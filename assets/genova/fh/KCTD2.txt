# KCTD2

## Overview
KCTD2 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 2, which is a member of the KCTD family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which facilitates its role as an adaptor in the Cullin3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The KCTD2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination, neuronal signaling, and cellular homeostasis. It plays a significant role in regulating the stability of proteins such as c-Myc, thereby influencing cell proliferation and metabolism. KCTD2 is ubiquitously expressed, with particularly high levels in the brain, suggesting its importance in neuronal function. Alterations in KCTD2 expression have been linked to several diseases, including glioma, Alzheimer's disease, and lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Boada2013ATP5HKCTD2; Shi2022Comprehensive; Kim2017KCTD2).

## Structure
KCTD2 is a protein characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which is a versatile protein-protein interaction motif. This domain is crucial for its role as an adaptor in the Cullin3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating interactions that are important for ubiquitination and protein degradation (Liu2013The; Kim2017KCTD2). The BTB domain in KCTD2 is involved in forming hetero-oligomeric complexes with other KCTD proteins, such as KCTD5, through interactions that are necessary for recruiting Cul3 (Liao2023KCTD5).

The BTB domain's structural versatility allows it to adopt multiple oligomeric states, including monomeric, tetrameric, and pentameric forms, which may relate to its functional roles (Balasco2019The). Although specific details about the molecular structure of KCTD2 are not provided, the general structural features of the KCTD family, including the presence of the BTB domain, suggest its involvement in protein interactions and oligomerization (Balasco2024A). The protein's structure and interactions are significant for its role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Liu2013The).

## Function
The KCTD2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) family, which plays a role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, KCTD2 is involved in DNA transcription, degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, and proteasome physiology. It is also associated with the function of voltage-dependent potassium channels and the composition of GABA neurotransmitter receptor B heteromultimers, indicating its role in neuronal excitability and signaling (Boada2013ATP5HKCTD2).

KCTD2 acts as an adaptor for the Cullin3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the degradation of proteins such as c-Myc, which is crucial for regulating cell proliferation and metabolism. This interaction helps maintain normal c-Myc levels, thereby preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation and maintaining metabolic balance (Kim2017KCTD2). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with Cullin3 and other proteins to regulate cellular signaling and homeostasis (Kim2017KCTD2).

KCTD2 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, suggesting its significant role in neuronal function and potentially in maintaining cellular energy balance and neuronal stability under stress conditions (Boada2013ATP5HKCTD2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the KCTD2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In gliomagenesis, KCTD2 acts as an adaptor for the Cullin3 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is crucial for the degradation of the c-Myc protein. Reduced expression of KCTD2 in glioma cells leads to increased c-Myc protein levels, enhancing glycolysis and promoting the malignant transformation of glioma cells. Clinically, lower KCTD2 mRNA levels are observed in aggressive glioma subtypes, correlating with poor survival outcomes (Kim2017KCTD2).

KCTD2 is also associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The ATP5H/KCTD2 locus has been identified as a potential marker for AD, with the rs11870474 SNP within KCTD2 linked to increased AD susceptibility. This association suggests a role for KCTD2 in neuronal physiological processes, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Boada2013ATP5HKCTD2).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), KCTD2 expression is higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with immune infiltration levels. Alterations in KCTD2 expression are linked to various clinicopathological characteristics, including tumor stage and TP53 mutation status, and may serve as a prognostic marker in LUAD (Shi2022Comprehensive).

## Interactions
KCTD2 is known to interact with the Cullin3 (Cul3) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, functioning as an adaptor protein that facilitates the degradation of c-Myc through polyubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for regulating c-Myc protein stability and is confirmed through various assays, including yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence (Kim2017KCTD2). KCTD2's interaction with Cul3 is a common feature among KCTD proteins, which are characterized by their BTB domain that mediates these interactions (Balasco2024A).

KCTD2 also forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with KCTD5, another member of the KCTD protein family. This interaction is facilitated by the BTB domain of KCTD5, which is necessary and sufficient for complex formation with KCTD2. The interaction between KCTD2 and KCTD5 is significant for the recruitment of Cul3, highlighting the functional importance of these protein complexes (Liao2023KCTD5). These interactions suggest that KCTD2 plays a role in cellular signaling pathways and may have implications in tumorigenesis, particularly in the context of glioma, where it acts as a tumor suppressor by destabilizing c-Myc (Kim2017KCTD2).
