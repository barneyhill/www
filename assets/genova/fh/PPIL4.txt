# PPIL4

## Overview
PPIL4, or peptidylprolyl isomerase like 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cyclophilin family, which is characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. The protein encoded by PPIL4 is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to RNA metabolism and protein interactions. It features several conserved domains, including a PPIase motif and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which suggest its involvement in protein folding and RNA processing (Zeng2001Molecular; Thapar2015Roles). PPIL4 is known to act as a stimulatory cofactor for the helicase DHX40, enhancing its ATPase activity in the presence of RNA, thereby playing a role in RNA metabolism and genome stability (Thapar2015Roles). Additionally, PPIL4 is a component of the spliceosome, implicating it in RNA splicing and transcriptional regulation (Thapar2015Roles). Despite its structural divergence from classical cyclophilins, PPIL4's conserved domains underscore its significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through RNA-mediated processes (Davis2010Structural).

## Structure
The PPIL4 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the cyclophilin family, characterized by a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) motif. The protein has a predicted molecular mass of approximately 57.2 kDa and consists of 492 amino acids (Zeng2001Molecular). It includes several conserved domains: a PPIase motif, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), a pair of bipartite nuclear targeting sequences (NLS_BP), and a lysine-rich domain (LYS_RICH) (Zeng2001Molecular). These domains suggest potential roles in nuclear functions, possibly related to transcription regulation (Zeng2001Molecular).

Structurally, PPIL4 is noted for its divergence in the active site compared to other cyclophilins, lacking the conserved Arg55 and substituting Trp121 with a non-histidine residue, which affects its isomerase activity (Davis2010Structural). Despite these differences, PPIL4 may still function as a proline-binding domain (Davis2010Structural). The protein also features structural variations in the b1-b2 loop region and a shorter a1-b3 loop, which may influence its substrate interactions and binding partners (Davis2010Structural). PPIL4 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its structure and function.

## Function
PPIL4 (peptidylprolyl isomerase like 4) is a cyclophilin family member involved in RNA metabolism and protein interactions within human cells. It contains a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) domain and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), suggesting roles in protein folding and RNA processing (Zeng2001Molecular; Thapar2015Roles). PPIL4 acts as a stimulatory cofactor for the helicase DHX40, enhancing its ATPase activity, particularly in the presence of RNA, which indicates a role in RNA metabolism and genome stability (1 page 23 of 34; 1 page 31 of 34). 

PPIL4 is also a component of the spliceosome, potentially influencing RNA splicing and transcriptional regulation (Thapar2015Roles). It interacts with L1 RNAs and has been implicated in regulating L1 retrotransposition, which may impact genome stability (1 page 32 of 34). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it may contribute to RNA processing and transcription regulation (Zeng2001Molecular). Despite its weak homology to classical cyclophilins, PPIL4's conserved domains suggest it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in RNA-mediated processes (Davis2010Structural).

## Interactions
PPIL4, a member of the cyclophilin family, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in RNA metabolism and genome stability. It acts as a stimulatory cofactor for the RNA helicase DHX40, enhancing its ATPase activity, particularly in the presence of RNA. This interaction suggests that PPIL4 may help recruit DHX40 to its RNA substrates, potentially influencing RNA processing and the regulation of transposable elements (1 page 31 of 34; 1 page 32 of 34).

PPIL4 also binds to L1 RNA sequences, indicating a role in the regulation of L1 retrotransposition. This binding is part of a broader network of interactions involving proteins like HNRNPM, XRCC5, and XRCC6, which are known to regulate L1 activity (1 page 32 of 34; 1 page 19 of 34). The interaction between PPIL4 and DHX40 is confirmed through immunoprecipitation and western blotting, showing that PPIL4 is specifically recovered with DHX40, suggesting a direct protein-protein interaction (1 page 22 of 34).

Structurally, PPIL4 contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain, which may facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins, contributing to its role in RNA splicing and genome stability (Zeng2001Molecular; Davis2010Structural).
