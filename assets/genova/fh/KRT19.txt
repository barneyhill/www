# KRT19

## Overview
KRT19 is a gene that encodes keratin 19, a type I intermediate filament protein, which is a crucial component of the cytoskeletal network in epithelial cells. Keratin 19 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular structure and integrity by providing mechanical support and stability to the plasma membrane (Alsharif2021Keratin; Arin2009The). It is involved in various cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and migration, which are essential for tissue repair and regeneration (Alsharif2021Keratin). The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it stabilizes cell-cell junctions and interacts with other proteins to regulate cell mechanics and signaling pathways. KRT19's expression and interactions have been implicated in several cancers, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the context, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Mi2022A; Saha2019Opposing).

## Structure


## Function
Keratin 19 (KRT19) is a type I intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It forms part of the cytoskeletal network, providing mechanical support and stability to the plasma membrane (Alsharif2021Keratin; Arin2009The). KRT19 is involved in several cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and migration, which are essential for tissue repair and regeneration (Alsharif2021Keratin).

In healthy human cells, KRT19 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain cell morphology and adhesion by stabilizing cell-cell junctions. It achieves this by ensuring the proper localization of E-cadherin at the cell surface, which is vital for cell-cell adhesion and the maintenance of epithelial cell integrity (Alsharif2021Keratin). The interaction between KRT19 and β-catenin is crucial for the stability of adherens junctions, which are important for maintaining cell architecture and preventing cell migration (Alsharif2021Keratin).

KRT19's role extends to the regulation of cell mechanics, which is critical for processes such as wound healing and tissue remodeling. Its expression is regulated by various factors, including retinoic acid, which can up-regulate KRT19 in different tissues, suggesting its involvement in differentiation and epithelial integrity (Ramot2009Endocrine).

## Clinical Significance
KRT19 (keratin 19) is significantly implicated in various cancers, including breast, colon, thyroid, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In breast cancer, KRT19 is overexpressed and associated with cancer invasiveness. Its knockdown in breast cancer cell lines leads to increased proliferation, migration, invasion, and drug resistance, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Saha2018Cytokeratin; Saha2016KRT19). KRT19 also interacts with signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and Notch, influencing cancer stem cell properties and drug sensitivity (Saha2019Opposing; Saha2018Cytokeratin).

In colon cancer, KRT19 expression is linked to poor prognosis, with its knockdown suppressing cancer properties by downregulating Wnt/Notch signaling (Saha2019Opposing). In thyroid cancer, KRT19 is upregulated and associated with aggressive clinical characteristics, including lymph node metastasis (Wang2019BRAFV600E‑induced). In hepatocellular carcinoma, KRT19 expression correlates with increased tumor size, decreased differentiation, and metastasis, serving as a marker for poor prognosis (Govaere2013Keratin).

KRT19's role in cancer is complex, as it can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the cancer type and context, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Mi2022A; Saha2019Opposing).

## Interactions
Keratin 19 (KRT19) is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence cellular processes. KRT19 interacts with the β-catenin/RAC1 complex, promoting the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which is crucial for the expression of NUMB, an inhibitor of the NOTCH signaling pathway. This interaction plays a role in modulating cancer stem cell properties and the invasiveness of breast cancer cells (Saha2016KRT19).

KRT19 also physically associates with HER2, particularly in HER2-overexpressing cells, where it stabilizes HER2 on the cell membrane. This interaction is dependent on Akt-mediated phosphorylation of KRT19 at serine 35, which is crucial for maintaining HER2 stability and preventing its ubiquitin-mediated degradation (Ju2014Cytokeratin19).

Additionally, KRT19 interacts with Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), regulating its nuclear accumulation and the degradation of cyclin D3. This interaction is essential for cell proliferation, as KRT19 prevents GSK3β from entering the nucleus and degrading cyclin D3, thereby influencing the sensitivity of cancer cells to CDK4/6 inhibitors (Sharma2021Keratin).

KRT19 also interacts with HNRNPK, promoting its cytoplasmic localization in triple-negative breast cancer cells, which may affect the regulatory activity of HNRNPK (Fallatah2023Keratin).
