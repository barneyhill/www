# CYP2D6

## Overview
CYP2D6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily D member 6, a critical component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily involved in the metabolism of a wide array of substances, including approximately 25% of clinically used drugs. This enzyme, categorized as a monooxygenase, is primarily expressed in the liver, gut, and brain, where it facilitates the oxidative metabolism of both exogenous and endogenous compounds (He2015Impact; Zanger2004Cytochrome). The CYP2D6 enzyme is characterized by its distinctive P450 fold, which includes a series of α-helices and β-sheets, and features a highly conserved active site crucial for substrate binding and catalysis (Wang2009New). Genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene lead to significant interindividual variability in drug metabolism, influencing drug efficacy and safety, and are associated with various clinical implications, including altered responses to medications and susceptibility to certain diseases (Teh2012Pharmacogenomics; Neafsey2009Genetic).

## Structure
The human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme exhibits a characteristic P450 fold, which includes a series of α-helices and β-sheets forming a compact, globular structure. The secondary structure is composed of helices A-L and four β-sheets, similar to other members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (Wang2009New). The active site of CYP2D6 is located above the heme group and is described as having a 'right foot' shape with a volume of approximately 540 Å³ (Wang2009New). Key residues such as Asp-301, Glu-216, Phe-120, and Phe-483 play crucial roles in substrate recognition and binding (Rowland2006Crystal).

The enzyme's tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions between the heme group and several residues, including Cys-443, which coordinates the heme iron (Rowland2006Crystal; Wang2009New). The quaternary structure of CYP2D6 is typically monomeric, as is common for cytochrome P450 enzymes. The enzyme also features a highly conserved C-terminal region important for binding with cytochrome P450 reductase, with Arg-440 being essential for this interaction (Rowland2006Crystal). The structure of CYP2D6 is crucial for its role in drug metabolism, with genetic polymorphisms affecting its function and leading to variations in drug metabolism among individuals (Rowland2006Crystal).

## Function
The CYP2D6 gene encodes the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of substances in the human body. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of approximately 25% of clinically used drugs, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and opioids (He2015Impact; Wang2009New). In healthy human cells, CYP2D6 is expressed in the liver, gut, and brain neurons, where it metabolizes both exogenous and endogenous substrates (Zanger2004Cytochrome).

CYP2D6 is responsible for converting codeine to morphine, which contributes to its analgesic effects, and for the metabolism of serotonin analogs and the conversion of 5-methoxytryptamine to serotonin (Siegle2001Cellular; He2015Impact). The enzyme also metabolizes endogenous compounds such as neurosteroids and the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (Miksys2013Cytochrome). Its activity is significant in the brain, where it is found in large principal neurons like pyramidal cells of the cortex and hippocampus, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (Siegle2001Cellular; He2015Impact). The enzyme's polymorphic nature leads to variations in drug metabolism among individuals, affecting drug efficacy and safety (Wang2009New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene can significantly impact drug metabolism, leading to various clinical implications. CYP2D6 polymorphisms result in different metabolizer phenotypes, such as poor metabolizers (PMs) and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs), which affect drug efficacy and safety. In psychiatric treatment, PMs may experience higher rates of adverse drug reactions, while UMs may show nonresponsiveness to antidepressants (Teh2012Pharmacogenomics). In cardiovascular disorders, CYP2D6 polymorphisms can influence the metabolism of drugs like metoprolol, potentially leading to increased drug concentrations and adverse effects (Teh2012Pharmacogenomics).

CYP2D6 polymorphisms are also associated with cancer risks. For instance, certain genotypes have been linked to susceptibility to bladder, prostate, and breast cancers, although the biological mechanisms are not fully understood (Neafsey2009Genetic). In breast cancer treatment, CYP2D6 polymorphisms can affect the metabolism of tamoxifen, with some studies indicating that CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the risk of cancer recurrence (Higgins2010CYP2D6).

In liver diseases, autoimmune hepatitis type 2 is associated with autoantibodies against CYP2D6, leading to decreased enzyme activity and affecting drug metabolism (He2015Impact). Additionally, cytokines and inflammation from infections or diseases can down-regulate CYP2D6 expression, impacting drug metabolism (He2015Impact).

## Interactions
CYP2D6 is known for its interactions with other cytochrome P450 enzymes, forming both homooligomers and heterooligomers. It has a high propensity to form oligomers in the microsomal membrane, particularly with CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. These interactions can significantly alter the catalytic properties of the enzymes involved. For instance, the presence of CYP2D6-specific substrates can activate CYP2D6 through a substrate-induced reorganization of CYP2E1-CYP2D6 heterooligomers, affecting the stoichiometry of substrate oxidation and reducing electron leakage through peroxide-generating pathways (Davydov2017Toward).

CYP2D6 also interacts with CYP2C9, where it can inhibit CYP2C9-mediated metabolism by increasing the dissociation constants for substrate binding, suggesting a rearrangement that obstructs the distal face of CYP2C9 (Reed2016The; Reed2017Physical). These interactions are stable and can influence drug metabolism significantly (Reed2017Physical).

The interactions between CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 are particularly significant, as they can modulate the production of reactive oxygen species and affect the efficiency of the microsomal monooxygenase system (Davydov2017Toward). These findings underscore the complex interplay between CYP2D6 and other P450 enzymes in drug metabolism.
