# PARP11

## Overview
PARP11 is a gene that encodes the protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 11, which is part of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family. This protein is categorized as a mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase, primarily involved in the post-translational modification process known as mono-ADP-ribosylation. PARP11 plays a crucial role in regulating protein-protein interactions and cellular stress responses, contributing to various cellular processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and cell cycle regulation (Schuhwerk2017PARPing). It is localized to the nuclear envelope and is involved in nuclear envelope stability and remodeling, particularly during spermiogenesis, indicating its importance in male fertility (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid). Additionally, PARP11 is implicated in immune signaling, acting as a regulator of the interferon response upon viral entry, which underscores its potential involvement in host defense mechanisms (Sanderson2020Mechanisms).

## Structure
PARP11 is a member of the PARP protein family and is characterized by two distinct domains: the N-terminal WWE domain and the C-terminal catalytic PARP domain. The WWE domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is capable of binding to a terminal ADP-ribose unit, which is crucial for its function in ADP-ribosylation processes (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid; Suskiewicz2023Updated). The WWE domain in PARP11 shows a preference for the terminal ADP-ribose unit and is similar to the beta-grasp fold of ubiquitin (Suskiewicz2023Updated). Specific amino acids within the WWE domain, such as Y77, Q86, and R95, are essential for its interaction with ADP-ribose, and mutations in these residues can disrupt its localization to the nuclear envelope (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid).

The PARP domain contains the enzyme activity necessary for posttranslational modification of target proteins, although PARP11 functions primarily as a mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase and does not exhibit poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity under certain experimental conditions (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid). The presence of both the WWE and PARP domains is necessary for the proper subcellular localization of PARP11, particularly at the nuclear envelope, where it colocalizes with nuclear pore components like NUP153 (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid). The enzymatic activity of PARP11 is not required for its localization, indicating that structural features rather than catalytic function are critical for its positioning within the cell (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid).

## Function
PARP11, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family, is involved in mono-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification process. This protein plays a significant role in regulating protein-protein interactions and cellular stress responses. In healthy human cells, PARP11 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing various cellular processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and cell cycle regulation, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Schuhwerk2017PARPing).

PARP11 localizes to the nuclear envelope and is involved in nuclear envelope stability and nuclear remodeling, particularly during spermiogenesis in mice, which suggests a similar role in human cells (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid). It colocalizes with nuclear pore components, such as NUP153, indicating its involvement in nuclear envelope functions (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid). During mitosis, PARP11 localizes to the spindle poles, suggesting a role in cell division and the organization or function of the mitotic spindle (Vyas2013A).

PARP11 is also implicated in immune signaling, acting as a regulator of the interferon response upon viral entry, which highlights its potential involvement in host defense mechanisms (Sanderson2020Mechanisms). This multifaceted role underscores the importance of PARP11 in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
PARP11 plays a significant role in male fertility, particularly in the context of spermatid head elongation and nuclear shaping. In mice, deletion of the Parp11 gene results in nuclear envelope defects during spermatid elongation, leading to teratozoospermia and impaired male fertility. These defects include abnormal nuclear envelope invaginations and chromatin detachment, which result in malformed sperm that are fertilization-incompetent (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid). Despite normal testis weights and sperm counts, Parp11 knockout mice exhibit significant fertility issues due to these structural defects (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid).

PARP11 is also implicated in antiviral defense, particularly against the Zika virus (ZIKV). It acts as an interferon-stimulated gene that suppresses ZIKV replication by promoting the degradation of viral proteins NS1 and NS3, in cooperation with PARP12. This antiviral function is largely independent of its enzymatic activity, suggesting a complex role in the host's immune response (Li2021ADPribosyltransferase). Alterations in PARP11 expression or function could potentially influence susceptibility to viral infections, although specific diseases resulting from such alterations are not detailed (Li2021ADPribosyltransferase).

## Interactions
PARP11 is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its functional roles in cellular processes. It interacts with PARP12 to suppress Zika virus (ZIKV) replication. This interaction enhances the degradation of ZIKV nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS3, which are crucial for viral replication. The interaction between PARP11 and PARP12 is mediated through their WWE domains, forming a complex that promotes the degradation of viral proteins, thereby contributing to the antiviral response (Li2021ADPribosyltransferase).

PARP11 also localizes to the nuclear envelope and interacts with nuclear pore components such as NUP153. This interaction is mediated by the WWE domain and the catalytic domain of PARP11, although its enzymatic activity is not required for this colocalization. Specific amino acids within the WWE domain are essential for binding ADP-ribose, which is crucial for its localization to the nuclear envelope (MeyerFicca2015Spermatid).

In the context of pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection, PARP11 has been shown to interact with host cellular pathways, influencing mRNA export and autophagy, which affects viral replication (Qi2024Identification).
