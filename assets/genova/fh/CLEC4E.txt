# CLEC4E

## Overview
CLEC4E is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain family 4 member E, commonly referred to as Mincle. Mincle is a C-type lectin receptor that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by functioning as a pattern recognition receptor. It is primarily expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells, where it is involved in the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). As a type II transmembrane protein, Mincle is characterized by a single extracellular carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that facilitates the binding of specific glycolipids, such as trehalose dimycolate, through calcium-dependent interactions. This binding triggers downstream signaling pathways that lead to the activation of immune responses, including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The gene and its encoded protein are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune surveillance, inflammation, and susceptibility to diseases such as tuberculosis and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (Drouin2020CType; Veltman2021Clec4eReceptor; Richardson2014MCL).

## Structure
The CLEC4E gene encodes the Mincle protein, a C-type lectin receptor involved in immune responses. Mincle is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a single extracellular carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that is crucial for its function as a pattern recognition receptor. The CRD is responsible for binding specific glycolipids, such as trehalose dimycolate (TDM) and glycerol monomycolate (GroMM), through interactions facilitated by calcium ions (Richardson2014MCL). The CRD has a globular fold with two alpha helices surrounding a beta-strand core, and it contains two calcium ions essential for carbohydrate binding (Richardson2014MCL).

The transmembrane region of Mincle includes a positively charged arginine residue that interacts with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor molecule Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ), which is critical for signaling (Richardson2014MCL). Structural studies have shown that Mincle binds trehalose through a specific interaction with calcium ions, and a hydrophobic channel near the binding site may accommodate lipid components of ligands (Richardson2014MCL). The protein's tertiary structure is conserved across species, with human and bovine Mincle having largely identical CRD structures (Holder2023Characterisation).

## Function
CLEC4E, also known as Mincle, is a C-type lectin receptor primarily expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. It plays a significant role in the immune response by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dead cells. This recognition triggers the recruitment of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and the activation of signaling pathways such as NF-κB, MAPK, AP-1, and NFAT, leading to the transcription of inflammatory genes (Drouin2020CType). 

CLEC4E is involved in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-2, and CXCL1, which are crucial for mediating inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance (Drouin2020CType). It also plays a role in the induction of autophagy, a process that targets antigens for lysosomal degradation, enhancing cell survival and inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses (Pahari2019Induction). 

In healthy human cells, CLEC4E contributes to immune surveillance and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by modulating inflammatory responses and facilitating the clearance of pathogens and dead cells (Drouin2020CType). Its activity is crucial for the proper functioning of the innate immune system and the prevention of excessive inflammation.

## Clinical Significance
CLEC4E, also known as Mincle, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in modulating immune responses. Alterations in CLEC4E expression or function can significantly impact the pathophysiology of several conditions. In myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, CLEC4E is upregulated and associated with increased cardiac injury and inflammation. Its deletion in murine models results in reduced neutrophil migration and improved cardiac outcomes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for myocardial infarction (Veltman2021Clec4eReceptor).

In the context of tuberculosis (TB), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CLEC4E gene have been linked to susceptibility to the disease. For instance, the rs10841856 SNP is associated with increased TB risk, particularly in males, indicating a potential genetic predisposition influenced by CLEC4E variants (Zhou2021A). Conversely, other SNPs like rs10841845 and rs10841847 have been associated with a protective effect against pulmonary tuberculosis in certain populations (Kabuye2019Association).

CLEC4E is also suggested to play a role in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease, where its involvement in immune responses and inflammation has been noted, although direct links remain to be fully established (te2017The).

## Interactions
CLEC4E, also known as Mincle, is a C-type lectin receptor that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its role in the immune response. It forms heterodimers with Macrophage C-type Lectin (MCL, CLEC4D), creating a functional complex on the cell surface that is involved in recognizing sugar moieties and long fatty acids (Del2019Sensing; Richardson2014MCL). CLEC4E interacts with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor molecule Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ). This interaction is facilitated by a positively charged arginine in the transmembrane region of CLEC4E, which is critical for its signaling capability. Upon ligand binding, CLEC4E leads to the phosphorylation of the ITAM of FcRγ, recruiting spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and activating nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) through Card9-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosomes (Richardson2014MCL; Pahari2019Induction).

CLEC4E also interacts with Spliceosome-Associated Protein 130 (SAP130), a component of the U2 Small Nuclear RibonucleoProtein (snRNP) complex, which it recognizes as an endogenous ligand. This interaction induces the production of proinflammatory mediators such as TNF and CXCL2/MIP-2a (Del2019Sensing). Additionally, CLEC4E is involved in the TLR2/CLEC4E signaling pathway, which is important for pathogen sensing, particularly against Candida albicans (Kulkarni2023FAM21).
