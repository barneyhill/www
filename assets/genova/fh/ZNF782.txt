# ZNF782

## Overview
ZNF782 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 782, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are integral to the protein's function as a transcription factor, facilitating DNA binding and playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Zinc finger protein 782 is predominantly active in the cell nucleus, where it participates in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation. While the specific functions of ZNF782 in human biology are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes. In cattle, ZNF782 has been associated with the regulation of fatty acid composition, suggesting potential metabolic roles across species (Sun2020Gene; Chauhan2017Initial). The protein's involvement in pathways such as the MAPK signaling pathway further underscores its significance in cellular signaling and regulatory mechanisms (Yan2011Identification).

## Structure
ZNF782 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding. These domains typically consist of conserved cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate zinc ions, stabilizing the protein's structure. The primary structure of ZNF782 is rich in these residues, which are essential for forming the zinc finger motifs (Hughes2008Genomewide).

The secondary structure of ZNF782 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, common in zinc finger proteins, facilitating the formation of the finger-like projections that interact with DNA. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a stable conformation, allowing the protein to perform its function effectively (Yan2011Identification).

Post-translational modifications of ZNF782 include phosphorylation, which can influence the protein's function and stability. Specifically, a phosphorylation site at serine 684 has been identified, indicating a role in regulatory processes (Yan2011Identification).

ZNF782 may also exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which could lead to diverse functional roles within the cell. These isoforms might differ in their zinc finger domains or other functional regions, potentially affecting their DNA-binding capabilities and regulatory functions (Sun2020Gene).

## Function
ZNF782, a member of the zinc finger protein family, is characterized by zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding, suggesting its role as a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression. This protein is typically active in the cell nucleus, where it participates in various cellular processes, including DNA transcription regulation (Chauhan2017Initial). Although the specific function of ZNF782 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, it is believed to contribute to maintaining normal cellular functions through its involvement in transcriptional regulation.

In cattle, ZNF782 has been identified as one of the key genes related to the regulation of fatty acid composition across different tissues, indicating its potential role in metabolic processes (Sun2020Gene). This suggests that ZNF782 may have similar regulatory functions in other organisms, including humans, although direct evidence in human cells is limited. The protein's involvement in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation implies that it may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal metabolic functions. However, further research is needed to elucidate its precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes in human biology (Bakker2022Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF782 has been studied in the context of several medical conditions, though its clinical significance remains unclear. In a study by Bakker et al., a rare variant of ZNF782, p.Arg321His, was identified in a family with intracranial aneurysms (IA). However, this variant did not show a statistically significant association with IA in a larger cohort of 937 patients, suggesting that its role in IA is uncertain (Bakker2022Genomewide). The study also noted that ZNF782 expression levels were low in both IA and control cerebral artery tissues, with no significant differential expression between aneurysm and control tissues (Bakker2022Genomewide).

In another study, ZNF782 was found to have a slight differential expression in individuals who had completed suicide compared to controls, with a log fold change of 0.12 and an adjusted p-value of 0.024. This suggests a potential involvement of ZNF782 in the genetic etiology of suicidal behavior and psychiatric disorders, although the exact implications are not fully understood (Rao2019Genomewide).

Research on pancreatic cancer has shown that ZNF782 is upregulated in response to gemcitabine treatment in sensitive models, indicating a possible role in the transcriptional response to chemotherapy (Konaté2024Insights).

## Interactions
ZNF782, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions, primarily functioning as a transcription factor. In the context of cattle, ZNF782 is part of a gene co-expression network that includes interactions with genes such as HSPG2, USP33, CDKAL1, and DAAM1. These interactions are significant in the regulation of fatty acid composition, with ZNF782 being regulated by the transcription factor NKX2-1, which plays a crucial role in adipogenesis (Sun2020Gene).

In human studies, ZNF782 has been identified as a transcription factor involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is influenced by genistein. This pathway is associated with processes like apoptosis, inflammation, and cell growth. ZNF782 is one of the transcription factors that are phospho-regulated by genistein, indicating its role in cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Yan2011Identification). Additionally, ZNF782 has a phosphorylation site at S684, suggesting its involvement in phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways (Yan2011Identification).

Despite these findings, specific protein interactions involving ZNF782, particularly in the context of blood vessel or aneurysm biology, remain unclear, as studies have not provided detailed information on its interactions beyond its role as a transcription factor (Bakker2022Genomewide).
