# MEPE

## Overview
The MEPE gene encodes the matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, a member of the SIBLING (Small Integrin-Binding Ligand, N-linked Glycoprotein) family, which plays a pivotal role in bone mineralization and phosphate metabolism. The protein is characterized as an intrinsically unstructured protein, with significant portions of its structure being disordered, allowing for versatile interactions with other molecules. MEPE is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, where it contributes to the regulation of bone matrix formation and mineralization processes. It contains key motifs such as the RGD cell attachment motif and the ASARM motif, which are crucial for its function in inhibiting mineralization and regulating phosphate homeostasis. MEPE's interactions with proteins like PHEX, DMP1, and FGF23 form a complex network essential for maintaining bone and renal mineral balance. Alterations in the MEPE gene are associated with various bone disorders, including hereditary congenital facial paresis and otosclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance in bone health and disease (Rowe2004MEPE; Argiro2001MEPE; Schrauwen2019Variants).

## Structure
The MEPE protein, encoded by the MEPE gene, is a member of the SIBLING family and is involved in bone mineralization and phosphate regulation. It consists of 525 amino acids in its primary structure and includes several key motifs and domains, such as the RGD cell attachment motif and the ASARM motif, which are crucial for its function (Machado2011Adaptive; Schrauwen2019Variants). The RGD motif is important for cell adhesion, while the ASARM motif, located at the C-terminus, plays a role in inhibiting mineralization by binding to hydroxyapatite crystals (Argiro2001MEPE; Machado2011Adaptive).

The MEPE protein is characterized as an 'intrinsically unstructured/natively disordered' protein, with a significant portion of its structure being disordered. In humans, 53.8% of MEPE is composed of amino acids associated with disorder/unstructured regions (Machado2011Adaptive). The tertiary structure of MEPE is similar to another extracellular matrix protein, anosmin-1, with a Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of 5.06 (Machado2011Adaptive).

Post-translational modifications of MEPE include phosphorylation and glycosylation, with several predicted phosphorylation sites and two N-glycosylation motifs (Machado2011Adaptive). The protein also contains a glycosaminoglycan attachment site, which may contribute to its functional properties (Argiro2001MEPE).

## Function
The MEPE gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in bone mineralization and phosphate metabolism. In healthy human cells, MEPE is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, where it contributes to the regulation of bone matrix formation and mineralization processes (Rowe2004MEPE; Argiro2001MEPE). MEPE contains an ASARM peptide motif, which is a potent inhibitor of mineralization. This peptide can sequester free calcium, thereby inhibiting mineralization at high doses (Rowe2004MEPE). The ASARM motif is resistant to a wide range of proteases, except for PHEX, which can cleave MEPE to release the ASARM peptide, influencing mineralization and energy metabolism (Rowe2012Regulation).

MEPE also interacts with other proteins and enzymes, such as cathepsin B, which can cleave MEPE to release the ASARM peptide, further modulating mineralization (Rowe2004MEPE). The protein's role in phosphate metabolism is highlighted by its involvement in conditions like oncogenic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia and X-linked hypophosphatemia, where it may act as a circulating factor responsible for renal phosphate wasting (Argiro2001MEPE). MEPE's regulation of mineralization and phosphate metabolism is crucial for maintaining normal bone and dental health (Rowe2012Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MEPE gene are associated with several bone disorders. Variants in MEPE, particularly frameshift and nonsense mutations, have been linked to hereditary congenital facial paresis (HCFP) and otosclerosis. In HCFP, a specific frameshift variant leads to a truncated MEPE protein, resulting in increased mineralization and osteogenesis (Schrauwen2019Variants). In otosclerosis, these variants cause increased bone turnover and mineralization, particularly affecting the otic capsule, due to the loss of crucial motifs like ASARM and RGD, which are essential for bone homeostasis (Schrauwen2019Variants).

Alterations in MEPE expression are also implicated in conditions like X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (HYP) and tumor-induced osteomalacia. In HYP, MEPE is up-regulated due to mutations in the PHEX gene, leading to defective bone calcification and renal phosphate wasting (Rowe2004MEPE). MEPE's role in these conditions is linked to its ability to inhibit mineralization and phosphate uptake, with its ASARM motif playing a significant role in these processes (Rowe2012Regulation; Guo2002Inhibition). These findings suggest that MEPE and its interactions are crucial for understanding and potentially treating various bone-mineralization disorders.

## Interactions
MEPE (matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in bone and mineral metabolism. One of its primary interactions is with PHEX (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome), a zinc metalloendopeptidase. This interaction is crucial for regulating mineralization and phosphate homeostasis. PHEX binds to MEPE and its associated ASARM peptide, inhibiting the cleavage of MEPE by cathepsin B-like enzymes, which prevents the release of the ASARM peptide, a potent inhibitor of mineralization (Rowe2012Regulation; Guo2002Inhibition).

MEPE also interacts with dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1), another member of the SIBLING protein family. Mutations in DMP1 can lead to autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets, highlighting the importance of MEPE-DMP1 interactions in phosphate regulation and bone mineralization (Rowe2012Regulation).

Additionally, MEPE has been shown to interact with fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which is involved in phosphate homeostasis. The ASARM peptide derived from MEPE influences the expression of FGF23, further impacting mineral and energy metabolism (Rowe2012Regulation). These interactions form a complex network that is essential for maintaining bone and renal mineral balance.
