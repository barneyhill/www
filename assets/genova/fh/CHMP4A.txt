# CHMP4A

## Overview
CHMP4A is a gene that encodes the protein charged multivesicular body protein 4A, which is a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-III) complex. This protein plays a significant role in cellular processes involving membrane remodeling and fission, such as the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo proteins for lysosomal degradation. CHMP4A is particularly important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating signaling pathways. It interacts with the ALIX protein, facilitating processes like cytokinesis and viral budding, and can form heteropolymers with other CHMP proteins, such as CHMP4B and CHMP4C, to enhance its functional versatility within the ESCRT-III complex (McCullough2008ALIXCHMP4; Baeumers2022Using). The protein's interactions and functions underscore its potential involvement in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, making it a subject of interest for therapeutic research.

## Function
CHMP4A is a component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is essential for various cellular processes involving membrane remodeling and fission. In healthy human cells, CHMP4A plays a critical role in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are involved in sorting ubiquitinated cargo proteins for degradation in lysosomes. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating signaling pathways (McCullough2008ALIXCHMP4).

CHMP4A interacts specifically with the Bro1 domain of the ALIX protein, a key player in the ESCRT pathway. This interaction is vital for processes such as cytokinesis and HIV-1 budding, as it facilitates the recruitment of other proteins to the membrane, enabling membrane scission events (McCullough2008ALIXCHMP4). The specificity of CHMP4A's interaction with ALIX is determined by the distinct hydrophobic residues in its C-terminal amphipathic helices, which are conserved across metazoan CHMP4 proteins (McCullough2008ALIXCHMP4).

In the context of Drosophila melanogaster, CHMP4A can cooperate with CHMP4B to enhance the rescue of shrub mutants, suggesting a potential for forming heteropolymers that contribute to the ESCRT-III function (Baeumers2022Using). This cooperative interaction highlights the versatility and adaptability of CHMP4A within the ESCRT-III complex.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation in the CHMP4A gene have been implicated in several diseases due to its critical role in cellular processes such as endosomal sorting and membrane remodeling. Alterations in CHMP4A expression can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, where the disruption of cellular homeostasis and autophagy may lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles, exacerbating neuronal damage. In cancer, CHMP4A dysregulation may affect tumor progression and metastasis by altering cytokinesis and cell division, potentially leading to aneuploidy and genomic instability. The gene's involvement in immune responses suggests that its altered expression could impact the body's ability to respond to infections, possibly influencing the severity and progression of viral infections. These associations highlight the importance of CHMP4A in maintaining cellular integrity and its potential as a therapeutic target in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CHMP4A interacts with the ALIX protein through its C-terminal amphipathic helices, specifically binding to the Bro1 domain of ALIX. This interaction is mediated by hydrophobic residues, including invariant C-terminal leucine and tryptophan, and a variable hydrophobic position that can be methionine, leucine, isoleucine, or phenylalanine. The interaction is crucial for processes such as HIV-1 budding and cytokinesis, as mutations in ALIX that disrupt CHMP4 binding also affect these processes (McCullough2008ALIXCHMP4).

CHMP4A is part of the ESCRT-III complex and interacts with other CHMP proteins, such as CHMP4B and CHMP4C, forming heteropolymers that are essential for membrane remodeling and fission. In Drosophila melanogaster, CHMP4A can cooperate with CHMP4B to rescue shrub mutants, indicating a functional interaction (Baeumers2022Using).

CHMP4A also interacts with VPS4A, a protein involved in disassembling the ESCRT-III complex, and with CC2D1A, which may be involved in signal transduction cascades (Tsang2006A). Additionally, CHMP4A has been associated with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), suggesting a role in regulating hypoxia in mammalian cells (Shi2010Highthroughput).
