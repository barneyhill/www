# PRR22

## Overview
The PRR22 gene encodes the proline-rich 22 protein, which is characterized by its abundance of proline residues. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. Proline-rich proteins often play roles in signaling pathways and structural functions within the cell, suggesting that proline-rich 22 may have similar roles. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their contributions to cellular physiology and potential implications in human health and disease.
