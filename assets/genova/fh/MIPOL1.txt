# MIPOL1

## Overview
MIPOL1, or mirror-image polydactyly 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The MIPOL1 protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are similar to the caspase recruitment domain, indicating its potential role in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement). Predominantly localized in the nucleus, the protein is implicated in nuclear processes and is expressed in multiple tissues, including the kidney, liver, and heart (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement; Cheung2009Chromosome). Functionally, MIPOL1 is recognized as a candidate tumor suppressor gene, particularly in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where it interacts with the tumor suppressor RhoB to regulate cell proliferation and metastasis (Leong2019Functional). Additionally, chromosomal translocations involving MIPOL1 are associated with congenital anomalies such as mirror-image polydactyly, highlighting its significance in developmental biology (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement).

## Structure
The MIPOL1 gene encodes a protein consisting of 442 amino acids, which includes two coiled-coil domains located in the C terminus. One of these domains is highly similar to the caspase recruitment domain, suggesting a potential role in protein-protein interactions (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement). The primary structure of the MIPOL1 protein is defined by its amino acid sequence, which is crucial for its function and interaction with other cellular components. 

The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with coiled-coil domains, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure, which refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, is not detailed in the available sources. Similarly, information on the quaternary structure, which would describe the assembly of multiple protein subunits, is not available.

The MIPOL1 gene has three alternative transcripts of 7, 3, and 2 kb sizes, indicating the presence of splice variant isoforms that may result in different protein products with potentially distinct functions (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement). The protein predominantly localizes in the nucleus, with minimal presence in the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in nuclear processes (Cheung2009Chromosome).

## Function
The MIPOL1 gene encodes a protein involved in several cellular and developmental processes. In healthy human cells, MIPOL1 is expressed in various tissues, including the adult kidney, skeletal muscles, liver, heart, pancreas, and fetal kidney (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement). The protein contains coiled-coil domains in its C-terminal region, which are important for its functional interactions (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement). These domains are similar to the caspase recruitment domain, suggesting a role in cellular signaling pathways that may influence cell growth and differentiation (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement).

MIPOL1 is also implicated in maintaining the integrity of these functional domains, which may be crucial for its role in cellular processes (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement). The gene's expression during mouse embryonic development indicates its involvement in developmental processes, particularly during critical stages of organogenesis (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement).

In the context of cancer biology, MIPOL1 has been identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene. It interacts with RhoB, a known tumor suppressor, to regulate cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis (Leong2019Functional). This interaction highlights its potential role in inhibiting cancer progression by modulating key signaling pathways (Leong2019Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MIPOL1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. MIPOL1 is implicated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) as a candidate tumor suppressor gene. In NPC, MIPOL1 is often downregulated, and its re-expression has been shown to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. This tumor suppressive role is linked to its interaction with the tumor suppressor RhoB, which is crucial for limiting cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis (Leong2019Functional).

MIPOL1 is also associated with congenital anomalies, particularly mirror-image polydactyly, a condition characterized by the duplication of digits. Chromosomal translocations involving MIPOL1, such as t(4;14)(q25;q13), have been observed in patients with developmental anomalies, including craniofacial defects and agenesis of the corpus callosum (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement). These translocations can disrupt the gene, potentially leading to the observed phenotypic abnormalities (Kamnasaran2003Rearrangement).

In addition to its role in NPC and congenital anomalies, MIPOL1 deletions have been observed in other cancers, such as prostate and lung cancer, suggesting a broader role in tumor suppression (Leong2019Functional).

## Interactions
The MIPOL1 gene encodes a protein that interacts with the tumor suppressor RhoB, enhancing its cellular activity. This interaction has been validated through yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating that MIPOL1 plays a significant role in regulating RhoB activity. The interaction is crucial for MIPOL1's function as a tumor suppressor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, as it increases activated RhoB levels, which are essential for suppressing angiogenesis and reducing phosphorylation levels of certain proteins involved in cancer progression (Leong2019Functional).

The intact MIPOL1 protein is necessary for these interactions, as truncated forms of the protein do not enhance RhoB activity or exhibit tumor suppressive effects. Functional assays have shown that re-expression of wild-type MIPOL1 suppresses clonogenic survival, migration, and invasion abilities of tumor cells in vitro. In vivo studies further support these findings, showing that MIPOL1 inhibits metastasis and tumor growth, with significant reductions in liver metastasis and tumor size compared to controls (Leong2019Functional). These interactions highlight the importance of MIPOL1 in modulating cellular pathways that are critical for tumor suppression.
