# PNMA8C

## Overview
PNMA8C is a gene that encodes the protein PNMA family member 8C, which is part of the paraneoplastic Ma (PNMA) family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in cellular processes related to the immune response and have been implicated in various neurological and oncological conditions. The PNMA8C protein is characterized by its role in intracellular signaling pathways, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain under investigation. Research into PNMA8C and its protein product is ongoing, with studies focusing on its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis and its utility as a biomarker for certain conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
