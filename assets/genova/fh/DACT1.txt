# DACT1

## Overview
DACT1, or Dapper Antagonist of Catenin-1, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways, particularly the Wnt signaling pathway. The protein encoded by DACT1, known as dishevelled binding antagonist of beta catenin 1, plays a crucial role in both beta-catenin-dependent and beta-catenin-independent Wnt signaling, which are essential for various developmental processes and cellular functions (Contriciani2021Dact1). As a scaffold protein, DACT1 interacts with multiple proteins, including Dishevelled (Dvl), Vangl, and serine/threonine kinases, to modulate signaling pathways that influence cellular processes such as neural development, planar cell polarity, and morphogenetic movements (Contriciani2021Dact1; Kivimäe2011All). The protein's structure is characterized by a conserved leucine zipper motif and intrinsically disordered regions, which are essential for its function in protein interactions and signaling regulation (Esposito2021TGFβinduced; Kivimäe2011All). DACT1's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including muscular dystrophies, congenital anomalies, and cancer (Christians2022Heterozygous; Contriciani2021Dact1; Esposito2021TGFβinduced).

## Structure
DACT1 is a protein involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly the Wnt signaling pathway. It is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function. The primary structure of DACT1 includes a conserved leucine zipper motif near the N-terminus, which is crucial for protein dimerization and interaction with other proteins (Kivimäe2011All). This motif facilitates both homo- and heterodimerization with other Dact proteins (Kivimäe2011All). 

DACT1 also contains intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that are essential for its ability to form biomolecular condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation. These IDRs are critical for the protein's function in repressing Wnt signaling (Esposito2021TGFβinduced). The coiled-coil domain is important for DACT1 expression, as its deletion results in a loss of expression (Esposito2021TGFβinduced).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating DACT1's function. Phosphorylation affects the protein's mobility on SDS-PAGE, indicating its impact on the protein's structure and function (Kivimäe2011All). DACT1 interacts with various proteins, including Vangl, Dvl, and serine/threonine kinases, which are important for its role in signaling pathways (Kivimäe2011All).

## Function
The DACT1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental processes and cellular functions. In healthy human cells, DACT1 is widely expressed across many organ systems, with strong cytoplasmic expression in central nervous system tissues and moderate expression in the rectum, appendix, most endocrine glands, urinary bladder, seminal vesicle, and most myocytes (Webb2017Heterozygous). The DACT1 protein contains seven DAPPER homologous (DAPH) domains, which are involved in protein interactions, including a leucine zipper motif that participates in homodimerization and heterodimerization with Dact paralogs (Webb2017Heterozygous).

DACT1 functions in both beta-catenin-dependent and beta-catenin-independent Wnt-signaling pathways, which are essential for normal neural development and other cellular processes (Webb2017Heterozygous). It acts as a context-dependent regulator of the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway, capable of both inhibiting and activating it based on its phosphorylation status (Contriciani2021Dact1). DACT1 is also involved in the Wnt/PCP pathway, collaborating with Dvl2 and Sestd1 to manage the trafficking and posttranscriptional modifications of the Vangl2 protein, which is crucial for planar cell polarity (Contriciani2021Dact1). These pathways are vital for processes such as gastrulation, morphogenetic movements, somitogenesis, and heart formation (Contriciani2021Dact1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DACT1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In muscle diseases, DACT1 expression is upregulated in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2A (LGMD-2A), while it is downregulated in Acute Quadriplegic Myopathy (AQM). The upregulation in DMD may serve as a compensatory mechanism due to the lack of Dystrophin, as DACT1 shares structural similarities with Dystrophin and Utrophin (Contriciani2021Dact1).

DACT1 is also implicated in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and features of Townes-Brocks syndrome 2 (TBS2). Rare heterozygous variants in the DACT1 gene, particularly in the DVL2 interaction region, are linked to these conditions. These variants can lead to kidney malformations, anal atresia, and other developmental anomalies (Christians2022Heterozygous).

In cancer, DACT1 expression is elevated in bone metastatic cells, particularly in breast and prostate cancer, where it is critical for the progression of bone metastasis. DACT1 forms biomolecular condensates that suppress Wnt signaling, which is crucial for bone metastasis development (Esposito2021TGFβinduced).

## Interactions
DACT1, a scaffold protein, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in Wnt and Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathways. It forms complexes with Vangl, Dvl, and CK1δ/ε proteins across different species, as well as with PKA and PKC, facilitated by its conserved N-terminal leucine-zipper domains (Kivimäe2011All). DACT1 also interacts with the catenin superfamily member p120ctn, although this interaction is weaker (Kivimäe2011All). 

In the context of Wnt signaling, DACT1 binds to Dishevelled proteins and β-catenin, influencing β-catenin stability and localization. It interacts with axin and GSK-3β, components of the β-catenin regulation complex, preventing β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation (Yuan2012Oncogenic). DACT1 also forms biomolecular condensates that sequester Casein Kinase 2 (CK2), reducing its availability for Wnt signaling (Esposito2021TGFβinduced).

DACT1 interacts with Sestd1, forming a complex that regulates Vangl2 in the PCP pathway. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Vangl2's post-translational stability and trafficking during mammalian development (Yang2013SEC14). These interactions highlight DACT1's role in modulating signaling pathways and cellular processes.
