# OR2T10

## Overview
OR2T10 is a gene in humans that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 10, which is a part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a pivotal role in the olfactory system by detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of smell. The OR2T10 protein is specifically expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is involved in binding specific odorants, contributing to the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). This receptor is particularly responsive to ester-containing odorants, such as maltyl isobutyrate and terpinyl acetate, highlighting its role in the detection of specific scent profiles (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

## Function
OR2T10 is a human olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR2T10 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory perception (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

In a functional analysis, OR2T10 was found to respond to certain ester odorants, such as maltyl isobutyrate and terpinyl acetate. This suggests that OR2T10 may be preferentially responsive to odorants containing ester functional groups. Notably, terpinyl acetate, which has a herbal, citrus, and woody odor, was able to activate only OR2T10 among the tested receptors, indicating a specific role for OR2T10 in detecting these types of odorants (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

The receptor's activity is part of a combinatorial coding system in the olfactory system, where some receptors are narrowly tuned to a small number of odorants, while others can detect a broader range of odorants (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).
