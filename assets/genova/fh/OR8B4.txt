# OR8B4

## Overview
The OR8B4 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily B member 4, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in detecting and transducing chemical signals, specifically odorants, into cellular responses. The OR8B4 receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is involved in the perception of specific aromatic compounds, contributing to the diversity of olfactory signals processed by the brain (Su2009Olfactory; Jimenez2021The). Variations in the OR8B4 gene can influence olfactory function and have been studied in the context of various physiological and pathological conditions, although its precise clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated (Kajii2019Wholeexome; Kim2019Incorporating).

## Structure
The OR8B4 gene encodes an olfactory receptor that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs, facilitating the detection and transduction of odorant signals. The OR8B4 receptor has been identified to bind specific aromatic compounds such as anisic aldehyde and muguet alcohol (Jimenez2021The).

The primary structure of OR8B4 includes several non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), such as the rs4057749 (c.532 T>C, p.Cys178Arg) mutation, which may affect the perception of certain odors in a significant portion of the population (Jimenez2021The). Another variant, p.I215V, has been identified in the OR8B4 gene, located on chromosome 11q24.2 (Kajii2019Wholeexome).

The secondary and tertiary structures of OR8B4, like other GPCRs, are likely stabilized by conserved motifs and disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the receptor's conformation and function. The conserved motifs, such as the (N/S)LxxxD 2.50 motif, play a significant role in receptor activation through allosteric modulation (Jimenez2021The).

Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, are common in GPCRs and may also be present in OR8B4, contributing to its functional regulation and stability. However, specific details on these modifications for OR8B4 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
OR8B4 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR8B4 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory signals processed by the brain (Jimenez2021The).

The function of OR8B4 involves the binding of odorants through interactions that lead to the activation of G proteins. This activation triggers a cascade of intracellular events, including the activation of adenylyl cyclase and the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which ultimately results in the opening of ion channels and signal amplification (Su2009Olfactory). This process is crucial for the detection and discrimination of a wide range of odorants, allowing for the perception of complex smells.

Mutations in OR8B4 can affect its function by altering key motifs necessary for receptor activation, potentially impairing the ability to perceive certain aromatic substances (Jimenez2021The). The receptor's function is also modulated by ionic species, which are essential for its activation and the coordination of modulating ions (Jimenez2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The OR8B4 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in various studies, though its clinical significance remains largely unexplored. In a study focusing on breast cancer subtypes, OR8B4 was identified as part of a subnetwork of 13 linked genes within the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling pathway, specifically associated with the Her2 subtype of breast cancer. This suggests a potential role in cancer-related pathways, although the exact clinical implications are not fully understood (Kim2019Incorporating).

In another study, a non-synonymous single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in the OR8B4 gene was identified in individuals with mandibular prognathism, a facial deformity. This variant, located on chromosome 11q24.2, was found in affected individuals but not in unaffected ones. However, the study did not consider OR8B4 a plausible candidate for mandibular prognathism, indicating that its role in this condition may be limited or indirect (Kajii2019Wholeexome).

Additionally, OR8B4 was mentioned in the context of acquired radioresistance in breast cancer cells, being part of the G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway influenced by miR-122. The specific clinical significance of OR8B4 in this context remains unclear (Perez‐Añorve2019New).
