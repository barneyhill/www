# COA4

## Overview
COA4 is a gene that encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 4 homolog, a protein integral to the mitochondrial copper delivery pathway. This protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain responsible for cellular energy production. Although COA4 is not a copper metallochaperone itself, it is involved in the regulation of copper delivery to the CuB site of the Cox1 subunit of CcO, likely through its interaction with the copper metallochaperone Cox11. The evolutionary conservation of COA4 from yeast to humans underscores its critical function in maintaining cellular copper homeostasis and ensuring efficient mitochondrial respiration (Swaminathan2022A).

## Function
The human gene COA4 encodes a protein involved in the mitochondrial copper delivery pathway, which is crucial for the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), a key enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. COA4 is evolutionarily conserved between yeast and humans, indicating its essential role in cellular respiration and energy production. The protein is active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the proper assembly of CcO by facilitating the delivery of copper to the CuB site of the Cox1 subunit, a critical step for CcO function (Swaminathan2022A).

COA4 does not function as a copper metallochaperone itself, as it lacks the copper-binding cysteine motif found in other metallochaperones. Instead, it may regulate the activity of Cox11, a copper metallochaperone, to ensure the correct insertion of copper into CcO (Swaminathan2022A). In COA4-deficient cells, there is a reduction in mitochondrial copper levels, leading to decreased abundance and activity of CcO subunits, which impairs respiratory growth. This highlights COA4's role in maintaining cellular copper homeostasis and its importance in mitochondrial function (Swaminathan2022A).

## Interactions
The COA4 protein, also known as cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 4 homolog, is involved in the mitochondrial copper delivery pathway crucial for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). COA4 interacts with Cox11, a copper metallochaperone, in the copper delivery pathway to the Cox1 subunit of CcO. This interaction is genetic rather than direct, as COA4 does not physically bind to Cox11 but is part of the same pathway, suggesting a regulatory role in copper delivery (Swaminathan2022A). The abundance of COA4 and Cox11 proteins is reciprocally regulated, indicating a post-transcriptional mechanism that maintains their steady-state levels (Swaminathan2022A).

COA4 is not a copper metallochaperone itself, as it lacks the copper-binding cysteine motif found in other metallochaperones like Cox17. However, it may facilitate Cox1 metallation by influencing Cox11's copper delivery or binding (Swaminathan2022A). The deletion of COA4 results in reduced cellular copper levels, similar to phenotypes observed in human cells with mutations in CcO assembly factors, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular copper homeostasis (Swaminathan2022A).
