# ZSWIM2

## Overview
ZSWIM2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger SWIM-type containing 2 protein, which is part of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of a SWIM domain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, due to its zinc finger motif, which facilitates interactions with nucleic acids and other proteins. The precise biological functions of ZSWIM2 are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and may be implicated in certain signaling pathways. Understanding the function and interactions of the ZSWIM2 protein is crucial for elucidating its potential involvement in human diseases and developmental processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
