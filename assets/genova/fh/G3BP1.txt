# G3BP1

## Overview
G3BP1 (G3BP stress granule assembly factor 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in the cellular stress response and RNA metabolism. The protein, categorized as an RNA-binding protein, plays a pivotal role in the formation of stress granules, which are cytoplasmic aggregates of proteins and RNAs that form in response to cellular stress. G3BP1 contains several functional domains, including an N-terminal nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, a proline-rich motif, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), and a C-terminal arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) domain, which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins (Kang2021Research; He2021G3BP1). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, and it plays a significant role in antiviral responses by interacting with viral components and modulating the host's immune response (Jayabalan2023ProViral; Kim2019The). G3BP1's dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Mukhopadhyay2021G3BP1; Sanchez2021Huntington’s).

## Structure
G3BP1 is a multi-domain protein that plays a crucial role in stress granule assembly and RNA metabolism. It contains several distinct domains, including an N-terminal nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, an acidic residue-rich region, a proline-rich (PxxP) motif, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), and a C-terminal arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) domain (Kang2021Research; He2021G3BP1). The NTF2 domain is involved in nuclear transport and dimerization, which is essential for its function in cellular localization and viral replication (Mahajan2022Targeting). The PxxP motif is important for protein kinase activation and stress granule nucleation (Kang2021Research).

The RRM and RGG domains are critical for RNA binding, with the RGG domain being particularly important for binding to RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) (He2021G3BP1). The RGG domain enhances the binding capacity of G3BP1 to rG4 structures, which is further supported by the RRM domain (He2021G3BP1). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination regulate G3BP1's function and its role in stress granule dynamics (Jayabalan2023ProViral). G3BP1 can form homodimers or heterodimers with G3BP2, contributing to its quaternary structure and function in stress granule assembly (Kang2021Research).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the G3BP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, G3BP1 is overexpressed in several types, including pancreatic, breast, kidney, lung, and prostate cancers. Its overexpression is associated with cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. In pancreatic cancer, G3BP1 interacts with CD24 to promote metastasis, while in breast cancer, it stabilizes β-catenin through interaction with GSK-3β, enhancing cell proliferation (Kang2021Research). In prostate cancer, G3BP1 overexpression correlates with aggressive disease and lower metastasis-free survival, acting as a negative regulator of the SPOP ubiquitin ligase, which amplifies androgen receptor signaling and tumorigenesis (Mukhopadhyay2021G3BP1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, G3BP1 plays a protective role by inhibiting protein aggregation. Its depletion leads to increased aggregation of proteins like α-synuclein, associated with Parkinson's disease, and CFTR-ΔF508, linked to cystic fibrosis (Anisimov2019G3BP1). In Huntington's disease, increased G3BP1 granules in the cortex may exacerbate proteotoxicity or serve a protective function (Sanchez2021Huntington’s). These findings suggest that G3BP1 is a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
G3BP1 is an RNA-binding protein that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular stress responses and viral infections. It binds to viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the RIG-I helicase domain through its RGG domain, enhancing the interferon-β (IFN-β) response by preventing RIG-I degradation and promoting Ifn-b mRNA expression (Kim2019The). G3BP1 also interacts with cGAS, forming complexes that enhance interaction with viral DNA, which is essential for inducing IFN production (Jayabalan2023ProViral).

G3BP1 is a key component in stress granule (SG) assembly, acting as a scaffold that recruits other proteins into SGs. It forms a core protein-protein interaction network with G3BP2, binding translation factors, mRNA-binding proteins, and specific transcripts during stress conditions (Jayabalan2023ProViral). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as methylation by PRMT1 and PRMT5, which regulate SG assembly (Tsai2016Arginine).

During viral infections, G3BP1 interacts with viral components, such as the non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) of chikungunya virus, facilitating viral RNA translation and replication (Jayabalan2023ProViral). It also binds to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, affecting stress granule dynamics (Jayabalan2023ProViral).
