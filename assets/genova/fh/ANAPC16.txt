# ANAPC16

## Overview
ANAPC16 is a gene that encodes the protein anaphase-promoting complex subunit 16, which is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the transition from metaphase to anaphase during mitosis. ANAPC16 is categorized as part of the TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) arm of the APC/C, serving as a scaffolding element that stabilizes the complex and facilitates the binding of co-activators such as Cdc20 and Cdh1 (Zhou2016Insights). While the specific molecular functions of ANAPC16 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, its involvement in the APC/C complex is essential for proper chromosome segregation and mitotic exit (Melloy2019The). Additionally, alterations in the ANAPC16 gene have been linked to various cancer types, suggesting its potential role in oncogenesis and as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Melloy2019The).

## Function
ANAPC16 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. The APC/C complex is essential for the transition from metaphase to anaphase during cell division, facilitating the degradation of specific proteins to ensure proper chromosome segregation and mitotic exit. ANAPC16 is part of the TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) arm of the APC/C, which serves as a scaffolding component, stabilizing the complex and providing binding sites for co-activators such as Cdc20 and Cdh1 (Zhou2016Insights). This structural role is critical for the assembly and function of the APC/C complex, although the specific molecular activities of ANAPC16 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available literature (Melloy2019The).

The APC/C complex, including ANAPC16, is active in the nucleus during cell division, where it regulates various cellular processes beyond mitosis, such as differentiation, genome stability, and energy metabolism (Zhou2016Insights). Despite its importance in these processes, the precise function of ANAPC16 within the APC/C complex in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated (Melloy2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ANAPC16 gene, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), have been implicated in various cancer types. The APC/C is generally considered a complex of tumor suppressors, but changes in its subunits, including ANAPC16, may act as oncogenes in certain cancers (Melloy2019The). Specifically, low copy numbers of ANAPC16 are associated with poor prognosis in glioma (GBMLGG), indicating a potential role in patient survival and recurrence-free survival (Melloy2019The). 

The study of APC/C subunits, including ANAPC16, has shown that these alterations can have cancer subtype-specific impacts, with different prognoses depending on whether the gene copy number is increased or decreased (Melloy2019The). The kidney and glioma cancer subtypes have the most incidences of APC/C subunit copy number alterations affecting patient prognosis (Melloy2019The). 

Further research is needed to determine if ANAPC16 and other APC/C subunits can be used as biomarkers for patient survival or treatment responsiveness, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene in cancer prognosis and therapy (Melloy2019The).

## Interactions
ANAPC16 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a large E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involved in cell cycle regulation. ANAPC16 is part of the accessory sub-complex associated with the TPR lobe of the APC/C, which plays a scaffolding role in the complex (Melloy2019The). It is also mentioned as part of the TPR arm, which includes other subunits like APC3, APC6, APC7, and APC8, and is involved in stabilizing the complex and recruiting co-activators such as Cdc20 and Cdh1 (Zhou2016Insights).

The identification of ANAPC16 as a genuine member of the APC core complex was supported by quantitative proteomics studies, which used methods like SILAC and label-free pull-down to identify specific interaction partners. These studies demonstrated that ANAPC16 interacts with other core components of the APC, distinguishing it from adaptors like CDC20 and FZR1 by intensity in experiments (Hubner2010Quantitative). Despite its small size, which may have previously hindered detection, ANAPC16 was identified with significant ratios and high reproducibility, confirming its role within the APC core complex (Hubner2010Quantitative).
