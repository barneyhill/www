# ARL11

## Overview
ARL11, also known as ARLTS1, is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor-like GTPase 11, a member of the ARF-ARL family within the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. This protein functions as a molecular switch, cycling between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active states, and is primarily involved in intracellular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization (Li2023The; Siltanen2011Contribution). ARL11 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with significant expression in the lungs and leukocytes, suggesting a role in immune processes (Siltanen2011Contribution). It is implicated in regulating apoptosis and cell growth, acting as a tumor suppressor by maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Petrocca2006Alterations; Yendamuri2007Tumor). The protein's interactions with other cellular proteins, such as CRABP2 and PGAM1, further highlight its involvement in metabolic and retinoic acid pathways (Lee2012InFrame).

## Function
ARL11, also known as ARLTS1, is a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-ARF-like (ARL) family of the Ras protein superfamily, which are guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ARL11 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in intracellular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization (Li2023The). It functions as a molecular switch by cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound conformations, which is crucial for its role in vesicle trafficking pathways (Siltanen2011Contribution).

ARL11 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with notable expression in the lung and leukocytes, indicating its involvement in immune processes (Siltanen2011Contribution). The protein is also implicated in regulating apoptosis and cell growth, contributing to its function as a tumor suppressor (Petrocca2006Alterations). In normal cellular contexts, ARL11 helps maintain cellular homeostasis by influencing pathways related to vesicular transport and membrane trafficking, which are essential for proper cell function and survival (Yendamuri2007Tumor). Its activity in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ARL11 gene, also known as ARLTS1, have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, the ARLTS1 gene is located in a region frequently deleted in tumor tissues, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. The T442C variant of ARLTS1 is associated with increased prostate cancer risk, particularly in familial cases, and is more prevalent in malignant tissues (Siltanen2011Contribution; Siltanen2013ARLTS1). 

In breast cancer, higher expression levels of ARL11 are linked to worse recurrence-free and overall survival. The gene is involved in immunosuppressive processes, such as T cell differentiation and the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, which are critical in cancer progression (Xie2022ARL11). 

ARL11 is also associated with familial hematological malignancies, with specific variants like W149X and C148R linked to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and high-risk familial breast cancer (Hamadou2017ARLTS1; Petrocca2006Alterations). The Trp149Stop polymorphism is associated with familial cancer aggregation, particularly in breast cancer, and is down-regulated by promoter methylation in several cancers, including lung carcinomas and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Calin2005Familial; Petrocca2006Alterations).

## Interactions
ARL11, a member of the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins, has been shown to interact with several proteins, suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes. A study by Lee et al. identified cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2) and phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) as novel binding partners of ARL11. CRABP2 is a retinoic acid carrier protein that facilitates the transfer of retinoic acid from the cytosol to the nucleus, and the interaction with ARL11 suggests a potential role in this transfer process (Lee2012InFrame). PGAM1, involved in the glycolytic pathway, is another protein that interacts with ARL11, indicating a possible link to metabolic pathways in rapidly proliferating cells (Lee2012InFrame). These interactions were confirmed through co-transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating the specificity of ARL11's interactions with these proteins (Lee2012InFrame).

The study utilized an in-frame cDNA library to identify these interactions, emphasizing the importance of accurate cDNA constructs in revealing true protein-protein interactions. The removal of 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) from the cDNA library was crucial in preventing frame shifts and premature stop codons, which could lead to false identification of interactions (Lee2012InFrame).
