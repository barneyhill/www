# ARB2A

## Overview
The ARB2A gene encodes the ARB2 cotranscriptional regulator A protein, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional regulator, involved in modulating the transcriptional machinery to ensure precise gene expression patterns. ARB2 cotranscriptional regulator A is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcriptional initiation and elongation, thereby influencing cellular differentiation and development. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research due to their potential involvement in complex regulatory networks and their implications in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
