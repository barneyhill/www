# IL1RL1

## Overview
The IL1RL1 gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 protein, a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, which plays a pivotal role in immune and inflammatory responses. This protein, also known as ST2, is categorized as a receptor and exists in multiple isoforms, including a transmembrane form (ST2L) and a soluble form (sST2), due to alternative splicing. The transmembrane form is involved in signal transduction through its interaction with interleukin-33 (IL-33), leading to the activation of pathways such as NF-kB, which are crucial for Th2 immune responses (Boraschi2013The; Akhabir2010Genetics). The soluble form acts as a decoy receptor, modulating inflammatory processes by binding IL-33 and preventing its interaction with membrane-bound receptors (Akhabir2010Genetics). IL1RL1 is implicated in various immune-related conditions, including asthma and ulcerative colitis, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (DíazJiménez2017A; Dijk2019IL1RL1).

## Structure
The IL1RL1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the interleukin-1 receptor family, known for its role in immune and inflammatory responses. The IL1RL1 protein, also referred to as ST2, exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing: a long transmembrane form (ST2L), a soluble form (sST2), and a variant membrane-anchored form (vST2) (Boraschi2013The; Akhabir2010Genetics). 

The protein structure includes an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like folds, a single transmembrane helix, and an intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is crucial for signal transduction (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2022What). The soluble form of IL1RL1 corresponds to the extracellular domain of the transmembrane form, except for nine amino acids in the C-terminal region (Akhabir2010Genetics).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are important for the stability and function of IL1RL1 (Boraschi2022What). The protein's ability to bind interleukin-33 (IL-33) and its involvement in Th2 cell differentiation highlight its significance in immune responses, particularly in conditions like asthma (Akhabir2010Genetics).

## Function
The IL1RL1 gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 protein, which is a crucial component of the immune system. It is primarily known for its role as a receptor for interleukin-33 (IL-33), a cytokine involved in immune responses. Upon binding with IL-33, IL1RL1 activates signaling pathways, notably the NF-kB pathway, leading to the transcription of cytokines that are essential for a Th2 immune response. This process is significant in regulating immune responses, particularly in allergic inflammation and asthma (Portelli2020Phenotypic; Akhabir2010Genetics).

IL1RL1 exists in multiple isoforms, including a long membrane-bound form (ST2L) and a short soluble form (sST2). The membrane-bound isoform is primarily expressed on hematopoietic cells such as T-helper 2 cells, mast cells, and some epithelial cells, where it influences cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Akhabir2010Genetics). The soluble isoform acts as a decoy receptor, binding IL-33 and inhibiting its pro-inflammatory effects, thus serving as a negative regulator of inflammation (Akhabir2010Genetics). These functions highlight IL1RL1's role in maintaining immune homeostasis and its involvement in various inflammatory processes.

## Clinical Significance
The IL1RL1 gene, also known as ST2, is implicated in several immune and inflammatory disorders. Variations in this gene have been associated with conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC), asthma, and atopic dermatitis. In UC, the rs6543115(C) variant in the IL1RL1 promoter is linked to increased susceptibility and modulates glucocorticoid-induced soluble ST2 (sST2) expression, which is crucial for the inflammatory response in UC patients undergoing corticosteroid treatment (DíazJiménez2017A). 

In asthma, IL1RL1 polymorphisms, including rs10204137, are associated with asthma exacerbations and reduced efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in children and adolescents. These genetic variations affect IL1RL1 expression and IL-33 responsiveness, potentially modifying the asthma phenotype into a more severe form (Dijk2019IL1RL1). 

The IL1RL1 gene is also involved in the IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway, which plays a role in Th2 immune responses. Genetic variants in IL1RL1 influence sST2 concentrations, impacting immune and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Elevated sST2 levels are linked to increased cardiovascular risk and worse prognosis in heart failure and acute coronary syndrome (Ho2013Common). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IL1RL1 in various inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions.

## Interactions
IL1RL1, also known as ST2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in immune signaling. It interacts with interleukin-33 (IL-33) to form a complex that signals through the IL-1 receptor-related protein ST2, leading to the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as MyD88, IRAK, IRAK4, and TRAF6. This interaction activates downstream signaling pathways, including NF-kB and MAP kinases, which are essential for the production of T helper type 2 (TH2)-associated cytokines like IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (Schmitz2005IL-33).

IL1RL1 also interacts with proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Variants of IL1RL1, such as A433T and Q501R, have been shown to interact with the PI3K-p85 subunit, enhancing the activation of NF-kB and AP-1 pathways (Ho2013Common). These interactions suggest a role in regulating sST2 expression and modulating immune responses (Ho2013Common).

In the context of Helicobacter pylori infection, IL1RL1 interacts with MyD88 and TIRAP, inhibiting NF-kB activation by sequestering these adaptor proteins. This interaction promotes an anti-inflammatory response, highlighting IL1RL1's role in modulating immune responses (Fulgione2020Interaction).
