# SH3GL2

## Overview
SH3GL2 is a gene that encodes the protein SH3 domain containing GRB2 like 2, also known as endophilin A1. This protein is a key player in cellular processes, particularly in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, which is crucial for neurotransmitter recycling in neurons. Endophilin A1 is characterized by the presence of SH3 and BAR domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and membrane dynamics, respectively (Mehrabipour2023A; Yang2023Biology). The SH3 domain is involved in binding to proline-rich regions of other proteins, while the BAR domain, specifically the N-BAR subtype, is essential for inducing membrane curvature (Mondal2022Multivalent). This protein is predominantly active in presynaptic terminals, contributing to efficient synaptic transmission and neural communication (Mehrabipour2023A). SH3GL2 has been implicated in various cellular signaling pathways and is associated with the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), playing a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Yao2014MiR330Mediated; Qu2012MicroRNA330). Alterations in the SH3GL2 gene have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in tumor progression and prognosis (Islam2020Reduction; Maiti2013Overexpression).

## Structure
The SH3GL2 protein, also known as Endophilin A1, is characterized by the presence of SH3 (Src homology 3) and BAR (Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs) domains, which are crucial for its function in cellular processes such as endocytosis (Yang2023Biology). The SH3 domain facilitates protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich domains in other proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic activity and cellular signaling pathways (Mehrabipour2023A; Mondal2022Multivalent). The BAR domain, specifically the N-BAR subtype, is involved in binding to lipid bilayers and inducing membrane curvature, essential for membrane dynamics (Yang2023Biology).

The N-BAR domain includes three functional regions: the N-terminal amphiphilic helix (H0), which mediates membrane binding; the amphiphilic helix inserted into helix 1 (H1), which inserts into the membrane; and the crescent-shaped body formed by the dimerized BAR domain, which drives membrane curvature (Yang2023Biology). The protein's structure, including its alpha helices and beta sheets, contributes to its tertiary structure, allowing it to play a significant role in intracellular membrane dynamics (Yang2023Biology). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can regulate the activity of SH3GL2, and multiple splice variants exist, potentially altering its functional properties.

## Function
SH3GL2, also known as endophilin A1, is a protein primarily involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, a critical process for neurotransmitter recycling in neurons. It is predominantly active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it contributes to efficient synaptic transmission and neural communication (Mehrabipour2023A). The protein contains an SH3 domain that facilitates interactions with other proteins, playing a role in membrane curvature and vesicle formation (Mehrabipour2023A).

In healthy human cells, SH3GL2 is involved in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the cell membrane. It forms complexes with Cb1 and CIN85, which activate EGFR, mediate its endocytosis, and promote its degradation. This process is crucial for maintaining normal EGFR function and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Yao2014MiR330Mediated). SH3GL2 also interacts with Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa (CIN85) and Cbl, influencing the internalization, degradation, and intracellular signaling of tyrosine kinase receptors for hepatocyte and epidermal growth factors (Qu2012MicroRNA330).

The protein's role in healthy cells is likely related to its regulatory functions in cell signaling and adhesion, contributing to normal cellular processes and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qu2012MicroRNA330).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the SH3GL2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), SH3GL2 is frequently inactivated through deletions and promoter methylation, which is associated with the overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This inactivation may impair EGFR endocytosis and degradation, contributing to cancer progression and poor patient survival (Maiti2013Overexpression). SH3GL2 is also involved in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where its reduced expression is linked to EGFR overexpression and nuclear expression of Y654-p-β-catenin, suggesting a role in chemotolerance (Islam2020Reduction).

In glioblastoma, SH3GL2 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation by miR-330 enhances malignant behaviors of glioblastoma stem cells by activating ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (Yao2014MiR330Mediated). SH3GL2 expression is also reduced in retinoblastoma, where its downregulation promotes tumor growth and invasiveness (Chen2022Bioinformatics). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SH3GL2 in cancer, where its altered expression or inactivation contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis.

## Interactions
SH3GL2, also known as endophilin A1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. It interacts with ITSN1 (Intersectin 1) through SH3 domain-mediated complex formation, which is essential for recruiting Endophilin 1 at sites of clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle recycling. The second SH3 domain of ITSN1 is particularly important for this interaction, highlighting the role of SH3GL2 in synaptic vesicle recycling (Mehrabipour2023A).

SH3GL2 also plays a role in the BDNF-NTRK2 pathway, which is significant for early endocytosis and signal transduction in nerve cells. This interaction is part of the intracellular signaling cascades, such as PI3K/Akt, PLCγ, and MAPK/ERK pathways, which are crucial for inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress responses that can lead to neuron cell death, a mechanism associated with Alzheimer's disease (Tian2021Identification).

Additionally, SH3GL2 is known to interact with proteins like dynamin and synaptojanin, contributing to endocytosis and cytoskeleton regulation. These interactions are vital for synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane curvature, indicating SH3GL2's role in maintaining synaptic function (Mehrabipour2023A).
