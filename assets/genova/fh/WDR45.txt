# WDR45

## Overview
WDR45 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the WD repeat domain 45 (WDR45) protein, also known as WIPI4. This protein is a member of the β-propeller family, characterized by its seven WD repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes (Zheng2017Architecture; Tsukida2022WDR45). WDR45 plays a significant role in autophagy, a cellular degradation and recycling process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is involved in the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, interacting with proteins such as ATG2A and ATG2B to facilitate lipid transfer and autophagosome expansion (Zheng2017Architecture; Cong2021WDR45). Mutations in the WDR45 gene are linked to neurodegenerative disorders, most notably beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Haack2012Exome; Hayflick2013Betapropeller).

## Structure
The WDR45 gene encodes the WIPI4 protein, which consists of 361 amino acids and includes seven WD repeat domains, contributing to its classification within the β-propeller family (Zheng2017Architecture; Tsukida2022WDR45). These WD repeat domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and forming a globular structure, which is characteristic of β-propeller proteins (Zheng2017Architecture). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in autophagy, as it interacts with other proteins like ATG2B to form a club-shaped complex, with WDR45 appearing as a globular protein attached to one end of the ATG2B bar (Zheng2017Architecture).

WDR45 has a stronger binding capacity for ATG2A and ATG2B compared to other WIPI proteins, and this interaction is essential for autophagy (Zheng2017Architecture). The protein also binds to phosphatidylinositol phosphates, with a preference for PI(3)P, which is important for its membrane association and function in autophagosome maturation (Ji2021βpropeller). Mutations in WDR45 can lead to neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper cellular function (Zheng2017Architecture). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could further influence its function and interactions.

## Function
The WDR45 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the autophagy process, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by degrading and recycling cellular components. In healthy human cells, WDR45 is involved in the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, which are double-membrane structures that engulf cellular debris for degradation in lysosomes (Zhao2015The; Ji2021βpropeller). WDR45 interacts with proteins such as ATG2A and ATG2B, facilitating lipid transfer necessary for autophagosome expansion and closure (Zheng2017Architecture; Cong2021WDR45).

WDR45 is also involved in the regulation of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, a critical step for the degradation of cellular components. It interacts with the tether protein EPG5 and SNARE proteins, forming complexes that are essential for this fusion process (Ji2021βpropeller). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with phosphatidylinositol phosphates, particularly PI(3)P, which is crucial for its membrane association (Ji2021βpropeller).

In addition to its role in autophagy, WDR45 is implicated in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and neuronal health, influencing the stability of ER proteins and preventing ER stress (Wan2019WDR45). Deficiency in WDR45 can lead to impaired autophagic flux and neurodegenerative conditions such as β-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) (Zhao2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR45 gene are primarily associated with beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), a subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). BPAN is characterized by early-onset developmental delays, intellectual disability, and seizures, followed by progressive motor and cognitive decline, including parkinsonism, dystonia, and dementia in adolescence or early adulthood (Hor2018Betapropeller; Haack2012Exome; Hayflick2013Betapropeller). The disorder is linked to de novo mutations in the WDR45 gene, which is located on the X chromosome, leading to an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern. This results in a higher prevalence in females, although males can also be affected (Nishioka2015High; Haack2012Exome).

WDR45 mutations can also lead to other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett-like syndrome, developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, and West syndrome, though these are less common (Carvill2017Severe; Cong2021WDR45). The gene's role in autophagy is crucial, and its dysfunction is linked to the complex phenotypes observed in these conditions (Hor2018Betapropeller). Genetic testing for WDR45 variants is recommended for accurate diagnosis, especially in cases with overlapping symptoms (Cong2021WDR45).

## Interactions
WDR45, also known as WIPI4, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for autophagy and iron metabolism. It forms a complex with ATG2B, which is essential for lipid transfer and autophagosome maturation. This interaction is facilitated by a conserved aromatic Y/HF motif in ATG2B, and mutations in WDR45 can impair this binding (Zheng2017Architecture). WDR45 also interacts with nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) and WD repeat domain phosphoinositide interacting protein 4 (WIPI4), playing a role in ferritinophagy, a process crucial for iron metabolism (Tsukida2022WDR45).

In neural cells, WDR45 and its homolog WDR45B are involved in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. They interact with the tether protein EPG5, facilitating its targeting to late endosomes/lysosomes. This interaction is critical for the formation of SNARE-tether fusion complexes necessary for autophagosome maturation (Ji2021βpropeller). Mutations in WDR45 that disrupt its interaction with EPG5 are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as BPAN (Ji2021βpropeller). These interactions highlight the role of WDR45 in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in autophagy and iron metabolism.
