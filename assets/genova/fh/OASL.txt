# OASL

## Overview
The OASL gene encodes the protein 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase like, which is a member of the oligoadenylate synthetase family. This protein is integral to the innate immune response, particularly in antiviral defense mechanisms. Unlike other members of its family, OASL lacks catalytic activity but plays a crucial role in modulating immune pathways through its structural features, including an oligoadenylate synthetase-like domain and C-terminal ubiquitin-like domains. These domains enable OASL to enhance RIG-I signaling by mimicking polyubiquitin, thereby facilitating the activation of type I interferons and other interferon-stimulated genes (Zhu2014Antiviral; Ibsen2015Structural). Additionally, OASL interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing both antiviral and proviral activities, and has significant clinical implications in cancer and viral infections (Bussey2018The; Liu2024Multiomics).

## Structure
The human OASL protein is part of the oligoadenylate synthetase family and is characterized by its unique structural features. It contains an oligoadenylate synthetase-like domain (OLD) and two C-terminal ubiquitin-like domains (UbLDs). The OLD is structurally similar to the activated form of OAS1, featuring a classical OAS structure with two lobes connected by a linker region. The N-terminal lobe consists of a five-stranded β-sheet, while the C-terminal lobe forms a four-helix bundle. Notably, OASL intrinsically forms the αN4 helix, which is crucial for its function, unlike OAS1, which requires dsRNA binding for this formation (Ibsen2015Structural).

The C-terminal ubiquitin-like domains of OASL can substitute for K63-linked poly-ubiquitin and interact with the CARDs of RIG-I, enhancing RIG-I signaling. These domains are involved in post-translational modifications and play a significant role in the protein's antiviral activity (Ibsen2015Structural). OASL forms soluble multimers in solution, although a minor fraction exists as monomers (Ibsen2015Structural). Despite lacking catalytic activity due to an incomplete catalytic triad, OASL's structural features, particularly its dsRNA binding groove, are essential for its role in antiviral defense (Ibsen2015Structural).

## Function
The OASL (2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase like) protein plays a significant role in the innate immune response by modulating antiviral pathways. In healthy human cells, OASL enhances the activity of the RIG-I-like receptor pathway, which is crucial for detecting and responding to viral RNA. OASL achieves this by mimicking polyubiquitin, thereby activating RIG-I, a key RNA sensor, which leads to the induction of type I interferons and other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Zhu2014Antiviral). This activation is essential for the oligomerization of RIG-I, a necessary step for its activation, and occurs even in the absence of TRIM25, a known cofactor for RIG-I (Zhu2014Antiviral).

OASL also interacts with the DNA sensor cGAS, inhibiting its activity during DNA virus infections. This interaction reduces the production of cGAMP, a second messenger that activates the STING pathway, thereby limiting the induction of interferons and modulating the immune response to DNA viruses (Ghosh2019OligoadenylateSynthetaseFamily). OASL's dual role in enhancing RIG-I signaling and inhibiting cGAS activity highlights its importance in balancing the immune response to different types of viral infections.

## Clinical Significance
The OASL gene has significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly in cancer and viral infections. In cancer, OASL expression levels are associated with different prognostic outcomes across multiple tumor types. High OASL expression correlates with poor prognosis in cancers such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), low-grade glioma (LGG), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), thymoma (THYM), and uveal melanoma (UVM), while it appears protective in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) (Liu2024Multiomics). In pancreatic cancer, reduced OASL expression through siRNA knockdown decreases cell viability and invasion, and increases apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor progression (Liu2024Multiomics).

OASL is also involved in antiviral responses. It enhances RIG-I signaling, crucial for the induction of interferon-stimulated genes, thereby playing a positive role in antiviral defense. Loss of OASL expression can lead to reduced induction of these genes and increased viral replication, impacting the host's ability to combat viral infections (Zhu2014Antiviral). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OASL gene, such as rs3213545, have been linked to susceptibility to viral infections like West Nile virus and response to hepatitis C treatment (Choi2015Oligoadenylate). These genetic variations highlight the gene's broader clinical significance beyond immune-related diseases.

## Interactions
The human OASL protein interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in antiviral and proviral activities. OASL is known to interact with the RIG-I protein, a pattern recognition receptor involved in antiviral responses. This interaction enhances RIG-I signaling by mimicking polyubiquitin, which is crucial for RIG-I activation and the subsequent induction of type I interferons (Zhu2014Antiviral). OASL binds to RIG-I through its C-terminal ubiquitin-like domains, facilitating RIG-I oligomerization and activation (Zhu2014Antiviral).

OASL also interacts with the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF20 protein. This interaction is conserved across all ORF20 isoforms and homologs in other herpesviruses and is independent of RNA-binding and the ubiquitin-like domain of OASL (Bussey2018The). OASL and ORF20 co-purify with ribosomal subunits and associate with polysomes, suggesting a role in translation processes during KSHV infection (Bussey2018The).

Additionally, OASL interacts with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) through a binding groove, which is essential for its role in enhancing RIG-I signaling (Ibsen2015Structural). This interaction with dsRNA is crucial for OASL's function in promoting antiviral responses.
