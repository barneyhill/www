# MMP15

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 15 (MMP15) is a gene that encodes a type-1 transmembrane protein belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase family. This protein, also known as membrane-type 2 matrix metalloproteinase (MT2-MMP), plays a pivotal role in the degradation of extracellular matrix components, which is essential for processes such as tissue remodeling, cell migration, and angiogenesis. MMP15 is characterized by its complex structure, including a catalytic domain that is stabilized by zinc and calcium ions, and a hemopexin-like domain that facilitates substrate binding. The protein is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including placental development, adipocyte differentiation, and cancer progression. Its expression and activity are regulated through interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Feinberg2016Functional; Gan2020Identification; Majali‐Martinez2020Matrix).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 15 (MMP15) is a type-1 transmembrane protein that is part of the matrix metalloproteinase family. The primary structure of MMP15 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain, which includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, a catalytic domain, a hinge region, a hemopexin-like domain, a stalk region, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region (Gan2020Identification; Jackson2010Update). 

The secondary structure of the catalytic domain is composed of a 5-stranded β-sheet, three α-helices, and a connective loop, stabilized by zinc and calcium ions (Gan2020Identification). The hemopexin domain is organized into a four-bladed β-propeller structure, which is crucial for binding to various substrates and cell surface molecules (Stawikowski2015Matrix).

The tertiary structure of MMP15 involves the three-dimensional folding of these domains, with the zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) and the cysteine switch motif (PRCGXPD) being crucial for the regulation of its enzymatic activity (Gan2020Identification). 

MMP15 may form quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, although specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context. Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is important for the formation of enzyme complexes and activation of other MMPs (Stawikowski2015Matrix). The presence of splice variant isoforms can result in structural and functional diversity, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context.

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 15 (MMP15) is a membrane-type metalloproteinase involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components, playing a crucial role in tissue remodeling and cell migration. In healthy human cells, MMP15 is primarily active at the cell surface, where it participates in the reconstruction of the extracellular matrix, which is essential for maintaining tissue architecture, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, tissue repair, and angiogenesis (Kudelski2020Dominative). 

MMP15 is expressed in various tissues, including the placenta, where it is crucial for the invasion of cytotrophoblasts during early pregnancy. This invasion is vital for placental development, as MMP15 facilitates the outgrowth and invasion of trophoblasts, although it does not affect their proliferation or apoptosis (Majali‐Martinez2020Matrix). 

In the mammary gland, MMP15 is involved in adipocyte differentiation, particularly in the formation of thermogenic brown fat, indicating its role in energy metabolism and thermogenesis (Feinberg2016Functional). Despite its involvement in these processes, MMP15 is not essential for branching morphogenesis in the mammary gland, as its absence does not significantly affect ductal network formation (Feinberg2016Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MMP15 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A bi-allelic null variant in MMP15 is associated with congenital cardiac defects, cholestasis jaundice, and failure to thrive. This variant results in a frameshift mutation that introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein that likely disrupts its function as a membrane endopeptidase. The mutation also causes reduced MMP15 mRNA levels, likely due to nonsense-mediated decay (Abdelrahman2022Bi‐allelic).

In breast cancer, MMP15 expression is highly variable across different pathological stages and is associated with poorer overall survival, particularly in the Normal-like subtype. High MMP15 expression is linked to poor prognosis, suggesting its role in cancer development and progression (Cheng2022Landscape).

MMP15 also plays a crucial role in early placental development, particularly in cytotrophoblast invasion during the first trimester of pregnancy. Its expression is not significantly altered by maternal obesity or associated inflammatory conditions, indicating a specific role in placental development rather than being influenced by external maternal factors (Majali‐Martinez2020Matrix).

## Interactions
MMP15, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 15, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In lung carcinoma cells, MMP15 expression is regulated by T cell factor-4 (TCF-4), which acts as a co-activator to promote NF-κB-dependent transcription of MMP15. This interaction involves the p65 subunit of NF-κB, which binds to the MMP15 promoter, facilitating its expression and contributing to cancer cell migration and invasion (Liu2016T).

In the context of colorectal cancer, MMP15 is expressed by stromal fibroblasts and macrophages, suggesting its involvement in the tumor microenvironment. The expression of MMP15 increases in early cancer progression, indicating its potential role in stromal regulation and tumor development (Roncucci2012Matrix).

In medaka fish, MMP15 is crucial for ovulation, where its expression is regulated by the phosphorylation of the nuclear progestin receptor (Pgr) by cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9). This phosphorylation is necessary for MMP15 expression, highlighting a regulatory interaction that is essential for extracellular matrix degradation during ovulation (Ogiwara2019Nuclear).
