# ANP32A

## Overview
ANP32A, or acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member A, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, apoptosis, and intracellular transport. The ANP32A protein is characterized by its N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a C-terminal low-complexity acidic region (LCAR), which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Huyton2007The; Yu2022Roles). As a member of the ANP32 protein family, ANP32A plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by being part of the inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) complex, which represses transcription through histone modification (Reilly2014Cracking). Additionally, ANP32A is implicated in neural development and diseases such as Alzheimer's, where it affects tau protein phosphorylation and neuronal function (Yu2022Roles). Its involvement in apoptosis and intracellular transport further underscores its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (Reilly2014Cracking).

## Structure
The ANP32A protein, also known as pp32, is characterized by a distinct molecular structure comprising an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a C-terminal low-complexity acidic region (LCAR). The LRR domain consists of a series of leucine-rich repeats, each containing a β strand and an α helix connected by loops, forming a canonical curved solenoid shape. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions and includes nuclear export signals (NESs) that facilitate cytoplasmic distribution (Huyton2007The; Yu2022Roles). The LRR domain is monomeric and does not dimerize, featuring a concave surface lined by beta-strands and an outer surface formed by a 3 10-helix or short alpha-helix (Huyton2007The).

The C-terminal LCAR is highly acidic, composed mainly of aspartic and glutamic acids, and includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that interacts with nuclear transport receptors (Chen1996Structure; Yu2022Roles). This region is flexible, allowing interaction with various proteins, and is involved in chromatin binding and microtubule association (Huyton2007The). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, particularly by Casein kinase II, further increase the acidity of ANP32A and may affect its function (Reilly2014Cracking).

## Function
ANP32A, a member of the ANP32 protein family, is involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ANP32A plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling by being part of the inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) complex, which represses gene transcription by inhibiting histone acetylation. It binds to unmodified histone tails, particularly histone H3, and interacts with DNA-binding transcription factors to regulate gene expression (Reilly2014Cracking; Yu2022Roles).

ANP32A is also involved in apoptosis, where it acts as an activator of apoptosomes, promoting apoptosome formation and activity. It chelates proteins such as SET and HuR to stimulate apoptosis, and its decreased expression can lead to rapid apoptosis in macrophages (Reilly2014Cracking; Yu2022Roles).

In neural development, ANP32A regulates the expression of the neurofilament light chain and affects neuronal axon generation. It is associated with nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, where its expression is elevated, leading to decreased PP2A activity and tau protein hyperphosphorylation (Yu2022Roles).

ANP32A also plays a role in intracellular transport by acting as an adaptor between the nuclear-export factor CRM1 and the mRNA-binding protein HuR, impacting mRNA transport and stability (Reilly2014Cracking).

## Clinical Significance
ANP32A plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in regulating Wnt signaling and other cellular pathways. In osteoarthritis, ANP32A deficiency leads to hyperactivation of Wnt signaling, contributing to disease progression and increased cartilage damage. This is associated with increased oxidative stress, and targeting Wnt signaling and oxidative stress may offer therapeutic benefits (Cornelis2016Loss; Monteagudo2021ANP32A). In cardiac hypertrophy, the absence of ANP32A results in enhanced Wnt signaling, increased heart/body weight ratio, and fibrosis, indicating its protective role against this condition (Monteagudo2021ANP32A).

In Alzheimer's disease, ANP32A dysregulation is linked to enhanced Wnt signaling and memory deficits. Its knockdown in models restores histone acetylation levels, crucial for synaptic protein expression, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Chai2017Downregulating; Monteagudo2021ANP32A). ANP32A is also implicated in cancer, with altered expression promoting cell proliferation in colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma through pathways like Akt and HMGA1/STAT3 (Yan2017ANP32A; Tian2020ANP32A). In prostate cancer, ANP32A is targeted by miR-21, which suppresses its tumor-suppressive functions (Schramedei2011MicroRNA21). These findings highlight ANP32A's clinical significance across various diseases.

## Interactions
ANP32A, also known as acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member A, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions that influence cellular processes. It is a component of the inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) complex, where it binds to unmodified histone tails, particularly histone H3, to inhibit acetylation and repress gene transcription (Reilly2014Cracking). ANP32A interacts with transcription factors such as ER alpha, p120E4F, LHX3, and STAT1-STAT2, affecting gene transcription (Yu2022Roles). It also plays a role in apoptosis by interacting with SET and HuR proteins, stimulating apoptosome activation and caspase-3 activation (Reilly2014Cracking).

ANP32A is involved in intracellular transport, acting as an adaptor between the nuclear-export factor CRM1 and the mRNA-binding protein HuR (Reilly2014Cracking). It also interacts with the influenza virus polymerase complex, affecting viral replication (Yu2022Roles). The protein's interactions with the hyperphosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor and its role in mRNA trafficking through the HuR complex are significant in cancer progression (Huyton2007The). These interactions highlight ANP32A's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and disease.
