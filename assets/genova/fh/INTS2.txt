# INTS2

## Overview
The INTS2 gene encodes the integrator complex subunit 2 protein, which is a critical component of the Integrator complex involved in RNA processing and transcription regulation. The protein plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity of the Integrator-PP2A complex (INTAC), forming a scaffold with other subunits such as INTS1 and INTS7. This structural arrangement is essential for the complex's function in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription, particularly in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and the regulation of gene expression. INTS2 is implicated in chromatin interactions and the dephosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, which are crucial for transcription regulation. Mutations in INTS2 have been associated with certain cancers, although its precise role in disease pathogenesis remains to be fully elucidated (Federico2017PanCancer; Zheng2020Identification).

## Structure
The INTS2 protein is a component of the Integrator complex, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing. Structurally, INTS2 is part of the backbone module of the Integrator-PP2A complex (INTAC), forming a rigid scaffold with INTS1 and INTS7. INTS2 adopts an elongated conformation, featuring an N-terminal helical cap (Ncap) and three tandemly repeated α-helix hairpins, labeled as INTS2R1 to INTS2R3. The INTS2R1 region exhibits an extended arch-shaped conformation, while the INTS2R2-INTS2R3-INTS1R4 'bridge' extends to and binds the shoulder module, which includes INTS5 and INTS8 (Zheng2020Identification).

The structure of INTS2 is integral to the assembly of the INTAC complex, as it merges at a three-way junction with INTS1 and INTS7, facilitating extensive contacts that nucleate the assembly of the entire complex. This structural arrangement is essential for the complex's function in transcription regulation (Zheng2020Identification). Despite these insights, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of INTS2, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
INTS2 is a component of the Integrator complex, which plays a crucial role in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. This complex is involved in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and the regulation of gene expression. INTS2, along with other subunits, forms a rigid scaffold in the backbone module of the Integrator-PP2A complex (INTAC), contributing to its structural integrity (Zheng2020Identification). The Integrator complex, including INTS2, is involved in the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II at specific serine residues, which is essential for transcription regulation, affecting initiation, pausing, and elongation (Zheng2020Identification).

INTS2 is also implicated in chromatin interactions, as it localizes on chromatin along with other Integrator subunits, indicating its role in regulating RNA polymerase II activity (Zheng2020Identification). The complex's activity is crucial for maintaining proper phosphorylation states necessary for transcription, as depletion of certain components leads to increased phosphorylation levels of RNA polymerase II (Zheng2020Identification). INTS2's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper gene expression in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
INTS2, a component of the integrator complex, has been implicated in various diseases through mutations and alterations in its expression. In gastric cancer, recurrent mutations in INTS2 have been identified, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Federico2017PanCancer). Specifically, a p.G906K mutation in INTS2 was discovered in gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Xu2024Comprehensive).

In a study involving an infant with fulminant hepatic failure and mitochondrial DNA depletion, a homozygous intronic variant in INTS2 (c.456+5A>G) was identified. However, this variant was not expected to affect canonical splicing sites, and INTS2 was not directly associated with the observed phenotype, which was attributed to a POLG2 variant (Varma2016Whole).

Despite these findings, the precise biological role of INTS2 in disease remains unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance. The current evidence suggests that while INTS2 mutations are present in certain cancers, their direct impact on disease mechanisms requires additional investigation.

## Interactions
INTS2 is a subunit of the Integrator complex, which is involved in RNA polymerase II transcription regulation. It forms a heterodimer with INTS7, a relationship confirmed through chemical crosslinking studies and co-purification techniques (Fianu2024Reconstitution). This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity of the Integrator complex.

INTS2 is part of the backbone module of the Integrator-PP2A complex (INTAC), where it closely associates with INTS1 and INTS7 to form a rigid scaffold. It adopts an elongated conformation with an N-terminal helical cap and three tandemly repeated alpha-helix hairpins, contributing to the structural framework of the complex (Zheng2020Identification). The INTS2R2-INTS2R3-INTS1R4 'bridge' extends to and binds the shoulder module, which includes INTS5 and INTS8, forming a cruciform scaffold (Zheng2020Identification).

While the specific interactions of INTS2 with nucleic acids are not detailed, its role within the Integrator complex suggests it may participate in RNA processing activities. The structural configuration of INTS2 within the Integrator complex highlights its importance in maintaining the complex's stability and function (Fianu2024Structural; Zheng2020Identification).
