# DCTPP1

## Overview
The DCTPP1 gene encodes the enzyme dCTP pyrophosphatase 1, a member of the all-α NTP-PPase superfamily, which is crucial for maintaining nucleotide pool homeostasis in human cells. This enzyme functions primarily by hydrolyzing dCTP into dCMP and pyrophosphate, thereby regulating the levels of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) such as dCTP, dTTP, and dUTP. The protein encoded by DCTPP1 is characterized by a conserved Nudix hydrolase domain and typically forms a homotetramer, with its enzymatic activity optimized in the presence of Mg2+ as a cofactor (Song2015Human). DCTPP1 plays a vital role in preventing the accumulation of uracil in DNA, which can lead to genomic instability and DNA damage (MartínezArribas2019DCTPP1). The enzyme is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to DNA replication and repair processes by ensuring the incorporation of undamaged nucleotides into DNA (Requena2016The).

## Structure
The human DCTPP1 protein is a member of the all-α NTP-PPase superfamily and shares homology with the MazG protein from prokaryotic organisms. Its primary structure includes a key amino acid motif, ExxD, essential for Mg2+ binding and substrate coordination (Song2015Human). The secondary structure of DCTPP1 is characterized by four α-helices, which form the active enzymatic sites necessary for its function (Song2015Human). 

In terms of tertiary structure, DCTPP1 forms an asymmetric dimer of dimers, similar to the crystal structure of mouse DCTPP1 and other members of the all-α NTP-PPase family (Song2015Human). The quaternary structure of DCTPP1 is a tetrameric form composed of four monomers (Song2015Human). 

DCTPP1 exhibits substrate preference for dCTP and structurally similar derivatives, including 5-methyl-dCTP and 5-halo-dCTP, with its enzymatic activity optimized with Mg2+ as a cofactor (Song2015Human). The protein's structure includes a conserved Nudix hydrolase domain, crucial for its enzymatic activity, and it typically forms a homotetramer (Song2015Human). Common post-translational modifications may include phosphorylation, affecting its activity and stability.

## Function
The DCTPP1 gene encodes the enzyme dCTP pyrophosphatase 1, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools in human cells. This enzyme is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of dCTP into dCMP and pyrophosphate, which helps regulate the levels of dCTP, dTTP, and dUTP, thereby maintaining nucleotide pool homeostasis (Requena2016The; MartínezArribas2019DCTPP1). DCTPP1's activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of uracil in DNA, which can lead to DNA damage and genomic instability (MartínezArribas2019DCTPP1).

In healthy cells, DCTPP1 prevents a mutator phenotype by modulating nucleotide pools, thus preserving genomic integrity (MartínezArribas2019DCTPP1). The enzyme is highly expressed in embryonic and proliferative tissues, indicating its importance in cells with high DNA precursor demand (MartínezArribas2019DCTPP1). DCTPP1 is also involved in the synthesis of dTTP, as its deficiency results in reduced dTTP levels and increased dUTP, leading to uracil accumulation in DNA and activation of the DNA repair response (MartínezArribas2019DCTPP1).

DCTPP1 is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the maintenance of nucleotide pool balance and prevents the incorporation of damaged nucleotides into DNA, playing a crucial role in DNA replication and repair (Requena2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DCTPP1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it is often overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. In ovarian cancer, DCTPP1 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues, with higher levels correlating with advanced disease stages and poorer patient outcomes. This overexpression is also linked to resistance to cisplatin treatment, suggesting a role in chemotherapy resistance (Wang2022ROSInduced).

In prostate cancer, DCTPP1 overexpression is associated with increased tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes. It is linked to enhanced autophagy and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, processes that contribute to tumor growth and metastasis (Lu2018Autophagy). Similarly, in breast cancer, high DCTPP1 expression is correlated with poor prognosis and is involved in promoting cancer cell growth and stemness by modulating 5-methyl-dCTP metabolism and global hypomethylation (Song2015Human).

DCTPP1 also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating nucleotide pools. Its deficiency can lead to genomic instability, characterized by increased uracil incorporation into DNA and activation of DNA damage responses, which may contribute to a hypermutator phenotype (MartínezArribas2019DCTPP1).
