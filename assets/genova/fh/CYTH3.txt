# CYTH3

## Overview
CYTH3 is a gene that encodes the protein cytohesin 3, a member of the cytohesin family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that primarily function in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. Cytohesin 3 is characterized by its structural domains, including a Sec7 domain responsible for its GEF activity, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for membrane association, and a coiled-coil domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, such as actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, and migration, and is particularly important in the context of insulin signaling and lipid metabolism. CYTH3's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential impact on metabolic disorders and fibrotic conditions, making it a subject of interest for therapeutic research (Malaby2013Structural; Jux2019Cytohesin3; Huang2021LncRNA).

## Structure
Cytohesin-3 (CYTH3) is a member of the cytohesin family of proteins, which function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for ARF GTPases. The protein structure of CYTH3 includes several key domains: a Sec7 domain, which is responsible for its GEF activity, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that facilitates membrane association by binding to phosphatidylinositol phosphates, and a coiled-coil domain that aids in protein-protein interactions (Malaby2013Structural; Jux2019Cytohesin3).

The PH domain of CYTH3 is particularly important for its function, as it binds phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates, with specificity influenced by alternative splicing. This results in diglycine (2G) and triglycine (3G) variants, where the 2G variant has a higher affinity for PI(3,4,5)P3 (Malaby2013Structural). The protein also contains a C-terminal helix (CtH) that overlaps with a polybasic region (PBR), contributing to its autoinhibition, which can be relieved by Arf6-GTP binding (Malaby2013Structural).

CYTH3 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and localization. Splice variants of CYTH3 can lead to different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions (Jux2019Cytohesin3).

## Function
Cytohesin 3 (CYTH3) is a member of the cytohesin family of proteins, which function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). These proteins are involved in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking, playing a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, and migration. CYTH3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it facilitates various cellular processes (Jux2019Cytohesin3).

In the context of insulin signaling, CYTH3 is essential for the full activation of insulin receptor (IR) signaling pathways. It modulates the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is critical for glucose transporter recycling and actin rearrangement upon insulin stimulation. This activity is vital for maintaining glucose homeostasis and proper metabolic function in tissues such as the liver and adipose tissue (Jux2019Cytohesin3).

CYTH3 also plays a role in lipid metabolism and body weight regulation. In cytohesin-3-deficient mice, there is impaired insulin signaling, leading to altered glucose metabolism and increased lipid excretion. This results in reduced body fat and protection against obesity induced by aging or a high-fat diet (Jux2019Cytohesin3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CYTH3 gene, also known as cytohesin 3, have been implicated in various metabolic and fibrotic conditions. In the context of insulin signaling, CYTH3 is essential for full insulin receptor signaling in the liver and adipose tissue. Deficiency in CYTH3 leads to impaired insulin signaling, which can result in insulin resistance and altered lipid metabolism. This is characterized by increased lipid excretion and reduced body fat accumulation, particularly under high-fat diet conditions, suggesting a potential role in metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (Jux2019Cytohesin3).

In liver fibrosis, CYTH3 expression is upregulated in activated hepatic stellate cells and in fibrotic liver tissues. The long non-coding RNA Neat1 regulates CYTH3 expression by modulating microRNAs miR-148a-3p and miR-22-3p. Knockdown of CYTH3 in mouse models has been shown to reduce liver fibrosis, indicating its involvement in fibrogenesis. This suggests that CYTH3 could be a target for therapeutic intervention in liver fibrosis (Huang2021LncRNA). The regulatory pathway involving Neat1 and CYTH3 highlights the complex interactions that contribute to the progression of liver fibrosis and potentially other fibrotic diseases.

## Interactions
CYTH3, also known as cytohesin 3, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell signaling and motility. CYTH3 interacts with CNK2, specifically through the CRAC domain of CNK2, which is essential for promoting cell migration. This interaction is necessary for the activation of ARF6, a GTPase that regulates RAC1 and RHOA during cell migration. Mutations in CNK2 that impair its binding with CYTH3, such as the L955P mutation, result in reduced cell migration and ARF6-GTP levels, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Serwe2023CNK2).

CYTH3 also forms a complex with CNK2A and CYTH1 at the plasma membrane, facilitating ARF6 activation. This complex is crucial for cell motility, as it may enhance cytohesin GEF activity or recruit them to the plasma membrane near ARF6. The interaction between CNK2A and CYTH3 is distinct from that with CYTH2, indicating a specific binding interface that is essential for ARF6 activation (Serwe2023CNK2).

In the context of liver fibrosis, CYTH3 expression is regulated by the lncRNA NEAT1 through interactions with miR-148a-3p and miR-22-3p. These microRNAs negatively regulate CYTH3, and their inhibition leads to increased CYTH3 expression, affecting hepatic stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis progression (Huang2021LncRNA).
