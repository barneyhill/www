# CKB

## Overview
Creatine kinase B (CKB) is a gene that encodes the creatine kinase B protein, a crucial enzyme in cellular energy metabolism. This protein belongs to the kinase family and is primarily involved in the reversible transfer of phosphate groups between ATP and phosphocreatine, facilitating energy storage and distribution in cells with high energy demands, such as neurons and astrocytes (Kuiper2009Local; Schlattner2016Cellular). The CKB protein functions as a homodimer, with each monomer comprising distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains, and is subject to post-translational modifications that can affect its activity (Sprenger2021Calmodulin; Darabedian2023Depletion). CKB is highly expressed in the brain, where it plays a vital role in maintaining energy homeostasis and supporting synaptic transmission (Schlattner2016Cellular; Pfefferle2011Comparative). Additionally, CKB has significant clinical relevance, particularly in cancer biology, where its expression is linked to tumor growth and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Krutilina2021HIFdependent).

## Structure
The human creatine kinase B (CKB) protein is a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of an N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal α/β domain, connected by a 24-residue linker (Sprenger2021Calmodulin). The N-terminal domain includes residues 1-100, while the C-terminal domain spans residues 125-381 (Bong2008Structural). The loop regions, particularly residues 60-70 and 323-332 near the active site, play a crucial role in regulating enzyme activity and differ structurally between isoforms (Sprenger2021Calmodulin). These loops, along with the amphiphilic helix α12 in the C-terminal region, are potential binding sites for calmodulin (CaM) (Sprenger2021Calmodulin).

The CKB protein shares approximately 80% sequence identity with creatine kinase M (CKM), and their crystal structures are highly similar (Sprenger2021Calmodulin). The structure of CKB in complex with substrates or substrate analogs shows ligand-dependent structural changes in these loops and helices (Sprenger2021Calmodulin). CKB may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Darabedian2023Depletion). The protein's quaternary structure involves the dimerization of two identical subunits, which is essential for its enzymatic function (Sprenger2021Calmodulin).

## Function
Creatine kinase B (CKB) plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism by catalyzing the reversible transfer of high-energy phosphate groups between ATP and phosphocreatine. This process is essential for energy storage and distribution, particularly in cells with high energy demands such as neurons and astrocytes (Kuiper2009Local; Schlattner2016Cellular). CKB is involved in the local generation of ATP, which is vital for processes like actin polymerization and myosin force generation, supporting cell motility and morphological changes (Kuiper2009Local). 

CKB is highly expressed in the brain, where it maintains energy homeostasis by regenerating ATP from ADP using phosphocreatine. This function is critical for regulating neurotransmitter release, maintaining membrane potentials, and supporting synaptic transmission (Schlattner2016Cellular; Pfefferle2011Comparative). CKB is also recruited to specific subcellular sites, such as the cytoskeleton and synaptic vesicles, to facilitate ATP-dependent processes, including protein kinase signaling and motor protein function (Schlattner2016Cellular). 

In astrocytes, CKB enhances cell spreading and migration by co-localizing with dynamic actin structures, indicating its role in actin-driven processes (Kuiper2009Local). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the functional integrity of actin filament nucleation and elongation, impacting cell morphology and migration behavior (Kuiper2009Local).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CKB gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of breast cancer. CKB is identified as a hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) dependent target gene, and its expression is crucial for tumor outgrowth and metastasis. High levels of CKB mRNA or protein are associated with reduced relapse-free survival across all molecular subtypes of breast cancer, with a more pronounced effect in basal-like breast cancers (Krutilina2021HIFdependent). The regulation of CKB expression in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is HIF-dependent but not hypoxia-dependent, suggesting involvement of other pathways (Krutilina2021HIFdependent).

CKB expression is necessary for cell invasion and promotes tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer models. Cyclocreatine, a creatine analog, inhibits creatine kinase activity and has been shown to repress cell migration, invasion, and lung metastasis, enhancing the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy agents (Krutilina2021HIFdependent). Knockdown of CKB results in reduced intracellular ATP levels and impaired glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, indicating its essential role in maintaining energy metabolism in cancer cells (Krutilina2021HIFdependent).

In the nervous system, CKB interacts with the potassium-chloride co-transporter 3 (KCC3), and this interaction is crucial for ion transport and cell volume regulation. Disruption of this interaction due to mutations can impair ion transport, with implications for neurological conditions (SalinCantegrel2008HMSNACC).

## Interactions
Creatine kinase B (CKB) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular energy metabolism. CKB interacts with α-skeletal actin, a major actin isoform in adult mouse skeletal muscle, as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is specific to α-skeletal actin and does not occur with β-cyto-actin or γ-cyto-actin isoforms. The interaction is likely indirect, mediated by intermediary proteins (SimionescuBankston2015Creatine).

CKB also interacts with several actin-regulatory proteins, including Myc-Bin3, Myc-Septin-8, and Myc-Hsbp3, which are important for actin dynamics during myogenesis (SimionescuBankston2015Creatine). In addition, computational simulations have identified potential interacting partners for CKB, such as NFKB1, MYOC, MYOM2, FHL2, and ASB9, with NFKB1 highlighted as a hub protein (Hu2011Computational).

CKB is associated with synaptic vesicles and mitochondrial membranes, where it interacts with membrane proteins like VAMP2, VAMP3, and JWA. These interactions facilitate local ATP regeneration, crucial for processes such as ion pumping and vesicle trafficking (Schlattner2016Cellular). CKB's interaction with the potassium-chloride co-transporter 3 (KCC3) is essential for KCC3's activation, particularly under hypotonic conditions, and is disrupted in certain neuropathies (SalinCantegrel2008HMSNACC).
