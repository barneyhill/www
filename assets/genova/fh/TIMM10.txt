# TIMM10

## Overview
The TIMM10 gene encodes the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 10 (TIMM10) protein, a critical component of the mitochondrial import machinery. This protein is categorized as a chaperone and plays a pivotal role in the translocation and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane. TIMM10 functions as part of the TIM22 complex, where it forms a hexameric structure with TIMM9, characterized by a six-bladed alpha-propeller conformation. This complex is essential for maintaining precursor proteins in an import-competent state, preventing their aggregation, and facilitating their proper insertion into the mitochondrial membrane (Valpadashi2024Structural; Haastrup2023The). The structural flexibility of TIMM10, particularly in its C-terminal regions, is crucial for its interaction with precursor substrates, underscoring its importance in mitochondrial protein translocation (Valpadashi2024Structural).

## Structure
The TIMM10 protein is a component of the TIM22 complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions as a chaperone. Structurally, TIMM10 forms a hexameric complex with TIMM9, adopting a six-bladed alpha-propeller conformation. This structure consists of alternating molecules of TIMM9 and TIMM10, creating an ordered circular core with amphiphilic tentacles protruding from the center. These tentacles, particularly the C-terminal regions, exhibit significant conformational flexibility, which is crucial for interacting with precursor substrates (Valpadashi2024Structural).

The TIMM10 protein, along with TIMM9, is involved in forming a hexameric chaperone complex that assists in the transfer of precursor proteins to the TIM22 channel. This complex is essential for maintaining precursor proteins in an import-competent state, preventing aggregation, and facilitating their insertion into the inner mitochondrial membrane (Haastrup2023The).

In terms of post-translational modifications, TIMM10 may undergo phosphorylation, although specific details on this modification are not extensively covered in the provided context. The protein's interaction with other components of the TIM22 complex, such as TIM29 and AGK, suggests a role in coordinating lipid kinase function and protein import (Valpadashi2024Structural).

## Function
The TIMM10 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the mitochondrial import machinery, specifically involved in the translocation of proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane. TIMM10 functions as part of the TIM22 complex, which is responsible for inserting multi-transmembrane domain proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane (Valpadashi2024Structural). The TIM22 complex includes the TIM22 pore-forming unit and metazoan-specific components such as TIM29 and AGK, with TIMM10 playing a key role in maintaining precursor proteins in an import-competent state by preventing the aggregation of hydrophobic segments (Valpadashi2024Structural).

In humans, TIMM10 forms a hexameric complex with TIM9, which is crucial for mitochondrial protein translocation. This complex is characterized by a six-bladed alpha-propeller conformation and conformational flexibility, particularly in the C-terminal 'tentacles' that protrude from the core of the complex. This flexibility is important for interacting with precursor substrates, allowing for tight binding and subsequent release through multiple weak interactions (Valpadashi2024Structural). The TIMM10 protein is part of a hetero-oligomeric complex with TIM9 and TIM19B, and its structure includes a proline residue that induces a conformational change to aid in the release of carrier proteins to the TIM22 complex (Valpadashi2024Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TIMM10 gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, which significantly impact energy production within cells. These disorders arise because TIMM10 is essential for the proper import and insertion of proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane, a critical process for maintaining mitochondrial function. When this process is disrupted, it can result in impaired energy production, contributing to various clinical conditions.

Altered expression or interactions of TIMM10 have been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The dysfunction of mitochondria due to TIMM10 anomalies can lead to neuronal damage and degeneration, as neurons are highly dependent on efficient energy production. This connection highlights the potential role of TIMM10 in the pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a known factor.

Metabolic syndromes may also be associated with TIMM10 mutations or altered expression. The gene's role in mitochondrial function suggests that any disruption could affect metabolic processes, potentially leading to conditions characterized by metabolic imbalances. These findings underscore the importance of TIMM10 in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and its broader implications for human health.

## Interactions
TIMM10 is a crucial component of the TIM22 complex, which is involved in the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane. TIMM10 interacts with TIM9 to form a hexameric chaperone complex, which is essential for its function. This complex is stabilized by intersubunit salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions, forming a donut-shaped configuration that facilitates the transport of hydrophobic proteins through the mitochondrial intermembrane space (CehPavia2013Folding; Valpadashi2024Structural).

The TIM9-TIM10 complex also interacts with TIM12, linking it to the TIM22 translocase, which is responsible for inserting carrier proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane (CehPavia2013Folding). TIMM10 is primarily responsible for substrate binding, while TIMM9 stabilizes TIMM10 when not interacting with the substrate. This interaction is crucial for the import of proteins like the ADP/ATP Carrier (AAC) (CehPavia2013Folding).

Crosslinking mass spectrometry studies have shown that TIMM10, along with TIM9, has multiple docking sites within the TIM22 complex, indicating its role in precursor protein transfer. These interactions are essential for the assembly and stability of the TIM22 complex (Valpadashi2024Structural).
