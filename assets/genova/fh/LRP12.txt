# LRP12

## Overview
LRP12, or LDL receptor-related protein 12, is a gene that encodes a member of the LDL receptor family, specifically categorized as a receptor protein. This protein is characterized by the presence of CUB domains, which are involved in binding integrins and Golgi-associated proteins, suggesting its role in cellular adhesion and intracellular trafficking (Rey2009Wnt). LRP12 is implicated in the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical pathway for cell signaling and development, although its precise role within this pathway remains to be fully elucidated (Rey2009Wnt). Clinically, LRP12 has been associated with various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma, where alterations in its expression and methylation status have been linked to disease progression and therapy resistance (Grasse2018Epigenomic). Additionally, LRP12 is involved in inherited peripheral neuropathy, with CGG repeat expansions linked to clinical manifestations such as muscle weakness (Hobara2024Linking). Despite its recognized potential in cellular processes and disease mechanisms, further research is necessary to fully understand the diverse roles of LRP12.

## Clinical Significance
LRP12 (LDL receptor-related protein 12) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and methylation status. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LRP12 promoter hypermethylation is associated with resistance to carboplatin, a common chemotherapy drug. This hypermethylation correlates with poorer survival outcomes, making it a predictive biomarker for therapy resistance and patient prognosis (Grasse2018Epigenomic). 

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), LRP12 is identified as a putative oncogene. Its overexpression is linked to the progression of the disease, particularly in advanced pathologic stages, suggesting a role in oral tumorigenesis (VincentChong2017Genome). 

In B-cell lymphomas, LRP12 is frequently hypermethylated, which is a common feature across major types of this cancer. This methylation pattern is specific to lymphoma samples and not found in normal B cells, indicating its potential as a diagnostic marker (Bethge2014A). 

Additionally, LRP12 has been associated with breast malignant phyllodes tumors during pregnancy and lactation, where it may contribute to carcinogenesis, although its exact role in tumor formation remains unclear (Lei2022Genomic).

## Interactions
LRP12, a member of the LDL receptor family, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is part of the fourth subfamily of LDL receptors, which includes LRP3, and is characterized by the presence of CUB domains. These domains are involved in binding integrins and Golgi-associated proteins, suggesting a role in cellular adhesion and intracellular trafficking (Rey2009Wnt).

While specific interactions of LRP12 beyond its binding to integrins and Golgi-associated proteins are not detailed extensively, the protein is implicated in the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical pathway for cell signaling and development. The Wnt pathway involves multiple interactions with co-receptors and ligands, although the precise role of LRP12 in this context is not fully elucidated (Rey2009Wnt).

In the context of inherited peripheral neuropathy, LRP12 has been associated with CGG repeat expansions, which are linked to clinical manifestations such as muscle weakness and neurogenic changes. However, the specific protein interactions related to these pathological features are not detailed in the available literature (Hobara2024Linking). Overall, while LRP12 is recognized for its potential interactions, further research is needed to fully understand its role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
