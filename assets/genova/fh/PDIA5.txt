# PDIA5

## Overview
PDIA5 is a gene located on chromosome 3q21.1 that encodes the protein disulfide isomerase family A member 5, an enzyme primarily involved in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family, characterized by its multiple thioredoxin (TRX) domains, which facilitate its isomerase and chaperone-like activities. Although PDIA5 exhibits less enzymatic activity compared to other family members, it plays a crucial role in protein folding and maintaining cellular homeostasis by assisting in the oxidative folding of nascent proteins and refolding denatured proteins. PDIA5 is also involved in the activation of the transcription factor ATF6α during ER stress, highlighting its importance in cellular stress responses and protein quality control (Benham2012The; Higa2014Endoplasmic; Galligan2012The).

## Structure
PDIA5 is a protein encoded by the PDIA5 gene located on chromosome 3q21.1. The protein consists of 519 amino acids and is characterized by the presence of four thioredoxin (TRX) domains, which include three a-type and one b-like domain (Ji2024RUNX1PDIA5; Galligan2012The). The active sites within these domains are composed of specific sequences: Cys-Ser-Met-Cys, Cys-Gly-His-Cys, and Cys-Pro-His-Cys, with the second active site being the most critical for isomerase activity (Galligan2012The). PDIA5 also contains a COOH-terminal ER retention sequence (Lys-Glu-Glu-Leu) and an unverified signal sequence comprising the first 21 amino acids (Galligan2012The).

Structurally, PDIA5 is primarily located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it catalyzes protein folding and thiol-disulfide bond exchange (Ji2024RUNX1PDIA5). The N-terminal cysteine is exposed on the protein surface, facilitating redox reactions, while the C-terminal cysteine has limited exposure (Ji2024RUNX1PDIA5). PDIA5 exhibits chaperone-like activity, capable of refolding denatured proteins that lack disulfide bonds (Galligan2012The). Despite its structural features, PDIA5 shows significantly less enzymatic activity compared to other members of the protein disulfide isomerase family, such as P4HB (Galligan2012The).

## Function
PDIA5, or protein disulfide isomerase family A member 5, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds in proteins, a key process in protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Galligan2012The). This enzyme is part of the protein disulfide isomerase family, which is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control by facilitating thiol-disulfide exchange (Galligan2012The). PDIA5 is primarily active in the ER, where it assists in the oxidative folding of nascent proteins, ensuring their structural stability and function (Benham2012The).

PDIA5 contains multiple thioredoxin (TRX) domains, which are essential for its isomerase activity, although it exhibits significantly less enzymatic activity compared to other family members like P4HB (Galligan2012The). Despite this, PDIA5 also demonstrates chaperone-like activity, aiding in the refolding of denatured proteins that lack disulfide bonds (Galligan2012The). It is involved in the activation of the transcription factor ATF6α during ER stress, a process necessary for the transcriptional activation of ATF6α target genes, which are crucial for managing cellular stress responses (Higa2014Endoplasmic). PDIA5's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PDIA5 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it is often overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), high PDIA5 expression correlates with increased immune cell infiltration and poor clinical outcomes. It is linked to immune pathways and inflammatory activities, suggesting a role in regulating the tumor immune environment (Zhang2021PDIA5; Ji2024RUNX1PDIA5). PDIA5 is also involved in cancer-related signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-Akt pathway, which contributes to tumor cell malignancy and chemotherapy resistance (Ji2024RUNX1PDIA5; Chen2022PanCancer).

In addition to gliomas, PDIA5 overexpression is observed in several other cancers, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, cervical and endocervical cancers, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, where it is associated with shorter overall survival and disease-specific survival (Zhang2021PDIA5; Chen2022PanCancer). Genetic alterations such as single nucleotide variants and copy number variations in PDIA5 are also noted across various cancer types, further implicating its role in tumorigenesis (Chen2022PanCancer). These findings suggest that PDIA5 could serve as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy and a prognostic biomarker across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
PDIA5, a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In glioblastoma (GBM) cells, PDIA5 interacts with the cell division cycle and apoptosis regulator protein 1 (CCAR1). This interaction was confirmed through various assays, including subcellular immunofluorescence colocalization, bidirectional immunoprecipitation, and GST pulldown assays. PDIA5 regulates the expression of CCAR1, with its overexpression increasing CCAR1 protein levels, while suppression of PDIA5 decreases them. This interaction plays a significant role in the proliferation and invasion of GBM cells (Ji2024RUNX1PDIA5).

PDIA5 also interacts with the transcription factor ATF6α during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. It facilitates the export of ATF6α from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, a necessary step for ATF6α activation. This interaction is crucial for the survival of cancer cells under ER stress conditions, as PDIA5 influences the formation of disulfide bonds in ATF6α, affecting its oligomerization and activation (Higa2014Endoplasmic). These interactions highlight PDIA5's role in modulating cellular stress responses and tumor progression.
