# EPB41L4B

## Overview
EPB41L4B is a gene that encodes the protein erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 4B, which is a member of the FERM (Four-point-one, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) domain-containing family. This protein plays a pivotal role in linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cell shape, stability, and various cellular processes such as signal transduction and cell adhesion (Walker2018CRB3). EPB41L4B is particularly involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and the release of amphiregulin, which is crucial for cell proliferation and organization of cell polarity and motility (Schulz2010Changes; Walker2018CRB3). The gene has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including prostate cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer, where it influences cell motility, invasiveness, and proliferation (Schulz2010Changes; Li2019Differential).

## Function
EPB41L4B, also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 4B, is a member of the FERM domain-containing family, which plays a crucial role in linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. This protein is involved in maintaining cell shape and stability, as well as in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cell adhesion. In healthy human cells, EPB41L4B is primarily active in the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane regions, contributing to the structural integrity of cells (Walker2018CRB3).

EPB41L4B is essential for the regulation of vesicular trafficking and the release of amphiregulin (AREG), a process that is important for cell proliferation. It interacts with the polarity protein CRB3 to mediate changes in endocytic vesicle trafficking, which is marked by the presence of endosome and lysosome markers. This interaction enhances the secretion of AREG, which is crucial for EGF-independent cell proliferation (Walker2018CRB3).

The protein is also implicated in organizing cell polarity and motility by connecting transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. This function is particularly relevant in maintaining normal cellular architecture and facilitating responses to extracellular signals (Schulz2010Changes).

## Clinical Significance
EPB41L4B, also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 4B, has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including prostate cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer. In prostate cancer, EPB41L4B is significantly upregulated, particularly in cases with ERG overexpression, which is associated with increased cell proliferation and earlier biochemical recurrence of the disease (Schulz2010Changes). The gene's overexpression is linked to decreased cell adhesion and increased invasivity, suggesting a role in cancer cell dissemination (Schulz2010Changes).

In lung adenocarcinoma, EPB41L4B produces two transcript variants, Ehm2/1 and Ehm2/2, through alternative splicing. Ehm2/1 acts as a tumor suppressor, while Ehm2/2 promotes cancer cell invasiveness (Li2019Differential). In breast cancer, EPB41L4B is involved in the regulation of amphiregulin release and cell proliferation, particularly in estrogen receptor-negative samples, indicating its potential clinical significance (Walker2018CRB3).

EPB41L4B is also noted for its role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where its expression is negatively correlated with overall survival rates, suggesting its involvement in disease progression (Zhang2020Dysregulation). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
EPB41L4B, a FERM domain-containing protein, interacts with the intracellular domains of CRB proteins, specifically CRB1, CRB2, and CRB3. These interactions were identified using yeast two-hybrid systems and confirmed through various assays, including the GAL4-based system and the Cytotrap system (Gosens2007FERM). EPB41L4B is upregulated in response to CRB3 expression and is essential for CRB3-induced amphiregulin (AREG) release, which influences the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. This interaction is crucial for changes in cellular behavior, particularly in the trafficking of endocytic vesicles (Walker2018CRB3).

In prostate cancer, EPB41L4B, also known as EHM2, is overexpressed and associated with high migratory potential in tumor cells. It reduces the adhesion of prostate cancer cells to collagen, suggesting a role in cell motility and invasion (Schulz2010Changes). However, specific details about EPB41L4B's interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond CRB proteins are not provided in the available context. The focus is primarily on its role in cellular processes and cancer progression rather than detailed molecular interactions (Schulz2010Changes).
