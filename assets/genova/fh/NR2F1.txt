# NR2F1

## Overview
The NR2F1 gene encodes the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 1, a transcription factor belonging to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during development, particularly in the central nervous system. It is characterized by a DNA-binding domain with zinc-finger motifs and a ligand-binding domain, which facilitate its interaction with DNA and other proteins, allowing it to function as both an activator and repressor of transcription (Tocco2021Structural). NR2F1 is crucial for brain development, influencing neural progenitor proliferation, differentiation, and migration, as well as the formation of neural circuits and the visual system (Tocco2021Structural). Mutations in NR2F1 are linked to Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome (BBSOAS), highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Chen2016The; Kaiwar2017Novel).

## Structure
The NR2F1 gene encodes a transcription factor that is part of the nuclear receptor superfamily, specifically the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. The protein structure of NR2F1 includes two highly conserved domains: a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Tocco2021Structural). The DBD contains two zinc-finger motifs, which are crucial for recognizing and binding to specific DNA sequences (Tocco2021Structural). These zinc fingers are C4-type, and mutations in this domain are associated with severe clinical features in Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf Optic Atrophy Syndrome (BBSOAS) (Billiet2021NR2F1database:).

The LBD is essential for dimerization and interaction with cofactors, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation (Tocco2021Structural). The C-terminal activation domain (AF-2) within the LBD is crucial for binding cofactors, although the exact mechanism remains untested (Tocco2021Structural). NR2F1 can form homodimers or heterodimers, which influences its regulatory functions (Tocco2021Structural).

The N-terminal domain of NR2F1 is annotated as disordered, which is a common feature of proteins involved in nucleoli formation through liquid-liquid phase separation, although NR2F1 lacks typical nucleolar protein features (Bertacchi2024Unravelling). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions (Tocco2021Structural).

## Function
The NR2F1 gene, also known as COUP-TFI, encodes a transcriptional regulator that is part of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. It plays a crucial role in brain development by regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of neural progenitors and their progeny. NR2F1 influences the specification of neocortical areas and cell types, maturation of network activity, and the assembly of the visual system and corticospinal tract (Tocco2021Structural). It is involved in the development of GABAergic interneurons, which are essential for modulating the activity of excitatory pyramidal neurons, thereby maintaining the excitation/inhibition balance in the brain (Tocco2021Structural).

NR2F1 affects the expression of ion channels, such as the hyperpolarization-activated cation channel-1 (HCN1), which are important for neuronal excitability and rhythmic oscillatory activity. It also influences the structural and morphological features of neurons, such as dendrite complexity and the axon initial segment, which are critical for action potential initiation (Tocco2021Structural). In the visual system, NR2F1 ensures correct axonal guidance and connectivity from the retina to the brain, supporting normal visual processing (Tocco2021Structural). The gene's expression is crucial for the proper wiring of thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections, influencing the organization of cortical regions (Tocco2021Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NR2F1 gene are associated with Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome (BBSOAS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by optic atrophy, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and a range of other neurological symptoms such as hypotonia, seizures, and autism spectrum disorder (Chen2016The; Kaiwar2017Novel). BBSOAS is caused by NR2F1 haploinsufficiency, often due to deletions or missense point mutations, which can be de novo or inherited (Tocco2021Structural). Specific mutations in NR2F1, such as the NR2F1-R112K mutation, have been linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder, indicating that different mutations may lead to distinct clinical manifestations (Zhang2020Imbalance).

Alterations in NR2F1 expression levels are also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Dysregulation of NR2F1 can affect the expression of other genes, such as GLI3, involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is crucial for brain development and has been linked to autism spectrum disorder (Zhang2020Imbalance). Additionally, NR2F1 is identified as a tumor dormancy marker in cancer-associated fibroblasts, where its expression is associated with suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation and involvement in metastasis-related pathways (Wu2022NR2F1).

## Interactions
NR2F1, also known as COUP-TFI, is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression. It contains a DNA-binding domain with zinc-finger motifs, allowing it to bind directly to DNA at specific response elements, thereby regulating target genes involved in development and differentiation (Tocco2021Structural). NR2F1 can function as both an activator and repressor of gene expression. As an activator, it can bind to regulatory sequences or act as a co-factor with other transcription factors like Sp1. As a repressor, it can bind directly to target gene sequences with co-factors such as SMRT or N-CoR, or indirectly by sequestering proteins necessary for transcription (Tocco2021Structural).

NR2F1 also forms heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, such as the retinoid X receptor (RXR), which enhances its ability to regulate gene expression (Bertacchi2019The). The protein can recruit chromatin remodeling co-activators, leading to chromatin acetylation and gene expression, or recruit DNA methyltransferases for chromatin demethylation, depending on the cellular context (Tocco2021Structural). These interactions highlight NR2F1's versatile role in transcriptional regulation across different biological processes.
