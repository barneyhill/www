# TUBA3E

## Overview
TUBA3E is a gene that encodes the tubulin alpha 3e protein, a member of the tubulin family, which plays a critical role in the formation and function of microtubules. Microtubules are cytoskeletal structures essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. The tubulin alpha 3e protein is involved in the polymerization of tubulin dimers, contributing to the dynamic assembly and disassembly of microtubules, a process vital for cellular activities such as mitosis and intracellular trafficking (Prassanawar2019Tubulin). TUBA3E is notably expressed in the testis, indicating a potential role in the specialized functions of testicular cells (Prassanawar2019Tubulin). The diversity of tubulin isotypes, including TUBA3E, allows for specialized cellular functions and regulation by microtubule-interacting proteins, which can influence microtubule stability and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (Prassanawar2019Tubulin).

## Function
TUBA3E encodes a tubulin protein that is a key component of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular functions, including maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. The protein is involved in the polymerization of tubulin dimers, contributing to the dynamic assembly and disassembly of microtubules. This dynamic instability is crucial for cellular processes such as mitosis and intracellular trafficking (Prassanawar2019Tubulin).

The TUBA3E isotype is specifically expressed in the testis, suggesting a role in the specialized functions of testicular cells, although specific details on its function in healthy human cells are not provided (Prassanawar2019Tubulin). The diversity in tubulin isotypes, including TUBA3E, allows for specialized functions and regulation by microtubule-interacting proteins, which can influence microtubule stability and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (Prassanawar2019Tubulin).

The expression of different tubulin isotypes, such as TUBA3E, can impact microtubule function by altering growth rates and stability, which are essential for the proper execution of cellular processes like intracellular signaling and cell division (Prassanawar2019Tubulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the TUBA3E gene can have significant clinical implications. TUBA3E encodes a tubulin protein that is integral to microtubule formation, which is essential for maintaining cell structure and facilitating cell division. Disruptions in TUBA3E can impact neuronal development and function, potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders may arise due to the gene's role in critical cellular processes such as intracellular transport and mitosis, which are vital for proper neuronal function and development.

Alterations in TUBA3E expression or mutations can also be implicated in cancer. The gene's involvement in microtubule dynamics means that any disruption can affect cell division, potentially leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer. The precise mechanisms by which TUBA3E mutations contribute to these diseases are still under investigation, but the gene's role in microtubule stability and function is a key area of focus. Understanding these interactions and their disruptions could provide insights into therapeutic targets for conditions associated with TUBA3E abnormalities.
