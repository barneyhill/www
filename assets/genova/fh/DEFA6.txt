# DEFA6

## Overview
DEFA6 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin alpha 6, a member of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are integral to the innate immune system, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract. Defensin alpha 6 is predominantly expressed in the Paneth cells of the small intestine, where it contributes to the host's defense by disrupting the membranes of pathogenic microorganisms, thereby maintaining intestinal homeostasis and protecting against infections (Radeva2010Defensin; Hoffsten2023Paneth). The protein also plays a role in regulating the intestinal barrier and is involved in cellular processes related to growth and differentiation, as it is a downstream target of the Wnt signaling pathway (Radeva2010Defensin). DEFA6's expression is modulated in response to inflammation and disease, making it a potential biomarker for conditions such as Crohn's Disease and certain cancers (Nagao2023Reduced; Bao2023Predicting).

## Function
DEFA6, or defensin alpha 6, is a gene that encodes an antimicrobial peptide involved in the innate immune system, primarily active in the small intestine. This protein is expressed in the secretory granules of Paneth cells, which are located in the small intestine and colon. DEFA6 contributes to an antimicrobial shield by disrupting the membrane integrity of pathogens, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining gut microbiota balance and protecting against infections (Radeva2010Defensin; Hoffsten2023Paneth).

In healthy human cells, DEFA6 is involved in protecting the intestinal barrier by regulating tight junctions and activating the intestinal immune system against bacterial lipopolysaccharides. This function is essential for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal lining and preventing the invasion of harmful microorganisms (Hoffsten2023Paneth). DEFA6 is also a downstream target of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is active during the earliest stages of cancer development, indicating its role in cellular processes related to growth and differentiation (Radeva2010Defensin).

The expression of DEFA6 is typically elevated in chronically inflamed colon tissues, suggesting its involvement in the body's response to inflammation and its potential as a diagnostic marker for certain intestinal conditions (Radeva2010Defensin).

## Clinical Significance
DEFA6 (defensin alpha 6) is implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in the immune response within the intestinal tract. In Crohn's Disease (CD), DEFA6 is significantly up-regulated in colon tissues and serves as a diagnostic biomarker, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.920, indicating high diagnostic accuracy (Bao2023Predicting). The gene is associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly neutrophils, which are crucial in the pathogenesis of CD (Bao2023Predicting). A decrease in DEFA6 levels in non-inflammatory jejunal tissue of CD patients may be linked to mucosal barrier disorders, highlighting its role in maintaining intestinal integrity (Bao2023Predicting).

In ileal Crohn's Disease, DEFA6 levels are reduced, which is associated with a functional variant in the Wnt co-receptor LRP6. This variant impairs LRP6 activity, leading to diminished expression of DEFA6 and other antimicrobial peptides, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Koslowski2012Association). The downregulation of DEFA6 has also been observed in early submucosal-invasive gastric cancer, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Nagao2023Reduced). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DEFA6 in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.
