# CCNI

## Overview
Cyclin I, encoded by the CCNI gene, is a member of the cyclin family of proteins, which are primarily known for their role in regulating the cell cycle. Unlike many other cyclins, Cyclin I is predominantly expressed in postmitotic tissues such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, where it plays a crucial role in synaptic signaling, neuron development, and migration (Żuryń2021The). Structurally, Cyclin I features a classic cyclin box in its N-terminal domain and a PEST sequence in its C-terminal domain, which are essential for its function (Żuryń2021The). Functionally, Cyclin I interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), forming a complex that is vital for neuronal survival and stress response mechanisms (Quandt2020Atypical; Żuryń2021The). Additionally, Cyclin I is involved in regulating apoptosis through its interaction with the p21Cip1/Waf1 protein, highlighting its protective role in certain cell types (Chu2012Folding). The gene's expression and interactions have significant implications in cancer biology, particularly in the context of drug resistance and cell proliferation (Quandt2020Atypical; Gasa2017A).

## Structure
Cyclin I, encoded by the CCNI gene, is a protein consisting of 377 amino acids with a molecular weight of 42.6 kDa. It features a classic cyclin structure, including a 'cyclin box' in the N-terminal domain and a PEST sequence in the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain shares structural similarities with cyclins G and E, while the C-terminal domain is similar to cyclin G (Żuryń2021The).

Cyclin I is primarily a helical protein, as revealed by circular dichroism spectra, but it lacks intra-molecular tertiary interactions, a characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (Chu2012Folding). This suggests that while it has a defined secondary structure, its tertiary structure may be less rigid, allowing for flexibility in its interactions.

Cyclin I can directly bind to p21 cip1/waf1, and this interaction requires calcium ions, indicating a potential regulatory role in cellular processes (Chu2012Folding). The protein is highly expressed in postmitotic tissues such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, and it plays roles in synaptic signaling, neuron development, and migration (Żuryń2021The). There is no detailed information available on its quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
Cyclin I, encoded by the CCNI gene, is a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in postmitotic tissues such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. It is characterized by a classic cyclin structure, including a 'cyclin box' in the N-terminal domain and a PEST sequence in the C-terminal domain, which are crucial for its function (Żuryń2021The). Cyclin I binds to and activates Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent kinase essential for synaptic signaling, neuron development, and migration in postmitotic neurons (Żuryń2021The). This interaction is vital for neuronal survival and stress response mechanisms.

Cyclin I is also involved in regulating the p21Cip1/Waf1 inhibitor, which interacts with procaspase-3 to prevent apoptosis, thereby playing a protective role in podocytes and preventing kidney diseases (Żuryń2021The). In the context of cell cycle regulation, cyclin I has been linked to cell cycle progression, particularly in the S and G2/M phases, despite initial beliefs that it was not involved in cell cycle regulation (Żuryń2021The). Cyclin I's expression remains constant during cell cycle progression in postmitotic tissues, distinguishing it from other cyclins (Chu2012Folding).

## Clinical Significance
Cyclin I (CCNI) is implicated in various cancers, notably lung and cervical cancer. In lung cancer, CCNI is overexpressed, leading to increased cell proliferation and decreased overall survival. Its expression is higher in lung cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and it localizes to the nuclear membrane of tumor cells. This overexpression is associated with a modest decrease in sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin, gefitinib, and paclitaxel, suggesting a role in drug resistance (Quandt2020Atypical; Gasa2017A).

In cervical cancer, CCNI overexpression increases resistance to cisplatin, both in vitro and in vivo. This resistance is linked to its antiapoptotic activity, which requires CDK5 expression (Quandt2020Atypical). The gene's role in drug resistance is not limited to a specific chemical structure, indicating the involvement of multidrug resistance proteins (Gasa2017A).

CCNI's interaction with CDK5 is crucial, as it may regulate cell cycle progression and influence cancer pathogenesis. The homolog CCNI2 also activates CDK5 but retains it in different cellular locations, suggesting that CCNI and CCNI2 may compete for CDK5 binding, affecting its subcellular localization and function (Quandt2020Atypical).

## Interactions
Cyclin I (CCNI) is known to interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), forming a complex that plays a crucial role in neuronal survival and stress responses. This interaction is significant for synaptic signaling, neuron development, and migration in postmitotic neurons (Quandt2020Atypical; Żuryń2021The). Cyclin I also binds to the p21Cip1/Waf1 protein, an interaction that is facilitated by the presence of calcium ions. This binding is thought to regulate the activity of p21, potentially rescuing cells from apoptosis (Chu2012Folding).

In cancer cells, CCNI is associated with increased proliferative activity and angiogenesis. Its overexpression has been linked to resistance to chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin in cervical cancer, where its antiapoptotic activity requires CDK5 expression (Quandt2020Atypical). Although CCNI was identified as a potential candidate for interaction with CDK16 in initial screenings, detailed studies focused on other cyclins, and specific interactions with CDK16 were not confirmed (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent).

Overall, CCNI's interactions with CDK5 and p21Cip1/Waf1 highlight its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, particularly in neuronal and cancer cell contexts.
