# CCDC81

## Overview
CCDC81 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 81, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to microtubule dynamics and ciliary function. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal CCDC81 domain and several EF-hand domain pairs at the C-terminus, which suggest a role in calcium regulation and interactions with microtubules (Legal2023Molecular). CCDC81 is identified as a CP cap protein, potentially regulating microtubule polymerization and contributing to the assembly or stability of the ciliary cap complex (Legal2023Molecular). The gene has been implicated in several diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and eosinophilic esophagitis, and is associated with differential methylation in certain cancers, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Goldstein2019Rare; Kottyan2020The; CastroOropeza2022Epigenetic). Despite these associations, further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional roles and clinical implications of CCDC81.

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC81 gene has been implicated in several diseases through genetic studies. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rare loss-of-function variant in the CCDC81 gene was identified among North African Jewish ALS patients, suggesting a potential role of recessive variants in the disease's genetics (Goldstein2019Rare). However, specific diseases directly associated with mutations in CCDC81 beyond this context are not well-documented.

In eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), the CCDC81 gene is associated with the 11q14.2 risk locus. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs118086209, has been linked to EoE, with a significant odds ratio of 2.19, indicating a strong association with the disease (Kottyan2020The; Zhernov2021Molecular).

Additionally, CCDC81 has been identified as a differentially methylated region in HPV-positive cancers, including anal carcinoma and cervical cancer. These methylation changes may serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, although the direct impact of CCDC81 alterations in these cancers requires further investigation (CastroOropeza2022Epigenetic).

Overall, while CCDC81 is associated with certain conditions, its precise clinical significance and the mechanisms by which it contributes to these diseases remain areas of active research.

## Interactions
CCDC81 is involved in interactions with microtubules, likely due to its structural domains. The protein contains an N-terminal CCDC81 domain and several EF-hand domain pairs in the C-terminus, which suggest a role in calcium regulation and potential interactions with microtubules (Legal2023Molecular). Although parts of the microtubule-binding domain of its homolog IJ34 are missing in CCDC81, it is still considered likely to bind microtubules (Legal2023Molecular). CCDC81 is identified as a CP cap protein, potentially acting as a regulator of microtubule polymerization, which indicates its involvement in the assembly or stability of the ciliary cap complex (Legal2023Molecular).

The protein is also implicated in the regulation of A- and B-tubule lengths, suggesting its role in maintaining the structural integrity of cilia (Legal2023Molecular). However, specific details on the physical interactions of CCDC81 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the available context. The absence of CCDC81 in certain mutants suggests its involvement in the ciliary tip complex, but further research is needed to elucidate its precise interactions and functions (Legal2023Molecular).
