# OGFOD3

## Overview
OGFOD3 is a gene that encodes the protein 2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenase domain containing 3, which is part of the 2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenase family. This family of enzymes is known for its role in catalyzing hydroxylation reactions, which are critical for various post-translational modifications, including proline hydroxylation. These modifications can significantly impact protein stability and function. The OGFOD3 protein is involved in essential cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, cellular stress responses, and collagen biosynthesis, operating in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of healthy human cells. Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, growth, and survival, particularly in response to environmental changes and hypoxic conditions (Jia2017Largescale; England2017Genomic; Kornsuthisopon2024Human).

## Structure


## Function
OGFOD3, a member of the 2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenase family, is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in hydroxylation reactions. These enzymes are crucial for post-translational modifications, such as proline hydroxylation, which can affect protein stability and function. OGFOD3 is implicated in cellular stress responses and may influence gene expression and protein synthesis, contributing to cellular homeostasis and adaptation to environmental changes (Jia2017Largescale; England2017Genomic).

In healthy human cells, OGFOD3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a role in transcriptional regulation and cellular stress responses. Its activity is essential for maintaining cell growth and survival, impacting processes like hypoxia response and collagen biosynthesis (Jia2017Largescale; Kornsuthisopon2024Human). The protein's involvement in these pathways suggests it may have a significant role in influencing gene expression and protein stability, thereby affecting overall cellular function and organismal outcomes (Papadopoulou2019Signal; Kornsuthisopon2024Human).

## Clinical Significance
The OGFOD3 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in cellular oxygen sensing and metabolism. In survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL), genetic variants in OGFOD3, particularly the common variant rs62079523, have been associated with dyslipidemia, a condition characterized by abnormal lipid levels in the blood. This association suggests that OGFOD3 may contribute to the risk of developing cardiometabolic complications in this population (England2017Genomic).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alternative splicing events involving OGFOD3 have been linked to tumor relapse. Specifically, low expression of the OGFOD3-44325-AD splicing variant correlates with poor relapse-free survival, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker for HCC (Chen2022A).

Additionally, copy number variations involving OGFOD3 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. A duplication in the 17q25.3 region, which includes OGFOD3, has been linked to autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, and intellectual disability, although the specific contribution of OGFOD3 to these conditions remains unclear (Sahajpal202317q25.3).

## Interactions
OGFOD3, a member of the 2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenase family, has been implicated in various cellular processes, although specific protein interactions are not extensively detailed in the literature. The gene has been associated with dyslipidemia in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors, with the variant rs62079523 showing significant association in genetic studies (England2017Genomic).

In terms of protein interactions, OGFOD3 is affected by the expression of Signal peptide peptidase-like 2c (SPPL2c). SPPL2c expression in cells leads to a decrease in the secretion and maturation of OGFOD3, suggesting that SPPL2c may influence the subcellular trafficking or degradation of OGFOD3 (Papadopoulou2019Signal). This interaction indicates that OGFOD3 may be involved in vesicular transport processes, although the exact nature of its interactions with other proteins remains unclear.

OGFOD3 has also been identified in studies examining the co-expression and functional enrichment of genes related to the PLOD family in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting potential involvement in processes like protein hydroxylation and collagen biosynthesis (Yang2020Identification). However, specific protein interactions in these contexts are not detailed.
