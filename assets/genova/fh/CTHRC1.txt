# CTHRC1

## Overview
CTHRC1, or collagen triple helix repeat containing 1, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including tissue remodeling, bone formation, and cancer progression. The CTHRC1 protein is characterized by its collagen-like domain, which facilitates trimerization and interaction with other proteins, particularly within the Wnt signaling pathway. It acts as a modulator of extracellular matrix composition and cell motility, influencing processes such as osteoblastic differentiation and collagen deposition. CTHRC1's role in inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway and its interactions with microRNAs highlight its regulatory functions in cellular signaling. Clinically, aberrant expression of CTHRC1 is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (He2018CTHRC1; Yamamoto2008Cthrc1; Kimura2008Cthrc1; LeClair2007Cthrc1).

## Structure
The CTHRC1 protein is a secreted, glycosylated protein with a molecular weight of approximately 28 kDa. It is highly conserved across species and contains a leucine-rich hydrophobic signal peptide at the N-terminus, which facilitates its secretion (Liu2023CTHRC1; Pyagay2005Collagen). The protein features a short collagen-like domain with 12 Gly-X-Y repeats, which is responsible for its trimerization and susceptibility to collagenase cleavage (Pyagay2005Collagen). 

CTHRC1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can reduce its molecular weight by approximately 4 kDa when treated with N-glycosidase F (Pyagay2005Collagen). The protein contains 10 cysteine residues, contributing to its tertiary structure through disulfide bonds (Pyagay2005Collagen). Under nonreducing conditions, CTHRC1 appears as 50 and 75 kDa bands, while under reducing conditions, it runs as a 28 kDa band, indicating potential trimerization (Pyagay2005Collagen). 

The presence of multiple molecular weight forms of CTHRC1 suggests potential splice variant isoforms, although specific isoforms are not detailed (Liu2023CTHRC1). The protein's structure and modifications are crucial for its role in signaling transductions and tissue remodeling.

## Function
The CTHRC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various physiological processes, particularly in bone formation and tissue remodeling. In bone biology, CTHRC1 acts as a positive regulator of osteoblastic bone formation. It stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells and osteoblasts, enhancing bone formation without affecting osteoclastic bone resorption (Kimura2008Cthrc1). This function is crucial for maintaining bone mass and has potential implications for osteoporosis treatment, as it promotes bone formation while not influencing bone resorption, a common limitation of current therapies (Kimura2008Cthrc1).

CTHRC1 is also involved in the regulation of collagen expression and cell migration. It inhibits transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling, which is associated with collagen synthesis, thereby reducing collagen deposition in smooth muscle cells (LeClair2007Cthrc1). This inhibition is achieved by blocking the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, a key step in the TGF-β signaling pathway (LeClair2007Cthrc1). The protein's ability to modulate extracellular matrix composition and enhance cell motility is relevant in tissue repair and remodeling processes (Pyagay2005Collagen). CTHRC1 is active in the extracellular space and is involved in signaling pathways like Wnt, impacting cell proliferation and differentiation (Liu2023CTHRC1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CTHRC1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often correlates with poor prognosis and aggressive disease characteristics. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CTHRC1 overexpression is associated with increased tumor invasion and metastasis through the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases MMP7 and MMP9, leading to poor survival outcomes (He2018CTHRC1). Similarly, in colorectal cancer (CRC), CTHRC1 is linked to peritoneal carcinomatosis and poor clinical prognosis, interacting with the TGF-β and Wnt pathways to promote metastasis (Tan2013CTHRC1).

In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), high CTHRC1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Meng2022CTHRC1; Pang2022Application). CTHRC1 is also implicated in liver and renal cancers, where its overexpression correlates with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival (Peng2021Pancancer). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CTHRC1 promotes angiogenesis by upregulating VEGF expression, contributing to poor prognosis (Chen2019High).

CTHRC1's involvement in cancer is further supported by its association with immune cell infiltration and its potential as a therapeutic target across various cancer types (Peng2021Pancancer).

## Interactions
CTHRC1 (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence multiple signaling pathways. It interacts with components of the Wnt signaling pathway, forming complexes with Wnt proteins, Frizzled (Fzd) receptors, and the coreceptor Ror2. This interaction enhances the binding of Wnt proteins to their receptors, selectively activating the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway while suppressing the canonical Wnt pathway (Yamamoto2008Cthrc1). CTHRC1 binds to both canonical Wnt proteins, such as Wnt3a, and noncanonical Wnt proteins, such as Wnt5a and Wnt11, and interacts with Fzd proteins like Fzd3, Fzd5, and Fzd6 (Yamamoto2008Cthrc1).

CTHRC1 also plays a role in the TGF-β signaling pathway, where it can modulate the pathway through a negative feedback loop by affecting Smad2/3 phosphorylation (Mei2020The; Liu2023CTHRC1). In the context of cancer, CTHRC1 interacts with microRNAs such as miR-30c, miR-9, and miR-520d-5p, which regulate its expression and influence tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration (Mei2020The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CTHRC1 in cellular signaling and its potential impact on disease progression.
