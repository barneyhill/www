# PSMG4

## Overview
PSMG4 is a gene that encodes the protein proteasome assembly chaperone 4, which is integral to the assembly and maturation of the 20S proteasome, a core component of the proteasome complex. This protein functions as a chaperone, facilitating the correct folding and assembly of proteasome subunits, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular functions. The proteasome assembly chaperone 4 is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process vital for cellular health, as it prevents the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins that can lead to various diseases, including metabolic, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disorders (Sadovnick2017Genetic). PSMG4 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to processes such as cell cycle regulation and stress responses (Wang2020Exploring). Additionally, PSMG4 has been implicated in disease-related pathways, including its association with the HSP90/PI3K/AKT/Wnt signaling pathway in lung adenocarcinoma and its potential role in immune response modulation in benign prostatic hyperplasia (Zhu2024SRD5A2; Xuan2023Prognostic).

## Function
PSMG4, or proteasome assembly chaperone 4, plays a critical role in the assembly and maturation of the 20S proteasome, a core component of the proteasome complex responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular functions. PSMG4 functions as a chaperone, facilitating the correct folding and assembly of proteasome subunits, which is crucial for the degradation of damaged or misfolded proteins that can accumulate during metabolic, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases (Sadovnick2017Genetic).

In healthy human cells, PSMG4 is involved in the assembly of the 26S proteasome, which is important for mediating ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. This process is vital for the degradation of proteins such as myelin basic protein (MBP), which is a major autoantigen in multiple sclerosis (MS) (Sadovnick2017Genetic). PSMG4 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to processes like cell cycle regulation and stress responses (Wang2020Exploring). The proper function of PSMG4 is essential for preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful proteins, thereby maintaining cellular health and function (Sadovnick2017Genetic).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PSMG4, also known as proteasome assembly chaperone 4, plays a crucial role in the assembly of the human 20S proteasome. It interacts with other proteasome subunits and chaperones to facilitate the assembly process. PSMG4 is involved in the early stages of proteasome assembly, interacting with proteasome subunits and chaperones such as PAC3 and PAC4 (PSMG3 and PSMG4) (Adolf2024Visualizing). These interactions are essential for stabilizing assembly intermediates and ensuring the proper formation of the proteasome complex.

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PSMG4 is associated with the HSP90/PI3K/AKT/Wnt signaling pathway, indicating its involvement in tumor progression. Silencing PSMG4 in LUAD cell lines results in decreased expression of HSP90AA1, a marker related to HSP90, suggesting a regulatory interaction between PSMG4 and components of this pathway (Xuan2023Prognostic).

PSMG4 also shows interactions in the context of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), where it is negatively correlated with T-cell co-inhibition, indicating a potential role in immune response modulation (Zhu2024SRD5A2). These interactions highlight PSMG4's multifaceted role in both proteasome assembly and disease-related pathways.
