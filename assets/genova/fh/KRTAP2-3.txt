# KRTAP2-3

## Overview
KRTAP2-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 2-3, a member of the KAP2 family, which is integral to the structural composition of human hair. The protein is characterized by a high cysteine content, facilitating the formation of disulfide bonds that are essential for the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human). KRTAP2-3 is primarily expressed in the differentiated portion of the hair cortex, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to form a robust and compact hair structure (Rogers2006Human). While the gene has been studied in the context of certain genetic variations, its direct clinical significance remains uncertain, with some studies suggesting a potential role in cytoskeletal dynamics (Chang2014The; Norling2014Identification).

## Structure
The KRTAP2-3 protein is a member of the KAP2 family, which is characterized by a high degree of homology among its members, with over 97% identity. These proteins are approximately 13.5 kDa in size and have a high cysteine content, ranging from 27.3-28.1 mol %, which is crucial for the formation of disulfide bonds that contribute to the protein's structural stability (Rogers2006Human). The primary structure of KRTAP2-3 includes repetitive sequences that are common in keratin-associated proteins, influencing their secondary and tertiary structures. The protein also contains several dimeric cysteine-containing pentameric repeat structures, with serine, threonine, proline, or valine often occupying positions 4-5 of these pentamers (Rogers2006Human).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, affecting the protein's function and stability, although specific modifications for KRTAP2-3 are not detailed in the available context. The major differences among KAP2 proteins, including KRTAP2-3, are found in the 5' and 3' noncoding regions of their respective genes, which may influence their expression and regulation (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP2-3, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, plays a significant role in the structure and function of human hair. This protein is primarily expressed in the differentiated portion of the hair cortex, where it contributes to the formation of a hard and compact hair fiber through multiple cross-linkings with keratin intermediate filaments (Rogers2006Human). The KAP2 family, to which KRTAP2-3 belongs, is characterized by a high sulfur content, with cysteine making up 27.3-28.1 mol % of the protein. This high sulfur content is crucial for the cross-linking process that provides mechanical strength and resilience to hair fibers (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP2-3 is involved in the cross-linking of hair keratins, which is essential for the structural integrity of hair. The protein's expression is absent in the proliferative cell matrix compartment, the inner root sheath, the outer root sheath, and the medulla, indicating its specific role in the hair cortex (Rogers2006Human). The presence of dimeric cysteine-containing pentameric repeat structures in KRTAP2-3 suggests its involvement in forming a stable matrix with keratin filaments, influencing hair texture and quality (Rogers2006Human).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the KRTAP2-3 gene, which is part of the keratin-associated protein family, remains uncertain in relation to specific diseases. A study identified a 9 kb deletion encompassing the KRTAP2-3 and KRTAP2-4 genes in patients with secondary amenorrhea (SA) and primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). However, the presence of this deletion in control subjects suggests it might be a normal variant in the Swedish population, casting doubt on its direct causative role in these conditions (Norling2014Identification). A potentially damaging amino acid substitution in the KRTAP2-3 gene was also found in some patients, but its presence in a control subject further complicates its clinical relevance (Norling2014Identification).

The gene has been implicated in cytoskeletal dynamics, with studies showing its upregulation in response to actin cytoskeleton perturbation in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells. This suggests a role in maintaining cell structure, although the direct clinical implications of this function are not fully understood (Chang2014The). Overall, while KRTAP2-3 is associated with certain genetic variations, its direct link to specific diseases remains to be conclusively established.
