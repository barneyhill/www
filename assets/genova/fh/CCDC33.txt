# CCDC33

## Overview
CCDC33, or coiled-coil domain containing 33, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains. These domains are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC33 may play a role in cellular organization and communication. The protein is implicated in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is crucial for cell movement and signaling, particularly in tissues such as the testis and potentially the Fallopian tubes (Vandenbrouck2020The). CCDC33 is classified as a cancer/testis antigen, with expression primarily in germ cells, indicating a potential role in spermatogenesis (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil). Additionally, alterations in CCDC33 expression have been associated with various diseases, including diabetic pancreatic cancer and Huntington's disease, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Jiang2021Label; Yao2017A). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the diverse roles of CCDC33 in cellular and disease contexts.

## Function
CCDC33 is a protein that may play a role in ciliogenesis, which is the process of cilia formation and function. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that are involved in movement and signaling. The involvement of CCDC33 in ciliogenesis suggests it may be important for the formation and function of cilia in tissues where it is expressed, such as the testis and potentially the Fallopian tubes (Vandenbrouck2020The). 

In the context of male reproductive physiology, CCDC33 is classified as a cancer/testis gene, with expression primarily restricted to germ cells. This indicates a potential role in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development, although specific functions in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil). 

The protein's expression pattern and potential involvement in ciliary processes suggest that CCDC33 may contribute to cellular organization and communication, impacting cell shape and movement. However, further research is needed to confirm these functional hypotheses and to provide a more comprehensive understanding of CCDC33's roles in cellular and organismal biology (Vandenbrouck2020The).

## Clinical Significance
CCDC33 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of diabetic pancreatic cancer (PaC), CCDC33 is identified as a cancer/testis antigen and is up-regulated in diabetic PaC patients. This up-regulation is suggested to contribute to disease progression, potentially acting as an oncogene. The study by Yao et al. proposes that the overexpression of the long non-coding RNA HOTAIR represses miR-214, leading to increased CCDC33 expression, which may be a mechanism in diabetic PaC progression (Yao2017A).

In Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, the expression of CCDC33 is significantly altered during disease progression. This alteration is part of a broader change in gene expression affecting pathways such as TGF-beta signaling and immune response, which are crucial in the disease's molecular pathogenesis (Jiang2019Label; Jiang2021Label).

CCDC33 is also mentioned in the context of 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, where it may play a role in immune function by interacting with the ISLR2 gene, although specific diseases directly associated with CCDC33 mutations are not well-documented (Zhang2021Molecular).
