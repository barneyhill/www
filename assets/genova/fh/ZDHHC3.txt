# ZDHHC3

## Overview
ZDHHC3 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 3, commonly referred to as GODZ. This protein is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases, characterized by the presence of a DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) cysteine-rich domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Zmuda2020Regulatory; Korycka2012Human). ZDHHC3 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the post-translational modification of proteins through palmitoylation, a process that involves the addition of palmitate to cysteine residues. This modification is crucial for regulating protein localization, stability, and function (Jiang2018Protein; Korycka2012Human). The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation and S-acylation, which influence its interactions with various substrates, including the GABA A receptor γ2 subunit and the G protein α subunit (Gαq) (Zmuda2020Regulatory; Korycka2012Human). ZDHHC3's role in cellular signaling and vesicular trafficking underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis, including cancer (Jiang2018Protein; Kinney2017ZDHHC3).

## Structure
The ZDHHC3 protein, also known as GODZ, is a Golgi-localized palmitoyltransferase involved in the S-acylation of various proteins. It contains a DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) cysteine-rich domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain is part of a zinc-finger-like motif that coordinates zinc ions, maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme (Zmuda2020Regulatory; Korycka2012Human). The protein is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains, typically four or more, with the DHHC domain located between the second and third transmembrane regions (Korycka2012Human).

ZDHHC3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and S-acylation, which regulate its activity and interactions. Phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, such as Tyr 18, Tyr 295, and Tyr 297, affects its interaction with substrates like neuronal cell adhesion molecules (Zmuda2020Regulatory). S-acylation, particularly on cysteine residues involved in zinc coordination, can influence the enzyme's structure and function (Zmuda2020Regulatory).

The protein's tertiary structure likely includes a tepee-like arrangement of transmembrane domains, similar to other zDHHC enzymes, which accommodates the acyl chain of acyl-CoA (Zmuda2020Regulatory). However, specific details about the quaternary structure of ZDHHC3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ZDHHC3, also known as GODZ, is a palmitoyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through palmitoylation, which involves the addition of palmitate to cysteine residues. This modification affects protein localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC3 is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in the palmitoylation of various proteins, including the GABA A receptor γ2 subunit, which influences receptor sorting and trafficking (Jiang2018Protein; Korycka2012Human).

ZDHHC3 also palmitoylates the G protein α subunit (Gαq), facilitating its shuttling between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane, which is essential for signal transduction (Korycka2012Human). It is involved in the palmitoylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and PSD-95, impacting cellular signaling pathways (Jiang2018Protein). The enzyme's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its interaction with substrates and other proteins (Zmuda2020Regulatory).

ZDHHC3's broad substrate specificity allows it to interact with both cytoplasmic and integral membrane proteins, playing a significant role in vesicular trafficking and cellular signaling (Jiang2018Protein). Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ZDHHC3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast and pancreatic cancer. In breast cancer, particularly among African American women, ZDHHC3 gene alterations such as amplifications, deletions, and missense mutations are associated with decreased survival rates. Patients with these alterations have significantly shorter overall survival compared to those without, suggesting that ZDHHC3 could serve as a biomarker for breast cancer survival (Kinney2017ZDHHC3). Elevated expression of ZDHHC3 is also linked to reduced survival in breast cancer patients and is associated with tumor growth and metastasis. Ablation of ZDHHC3 in breast cancer models leads to increased oxidative stress and senescence, which are linked to tumor suppression (Sharma2017Protein).

In pancreatic cancer, high ZDHHC3 expression is associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and poor clinical outcomes. It correlates with downregulation of MHC protein complex-related genes and chemokines critical for CD8+ T cell recruitment, suggesting impaired antigen presentation. Knockdown of ZDHHC3 in pancreatic cancer models has been shown to slow tumor growth and enhance anti-tumor immunity, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2023RETRACTED).

## Interactions
ZDHHC3, also known as DHHC3 or GODZ, is a palmitoyltransferase that interacts with various proteins, influencing their localization and function through palmitoylation. It is known to palmitoylate the cysteine-string protein (CSP), which leads to its stable membrane attachment (Korycka2012Human). ZDHHC3 also interacts with the GABA A receptor γ2 subunit, affecting its sorting to distinct trafficking vesicles (Korycka2012Human). Additionally, it palmitoylates PSD-95, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and the G protein α subunit (Gαq), which is crucial for the shuttling of Gαq between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane (Korycka2012Human).

In the context of cancer, ZDHHC3 interacts with SLC9A2 in kidney clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), regulating its S-palmitoylation and membrane localization, which in turn affects cell apoptosis (Zhang2024zDHHC3-mediated). ZDHHC3 also plays a role in the palmitoylation of integrin subunits α6 and β4, which is critical for their function, expression, and stability, impacting cellular processes like signaling and matrix remodeling (Sharma2012Palmitoylation). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of ZDHHC3 in cellular signaling and disease progression.
