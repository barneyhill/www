# NNT

## Overview
NNT, or nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein, also named nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, functions as a transmembrane enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular redox balance and energy metabolism. It facilitates the transfer of hydride ions from NADH to NADP+, thereby generating NADPH, which is crucial for detoxifying reactive oxygen species and supporting biosynthetic processes (Meimaridou2018NNT; Yin2012Silencing). The NNT protein is structured as a homodimer, with each monomer comprising three domains that contribute to its function in proton translocation and hydride transfer (Metherell2016Three‐Dimensional). Mutations in the NNT gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including familial glucocorticoid deficiency and cardiomyopathy, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis (Bainbridge2015Loss; Jazayeri2015A).

## Structure
The human nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining redox balance. It is an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane and functions as a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of three domains: the NAD(H) binding domain (domain I), the transmembrane domain (domain II), and the NADP(H) binding domain (domain III) (Metherell2016Three‐Dimensional). 

Domain I spans residues 1-474 and is located in the mitochondrial matrix, containing a predicted mitochondrial targeting peptide and the NAD binding site. It features a beta-alpha-beta fold typical for domains binding dinucleotide coenzymes, with a consensus sequence Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly (Metherell2016Three‐Dimensional). Domain II, spanning residues 475-880, includes a proton translocation canal formed by 14 transmembrane α helices, crucial for proton translocation (Metherell2016Three‐Dimensional). Domain III, spanning residues 881-1086, contains the NADP binding site and is involved in hydride transfer (Metherell2016Three‐Dimensional).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a functional three-dimensional shape, with domain III showing significant conformational mobility, allowing it to swivel and facilitate communication with the other domains (Zhang2017ProtonTranslocating). The quaternary structure of NNT is an asymmetric homodimer, with domain I homodimerization sites identified using E. coli as a template (Metherell2016Three‐Dimensional).

## Function
Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox balance and energy metabolism. It catalyzes the transfer of hydride ions from NADH to NADP+, generating NADPH, which is essential for detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) through antioxidant systems like glutathione and thioredoxin (Meimaridou2018NNT; Yin2012Silencing). This process is vital for protecting cells from oxidative stress and supporting biosynthetic reactions (Ho2017Nicotinamide).

NNT's activity is linked to mitochondrial energy metabolism by maintaining the NADH/NAD+ balance, which is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production (Yin2012Silencing). It also influences the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis, affecting cellular energy production and metabolic flexibility (Ho2017Nicotinamide). In healthy cells, NNT helps regulate mitochondrial membrane potential and energy transduction, ensuring efficient energy production and redox regulation (Yin2012Silencing).

NNT's function is integral to cellular homeostasis, influencing redox-sensitive signaling pathways and maintaining the balance of pyridine adenine dinucleotide pools, which can impact protein acetylation and transcriptional regulation (Ho2017Nicotinamide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NNT gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the adrenal glands and cardiovascular system. One of the main disorders linked to NNT mutations is familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD), an autosomal recessive condition characterized by low cortisol levels despite elevated adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels. NNT mutations account for approximately 5-10% of FGD cases, leading to symptoms such as hypoglycemia, lethargy, and hyperpigmentation (Metherell2016Three‐Dimensional; Jazayeri2015A). 

NNT mutations can also result in primary adrenal insufficiency, which may present with severe hypoglycemia and salt wasting. These mutations often lead to oxidative stress due to impaired detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria (RoucherBoulez2016NNT; Ferreux2023Testicular). 

In addition to adrenal-related disorders, NNT mutations have been implicated in left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), a form of cardiomyopathy characterized by a spongy myocardium. This condition is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and is supported by studies in zebrafish models (Bainbridge2015Loss). 

Overall, NNT mutations can lead to a range of disorders due to their impact on mitochondrial function and redox balance.

## Interactions
Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial metabolism. NNT is an integral membrane protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a role in maintaining the NADPH:NADP+ ratio, which is essential for mitochondrial antioxidant capacity and the function of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins (Ward2019NNT). NNT interacts with the electron transport chain (ETC) by providing reducing power to protect the integrity of Fe-S clusters, which are sensitive to oxidation (Ward2019NNT). 

The enzyme's activity is influenced by the interactions between its domains, particularly the dII-dIII interface, which is crucial for nucleotide exchange. The binding of domain II to domain III allows NADP+ to insert into the proton channel, a process regulated by the protonation state of a key histidine residue (Kampjut2019Structure). 

NNT also participates in a redox cycle with pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), consuming NADH to generate NADPH, which is used to detoxify hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of PDH catalysis (Ward2019NNT). These interactions highlight NNT's role in maintaining mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis.
