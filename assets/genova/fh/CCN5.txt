# CCN5

## Overview
CCN5, also known as WISP2, is a gene that encodes the protein cellular communication network factor 5, a member of the CCN family of matricellular proteins. This protein is characterized by its unique structural composition, which includes an insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) domain, a von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) domain, but notably lacks the C-terminal cysteine-knot (CK) domain found in other CCN proteins (Jia2021CCN; Monsen2023Structural). The absence of the CK domain influences the protein's functional properties, making the TSP1 domain more accessible for interactions that are crucial for its biological activities (Monsen2023Structural). CCN5 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, adhesion, and migration, and plays a significant role in modulating signaling pathways such as the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway. It acts as a transcriptional repressor, particularly in the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and is implicated in the suppression of tumor progression and invasiveness (Sabbah2011CCN5). The protein's interactions with integrin receptors and its role in inhibiting CCN2-induced signaling further underscore its importance in cellular communication and regulation (Monsen2023Structural; Kaddour2019Recombinant).

## Structure
CCN5, also known as WISP2, is a member of the CCN family of matricellular proteins. It is characterized by the presence of three structural domains: an insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) domain, a von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) domain. Notably, CCN5 lacks the C-terminal cysteine-knot (CK) domain found in other CCN proteins, which influences its structural configuration and functional properties (Jia2021CCN; Monsen2023Structural).

The TSP1 domain of CCN5 is particularly significant, as it is sufficient to induce a range of functions typically associated with the full-length protein. This domain is involved in interactions with various proteins and has been shown to inhibit CCN2-induced cellular signaling (Monsen2023Structural). The absence of the CK domain in CCN5 makes the TSP1 domain more accessible for interaction, potentially affecting its activity and interactions with other proteins (Monsen2023Structural).

CCN5 is secreted as a prepropeptide and undergoes proteolytic processing to release bioactive ligands. The protein's structure allows it to interact with a wide array of proteins in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface, initiating intracellular signaling cascades (Monsen2023Structural). The TSP1 domain also plays a role in the nuclear localization of CCN5, which is crucial for its anti-fibrotic function (Song2022The).

## Function
CCN5, also known as WISP-2, is a member of the CCN family of proteins involved in various cellular functions, including cell growth, adhesion, migration, and endocrine-regulated processes. In healthy human cells, CCN5 is expressed at low levels and plays a role in suppressing cell proliferation. It acts as a transcriptional repressor, interacting with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to repress genes associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and components of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. This repression is crucial in preventing tumor progression and invasiveness (Sabbah2011CCN5).

CCN5 is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, suggesting diverse functions, including potential nuclear roles (Sabbah2011CCN5). It is known to inhibit the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, maintaining them in a G0 growth state. Knockdown of CCN5 results in morphological changes and disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Wiesman2010CCN5). CCN5 is also involved in modulating TGF-β signaling by inhibiting the Smad signal transducers and repressing transcription from the TGF-βRII promoter, which helps maintain epithelial characteristics and suppress invasiveness (Sabbah2011CCN5).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCN5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, CCN5 is typically overexpressed in noninvasive cells, but its expression is reduced or undetected in invasive breast carcinoma cell lines with mutant p53. This inverse relationship suggests that CCN5 plays a role in maintaining noninvasive phenotypes, and its suppression by mutant p53 may contribute to the invasive characteristics of breast cancer cells (Dhar2008Gain). The study by Dhar et al. highlights that mutant p53 proteins can silence CCN5 expression, leading to increased invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells. Estrogen signaling can counteract this suppression, indicating a potential therapeutic angle (Dhar2008Gain).

In the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), CCN5 expression is differentially regulated. It is upregulated in plexiform neurofibromas compared to dermal neurofibromas, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of NF1-associated tumors. This upregulation is associated with processes like fibrogenesis and angiogenesis, which are key features of plexiform neurofibromas (Pasmant2010Differential). These findings indicate that CCN5 may serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these conditions.

## Interactions
CCN5, also known as WISP2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its biological functions. It interacts with integrin receptors, which is crucial for its role in modulating cell adhesion and signaling pathways. This interaction is significant in pancreatic ß cells, where CCN5 enhances cell proliferation and survival by activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathways (Kaddour2019Recombinant).

CCN5 also acts as a transcriptional repressor in the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. It interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to repress gene expression, including genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and TGF-β signaling components like the TGF-βRII receptor. This interaction is facilitated by CCN5's recruitment to the TGF-βRII promoter, where it may recruit HDACs to mediate transcriptional repression (Sabbah2011CCN5).

The TSP1 domain of CCN5 is noted for its ability to inhibit cell physiological effects induced by CCN2, such as phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, suggesting a competitive interaction with CCN2 at an early stage of signaling (Monsen2023Structural).
