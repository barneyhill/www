# TMEM186

## Overview
TMEM186 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 186, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is implicated in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I (CI), a critical component of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. TMEM186 is part of the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex, interacting with other proteins such as TMEM126B, NDUFAF1, and ECSIT, which are essential for the biogenesis of CI (SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70; CabreraOrefice2022Complexome). The protein's localization to mitochondria has been confirmed, underscoring its role in mitochondrial processes (SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70). As a homolog of TMEM70, TMEM186 may also play a compensatory role in complex I assembly, particularly in the absence of TMEM70 (SánchezCaballero2019A).

## Interactions
TMEM186 is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I (CI) as part of the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex. It is associated with membrane arm intermediates that interact with other proteins such as TMEM126B, NDUFAF1, and ECSIT, suggesting its role in the assembly process of CI (SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70; CabreraOrefice2022Complexome). TMEM186 is also mentioned as part of the MCIA complex, which includes core subunits like NDUFAF1, ACAD9, and ECSIT, indicating its involvement in the biogenesis of the respiratory Complex I, a crucial component of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system (Giachin2021Assembly).

TMEM186 is a homolog of TMEM70 and is suggested to co-migrate with complex I assembly intermediates, potentially playing a role in complex I assembly and mitigating the effects of TMEM70 absence (SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70; SánchezCaballero2019A). The localization of TMEM186 in mitochondria has been confirmed through confocal microscopy and cell fractionation, supporting its involvement in mitochondrial processes (SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70). However, specific details on direct protein interactions involving TMEM186 are limited in the available literature.
