# CCDC54

## Overview
The CCDC54 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 54 protein, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC54 may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC54 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its structural properties imply potential involvement in intracellular signaling pathways or structural organization within the cell. Further research is needed to clarify its precise role and any implications it may have in health and disease.
