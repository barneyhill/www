# KDM4B

## Overview
KDM4B is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 4B, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of histone demethylases. This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by demethylating specific lysine residues on histone proteins, such as H3K9 and H3K36, thereby influencing chromatin structure and transcriptional activity (Chu2014KDM4B; Wang2022The). KDM4B is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and genomic stability, and is particularly significant in stem cell biology and adipogenesis (Wang2022The). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as transcription factors and coactivators, further underscore its role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Yi2021The; Coffey2013The). Clinically, KDM4B is implicated in several cancers, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Coffey2013The; Wang2022The).

## Structure
KDM4B, also known as lysine demethylase 4B, is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of histone demethylases. The protein structure includes a JmjC domain, which is responsible for its catalytic activity, and a JmjN domain, which contributes to its enzymatic function (Xiang2020Tudor). The JmjC domain of KDM4B folds into a β-jellyroll structure, characteristic of the KDM4 family, and is involved in the demethylation of histone H3 lysine residues, specifically H3K9me3/me2 and H3K36me3/me2 (Chu2014KDM4B).

KDM4B also contains two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers and hybrid Tudor domains (HTDs), which are involved in recognizing histone methylations and contribute to its nuclear localization (Xiang2020Tudor). The HTD forms an aromatic cage with residues such as W987 and Y993, which are critical for binding to methylated histones like H4K20me3 (Xiang2020Tudor).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. Splice variant isoforms of KDM4B may exist, leading to differences in structure and function (Xiang2020Tudor). The molecular structure of KDM4B is crucial for understanding its function and for developing selective inhibitors that can modulate its activity in cancer cells (Chu2014KDM4B).

## Function
KDM4B, a member of the lysine demethylase 4 family, plays a crucial role in regulating histone methylation, which in turn affects gene expression and chromatin structure. It specifically demethylates histone marks such as H3K9 and H3K36, influencing transcriptional activity and cellular processes like cell growth, survival, and differentiation (Su2016Reader; Wang2022The). KDM4B is essential for the self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and hematopoietic stem cells. In ESCs, it removes H3K9 methylation near promoters, which is vital for early development and the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (Wang2022The).

KDM4B also plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation by demethylating H3K9me3/me2 at PPAR and C/EBP promoters, thereby stimulating adipogenesis and enhancing metabolism in mature adipocytes (Wang2022The). In the central nervous system, KDM4B influences neurogenesis by demethylating promoters of genes like Notch1 (Wang2022The). It is active in the nucleus, where it maintains genomic stability and normal cellular function by regulating chromatin dynamics and gene expression (Su2016Reader).

## Clinical Significance
KDM4B is implicated in various cancers due to its role in histone demethylation, which affects gene expression and cellular processes. Overexpression of KDM4B is associated with oncogenic activity in several tumor types, including prostate, breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers. In prostate cancer, KDM4B enhances androgen receptor signaling, promoting cancer progression and resistance to castration therapies (Coffey2013The). In breast cancer, KDM4B is overexpressed in estrogen receptor-positive tumors, contributing to cell proliferation and tumor growth (Berry2013KDM4JMJD2). 

In colorectal cancer, KDM4B is activated by hypoxia-inducible factors and transcription factors like CREB and p53, influencing tumor growth and DNA damage response (Wang2022The). Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in colorectal and lung cancers, where it also contributes to treatment resistance (Wang2022The). In gastric cancer, KDM4B interacts with β-catenin and the Wnt signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis (Wang2022The).

KDM4B's role extends to other cancers, such as neuroblastoma and endometrial cancer, where it influences cell growth and progression (Wang2022The). Its expression levels and activity are considered potential therapeutic targets due to their significant impact on cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
KDM4B, also known as lysine demethylase 4B, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. It forms a complex with CCAR1 and MED1, which is crucial for osteoclast differentiation and bone homeostasis. This complex is involved in the regulation of osteoclast-related genes by facilitating the recruitment of transcription factors such as NF-κB p65 to gene promoters (Yi2021The). KDM4B also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), enhancing its stability and transcriptional activity by inhibiting AR ubiquitination, which prevents its degradation (Coffey2013The).

KDM4B's interaction with AR involves structural interactions that may mask ubiquitination sites, thereby stabilizing AR protein levels (Coffey2013The). It is also known to interact with the transcription factor p65, which is essential for RANK/RANKL signaling during osteoclastogenesis. This interaction is independent of KDM4B's demethylase activity, suggesting a cooperative role in gene regulation (Yi2021The). Additionally, KDM4B interacts with the SWI/SNF complex and other coactivators, with CCAR1 being specifically required for osteoclastogenesis (Yi2021The). These interactions highlight KDM4B's multifaceted role in regulating gene expression and cellular processes.
