# ANO8

## Overview
Anoctamin 8 (ANO8) is a gene that encodes the protein anoctamin 8, a member of the anoctamin family known for its involvement in calcium signaling and membrane interactions. The protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein, likely containing multiple transmembrane segments, which facilitate its role in ion transport and membrane protein regulation. Anoctamin 8 functions primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane (ER/PM) junctions, where it acts as a tether to enhance the assembly and stability of calcium signaling complexes. This protein is crucial for the interaction between the ER calcium sensor STIM1 and the plasma membrane calcium influx channel Orai1, thereby playing a significant role in receptor-stimulated calcium oscillations and cellular homeostasis (MedranoSoto2018Bioinformatic; Jha2019Anoctamin). Mutations in the ANO8 gene have been linked to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, highlighting its clinical significance in liver function and bile acid regulation (Liu2020Wholeexome).

## Structure
Anoctamin 8 (ANO8) is a member of the anoctamin family, which is characterized by its role in calcium signaling and membrane interactions. The primary structure of ANO8 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the ANO8 gene, forming a protein that is involved in tethering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) to facilitate calcium signaling complexes at the ER/PM junctions (Jha2019Anoctamin).

The secondary structure of ANO8 likely includes transmembrane segments, as is common in the anoctamin family, which typically features 8 to 10 transmembrane segments (TMSs) (MedranoSoto2018Bioinformatic). These segments are crucial for its function in ion transport and membrane protein regulation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these segments into a three-dimensional conformation that supports its role in calcium signaling (Jha2019Anoctamin).

ANO8 is also involved in the spatial organization of calcium signaling proteins, enhancing the assembly and stability of these complexes, and promoting the recruitment of SERCA2 pumps to the junctions (Jha2019Anoctamin). While specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of ANO8 are not detailed in the provided context, such modifications are common in proteins of this family and may regulate its activity.

## Function
ANO8, or anoctamin 8, is a protein that plays a crucial role in calcium (Ca2+) signaling within human cells. It functions as a tether at the endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane (ER/PM) junctions, facilitating the interaction between the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1 and the plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channel Orai1. This interaction is essential for the assembly of Ca2+ signaling complexes at the ER/PM compartment, which are critical for receptor-stimulated physiological Ca2+ oscillations (Jha2019Anoctamin).

ANO8 enhances the activity of Ca2+-dependent processes by increasing the local Ca2+ concentration at the ER/PM junctions. It promotes the clustering of STIM1 and Orai1, thereby increasing the current density and the rate of slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the Orai1 channel (Jha2019Anoctamin). ANO8 also enhances SERCA2-mediated Ca2+ uptake into the ER, which helps control the efficiency of receptor-stimulated Ca2+ signaling and prevents Ca2+ toxicity (Jha2019Anoctamin).

The protein is primarily located in the ER and is involved in the assembly of STIM1-Orai1 complexes, increasing the number and size of ER/PM contact sites (Jha2019Anoctamin). ANO8's role in Ca2+ signaling is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANO8 gene have been implicated in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), a liver disorder that occurs during pregnancy and is characterized by pruritus and elevated bile acid levels. The study by Liu et al. identified eight rare missense mutations in the ANO8 gene among 151 Chinese ICP patients, which were absent in 1029 control subjects. These mutations are predicted to be damaging to protein function and are associated with higher total bile acid levels in patients, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of ICP (Liu2020Wholeexome).

The ANO8 gene is involved in the transport of inorganic anions and chloride, which is crucial for bile salt transport. Disruptions in this function due to mutations may contribute to the development of ICP, leading to complications such as spontaneous abortion and preterm birth (Liu2020Wholeexome). The study highlights the significance of ANO8 mutations in ICP and suggests that these genetic alterations may affect bile salt transport, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Liu2020Wholeexome). This research provides new insights into the genetic basis of ICP and suggests potential targets for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Anoctamin 8 (ANO8) is involved in several key interactions at the endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane (ER/PM) junctions, primarily influencing calcium (Ca2+) signaling complexes. ANO8 acts as a tether protein, facilitating the interaction between the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1 and the plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channel Orai1. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and clustering of STIM1-Orai1 complexes, which are essential for Ca2+ influx and signaling (Jha2019Anoctamin).

ANO8 enhances the interaction of STIM1 with Orai1, increasing the rate and number of STIM1 puncta, which indicates its role in facilitating the formation of these complexes. It also interacts with SARAF, a protein that mediates slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation (SCDI) of Orai1, although ANO8 can also inactivate Orai1 currents through a SARAF-independent mechanism (Jha2019Anoctamin).

ANO8 is involved in the assembly of core Ca2+ signaling proteins, including Orai1, PMCA, STIM1, IP3 receptors, and SERCA2, at the ER/PM junctions. This assembly mediates a novel form of Orai1 channel inactivation by facilitating SERCA2-mediated Ca2+ influx into the ER, thus controlling the efficiency of receptor-stimulated Ca2+ signaling and preventing Ca2+ toxicity (Jha2019Anoctamin).
