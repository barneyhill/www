# DDX52

## Overview
DDX52 is a gene that encodes the protein DExD-box helicase 52, a member of the DExD/H-box helicase family. This protein is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis, primarily through its involvement in ribosomal RNA processing within the nucleolus (Xu2023DDX52). Beyond its fundamental role in protein synthesis, DExD-box helicase 52 is implicated in the regulation of the c-Myc signaling pathway and folate metabolism, highlighting its broader influence on cellular metabolic processes (Xu2023DDX52). The protein also contributes to spermatogenesis, emphasizing its importance in reproductive biology (Xu2023DDX52). Additionally, DDX52 has been associated with various cancers, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and patient prognosis, making it a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and therapy (Yu2021DDX52; Xu2023DDX52).

## Function
DDX52 is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in ribosome biogenesis, a critical function for protein synthesis and cellular growth. DDX52 facilitates the assembly and function of ribosomes by participating in ribosomal RNA processing, which is essential for the production of functional ribosomes (Xu2023DDX52). This activity occurs predominantly in the nucleolus, where ribosome assembly takes place.

In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, DDX52 is implicated in the modulation of the c-Myc signaling pathway, which is vital for cell growth and differentiation (Xu2023DDX52). The gene also influences gene expression within the folate metabolism pathway in human lymphocytes, highlighting its involvement in broader cellular metabolic processes (Xu2023DDX52).

DDX52's functions extend to spermatogenesis, where it is involved in the mitosis of spermatogonia and sperm cell differentiation, underscoring its importance in reproductive biology (Xu2023DDX52). These diverse roles emphasize DDX52's significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential impact on organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
The DDX52 gene has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), DDX52 expression is significantly elevated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with advanced cancer stages and poor clinical outcomes, making DDX52 an independent prognostic factor for overall survival, disease-free interval, and progression-free interval in LUAD patients (Xu2023DDX52). Similarly, in prostate cancer, DDX52 expression is higher in cancerous tissues, particularly in advanced or metastatic stages. Its expression correlates with shorter survival times, and knockdown experiments have shown that reducing DDX52 levels can significantly impede cancer cell growth, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis and progression (Yu2021DDX52).

DDX52 is also involved in the replication of the Myxoma virus (MYXV) in human cancer cells. Knockdown of DDX52 enhances MYXV replication, indicating a potential role in antiviral responses or regulation of innate immune responses (Rahman2017Identification). This suggests that DDX52 may have broader implications in viral infections and cancer therapy.

## Interactions
DDX52, a member of the DExD/H-box helicase family, is implicated in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, although specific details about these interactions are limited. In the context of HIV-1 replication, DDX52 is suggested to play a role before the packaging and assembly stages of the virus. Knockdown of DDX52 using siRNA led to decreased viral release, as measured by p24 levels, but did not affect the infectivity of the released virus, indicating a potential interaction with viral components during early replication stages (Rao2022DEADly; Williams2015Identification).

Despite the lack of detailed information on specific physical interactions, DDX52 is associated with rRNA biogenesis and regulation of c-Myc, linking it to various cancers (Rao2022DEADly). The gene's involvement in these processes suggests that it may interact with components of the ribosome biogenesis machinery and possibly with other proteins involved in RNA metabolism. However, further research is needed to elucidate the precise nature of these interactions and the specific proteins or nucleic acids involved (Dupas2021Predicting; Xu2023DDX52).
