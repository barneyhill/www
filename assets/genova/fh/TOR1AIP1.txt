# TOR1AIP1

## Overview
The TOR1AIP1 gene encodes the lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), a type II transmembrane protein predominantly located in the inner nuclear membrane. LAP1 is integral to the structural integrity and functional dynamics of the nuclear envelope, interacting with key nuclear components such as lamins and torsinA. These interactions facilitate essential cellular processes, including chromatin organization, gene expression, and the DNA damage response. LAP1's unique ability to modulate the ATPase activity of torsinA underscores its critical role in maintaining nuclear envelope homeostasis. Mutations in TOR1AIP1 have been implicated in various severe clinical conditions, including cardiomyopathies, muscular dystrophies, and congenital multisystemic syndromes, highlighting the gene's importance in normal cellular function and development (Dorboz2014Severe; Fichtman2019Combined; Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated).

## Structure
The TOR1AIP1 gene encodes the lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), a nuclear envelope protein with two identified isoforms in humans: LAP1B and LAP1C. These isoforms are generated through alternative start site usage, with LAP1B being 584 amino acids long and LAP1C consisting of 462 amino acids. Both isoforms are type 2 transmembrane proteins featuring an N-terminal nucleoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal luminal domain. A zinc-finger motif is present in the C-terminal regions of both proteins (Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated).

LAP1B contains three conserved protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding motifs, located at amino acids 55-59, 212-215, and 538-541, as well as a SILK motif at amino acids 306-309. These motifs are crucial for its role as a PP1 regulatory protein (Santos2013The). LAP1 isoforms undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and methionine oxidation, and are dephosphorylated by PP1 (Santos2014Identification).

The structural differences between LAP1B and LAP1C, particularly the absence of 122 amino acids at the N-terminus of LAP1C, suggest distinct functional roles, although the physiological implications remain unclear (Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated).

## Function
The TOR1AIP1 gene encodes lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), a type II transmembrane protein located in the inner nuclear membrane. LAP1 plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope by interacting with lamins A, C, and B, as well as emerin and torsinA (Serrano2016Lamina; Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated). These interactions are essential for proper chromatin organization and gene expression, contributing to the overall stability and function of the nuclear envelope (Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated).

LAP1 is involved in several cellular processes, including the regulation of mitosis and the DNA damage response. It is phosphorylated by various kinases, indicating its role in signaling pathways, particularly in response to genotoxic stress (Serrano2016Lamina). LAP1 also plays a role in the mitotic spindle formation and centrosome positioning, which are critical for cell division (Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated).

In addition to its structural roles, LAP1 is the only known protein to induce the ATPase activity of torsinA, a chaperone-like ATPase, which is vital for maintaining nuclear envelope dynamics and function (Dorboz2014Severe). This interaction underscores LAP1's unique and essential role in cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TOR1AIP1 gene, which encodes lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), are associated with a range of serious conditions. These include cardiomyopathies, such as dilated cardiomyopathy and left-ventricular dysfunction, which can lead to severe heart failure and may require heart transplants (Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated). TOR1AIP1 mutations also cause a recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, previously known as LGMD2Y, characterized by muscle weakness, contractures, and elevated creatine kinase levels (Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated; KaymanKurekci2014Mutation).

A unique case linked to a missense mutation in TOR1AIP1 involved severe dystonia, cerebellar atrophy, and cardiomyopathy, leading to death at age 17 (Dorboz2014Severe). Congenital multisystemic syndromes with progeroid features, including hearing loss, cataracts, and neurodevelopmental delays, have also been observed (Fichtman2019Combined; Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated). Additionally, congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) has been linked to TOR1AIP1 mutations, with symptoms like muscle weakness and fatigability (Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated).

The loss of LAP1 isoforms, particularly LAP1B and LAP1C, due to TOR1AIP1 mutations, results in severe phenotypes, including early onset multisystemic nuclear envelopathy, characterized by neurological impairment, heart malformations, and growth retardation (Fichtman2019Combined). These findings underscore the critical role of TOR1AIP1 in maintaining normal cellular functions and highlight the severe consequences of its mutations.

## Interactions
The TOR1AIP1 gene encodes the lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), a type II transmembrane protein located in the inner nuclear membrane. LAP1 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for maintaining nuclear envelope structure and function. It directly binds to lamins, which are structural components of the nuclear lamina, and indirectly associates with chromosomes, suggesting a role in chromatin positioning (Serrano2016Lamina; Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated).

LAP1 interacts with torsinA, a protein central to DYT1 dystonia, modulating its ATPase activity. This interaction is significant for nuclear envelope integrity and chromatin positioning (Serrano2016Lamina; Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated). LAP1 also binds to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates specific LAP1 residues, influencing its function (Serrano2016Lamina).

The LAP1 interactome includes proteins involved in DNA damage response and telomere maintenance, such as TRF2, TERF2IP, RIF1, and ATM. These interactions suggest LAP1's involvement in telomere protection and DNA repair (Serrano2016Lamina; Mackels2023TOR1AIP1Associated). LAP1 is also linked to the mitotic checkpoint complex through interactions with MAD2L1 and MAD2L1BP, indicating a role in mitosis regulation (Serrano2016Lamina).
