# CSF3

## Overview
The CSF3 gene encodes the protein granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a cytokine that plays a pivotal role in hematopoiesis by regulating the production and function of neutrophils. G-CSF is primarily involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow, acting through its receptor, CSF3R, to initiate various signaling pathways, including the Jak/STAT pathway (Panopoulos2008Granulocyte). This cytokine is crucial for both steady-state and emergency granulopoiesis, facilitating a rapid immune response during infections (Panopoulos2008Granulocyte). The CSF3 gene is expressed in multiple tissues, and its product, G-CSF, is categorized as a cytokine due to its role in immune regulation and hematopoietic cell signaling. Mutations in the CSF3 gene and its receptor are associated with various hematological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in disease progression and treatment (Pardanani2013CSF3R; Liongue2014Granulocyte).

## Function
The CSF3 gene encodes granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a cytokine crucial for the regulation of neutrophil production and function. G-CSF primarily acts on hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, where it binds to its receptor, G-CSFR, initiating a cascade of signaling pathways that promote the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neutrophil precursors (Panopoulos2008Granulocyte). 

In healthy human cells, G-CSF is essential for both steady-state and emergency granulopoiesis, ensuring a rapid immune response during infections. It achieves this by activating several signaling pathways, including the Jak/STAT pathway, which is critical for neutrophil chemotaxis and mobilization (Panopoulos2008Granulocyte). The cytokine also influences the expression of myeloid transcription factors and cell cycle regulators, such as Cyclin D3, which are vital for neutrophil production (Panopoulos2008Granulocyte).

G-CSF is produced by various tissues, including fibroblasts and endothelial cells, and its levels increase significantly during infection, stimulating the proliferation of granulocytic progenitor cells (Panopoulos2008Granulocyte). This cytokine plays a critical role in both innate and adaptive immune responses, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CSF3R gene, which encodes the receptor for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), are implicated in several hematological disorders. In severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), truncation mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of CSF3R are common and often occur alongside mutations in other genes like ELANE and HAX1. These mutations are associated with an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to their role in providing a clonal advantage through STAT5-mediated pathways (Pardanani2013CSF3R; Liongue2014Granulocyte).

In chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), the CSF3RT618I mutation is highly prevalent, occurring in 83% of cases. This mutation leads to constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, driving the overproduction of neutrophils (Pardanani2013CSF3R; Adam2022CoOccurring). The CSF3RT617N germline mutation is linked to hereditary neutrophilia, characterized by splenomegaly and increased circulating myeloid progenitors, and can be inhibited by JAK2 inhibitors (Plo2009An).

CSF3R mutations are also found in other myeloid disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), where they contribute to disease progression and transformation to acute leukemia (Adam2022CoOccurring; Liongue2014Granulocyte).

## Interactions
The colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) interacts with various proteins to mediate its signaling functions. CSF3R forms a 2:2 complex with its ligand CSF3, leading to receptor homodimerization. Although CSF3R lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, it activates members of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK) family, specifically JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, which bind to its juxtamembrane cytoplasmic region (Touw2013Scratching). The cytoplasmic domain of CSF3R contains conserved tyrosine residues that, upon phosphorylation, serve as docking sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing signaling proteins, including STAT3, SOCS3, Shp2, Shc, and Grb2 (Touw2013Scratching).

SOCS3 is recruited to a phosphorylated tyrosine residue on CSF3R, where it acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediating the ubiquitination of a critical lysine residue, which is essential for receptor trafficking (Touw2013Scratching). The deubiquitinating enzyme DUB2A counteracts this process by deubiquitinating CSF3R, enhancing its stability and signaling by promoting its accumulation in early endosomes (Meenhuis2011The). Additionally, the protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptp1b interacts with CSF3R at the ER-early endosome interface, modulating its signaling by dephosphorylation (Touw2013Scratching). These interactions are crucial for regulating the signaling output of CSF3R, affecting the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils.
