# OR6C6

## Overview
The OR6C6 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily C member 6, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. These receptors are a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The protein encoded by OR6C6 is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which allows it to transduce extracellular signals through interaction with G-proteins. While primarily associated with olfactory function, recent studies have suggested that OR6C6 may have additional roles in human health, particularly in relation to pregnancy-related conditions such as preeclampsia (Hirata2023Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
The gene OR6C6, an olfactory receptor, has been studied for its potential clinical significance in relation to preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to other organ systems. Research indicates that the expression of OR6C6 is significantly downregulated in preeclampsia, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early detection of the condition. Specifically, low expression levels of OR6C6 have been associated with an increased risk of developing preeclampsia, while higher expression levels appear to be protective (Hirata2023Exploring). The study highlights a sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.58 for OR6C6 expression in predicting preeclampsia, underscoring its potential utility in clinical settings (Hirata2023Exploring).

Additionally, the study explores the link between OR6C6 expression and mild gestational hypothyroidism, suggesting a shared molecular signature between hypothyroidism and preeclampsia. This connection is further supported by the observed correlation between the expression of other olfactory receptors and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, indicating a possible interaction between olfactory receptor expression and thyroid function (Hirata2023Exploring). These findings suggest that alterations in OR6C6 expression may play a role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and related gestational health conditions.
