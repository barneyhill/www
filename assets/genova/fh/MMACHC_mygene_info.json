however, its C-terminal region shows similarity to TonB, a bacterial protein involved in energy transduction for cobalamin (vitamin B12) uptake. Hence, it is postulated that this protein may have a role in the binding and intracellular trafficking of cobalamin. Mutations in this gene are associated with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type cblC.
