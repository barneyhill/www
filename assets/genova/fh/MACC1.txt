# MACC1

## Overview
The MACC1 gene encodes the MET transcriptional regulator MACC1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis and apoptosis. As a transcriptional regulator, MACC1 is involved in the modulation of the MET signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation, migration, and survival. The protein is characterized by its unique domain composition, including ZU5, SH3, and two C-terminal death domains, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and its involvement in signal transduction pathways (Kokoszyńska2009Unexpected). MACC1's function extends to its role in cancer progression, where it influences metastasis and tumor aggressiveness, particularly in colorectal cancer and other malignancies (Hu2021A; Vuaroqueaux2022Elevated). Through its interactions with proteins such as GIPC1 and transcription factors like SNAI1, MACC1 modulates key signaling pathways, underscoring its clinical significance in oncology (Siegel2023GIPC1; Zhang2022MACC1).

## Structure
The MACC1 protein is characterized by a unique domain composition that plays a crucial role in linking MET signaling and apoptosis. It consists of four primary domains: ZU5, SH3, and two C-terminal death domains (DD) (Kokoszyńska2009Unexpected). The ZU5 domain is typically found in receptor and cytoskeleton proteins and is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly binding spectrins near the cell membrane. The SH3 domain forms a β-barrel structure and is involved in protein-protein interactions within protein tyrosine kinase-dependent signal transduction pathways (Kokoszyńska2009Unexpected).

The two C-terminal death domains are notable for their six helical bundle fold, which is involved in the formation of oligomeric signaling complexes that regulate apoptosis. These domains mediate self-association with death domains of other proteins to induce pro-apoptotic signals (Kokoszyńska2009Unexpected). The presence of a double DD architecture in MACC1 is unique and has not been previously reported (Kokoszyńska2009Unexpected).

MACC1 shares a 43% sequence identity with its closest homolog, SH3BP4, which contains similar domains and an additional N-terminal SH3 domain involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Kokoszyńska2009Unexpected). The protein's structure and function are influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and splice variant isoforms can lead to different functional outcomes.

## Function
The MACC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a process crucial for the internalization of various receptors and their subsequent trafficking within cells. MACC1 is involved in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and transferrin receptor (TfR) trafficking, influencing their distribution and uptake at the plasma membrane (imbastari2020impact). The protein interacts with several components of the endocytic machinery, such as clathrin, dynamin, and adaptor complex 2, facilitating the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and the internalization of cargo proteins (imbastari2020impact).

MACC1 contains an SH3 domain, which is essential for its localization at the plasma membrane and its interaction with TfR, impacting the receptor's internalization and recycling (imbastari2020impact). The protein's involvement in CME suggests its role in receptor fate decisions, potentially affecting cellular signaling pathways and receptor recycling processes (imbastari2020impact). In healthy human cells, MACC1's regulation of receptor trafficking and endocytosis is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling dynamics.

## Clinical Significance
The MACC1 gene is clinically significant in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). Elevated expression of MACC1 is associated with chromosomal instability and somatic copy number alterations (SCNA), contributing to tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and poor patient survival in CRC (Vuaroqueaux2022Elevated). High MACC1 expression is linked to specific molecular subtypes of CRC, such as CMS2 and CMS4, which are characterized by distinct signaling pathways and phenotypes (Vuaroqueaux2022Elevated). 

In addition to CRC, MACC1 is implicated in other cancers, including gastric and lower-grade glioma, where its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and poor prognosis (Hu2021A). Genetic alterations in MACC1, such as missense mutations and amplifications, are common in melanoma and are associated with immune escape mechanisms (Hu2021A). 

The gene's role in metastasis is further highlighted by its interaction with the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Narayan2021Examining; Vuaroqueaux2022Elevated). MACC1 also influences angiogenesis and inflammation, contributing to tumor progression and immune evasion (Narayan2021Examining; Vuaroqueaux2022Elevated).

## Interactions
MACC1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. It physically interacts with GIPC1, a protein binding partner, through the SH3 domain of MACC1 and the C-terminal region of GIPC1. This interaction is crucial for MACC1's role in metastasis, as GIPC1 also acts as a transcription factor for MACC1, binding to its promoter region and influencing its expression (Siegel2023GIPC1).

In colorectal cancer, MACC1 is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and receptor recycling. It interacts with proteins such as clathrin light and heavy chains, dynamin 1/2, and the transferrin receptor, affecting the internalization and recycling of receptors like the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Imbastari2021MACC1).

In pancreatic cancer, MACC1 interacts with the transcription factor SNAI1, enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction leads to the upregulation of fibronectin 1 (FN1) and downregulation of cadherin 1 (CDH1), promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis (Zhang2022MACC1). These interactions highlight MACC1's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes associated with cancer metastasis.
