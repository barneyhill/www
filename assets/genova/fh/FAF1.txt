# FAF1

## Overview
Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, immune signaling, and protein homeostasis. The FAF1 protein is characterized by several domains, such as the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by promoting the degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins (Lee2012UbiquitinAssociated). As a regulatory protein, FAF1 is involved in modulating NF-κB signaling and type I interferon responses, thereby influencing immune and inflammatory pathways (Kim2017FASassociated; Elmetwali2014Fasassociated). Additionally, FAF1 interacts with various proteins, including VAPA, VAPB, and CD40, affecting processes such as transcriptional repression and cellular stress responses (Baron2014VAPBALS8; Chen2024Sumoylation). Clinically, FAF1 is implicated in several cancers, where its expression and mutations can either suppress or promote tumor progression, depending on the cancer type and context (Xie2017FAF1; Hu2023High).

## Structure
The human Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) protein contains several domains, including a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, ubiquitin-like domains (UBL1 and UBL2), and a ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain. The UBA domain, located at the N-terminal, is crucial for binding polyubiquitin chains, particularly K48-linked chains, and is involved in promoting the degradation of Hsp70, a heat shock protein, through the proteasome (Lee2012UbiquitinAssociated). The UBA domain adopts a canonical three-helical bundle structure, which is a common feature among UBA domains, and it specifically recognizes mono- and di-ubiquitin (Song2009Structure). 

The UBA domain of hFAF1 is characterized by a compact three-helix bundle structure, with significant differences from other UBA domains, particularly in the loop connecting helices a1 and a2, which contains a unique 'Cys-Thr-Gly-Ile' motif (Song2009Structure). The electrostatic surface of hFAF1-UBA is more acidic compared to other UBA domains, and it forms hydrophobic patches that are known ubiquitin recognition sites (Song2009Structure). 

FAF1 is also involved in apoptosis and inhibits tumor formation, with its expression reduced in several cancers, including cervical cancer (Lee2012UbiquitinAssociated). The protein's structure and function are further characterized by its interaction with polyubiquitinated proteins, essential for its role in tumor suppression (Lee2012UbiquitinAssociated).

## Function
FAF1 (Fas-associated factor 1) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in regulating NF-κB signaling, a pathway crucial for immune responses and inflammation. FAF1 interacts with the CD40 receptor, modulating CD40-induced NF-κB activation through a negative feedback loop. This interaction involves the TRAF6-binding domain of CD40 and the N-terminal FID domain of FAF1, allowing FAF1 to compete with TRAF6 for binding, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation (Elmetwali2014Fasassociated).

FAF1 is also involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, promoting the degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins such as Hsp70 through its ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. This activity is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating stress responses (Lee2012UbiquitinAssociated).

In the context of antiviral responses, FAF1 positively regulates type I interferon signaling by interacting with NLRX1, which enhances the RIG-I-mediated antiviral response. This interaction is crucial for mounting effective immune responses against RNA virus infections (Kim2017FASassociated).

FAF1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell survival, apoptosis, and immune signaling pathways, contributing to the maintenance of cellular and organismal homeostasis (Kinoshita2006Fasassociated).

## Clinical Significance
FAF1 (Fas-associated factor 1) is implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FAF1 is significantly overexpressed, particularly in adenocarcinoma, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. High FAF1 expression correlates with advanced pathological stages and worse outcomes, suggesting it may not act as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC (Hu2023High). In contrast, FAF1 is considered a tumor suppressor in other cancers, such as breast cancer, where its loss is linked to increased metastatic potential. FAF1 interacts with the TGF-β signaling pathway, and its downregulation can lead to enhanced cancer progression and metastasis (Xie2017FAF1).

In hereditary colorectal cancer, germline mutations in FAF1, such as p.Arg85Pro and p.Asp371Asn, result in unstable proteins that resist apoptosis and deregulate NF-κB and Wnt signaling pathways, contributing to tumor development (Bonjoch2020Germline). FAF1 mutations are also associated with leiomyosarcoma, where a specific mutation prevents its phosphorylation, leading to antiapoptotic transformation (Weber2015Molecular). These findings highlight FAF1's complex role in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a factor in cancer progression depending on the context.

## Interactions
FAF1 (Fas associated factor 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with VAPA and VAPB proteins in human U2OS cells, facilitating the binding of p97 to VAPB. This interaction is crucial, as depletion of FAF1 reduces the binding of p97 to VAPB, while depletion of p97 does not significantly affect FAF1's binding to VAPB (Baron2014VAPBALS8). FAF1 also interacts with the CD40 receptor, competing with TRAF6 for binding, which regulates CD40-induced NF-kB activation. This interaction involves the TRAF6-binding domain of CD40 and the N-terminal FID domain of FAF1 (Elmetwali2014Fasassociated).

FAF1 contains a non-canonical FFAT motif that allows it to interact with the MSP domain of VAPB, mediating VAPB's interaction with p97. This interaction is significant in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Baron2014VAPBALS8). FAF1 also interacts with SAP130, where sumoylation of SAP130 affects its interaction with FAF1, influencing transcriptional repression and protein stability (Chen2024Sumoylation). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, FAF1 interacts with Krr1p, a nucleolar protein, suggesting a role in rRNA synthesis and ribosome assembly (Karkusiewicz2004Functional).
