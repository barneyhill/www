# ZNF214

## Overview
ZNF214 is a gene located on chromosome 11p15.4 that encodes the zinc finger protein 214, a member of the zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. Through its involvement in transcription regulation, zinc finger protein 214 influences various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, by modulating the transcription of target genes (Sofos2011A). The gene is situated within a duplicated region on chromosome 11, which has been associated with a novel familial microduplication syndrome. Although ZNF214 has been implicated in certain syndromes, its precise role in healthy human cells and its contribution to phenotypic outcomes remain subjects of ongoing research (Sofos2011A).

## Function
ZNF214, a zinc finger protein, is involved in transcription regulation and metal ion binding, specifically zinc ion binding (Sofos2011A). As a member of the zinc finger protein family, ZNF214 functions primarily as a transcription factor, binding to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. This regulation is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, by modulating the transcription of target genes (Sofos2011A). ZNF214 is active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell, impacting the expression of genes involved in these fundamental biological processes (Sofos2011A).

The gene is part of a duplicated region on chromosome 11p15.4, which includes about 29 genes. Although ZNF214 has been hypothesized to play a role in the development of certain syndromes, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, there is not substantial evidence for functional mutations in these genes affecting healthy human cells (Sofos2011A). The study of ZNF214 in the context of a familial 11p15.4 microduplication suggests that while it may contribute to certain phenotypic outcomes, its role in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated (Sofos2011A).

## Clinical Significance
The ZNF214 gene, located on chromosome 11p15.4, has been implicated in a novel familial microduplication syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and obesity. This microduplication involves a 2.29 Mb region that includes ZNF214 and approximately 29 other genes. The duplication has been observed in multiple family members, suggesting a hereditary pattern, and is associated with variable clinical features such as developmental delays, learning disabilities, and aggressive behavior (Sofos2011A).

Despite the presence of these clinical features, the duplication does not appear to cause overgrowth or other characteristics of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which is often associated with duplications in nearby imprinted regions. This suggests that ZNF214 itself may not significantly impact growth-related phenotypes without the involvement of other imprinted genes like ZNF215 (Sofos2011A).

The study also explored a potential link between the duplication and hypercalcemia, but concluded that the hypercalcemia observed in the family was likely idiopathic and not directly caused by the 11p duplication (Sofos2011A). Further research is needed to clarify the role of ZNF214 in these conditions and to determine its contribution to the observed phenotypes.
