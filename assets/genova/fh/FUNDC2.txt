# FUNDC2

## Overview
FUNDC2 is a gene that encodes the protein FUN14 domain containing 2, which is a mitochondrial protein involved in critical cellular processes such as mitophagy, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dynamics. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its localization to the mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial quality control and energy homeostasis. FUNDC2 is particularly significant in the regulation of mitophagy, a cellular process that removes damaged mitochondria, thereby preserving cellular health (Wu2017Phylogenetic). The protein interacts with mitofusin 1 (MFN1), influencing mitochondrial dynamics by inhibiting MFN1's GTPase activity, which leads to mitochondrial fragmentation (Li2022FUNDC2). This interaction is crucial for cellular metabolism and has implications in liver tumorigenesis (Li2022FUNDC2). Additionally, FUNDC2 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and inflammation, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and stress response (Deng2020Deletion).

## Function
FUNDC2 (FUN14 domain containing 2) is a mitochondrial protein involved in several cellular processes, including mitophagy, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dynamics. In healthy human cells, FUNDC2 is localized to the mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial quality control and energy homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of mitophagy, a process that removes damaged mitochondria to preserve cellular health (Wu2017Phylogenetic).

FUNDC2 interacts with mitofusin 1 (MFN1), a protein that promotes mitochondrial fusion. By inhibiting the GTPase activity of MFN1, FUNDC2 affects mitochondrial dynamics, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation. This interaction is crucial for regulating mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism (Li2022FUNDC2). The inhibition of MFN1-mediated mitochondrial fusion by FUNDC2 is linked to its role in energy production and metabolic reprogramming, particularly in the context of liver tumorigenesis (Li2022FUNDC2).

In addition to its role in mitochondrial dynamics, FUNDC2 is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and inflammation, processes that are essential for cellular homeostasis and response to stress (Deng2020Deletion). The gene's involvement in these pathways highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FUNDC2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in liver tumorigenesis and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), elevated levels of FUNDC2 are associated with poor patient survival. The gene promotes tumor growth by inhibiting MFN1-mediated mitochondrial fusion, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and reprogramming of cancer cell metabolism, which supports tumorigenesis (Li2022FUNDC2). Knockdown of FUNDC2 in mouse models has been shown to suppress liver tumorigenesis, indicating its critical role in promoting liver cancer (Li2022FUNDC2).

In the context of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, a deletion on chromosome Xq28 that includes FUNDC2 and CMC4 has been linked to the condition in men. This deletion results in the complete loss of expression of these genes, contributing to dysregulation of apoptosis and inflammation, which are associated with HH (Deng2020Deletion). The deletion of FUNDC2 and CMC4 is sufficient to cause HH, highlighting the gene's significance in reproductive health (Deng2020Deletion). These findings suggest that FUNDC2 plays a role in both cancer biology and reproductive disorders.

## Interactions
FUNDC2 interacts with mitochondrial proteins MFN1 and MFN2, which are involved in mitochondrial fusion. This interaction was identified through tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, revealing that approximately 17% of proteins co-purified with FUNDC2 were mitochondrial proteins, including MFN1 and MFN2. Immunoprecipitation confirmed the interaction between FUNDC2 and MFN1/2 at both ectopic and endogenous expression levels. The N-terminal fragment of FUNDC2 (1-127) interacts with the GTPase domain of MFN1 (1-336), and mutations in the GTPase domain of MFN1 impair its interaction with FUNDC2. This suggests the importance of the GTPase domain in this interaction. FUNDC2 specifically inhibits the GTPase activity of MFN1, but not MFN2, indicating a selective regulatory role in mitochondrial dynamics (Li2022FUNDC2).

In the context of liver tumorigenesis, FUNDC2's interaction with MFN1 inhibits MFN1-mediated mitochondrial fusion, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased mitochondrial respiration, and altered cellular metabolism. This interaction is crucial for the role of FUNDC2 in promoting liver tumorigenesis, as it affects mitochondrial dynamics and energy production in tumor cells (Li2022FUNDC2).
