# RBM19

## Overview
RBM19, or RNA binding motif protein 19, is a gene that encodes a highly conserved RNA-binding protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly ribosome biogenesis. The protein encoded by RBM19 is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which facilitate specific binding to G-tract RNA sequences, playing a pivotal role in RNA splicing regulation and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing. This protein is essential for nucleologenesis, the formation of the nucleolus, and is crucial for early embryonic development, as it transitions from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus to coordinate nucleolar assembly and function. Disruptions in RBM19 function can lead to developmental arrest and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in cell proliferation and growth (Zhang2008RBM19; Neelamraju2015The). Additionally, RBM19 has been implicated in various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where it serves as a prognostic marker, and has been studied in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Wang2020Integrated; Hohman2015Global).

## Function
RBM19 (RNA binding motif protein 19) is a highly conserved RNA-binding protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, a critical process for protein synthesis in cells. It plays a significant role in the nucleolus, where it participates in the processing and assembly of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Dominguez2010Structural; Neelamraju2015The). RBM19 contains RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that enable it to bind specifically to G-tract RNA sequences, similar to the quasi-RNA recognition motifs (qRRMs) of hnRNP F, suggesting its involvement in RNA splicing regulation (Dominguez2010Structural).

In healthy human cells, RBM19 is essential for nucleologenesis, the formation of the nucleolus, which is crucial for ribosome production. This protein transitions from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus during early embryonic development, indicating its role in coordinating nucleolar assembly and function (Zhang2008RBM19). The proper functioning of RBM19 is vital for cell proliferation and growth, as it ensures efficient ribosome production, impacting overall cellular and organismal health (Zhang2008RBM19). Its activity in the nucleolus and involvement in ribosome biogenesis underscore its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and supporting normal developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
RBM19 is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. In mouse models, mutations in the RBM19 gene lead to developmental arrest at the morula stage, indicating its critical role in early embryonic development. These mutations result in defective nucleologenesis and increased apoptosis, with the P53 pathway being upregulated, suggesting a stress response due to nucleolar maturation failure (Zhang2008RBM19).

In humans, altered expression of RBM19 has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Integrated bioinformatic analyses have identified RBM19 as one of the RNA-binding proteins with increased expression in HCC tumor cells compared to normal cells. It is considered a prognostic marker for overall survival in HCC patients, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and as a therapeutic target (Wang2020Integrated).

RBM19 has also been mentioned in studies on Alzheimer's disease, where altered expression patterns were observed in the hippocampal cells of patients. However, its direct association with Alzheimer's disease risk remains unclear, as it has not been previously linked to the disease in other studies (Hohman2015Global).

## Interactions
RBM19 is known to interact with RNA and participate in various RNA-protein interactions. It contains RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that enable it to bind specifically to G-tract RNA sequences, similar to the hnRNP F quasi-RRM domains. This binding is crucial for regulating RNA splicing, as RBM19 can substitute for hnRNP F qRRM domains in the splicing regulation of Bcl-x pre-mRNA (Dominguez2010Structural). The protein's ability to bind G-tract RNA with micromolar affinity has been confirmed through ITC experiments, indicating its specificity for these sequences (Dominguez2010Structural).

RBM19 is also involved in ribosome biogenesis and is essential for preimplantation development in mice. It plays a role in nucleologenesis, the process of nucleolus formation, and is crucial for the proper assembly of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription apparatus (Zhang2008RBM19). The protein's interactions are vital for early embryonic development, as disruptions in RBM19 lead to developmental arrest and apoptosis, mediated by the P53 pathway (Zhang2008RBM19). Despite its significant role in these processes, specific protein-protein interactions involving RBM19 are not detailed in the provided context.
