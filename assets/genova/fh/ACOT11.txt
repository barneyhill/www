# ACOT11

## Overview
ACOT11, or acyl-CoA thioesterase 11, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the acyl-CoA thioesterase family, which is involved in lipid metabolism. The protein, acyl-CoA thioesterase 11, functions as an enzyme that hydrolyzes acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoA), playing a crucial role in regulating intracellular lipid levels and energy homeostasis (Kirkby2010Functional). Structurally, the protein is characterized by two tandem hotdog fold domains and a C-terminal START domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and lipid binding capabilities (Kirkby2010Functional). ACOT11 is active in both the cytosol and mitochondria, where it influences processes such as thermogenesis, particularly in brown adipose tissue, and is implicated in various cellular pathways, including those related to cancer progression (Liang2020ACOT11; Kirkby2010Functional). The gene's expression and activity have significant clinical implications, particularly in metabolic disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Han2012Functional; Xu2020AcylCoA).

## Structure
ACOT11, or acyl-CoA thioesterase 11, is characterized by its unique structural features, including two tandem hotdog fold domains and a C-terminal START domain. The hotdog fold, initially described in FabA from E. coli, is a common structural motif in thioesterases and is also known as a 4HBT (4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase) domain. This fold is prevalent in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species (Kirkby2010Functional). The START domain, approximately 210 amino acids in length, is involved in lipid binding and mediates intracellular functions such as lipid transport, metabolism, and cell signaling. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the START domain of ACOT11 reveals an antiparallel beta-sheet consisting of nine strands surrounded by five alpha-helices, with a proposed lipid binding site formed by a tunnel between the beta-sheet and alpha-helices 3, 4, and 5 (Kirkby2010Functional).

ACOT11 shares 55% sequence identity with ACOT12 and has a similar domain architecture, suggesting a conserved structural framework within this family of proteins (Swarbrick2020Structure). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ACOT11, as well as information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ACOT11, or acyl-CoA thioesterase 11, is an enzyme that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoA), thereby regulating intracellular levels of these molecules. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and lipid signaling pathways within cells (Kirkby2010Functional). ACOT11 is active in the cytosol and mitochondria, where it influences processes such as inflammation and energy expenditure (Kirkby2010Functional).

In healthy human cells, ACOT11 is involved in thermogenesis, particularly in brown adipose tissue (BAT). It is upregulated in response to cold environments, potentially increasing the availability of nonesterified fatty acids, which can relieve inhibition on uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). This process may also decrease cellular levels of esterified fatty acids, slowing beta-oxidation and ATP generation, and regulating mitochondrial levels of CoASH (Kirkby2010Functional). The enzyme's activity in lipid metabolism suggests a broader role in regulating intracellular concentrations of fatty acids and CoASH, which are essential for various biological processes, including lipid biosynthesis, signal transduction, and gene transcription regulation (Kirkby2010Functional).

## Clinical Significance
ACOT11, also known as acyl-CoA thioesterase 11, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ACOT11 is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal kidney tissues. This downregulation is consistent across multiple datasets, including those from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker for ccRCC. The diagnostic value of ACOT11 is supported by a high area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.964 in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, indicating high specificity and sensitivity for ccRCC detection (Xu2020AcylCoA).

In metabolic regulation, ACOT11, also known as Them1, plays a role in energy expenditure and lipid metabolism. Studies in mice have shown that the absence of Them1 expression leads to increased energy expenditure and improved glucose and lipid metabolism, suggesting its involvement in metabolic disorders. Them1's activity is influenced by its dimerization and interaction with nucleotides like ATP and ADP, which affect its catalytic activities and substrate affinities (Han2012Functional). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of ACOT11 in metabolic diseases.

## Interactions
ACOT11, also known as acyl-CoA thioesterase 11, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in lung adenocarcinoma. Using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, ACOT11 was found to interact with 573 proteins in lung cancer cells. Among these, interactions with proteins such as CAMK2D, AHCY, EZR, RHEB, SMAD3, SQSTM1, ATP2A2, CTNNB1, and CSE1L were identified and further validated (Liang2020ACOT11). The interaction between ACOT11 and CSE1L, an oncogene known to promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, was confirmed, suggesting that ACOT11 may regulate tumor proliferation and invasion through this interaction (Liang2020ACOT11).

The study also highlights that ACOT11 is involved in multiple cancer signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT, CDC42, and SAPK/JNK signaling, indicating its role in a complex network of interactions that regulate lung cancer progression (Liang2020ACOT11). These interactions suggest that ACOT11 may play a role in various cellular pathways and processes related to lung cancer (Liang2020ACOT11).
