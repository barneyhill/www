# C5orf60

## Overview
C5orf60 is a gene located on chromosome 5 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 5 open reading frame 60. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling or transport processes across the cell membrane. While the specific functions of C5orf60 are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular pathways and may play a role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular homeostasis. The gene's expression and potential interactions with other proteins are subjects of ongoing research, with implications for understanding its role in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
