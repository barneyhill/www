# ECH1

## Overview
ECH1 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase 1, which is integral to the beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acid metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a hydratase and plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids by catalyzing the isomerization of specific dienoyl-CoA substrates, thereby facilitating their complete oxidation. The ECH1 gene is expressed predominantly in tissues with high metabolic activity, such as skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and the heart, where it contributes to energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. The protein's interaction with mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) is crucial for enhancing uncoupled respiration and adapting to metabolic stress conditions, such as fasting and cold exposure (Dao2019Identification). Alterations in ECH1 expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and heart disease, underscoring its significance in metabolic and cellular processes (Chen2016Deciphering; Liu2012Mitochondrial).

## Structure
ECH1 (enoyl-CoA hydratase 1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism. The primary structure of ECH1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the foundation for its higher-level structures. In terms of secondary structure, ECH1 includes both alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of ECH1 results in a stable three-dimensional conformation, essential for its enzymatic activity.

ECH1 also exhibits a quaternary structure, which may involve dimerization, allowing it to function effectively within the mitochondrial environment. The protein contains an enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase domain, which is critical for its role in catalyzing reactions in fatty acid metabolism. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, potentially influencing the enzyme's activity and regulation.

Splice variant isoforms of ECH1 can lead to structural and functional diversity, allowing the enzyme to adapt to different metabolic needs or conditions. These variations can affect the protein's stability, localization, and interaction with other mitochondrial components, highlighting the complexity and adaptability of ECH1 in human metabolism.

## Function
Enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (ECH1) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acid metabolism. It plays a crucial role in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids, which are more complex to process than saturated fatty acids. ECH1 catalyzes the isomerization of a 3-trans, 5-cis dienoyl-CoA substrate to a 2-trans, 4-trans dienoyl-CoA product, facilitating the complete oxidation of these specific fatty acid metabolites. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial oxidative function and preventing metabolic stress (Dao2019Identification).

ECH1 is predominantly active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it contributes to energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. It is expressed in highly metabolic tissues such as skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and the heart (Dao2019Identification). The interaction between ECH1 and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) is stimulated by fatty acids, enhancing uncoupled respiration and unsaturated fatty acid oxidation. This interaction is important for adapting to metabolic stress conditions, such as fasting and cold exposure (Dao2019Identification).

In the context of metabolic stress, ECH1 helps protect against lipid overload by facilitating fatty acid metabolism, which is crucial for energy balance and thermoregulation (Dao2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ECH1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), overexpression of ECH1 is associated with enhanced energy generation and increased adhesion and migration capabilities of cancer cells, contributing to metastasis. A study found a 4.1-fold increase in ECH1 expression in the mitochondria of metastatic NPC cells compared to nonmetastatic cells. Downregulation of ECH1 has been shown to inhibit tumor proliferation and reduce adhesion and migration capacity, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Liu2012Mitochondrial).

In the context of heart disease, ECH1 is significantly up-regulated in the left atria of patients with mitral regurgitation (MR), a condition that can lead to heart failure. This upregulation is part of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, which is involved in the structural remodeling of the heart (Chen2016Deciphering).

Additionally, polymorphisms in the ECH1 gene product have been identified in human striated muscle tissue, although these polymorphisms have not been directly linked to specific diseases (Kovalyov2006Polymorphism). These findings suggest that ECH1 plays a significant role in various pathological conditions through its involvement in metabolic and cellular processes.

## Interactions
Enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (ECH1) is known to interact with mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) in skeletal muscle. This interaction is direct and is stimulated by the presence of fatty acids. ECH1 interacts with specific hydrophilic domains of UCP3, particularly domains 1, 3, and 4, with the first 12 amino acids of domain 4 being crucial for the interaction. This was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro pull-down assays with purified recombinant proteins (Dao2019Identification).

The interaction between ECH1 and UCP3 is significant in the context of fatty acid metabolism. Mutations in the active site of ECH1, such as D204N and E196, reduce its interaction with UCP3, highlighting the importance of ECH1's catalytic activity. The presence of fatty acids enhances the formation of the ECH1:UCP3 complex, which is reduced when fatty acid import into mitochondria is blocked (Dao2019Identification).

In physiological conditions, such as high-fat diets, the expression of both ECH1 and UCP3 increases in skeletal muscle mitochondria, suggesting a role in adapting to metabolic stress. This interaction is crucial for maintaining energy balance and thermogenesis, as evidenced by studies in ECH1 knockout mice (Dao2019Identification).
