# KLHL26

## Overview
KLHL26 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 26, which is part of the Kelch-like (KLHL) protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including the BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, the BACK (BTB and C-terminal Kelch) domain, and multiple Kelch repeats, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions. KLHL26 is involved in the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway, primarily through its interaction with Cullin-3 (CUL3), a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of protein turnover within cells. Variants in KLHL26, such as the R237C mutation, have been linked to congenital heart defects, including Ebstein's anomaly and left ventricular noncompaction, suggesting a significant role in cardiac development (Reitter2024A; Samudrala2020Novel).

## Structure
KLHL26 is a multidomain protein that belongs to the Kelch-like (KLHL) gene family. It comprises three distinct types of domains: the BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) or POZ (POxvirus and Zinc finger) domain, the BACK (BTB and C-terminal Kelch) domain, and six Kelch repeats. These Kelch repeats form a single topologic fold, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Samudrala2020Novel). The BTB domain is known for facilitating dimerization and interaction with other proteins, which is crucial for the protein's function in cellular processes (Samudrala2020Novel).

The KLHL26 protein is suggested to interact with Cullin-3 (CUL3), a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. This interaction is potentially affected by the R237C variant located in the BACK domain, which may alter the binding affinity between KLHL26 and CUL3 (Samudrala2020Novel). Although the complete structure of KLHL26 has not been published, homology-based modeling has been employed to predict its structure (Samudrala2020Novel). Information on specific splice variant isoforms or detailed structural data is limited (Samudrala2020Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KLHL26 gene have been associated with congenital heart defects, specifically Ebstein's anomaly (EA) and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC). A study identified a novel nonsynonymous variant in KLHL26 (c.709C > T p.R237C) that segregated with these conditions in a family with a history of congenital heart defects. This variant is located in the BACK domain of KLHL26 and is predicted to minimally affect protein stability but may alter its binding affinity with Cullin-3 (CUL3), potentially disrupting the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway crucial for cardiac development (Samudrala2020Novel).

The KLHL26 gene has not been previously associated with Mendelian diseases, highlighting its novel role in the pathogenesis of EA and LVNC. The study suggests that the KLHL26 variant is fully penetrant and conserved across multiple species, indicating its potential significance in cardiac development (Samudrala2020Novel). While other genes like MYH7, FLNA, and NKX2.5 have been implicated in these conditions, the identification of KLHL26 expands the understanding of the genetic etiology of EA and LVNC (Samudrala2020Novel).

## Interactions
KLHL26 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes through protein-protein interactions. KLHL26 has been identified as a novel interacting partner with KLHL3, another member of the BTB-BACK-Kelch protein family. This interaction suggests the potential formation of heterodimers between KLHL26 and KLHL3, which may have functional roles in cellular processes (Reitter2024A).

The KLHL26 protein is also implicated in the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway. It interacts with Cullin-3 (CUL3), a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The interaction between KLHL26 and CUL3 is crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. A specific variant of KLHL26, c.709C > T p.R237C, located in the BACK domain, is predicted to alter the electrostatic interaction with CUL3, potentially affecting the ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway (Samudrala2020Novel).

These interactions highlight the role of KLHL26 in protein degradation and its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases such as Ebstein's anomaly and left ventricular noncompaction, where it may influence cardiac development through its interaction with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Samudrala2020Novel).
