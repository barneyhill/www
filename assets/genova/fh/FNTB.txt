# FNTB

## Overview
The FNTB gene encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme farnesyltransferase, which is integral to the post-translational modification process known as prenylation. This enzyme is categorized as a transferase, specifically involved in the attachment of a farnesyl group to proteins with a C-terminal CAAX motif, a modification crucial for their cellular localization and function (Yang2008Caution!). Farnesyltransferase operates primarily in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, influencing various cellular processes such as signaling, growth, and differentiation (Taheri2018Assessment). The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper functioning of proteins, including GTPases, which are pivotal in intracellular signaling pathways (Pinner2019Protein). The FNTB gene's role in encoding this enzyme underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease contexts, particularly cancer (Bachmann2022FNTB).

## Structure


## Function
The FNTB gene encodes the beta subunit of farnesyltransferase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through a process known as prenylation. This process involves the attachment of a farnesyl group to proteins containing a C-terminal CAAX motif, which is essential for their proper localization and function within the cell (Yang2008Caution!). Farnesyltransferase activity is primarily associated with the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, where it impacts various cellular processes, including cell signaling, growth, and differentiation (Taheri2018Assessment).

In healthy human cells, farnesyltransferase is involved in the prenylation of proteins such as GTPases, which are critical for intracellular signaling pathways. This modification facilitates the membrane localization of these proteins, enabling them to participate in processes like synaptic regulation, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction (Pinner2019Protein). The proper functioning of farnesyltransferase is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal development, as it ensures the correct localization and activity of proteins involved in key biological functions (Taheri2018Assessment).

## Clinical Significance
The FNTB gene, encoding the β-subunit of farnesyltransferase, has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, FNTB promoter polymorphisms, such as FNTB-173 6G > 5G and FNTB-609 G > C, have been identified as independent prognostic biomarkers, especially in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). These polymorphisms are associated with tumor characteristics and patient outcomes, including recurrence-free interval, overall survival, and breast cancer-specific survival (Bachmann2022FNTB). The FNTB-609 G > C polymorphism, in particular, is linked to reduced promoter activity and mRNA expression, influencing the prognosis of breast cancer patients (Bachmann2022FNTB).

Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), which target the enzyme encoded by FNTB, have shown potential in cancer treatment, although clinical trials have yielded limited benefits. The genetic variability of the FNTB gene may predict response to FTIs, as observed in ovarian cancer patients (Bachmann2022FNTB). Additionally, FNTB has been studied in the context of metabolic syndrome and laminopathies, although specific mutations in FNTB were not directly associated with these conditions (Dutour2011High).

## Interactions
The FNTB gene encodes the beta subunit of farnesyltransferase, which is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through the addition of a farnesyl group. This enzyme forms a complex with the alpha subunit of farnesyltransferase to recognize and modify substrates containing a C-terminal CAAX motif. The interaction between the alpha and beta subunits is crucial for the enzyme's function, as the alpha subunit is shared between farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase type I, necessitating higher expression levels to form functional complexes with the beta subunits of both enzymes (MaurerStroh2003Protein).

Farnesyltransferase interacts with various protein substrates, including members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, nuclear lamina proteins, and other proteins involved in critical cellular pathways. These interactions are significant in the context of diseases such as cancer, where the inhibition of farnesyltransferase has shown potential therapeutic effects (MaurerStroh2003Protein). The enzyme's ability to recognize and modify both tetrapeptide and pentapeptide sequences, as demonstrated in studies using peptide libraries and structural analyses, highlights its role in cellular localization, protein-protein interactions, and signaling activity (Schey2024Library).
