# GLRA3

## Overview
The GLRA3 gene encodes the glycine receptor alpha 3 (GlyRα3) subunit, which is a critical component of the ligand-gated ion channel family involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. GlyRα3 forms part of the pentameric glycine receptor complex, which functions as a chloride-permeable channel, playing a significant role in synaptic inhibition within the central nervous system (Sandholm2018Confirmation; betz2006glycine). The GlyRα3 subunit is characterized by its transmembrane domains and is involved in various physiological processes, including nociceptive processing, respiratory rhythm modulation, and modulation of ethanol sensitivity (Langlhofer2016The; San2021Contribution; Manzke2010Serotonin). The gene's expression is widespread across several brain regions, and its dysfunction has been linked to conditions such as inflammatory pain sensitization, diabetic kidney disease, and autism (Ramanathan2004A; Harvey2004GlyR; Sandholm2018Confirmation; Ceder2023The).

## Structure
The GLRA3 gene encodes the glycine receptor alpha 3 subunit, which is part of the ligand-gated ion channel family. This receptor is a pentameric structure composed of two alpha and three beta subunits, forming a chloride-permeable channel (betz2006glycine). The primary structure of the GlyRα3 subunit includes specific amino acid sequences that form transmembrane domains, with the second transmembrane segment lining the ion channel (betz2006glycine).

The secondary structure of GlyRα3 features a large extracellular domain with an α-helix and 10 β-sheets, followed by four transmembrane domains (Langlhofer2016The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices and sheets into a functional 3D shape, although detailed structural information for certain regions, like the TM3-4 loop, is limited due to its replacement by a short peptide in crystallization studies (Langlhofer2016The).

The quaternary structure of GlyRα3 involves the assembly of multiple subunits into a pentameric channel (betz2006glycine). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation play a significant role in the receptor's function, influencing ion channel properties and receptor internalization (Langlhofer2016The). The GlyRα3 subunit has splice variants, notably α3L and α3K, which differ in their desensitization behavior and synaptic localization (Notelaers2014Membrane; Langlhofer2016The).

## Function
The GLRA3 gene encodes the glycine receptor alpha 3 (GlyRα3) subunit, which is a component of inhibitory glycine receptors. These receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system by allowing chloride ions to enter neurons, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability (Sandholm2018Confirmation). GlyRα3 is expressed in various regions of the central nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampal formation, midbrain, basal ganglia, and brainstem in humans (Ceder2023The).

In the spinal cord, GlyRα3 is involved in nociceptive processing and is implicated in inflammatory pain sensitization. It is inhibited by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) through receptor phosphorylation, contributing to central inflammatory pain sensitization (Harvey2004GlyR). GlyRα3 also plays a role in respiratory rhythm modulation, where it is influenced by serotonin receptor 1A (5-HTR1A) activation, which affects glycinergic inhibition and respiratory patterns (Manzke2010Serotonin).

The GlyRα3 subunit is also involved in the modulation of ethanol sensitivity and consumption, particularly in the nucleus accumbens, where it influences glycine and GABA-activated currents and ethanol potentiation (San2021Contribution). These functions highlight the diverse roles of GlyRα3 in both inhibitory neurotransmission and various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GLRA3 gene, which encodes the glycine receptor alpha 3 subunit, have been implicated in several neurological and physiological conditions. In Finnish patients with type 1 diabetes, a variant in the GLRA3 gene, rs10011025, is associated with albuminuria, an early indicator of diabetic kidney disease. This association is particularly significant in individuals with poor blood glucose control, suggesting a population-specific genetic effect (Sandholm2018Confirmation).

GLRA3 is also involved in pain pathways, particularly in inflammatory pain sensitization. The GlyR α3 subunit is inhibited by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leading to increased pain sensitivity. Mice lacking this subunit do not exhibit the typical PGE2-induced pain sensitization, indicating its role in inflammatory pain (Harvey2004GlyR).

In autism, an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q, which includes GLRA3, has been associated with the condition. This deletion results in hemizygosity for GLRA3 and other genes, suggesting a potential role in the development of autism due to altered neurotransmitter receptor function (Ramanathan2004A).

## Interactions
The GLRA3 gene encodes the glycine receptor alpha 3 subunit, which is part of the ligand-gated ion channel family involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. The alpha 3 subunit is known to participate in forming pentameric glycine receptor complexes, typically composed of both alpha and beta subunits. These complexes are essential for the receptor's function as a chloride channel. The beta subunit plays a crucial role in anchoring the receptor to the postsynaptic membrane by interacting with gephyrin, a receptor clustering protein. This interaction is vital for the synaptic localization of glycine receptors, including those containing the alpha 3 subunit (Haverkamp2003Diversity).

While the specific physical interactions of the GLRA3 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, the involvement of gephyrin in clustering GlyRs suggests a potential interaction between GLRA3 and gephyrin. This interaction is inferred from the role of gephyrin in clustering GlyRs at synaptic sites, which is essential for their synaptic localization (Haverkamp2003Diversity). The presence of the alpha 3 subunit in synaptic clusters further supports its role in glycinergic signaling in the retina (Haverkamp2003Diversity).
