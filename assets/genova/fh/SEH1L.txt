# SEH1L

## Overview
SEH1L is a gene that encodes the SEH1 like nucleoporin, a protein that plays a critical role in cellular processes such as mitosis, nuclear pore complex (NPC) function, and mTORC1 signaling. As a nucleoporin, SEH1L is a component of the Nup107-160 complex, which is essential for proper kinetochore function and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Additionally, SEH1L is a part of the GATOR2 complex, where it contributes to nutrient sensing and mTORC1 activation by forming β-propeller structures. The protein's interactions within these complexes are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell cycle progression. Clinically, SEH1L expression levels have been linked to cancer prognosis, with implications for therapeutic targeting in various malignancies (Valenstein2022Structure; Zuccolo2007The; Feng2024SEH1L).

## Structure
SEH1L is a component of the GATOR2 complex, which plays a role in nutrient sensing and mTORC1 signaling. The protein is involved in forming β-propeller structures, specifically open six-bladed β-propellers, which are crucial for its interactions within the complex (Valenstein2022Structure). SEH1L associates stoichiometrically with MIOS and WDR24, and each core GATOR2 component donates an extra β-blade to complete its associated SEH1L or SEC13, with the N-terminal β-strand of SEH1L functioning as the outermost strand in the seventh β-blade (Valenstein2022Structure). This interaction is stabilized by conserved, hydrophobic side chains (Valenstein2022Structure).

SEH1L is part of the octagonal scaffold of the GATOR2 complex, contributing to its architecture by forming central propeller pairs with MIOS (Valenstein2022Structure). The SEH1L β-propeller dimers are positioned at opposite corners of the octagon, playing a structural role in the complex (Valenstein2022Structure). The protein's involvement in the GATOR2 complex is essential for the regulation of mTORC1 by amino acids, and its depletion destabilizes the entire complex, impairing mTORC1 activation (Valenstein2022Structure).

## Function
SEH1L, a component of the Nup107-160 complex, plays a crucial role in mitosis and nuclear pore complex (NPC) function. It is involved in the proper localization of the Nup107-160 complex to kinetochores, which is essential for maintaining kinetochore function and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Depletion of SEH1L leads to mitotic defects such as delayed mitosis, increased spindle length, and impaired kinetochore-microtubule attachments, highlighting its importance in stabilizing kinetochore-bound proteins and ensuring proper chromosome alignment (Zuccolo2007The).

SEH1L is also part of the GATOR2 complex, where it is essential for the association of nucleoporin Nup153 with mitotic chromosomes and the localization of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres. This role is critical for chromosome alignment and segregation, as SEH1L influences the centromeric localization of Aurora B, a key regulator of kinetochore-microtubule interactions (Platani2018Seh1).

In interphase, SEH1L is targeted to the NPC, where it contributes to nucleocytoplasmic transport and NPC assembly, although its interaction with the Nup107-160 complex is relatively weak (Loïodice2004The).

## Clinical Significance
The SEH1L gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. High expression levels of SEH1L are associated with poor overall survival in several cancers, including adrenocortical carcinoma, kidney chromophobe, brain lower grade glioma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, mesothelioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, and sarcoma (Feng2024SEH1L). It is also linked to shorter progression-free intervals in certain cancers, such as adrenocortical carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Feng2024SEH1L). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SEH1L is significantly up-regulated, and its silencing induces ferroptosis, thereby suppressing cancer progression through the ATF3/HMOX1/GPX4 axis (Feng2024SEH1L).

SEH1L mutations in uterine mixed endometrial carcinoma patients are associated with better prognosis in overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival (Feng2024SEH1L). The gene's expression is also linked to drug sensitivity, affecting the efficacy of certain treatments (Feng2024SEH1L). These findings suggest that SEH1L could serve as a potential therapeutic target, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, by modulating ferroptosis and influencing cancer progression (Feng2024SEH1L).

## Interactions
SEH1L is a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and is involved in several protein interactions. It is a part of the Nup107-160 subcomplex, which is crucial for mitotic progression and chromosome congression. SEH1L interacts strongly with Nup107, as evidenced by SILAC ratio analysis, indicating a stable association within the Nup107 complex during mitosis (Platani2018Seh1). SEH1L also plays a role in the GATOR2 complex, where it interacts with proteins such as WDR24 and MIOS. These interactions are essential for the stability and function of the GATOR2 complex, which is involved in mTORC1 signaling (Valenstein2022Structure).

SEH1L's interaction with the GATOR2 complex is characterized by its structural role, where it forms part of the β-propeller structure, contributing to the stability of the complex. Mutations in SEH1L can disrupt its association with other GATOR2 components, affecting mTORC1 signaling (Valenstein2022Structure). Additionally, SEH1L is involved in the regulation of mitotic spindle assembly and interacts with the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) and Aurora B kinase, influencing kinetochore-microtubule attachments (Platani2018Seh1).
