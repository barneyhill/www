# CTDNEP1

## Overview
CTDNEP1, or CTD nuclear envelope phosphatase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein phosphatase belonging to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. The protein encoded by CTDNEP1 is involved in crucial cellular processes, including nuclear envelope biogenesis and lipid metabolism, by dephosphorylating key substrates such as LIPIN1. It plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating the activity of oncogenes like MYC. CTDNEP1 forms a complex with its regulatory subunit NEP1R1, which is essential for its stability and function. Mutations in the CTDNEP1 gene have been linked to aggressive forms of medulloblastoma, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer biology (Luo2021Loss; Luo2023Loss; Carrasquillo2023Differential).

## Structure
CTDNEP1 is a protein phosphatase that belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. It consists of 244 amino acids and features a C-terminal catalytic domain characterized by a conserved active site motif, DXDX(T/V), which is crucial for its phosphatase activity (Rallabandi2023Research; Carrasquillo2023Differential). The N-terminal region of CTDNEP1 contains an amphipathic helix, spanning residues 3-30, which is essential for targeting the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nuclear envelope, and lipid droplets. This region is rich in positively charged and bulky hydrophobic residues, facilitating membrane association (Carrasquillo2023Differential).

The protein's structure includes transmembrane regions in the N-terminal, necessary for its localization to the nuclear envelope (Rallabandi2023Research). CTDNEP1 forms a complex with its regulatory subunit NEP1R1, which stabilizes the protein by reducing its proteasomal degradation (Carrasquillo2023Differential). The interaction between CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 involves a hydrophobic binding interface, crucial for their complex formation (Carrasquillo2023Differential). The three-dimensional structure of CTDNEP1 has been modeled using AlphaFold, showing high confidence in the catalytic domain but low confidence in the N-terminal region (Rallabandi2023Research). However, the complete experimental determination of its structure is still pending.

## Function
CTDNEP1 (CTD nuclear envelope phosphatase 1) is a protein phosphatase involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in nuclear envelope biogenesis by dephosphorylating LIPIN1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase, which is essential for nuclear membrane formation and lipid metabolism (Rallabandi2023Research; Carrasquillo2023Differential). CTDNEP1 is also involved in regulating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane biogenesis, limiting ER membrane expansion by promoting the dephosphorylation of lipin 1, which is crucial for maintaining ER size and nuclear solidity (Carrasquillo2023Differential).

CTDNEP1 influences genomic stability by modulating the phosphorylation states of mitotic regulators such as CDK1 and SRPK1, which are important for proper chromosome segregation and genomic stability (Luo2023Loss). It acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating MYC activity and maintaining chromosomal stability, affecting mitotic checkpoint signaling by regulating the phosphorylation of mitotic regulators like TOP2A and CHEK1 (Luo2021Loss; Rallabandi2023Research). CTDNEP1's activity is regulated by its interaction with the regulatory subunit NEP1R1, which is necessary for its stabilization and function in the ER and nuclear envelope (Carrasquillo2023Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CTDNEP1 gene are associated with aggressive medulloblastomas, particularly the MYC-driven Group 3 subtype. These mutations are significantly enriched in these tumors and are linked to MYC amplification and genomic instability, contributing to a poorer prognosis. The loss of CTDNEP1 leads to the transformation of cerebellar progenitor cells into MYC-amplified medulloblastomas, characterized by chromosomal instability and p53 loss (Luo2021Loss; Luo2023Loss). CTDNEP1 mutations disrupt its phosphatase activity, resulting in increased MYC stability and oncogenic activity, which are critical factors in tumorigenesis (Luo2021Loss).

CTDNEP1 deficiency also affects key regulators of chromosome segregation and mitotic checkpoints, such as topoisomerase TOP2A and checkpoint kinase CHEK1, leading to genomic instability (Luo2023Loss). Lower expression levels of CTDNEP1 are associated with decreased overall survival in certain medulloblastoma subgroups, indicating its tumor-suppressive role (Luo2023Loss). The loss of CTDNEP1 is sufficient to trigger MYC signaling activation and overexpression, promoting tumorigenesis through MYC activation, genomic instability, and mitotic infidelity (Luo2023Loss). These findings suggest that CTDNEP1 mutations or low expression levels define a subset of highly aggressive medulloblastomas.

## Interactions
CTDNEP1 interacts with NEP1R1 to form a catalytically active magnesium-dependent protein phosphatase complex. This interaction enhances CTDNEP1's catalytic activity towards substrates such as para-nitrophenol phosphate (pNPP) and lipin 1a, and is crucial for the dephosphorylation of lipin 1a, a well-characterized phosphoprotein substrate of CTDNEP1 (Gao2023Structure). NEP1R1 acts as a regulatory subunit, stabilizing CTDNEP1 and preventing its aggregation, which is essential for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane morphology (Gao2023Structure).

The interaction between CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 is mediated through a hydrophobic binding interface, involving specific residues such as M220, A223, and V233 in CTDNEP1, and F30 and L120 in NEP1R1. Mutations in these residues can significantly reduce the binding affinity between the two proteins, highlighting the importance of this interaction for the stability of CTDNEP1 (Carrasquillo2023Differential).

CTDNEP1's interaction with NEP1R1 is also important for its function in the lipin activation pathway, influencing the phosphorylation status and localization of lipin-1b in human cells. This interaction is necessary for the dephosphorylation of lipins-1 and -2, affecting their cellular localization and function (Han2012Nuclear).
