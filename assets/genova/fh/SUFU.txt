# SUFU

## Overview
The SUFU gene encodes the SUFU negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling, a pivotal component in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for embryonic development and cellular differentiation. The SUFU protein functions primarily as a cytoplasmic negative regulator by binding to Gli transcription factors, thereby preventing their nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of target genes. Structurally, SUFU is characterized by its N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which facilitate its interaction with Gli proteins, stabilizing them in a repressor form. This interaction is essential for maintaining the balance between the activator and repressor forms of Gli proteins, thus modulating the transcriptional response to Hh signals. Mutations in the SUFU gene can lead to various clinical conditions, including medulloblastoma and Gorlin syndrome, due to its role as a tumor suppressor and regulator of the Hh pathway (Taylor2002Mutations; Zhang2013Structural; Humke2010The).

## Structure
The SUFU protein is a critical component in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator by interacting with Gli transcription factors. Structurally, SUFU consists of two main domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which are connected by a short linker. These domains exhibit a/b folds, characterized by several alpha helices surrounding a central beta sheet (Zhang2013Structural). The NTD and CTD are involved in binding Gli proteins, forming a sandwich-like structure that stabilizes SUFU in a 'closed' conformation when bound to Gli (Zhang2013Structural).

SUFU undergoes significant conformational changes upon binding with Gli, transitioning between 'open' and 'closed' states. The 'closed' conformation is stabilized by Gli binding, while the 'open' state is promoted by Gli dissociation and Hedgehog signaling (Zhang2013Structural). An intrinsically disordered region (IDR) within SUFU, particularly in the C-terminal domain, plays a role in its interaction with Gli and may be involved in allostery or regulated autoinhibition (Cherry2013Structural).

Mutations in key residues of SUFU can disrupt its interaction with Gli, affecting its regulatory function. These mutations often impact SUFU's stability and its ability to inhibit Gli-mediated transcription (Zhang2013Structural). SUFU is also subject to post-translational modifications, which can influence its function and stability (Cherry2013Structural).

## Function
The SUFU gene encodes the Suppressor of Fused protein, a critical negative regulator of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is essential for proper embryonic development and cellular differentiation. In healthy human cells, SUFU primarily functions in the cytoplasm, where it binds to Gli transcription factors, such as Gli2 and Gli3, preventing their nuclear translocation and activation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the balance between the activator and repressor forms of Gli proteins, thereby modulating the transcriptional response of cells to Hh signals (Humke2010The; Cherry2013Structural).

SUFU stabilizes the full-length form of Gli3 (Gli3FL) by preventing its degradation and promoting its processing into the repressor form (Gli3R) (Humke2010The). In the absence of Hh signaling, SUFU retains Gli3 in the cytoplasm, facilitating its conversion into a repressor form, which is essential for controlling the transcriptional activity of Gli proteins (Humke2010The). Upon activation of the Hh pathway, SUFU dissociates from Gli proteins, allowing them to enter the nucleus and function as transcriptional activators (Humke2010The). This regulation is vital for preventing uncontrolled cell growth and maintaining normal cellular function (Zhang2013Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUFU gene are associated with several clinical conditions due to its role as a tumor suppressor and regulator of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. SUFU mutations can predispose individuals to medulloblastoma, a type of brain tumor, particularly the desmoplastic subtype. These mutations often result in truncated protein products that fail to regulate GLI transcription factors, leading to their accumulation and activation of target genes (Taylor2002Mutations).

SUFU mutations are also linked to Gorlin syndrome, characterized by developmental anomalies and a predisposition to tumors such as basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. In rare cases, SUFU mutations can cause Gorlin syndrome, with a distinct clinical phenotype and a higher risk of medulloblastoma compared to PTCH1 mutations (Ogden2018The; Pastorino2009Identification).

Additionally, SUFU mutations are implicated in Joubert syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with cranio-facial and skeletal defects. Hypomorphic recessive variants in SUFU impair the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, leading to features such as cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and polydactyly (De2017Hypomorphic). SUFU haploinsufficiency is also associated with a mild neurodevelopmental phenotype within the Joubert syndrome spectrum (Serpieri2021SUFU).

## Interactions
The SUFU protein is a critical component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, interacting with various proteins to regulate this pathway. SUFU primarily interacts with the Gli family of transcription factors, inhibiting their activity by sequestering them in the cytoplasm and preventing their transcriptional activation in the nucleus (Dunaeva2003Characterization; Zhang2013Structural). This interaction involves a specific SYGH motif in Gli proteins, which is essential for binding to SUFU (Dunaeva2003Characterization).

SUFU also forms complexes with other proteins such as p66b and Mycbp. p66b, part of the NuRD complex, acts as a negative regulator of Hh signaling by interacting with SUFU and Gli proteins, while Mycbp promotes Hh responses by enhancing Gli activity upon pathway activation (Lin2014Regulation). SUFU serves as a bridge between p66b and Gli, facilitating their interaction and modulating Gli activity (Lin2014Regulation).

In addition to these interactions, SUFU binds to the Fused (Fu) protein in Drosophila, forming a complex that includes Ci/Gli proteins. This complex is involved in the phosphorylation of Ci by Fu, a crucial step in Hh signaling (Li2020Structural). These interactions highlight SUFU's role in regulating the Hh pathway through various protein complexes and interactions.
