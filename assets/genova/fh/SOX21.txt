# SOX21

## Overview
SOX21 is a gene that encodes the SRY-box transcription factor 21, a member of the SOX family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a conserved high mobility group (HMG) box domain. This domain is essential for the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. SOX21 functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor and is involved in various developmental processes, particularly in neural differentiation and development. The protein plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation in the nervous system and other tissues. It interacts with several other proteins and signaling pathways, such as Wnt signaling, to exert its regulatory effects. Alterations in SOX21 expression have been implicated in various diseases, including certain cancers, where it may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker (Bernard2010Acquisition; Wegner1999From; Whittington2015Sox21; Fang2019SOX21).

## Structure
SOX21 is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved high mobility group (HMG) box domain, which is crucial for its DNA-binding capability. This domain consists of three alpha helices arranged in a twisted L-shape, allowing SOX21 to interact with the minor groove of DNA, inducing a bend in the DNA structure (Bernard2010Acquisition; Wegner1999From; Williams2020Post-translational). The HMG box is a conserved domain of 79 amino acids, which is typical among SOX proteins (Bernard2010Acquisition).

SOX21 belongs to the SoxB2 subgroup and contains a transcriptional repression domain located C-terminal to the HMG box, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and recruitment of co-factors necessary for gene expression or repression (Bernard2010Acquisition; Williams2020Post-translational). This repressor domain is significant for its role in neurogenesis and other developmental processes (Whittington2015Sox21).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity of SOX21, although specific modifications for SOX21 are not detailed in the available context (Williams2020Post-translational). The protein's structure and function are further modulated by interactions with other proteins, such as Y-box binding protein 1 (YB1), which affects its role in neurite outgrowth (Bernard2010Acquisition).

## Function
SOX21 is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, primarily in neural differentiation and development. In the context of adult neurogenesis, SOX21 is expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells within the hippocampal dentate gyrus, where it represses the transcription of the Hes5 gene. This repression is crucial for promoting the differentiation of progenitor cells into neurons, particularly at the type 2a cell stage, facilitating the transition to type 2b cells and beyond (Matsuda2012Sox21).

In the development of the human airway epithelium, SOX21 plays a role in balancing progenitor maintenance and differentiation. It is expressed in SOX2+ progenitor cells and acts as a suppressor of differentiation, maintaining the progenitor state. This function is context-dependent, as SOX21 can either stimulate differentiation or help maintain the progenitor pool depending on external stimuli and expression levels (Eenjes2020SOX21).

SOX21 also plays a critical role in the specification of the rostral forebrain from human embryonic stem cells by repressing Wnt signaling, particularly targeting the WNT8B gene. This repression is essential for maintaining the identity of rostral forebrain neural progenitor cells (Fang2019SOX21).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SOX21 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cervical cancer, SOX21 is associated with the expression of the long non-coding RNA SOX21-AS1, which is upregulated in cancerous tissues. This upregulation is linked to hypomethylation of the SOX21-AS1 promoter region, suggesting a co-regulatory relationship between SOX21 and SOX21-AS1. While SOX21-AS1 acts as a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer, its expression is correlated with better patient survival, indicating a potential prognostic role (Wang2019Hypomethylation).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), SOX21 and SOX21-AS1 are downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation. This silencing is associated with increased cell proliferation and invasion, and low SOX21-AS1 expression correlates with advanced cancer stages and poorer survival outcomes. Although SOX21 itself does not significantly impact clinical manifestations in OSCC, the expression of SOX21-AS1 is clinically significant, serving as a potential prognostic biomarker (Yang2016Aberrant).

SOX21 also plays a role in neural development, where its dysregulation can lead to developmental abnormalities, particularly in the forebrain, by affecting Wnt signaling pathways (Fang2019SOX21).

## Interactions
SOX21, a member of the SOX family of transcription factors, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its regulatory functions. SOX21 interacts with β-catenin, interfering with the binding of the TCF4/β-catenin complex to the WNT8B enhancer, which is crucial for modulating Wnt signaling and maintaining rostral forebrain identity during neural differentiation (Fang2019SOX21). This interaction prevents the recruitment of TCF4/β-catenin complexes to the WNT8B locus, thereby repressing WNT8B expression (Fang2019SOX21).

In the context of neurogenesis, SOX21 interacts with Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2), inhibiting its ability to activate downstream targets such as neuroD, myT1, and n-tubulin, which are essential for neuronal differentiation. This interaction helps maintain a proliferating progenitor cell population (Whittington2015Sox21). SOX21 also forms a feedback loop with SOX2, where they maintain each other's expression to sustain progenitor pools and inhibit differentiation (Whittington2015Sox21).

SOX21's interaction with Y-box binding protein 1 (YB1) modulates its activity in promoting neurogenesis. In the absence of YB1, SOX21 inhibits neurite outgrowth, whereas in its presence, SOX21 promotes neurite outgrowth, highlighting the cooperative action necessary for neurogenesis (Bernard2010Acquisition).
