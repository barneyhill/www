# DIP2C

## Overview
DIP2C is a gene that encodes the protein disco interacting protein 2 homolog C, which is involved in various cellular and metabolic processes. The protein is characterized by its conserved domains, including a DNA methylation 1 (DNMT1) associated protein 1 (DMAP) binding domain and adenylate-forming domains, suggesting its role as an epigenetic regulator and in acyl-CoA synthesis (Larsson2017Loss; Ma2019Functional). DIP2C is implicated in the regulation of DNA methylation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes that are significant in cancer development and progression (Larsson2017Loss). Additionally, mutations in the DIP2C gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders, indicating its importance in neuronal development (Zarrei2018De). The protein's involvement in both metabolic and regulatory pathways underscores its potential role in complex biological networks and disease mechanisms.

## Structure
The DIP2C protein is encoded by the DIP2C gene and is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is composed of 1,556 amino acids and contains several conserved domains that are crucial for its function. At the N-terminus, DIP2C features a DNA methylation 1 (DNMT1) associated protein 1 (DMAP) binding domain, which spans amino acids 9-119. This domain is involved in interactions with transcriptional co-repressors (Larsson2017Loss; Ma2019Functional).

The C-terminus of DIP2C includes two adenylate-forming domains (AFD), which are part of the Class I superfamily of enzymes, such as acyl- and aryl-CoA ligases. These domains contain an acyl-activating enzyme (AAE) consensus motif essential for ATP binding and adenylate formation, suggesting a role in acyl-CoA synthesis (Ma2019Functional). The protein also has 28 AMP binding sites and 10 CoA binding sites, indicating its involvement in metabolic processes (Ma2019Functional).

DIP2C is suggested to be an epigenetic regulator, with its loss leading to changes in DNA methylation patterns, which can affect gene expression and cellular processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Larsson2017Loss). The protein's structure and domains suggest its involvement in both metabolic and regulatory pathways. However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of DIP2C are not provided in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DIP2C gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cancer, particularly breast and lung cancers, DIP2C mutations are associated with tumor development and progression. The loss of DIP2C in cancer cells leads to changes in DNA methylation and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes that are crucial for cancer metastasis and progression (Larsson2017Loss). DIP2C knockout cells exhibit increased migration and markers of cellular senescence, which can stimulate tumorigenic processes (Larsson2017Loss).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, DIP2C mutations have been linked to intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and developmental delay. De novo mutations and copy-number variations (CNVs) affecting DIP2C have been reported in cases of autism and hemiplegic cerebral palsy, suggesting a role in neurodevelopmental abnormalities (Zarrei2018De). The gene's involvement in neuronal development and synaptic function may underlie these associations. DIP2C is also noted for its potential role in developmental dyslexia and other intellectual disabilities, highlighting its broader significance in neurological conditions (Zarrei2018De).

## Interactions
The DIP2C gene is implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA methylation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer development. Although a direct physical interaction between DIP2C and DMAP1 has not been demonstrated, DIP2C contains a putative binding site for DMAP1, suggesting a potential role in DNA methylation regulation (Larsson2017Loss). DMAP1 is involved in DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and DNA repair, indicating possible pathways through which DIP2C might exert its effects (Larsson2017Loss).

In the context of cancer, the loss of DIP2C in RKO colorectal cancer cells leads to changes in DNA methylation patterns and gene expression, affecting genes involved in EMT and cell migration. This suggests that DIP2C may influence tumorigenesis by modulating these processes, potentially through interactions with other proteins involved in these pathways (Larsson2017Loss). The study also notes that DIP2C knockout cells exhibit markers of cellular senescence rather than apoptosis, with implications for EMT and inflammation processes (Larsson2017Loss). While specific protein interactions of DIP2C remain to be fully elucidated, its role as an epigenetic regulator highlights its potential involvement in complex protein networks.
