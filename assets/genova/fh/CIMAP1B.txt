# CIMAP1B

## Overview
CIMAP1B is a gene that encodes the ciliary microtubule associated protein 1B, a protein involved in the structural and functional regulation of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play crucial roles in cell movement, signaling, and sensory perception. The protein encoded by CIMAP1B is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, which is essential for the stabilization and organization of microtubules within cilia. These microtubules are critical for maintaining the integrity and function of cilia, thereby influencing various cellular processes and developmental pathways. Mutations or dysregulation of CIMAP1B can lead to defects in ciliary function, which are implicated in a range of ciliopathies, disorders characterized by abnormal cilia function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
