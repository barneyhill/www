# GNAI2

## Overview
GNAI2 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit alpha i2 (Gαi2), a pivotal component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in intracellular signal transduction. This protein is categorized as a G protein subunit and plays a crucial role in modulating various cellular processes by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity, thereby reducing cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Gαi2 is integral to immune cell signaling, influencing the development and positioning of lymphocytes within lymphoid tissues, and is also involved in angiogenesis and endothelial cell function. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as microtubule-associated proteins and the Elmo1/Dock180 complex, underscore its importance in cell migration and morphology. Clinically, alterations in GNAI2 expression and mutations have been associated with several diseases, including various cancers and developmental disorders like Noonan syndrome (Villaseca2023Gαi2; Kehrl2016The; Huang2009GNAI2).

## Structure
The GNAI2 gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha i2, which is part of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in signal transduction. The protein has a predicted disorder profile of 24.5% and shares structural similarities with other Gαi proteins, such as Gαi1 and Gαi3. It features a long N-terminal intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR) and multiple post-translational modification (PTM) sites (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

Structurally, GNAI2 contains a nucleotide-binding domain known as the Ras-like domain, which exhibits GTPase activity, and an α-helical domain (α-H domain). The α-H domain partially occludes the bound nucleotide, necessitating partial opening for nucleotide release. The protein undergoes structural rearrangements in three segments, known as switches I-III, which are loops between α-helices sensitive to guanine nucleotides. Switch I undergoes a GTPγS-dependent conformational change, while switches II and III transition from a disordered to an ordered state upon GTPγS binding (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

GNAI2 also has multiple alternatively spliced isoforms with missing or altered N-terminal regions or modified C-tails, contributing to its functional diversity in signaling pathways (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Function
The GNAI2 gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha i2 (Gαi2), which is a critical component of intracellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, Gαi2 is involved in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, leading to reduced levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). This reduction in cAMP is important for various cellular responses, including the promotion of leukocyte chemotaxis, although Gαi2 is not essential for chemokine-directed cell migration (Kehrl2016The).

Gαi2 plays a significant role in immune cell signaling, particularly in the regulation of chemokine receptor signaling and the organization of secondary lymphoid organs. It is crucial for the proper development and positioning of B and T lymphocytes within lymphoid tissues. The absence of Gαi2 impairs lymphocyte chemotaxis and affects the architecture of lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and lymph nodes (Hwang2010Variations).

In endothelial cells, Gαi2 is involved in angiogenesis. Overexpression of Gαi2 enhances angiogenic activities, including cell proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation, by activating the transcription factor NFAT, which is essential for endothelial cell activation (Bai2024G). Gαi2 is active in the cell membrane and influences processes like cell growth, differentiation, and immune response regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GNAI2 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In ovarian cancer, GNAI2 expression is significantly reduced, with 84.4% of cancer samples showing expression below the normal mean. This reduction is particularly notable in clear cell and mucinous ovarian cancers and correlates with advanced tumor stages and estrogen receptor status (Raymond2014Suppression). The GNAI2 gene is also associated with the gip2 oncogene, which contains a mutation leading to a constantly active enzyme, potentially contributing to cancer progression by preventing signal termination (Raymond2014Suppression).

In glioblastoma, GNAI2 expression increases with tumor grade and is higher in IDH wild-type samples, correlating with poorer prognosis (Raza2023Comparative). The gene's overexpression is also observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, promoting cancer cell growth and survival (Jiang2010Identification).

GNAI2 mutations have been linked to Noonan syndrome, a developmental disorder. A specific G184S mutation in GNAI2 results in phenotypes similar to Noonan syndrome, such as cardiac hypertrophy and altered facial morphology, due to enhanced signaling through the Gαi2 subunit (Huang2009GNAI2).

## Interactions
GNAI2, or G protein subunit alpha i2, participates in various interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling. It interacts with microtubule-associated proteins, particularly EB1 and EB3, to regulate microtubule dynamics, which is essential for cell migration and morphology. This interaction is significant in the context of Xenopus neural crest cell migration, where GNAI2 influences cellular polarity and focal adhesion dynamics (Villaseca2023Gαi2).

GNAI2 also interacts with the Elmo1/Dock180 complex, which is involved in the activation of Rac1, a small GTPase that plays a role in actin polymerization and cell migration. This interaction is particularly noted in breast cancer cells, where it contributes to cell migration (Villaseca2022Gαi).

In immune signaling, GNAI2 interacts with Homer 3, a scaffold protein that organizes actin assembly for neutrophil polarity and motility. This interaction is unique as Homer 3 binds both the GTP and GDP bound forms of GNAI2 (Kehrl2016The).

GNAI2 is also involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, where it enhances signaling by binding to activated RTKs and the GIV/Girdin guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, facilitating downstream PI3K signaling (Nůsková2021Stearic).
