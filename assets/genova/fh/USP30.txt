# USP30

## Overview
USP30, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 30, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme primarily associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial quality control by regulating processes such as mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics. As a transmembrane protein, USP30 is involved in the removal of ubiquitin from mitochondrial proteins, thereby modulating the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, and influencing the PINK1/Parkin-mediated pathway for mitochondrial damage response (RusilowiczJones2020USP30; Wang2022USP30:). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, due to its regulatory effects on mitochondrial morphology and function (Bingol2016Mechanisms; Liang2015USP).

## Structure
USP30 is a deubiquitinating enzyme primarily expressed in human skeletal muscle and is localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane due to its transmembrane domain (Wang2022USP30:; Quesada2004Cloning). The protein consists of 517 amino acids and features a unique catalytic triad composed of Cys77, His452, and Ser477, which is distinct from the typical Asp/Asn found in other USPs (Wang2022USP30:; Quesada2004Cloning). 

Structurally, USP30 includes three subdomains: thumb, palm, and fingers, which are involved in its interaction with ubiquitin (Gersch2017Mechanism). The crystal structure of the USP30-Lys6-di-Ub complex reveals that the distal ubiquitin interacts with the S1 site, while the proximal ubiquitin interacts with the S1' site, stabilized by hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds (Wang2022USP30:). 

Post-translational modifications of USP30 include phosphorylation by IKKβ at Ser210 and Ser364, which stabilizes the protein, and ubiquitination by Parkin, leading to its degradation (Wang2022USP30:). These modifications are crucial for USP30's role in physiological processes such as mitophagy (Wang2022USP30:).

## Function
USP30 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 30) is a deubiquitinating enzyme located in the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function. It is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by modulating the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission processes. USP30's activity is essential for maintaining normal mitochondrial morphology, as its depletion leads to elongated and interconnected mitochondria, indicating a shift towards increased fusion (Nakamura2008Regulation).

USP30 also regulates mitophagy, the selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria, by counteracting the ubiquitin ligase Parkin. It removes ubiquitin from mitochondrial proteins, thereby preventing excessive mitophagy and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Bingol2016Mechanisms). This regulation is crucial for mitochondrial quality control, particularly in the PINK1/Parkin-mediated pathway, which is essential for responding to mitochondrial damage (RusilowiczJones2020USP30; Wang2022USP30:).

In addition to its role in mitophagy, USP30 influences the ubiquitylation status of mitochondrial proteins, affecting processes such as mitochondrial import and fusion. It regulates the non-degradative ubiquitination of mitofusins, which is crucial for mitochondrial fusion (Yue2014A). Overall, USP30's activity is vital for maintaining mitochondrial and cellular health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the USP30 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In Parkinson's disease (PD), USP30 plays a critical role in regulating mitophagy, the process of clearing damaged mitochondria. Overexpression of USP30 can block mitophagy, while its knockdown enhances mitochondrial degradation, suggesting that USP30 inhibition could be beneficial for PD treatment by promoting mitophagy (Marcassa2018Dual; Wang2022USP30:). 

In cancer, USP30 is involved in regulating apoptotic cell death. Its depletion enhances depolarization-induced cell death in Parkin-overexpressing cells and sensitizes cancer cells to BH3-mimetics, indicating its potential as a target for combinatorial anti-cancer therapy (Liang2015USP). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the lncRNA USP30-AS1, which regulates USP30 expression, is associated with poor prognosis. USP30-AS1 promotes AML cell viability and inhibits apoptosis, suggesting that targeting USP30-AS1 could be a therapeutic strategy (Zhou2021LncRNA).

USP30 is also implicated in pulmonary disorders, where it opposes PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, a process crucial in diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (Wang2022USP30:).

## Interactions
USP30, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is primarily associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane and plays a significant role in regulating mitophagy. It interacts with several proteins, notably TOM20, a component of the Translocase of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane (TOM) complex. This interaction is crucial as USP30 deubiquitylates TOM20, counteracting Parkin-dependent ubiquitylation and influencing mitophagy processes (RusilowiczJones2020A; Liang2015USP). USP30 also interacts with other outer mitochondrial membrane proteins such as TOM22, and its depletion leads to enhanced degradation of these proteins (Liang2015USP).

USP30's interaction with Parkin substrates, including MIRO, highlights its role in mitochondrial quality control. It deubiquitylates MIRO, affecting its post-translational stability and influencing apoptotic pathways (Liang2015USP). Additionally, USP30 is involved in the regulation of the PINK1-PARKIN pathway by modulating the ubiquitylation status of mitochondrial proteins, thereby setting the threshold for mitophagy induction (Marcassa2018Dual; RusilowiczJones2020A).

USP30 does not have known interactions with nucleic acids, focusing instead on protein-protein interactions within mitochondrial dynamics (Jiang2020Probing; Damianou2024Integrative).
