# NDUFB5

## Overview
NDUFB5 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B5, a crucial component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a key step in ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Emelyanova2017Effect; Kang2020Potentially). NDUFB5 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, with structural features that include a transmembrane helix and interactions with other subunits and lipids within the mitochondrial membrane (Padavannil2022The). The gene's expression and the protein's function are particularly significant in tissues with high energy demands, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle, and are implicated in various clinical conditions, including mitochondrial disorders and diabetic complications (Emelyanova2017Effect; Wang2024METTL3mediated).

## Structure
The NDUFB5 protein is a component of the mitochondrial respiratory complex I, playing a crucial role in its assembly and function. Structurally, NDUFB5 spans the membrane arm of complex I with a transmembrane helix (TMH) positioned between the ND4 and ND5 subunits. This TMH is involved in pinning NDUFB11 and lipid molecules onto the surfaces of ND4 and ND5, indicating a role in lipid sequestration (Padavannil2022The).

In the intermembrane space (IMS), NDUFB5 features two α-helices that run parallel to the membrane. The protein's N-terminal coil in the matrix contacts several other subunits, including NDUFB3, NDUFAB1-β, NDUFB6, NDUFB9, and ND5. This coil also forms an eyelet through which a coil of NDUFB10 threads, highlighting a significant structural interaction (Padavannil2022The).

The C-terminal coil of NDUFB5 interacts with multiple subunits, contributing to the assembly of the P D -a subassembly and the formation of the P P -b/P D -a subassembly. The TMHs of NDUFB5 cap a lipid-filled cavity, trapping lipids at the interface between ND4 and ND5, which is crucial for the stability and function of complex I (Padavannil2022The).

## Function
NDUFB5 is a subunit of the mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Emelyanova2017Effect; Kang2020Potentially). 

In healthy human cells, NDUFB5 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial respiratory function, which is vital for cellular energy metabolism. It contributes to the assembly and normal function of complex I, although it is not directly involved in the catalytic action of NADH dehydrogenase (Wang2024METTL3mediated). The protein's activity is crucial for the efficient production of ATP, which is necessary for various cellular processes and overall cellular viability (Kang2020Potentially).

NDUFB5's role in mitochondrial function is particularly significant in tissues with high energy demands, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle. Its expression and function are critical for maintaining the energetic efficiency of these tissues, especially as they age (Emelyanova2017Effect).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NDUFB5 gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial function. NDUFB5 is a subunit of Complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and its dysfunction can lead to mitochondrial disorders. In the context of septic cardiomyopathy (SC), NDUFB5 has been identified as a hub gene whose expression is significantly downregulated, particularly in the late stages of the disease. This downregulation is associated with impaired mitochondrial energetics, contributing to the progression of SC (Kang2020Potentially).

In diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), a complication of diabetes mellitus, NDUFB5 expression is also reduced, which affects cell viability, migration, and mitochondrial respiration. This reduction is exacerbated by advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are known to impair endothelial cell function. The study suggests that METTL3-mediated m6A modification can enhance NDUFB5 expression, promoting wound healing and reducing oxidative stress in diabetic conditions (Wang2024METTL3mediated).

Overall, alterations in NDUFB5 expression are linked to significant clinical outcomes in conditions involving mitochondrial dysfunction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
NDUFB5 is a subunit of the mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, also known as complex I, which plays a critical role in the electron transport chain. This protein is involved in the assembly and function of complex I, facilitating electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, a key step in ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Fu2022The; Kang2020Potentially).

In the context of diabetic foot ulcers, NDUFB5 interacts with METTL3-mediated m6A modifications, which enhance its expression and stability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). This interaction is crucial for promoting cell viability, migration, and mitochondrial respiration, particularly under stress conditions induced by advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (Wang2024METTL3mediated). The m6A reader protein IGF2BP2 also plays a role in stabilizing NDUFB5 mRNA, further supporting its expression in these cells (Wang2024METTL3mediated).

NDUFB5 is also implicated in the progression of septic cardiomyopathy, where its expression is downregulated, potentially affecting mitochondrial energetics and contributing to disease progression. It is identified as a hub gene in a gene coexpression network, suggesting its involvement in critical protein-protein interactions within the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Kang2020Potentially).
