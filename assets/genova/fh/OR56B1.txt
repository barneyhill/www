# OR56B1

## Overview
The OR56B1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 56 subfamily B member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it contributes to the vast array of olfactory responses by binding specific odor molecules, thereby initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Malki2015Class). Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR56B1 is also expressed at low levels in human blood leukocytes, suggesting a potential involvement in immune functions (Malki2015Class). The gene is characterized by a common deleterious mutation, C106R, which is prevalent in certain populations due to a relaxation of negative selection pressures, likely influenced by the high duplication rate and sequence homology of olfactory receptor genes (Pierron2013Current).

## Function
OR56B1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR56B1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory responses (Malki2015Class).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR56B1 has been detected in human blood leukocytes, although at low transcript levels compared to other Class I odorant receptors. This suggests a potential, albeit limited, role in immune cell function. The presence of OR56B1 in leukocytes indicates that it might be involved in non-olfactory processes, possibly related to immune responses (Malki2015Class).

The gene has also been noted for having a common deleterious mutation (C106R) with a high frequency in certain populations. This mutation is not attributed to positive selection but rather a relaxation of negative selection constraints, which may be due to the high duplication rate and sequence homology of olfactory receptor genes (Pierron2013Current).
