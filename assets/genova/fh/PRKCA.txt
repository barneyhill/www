# PRKCA

## Overview
The PRKCA gene encodes protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. PKCα is activated by calcium ions and diacylglycerol, and it is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it participates in various signaling pathways (Dempsey2000Protein; Li2017Regulatory). As a member of the protein kinase C family, PKCα is involved in critical physiological functions across different systems, such as cardiac contractility regulation in the cardiovascular system and T-lymphocyte activation in the immune system (Saarela2006PRKCA; Li2017Regulatory). Additionally, PKCα influences bone architecture and neuronal signaling, underscoring its diverse biological roles (Galea2014Protein; MacLeod2014PRKCA). The gene's expression and activity are subject to regulation through alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, which contribute to its functional versatility (Van2021Protein; Kofler2002Molecular).

## Structure
The PRKCA gene encodes protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of PKCα includes a regulatory domain and a catalytic domain, which are crucial for its function (Kofler2002Molecular). The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Kofler2002Molecular).

The tertiary structure of PKCα involves a C1 domain responsible for diacylglycerol binding and a C2 domain that interacts with calcium ions, which are essential for the protein's activation and function (Kofler2002Molecular). The quaternary structure may involve dimerization, although specific details on this aspect are not extensively covered in the context provided (Kofler2002Molecular).

PKCα undergoes common post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is critical for its activation and regulation (Van2021Protein). The gene also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have tissue-specific expression patterns (Kofler2002Molecular). These structural features and modifications are integral to the diverse roles of PKCα in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
The PRKCA gene encodes protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase involved in various cellular processes. PKCα plays a critical role in signal transduction pathways, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is activated by calcium and diacylglycerol and is primarily active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane (Dempsey2000Protein; Li2017Regulatory).

In the cardiovascular system, PKCα is involved in regulating cardiac contractility and calcium homeostasis in myocytes, impacting heart function and potentially influencing treatment outcomes for heart failure (Li2017Regulatory). In the immune system, PKCα is crucial for T-lymphocyte activation, particularly in T-cell receptor/CD28-induced interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene expression, which is essential for T-cell activation and immune response regulation (Saarela2006PRKCA).

PKCα also plays a role in bone architecture by regulating the balance between osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation. It influences osteoblast activity, affecting bone mass and structure, and is involved in the response to mechanical strain and hormonal changes (Galea2014Protein). Additionally, PKCα is implicated in neuronal signaling, particularly in the trafficking of NMDA receptors, which affects synaptic plasticity and memory retrieval (MacLeod2014PRKCA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRKCA gene, which encodes protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), have been implicated in various diseases. The D463H mutation in PRKCA is a hallmark of chordoid gliomas, a rare type of brain tumor. This mutation is found in the kinase domain of PKCα and is associated with increased proliferation and oncogenic properties, suggesting a gain-of-function effect. It is specific to chordoid gliomas and not found in other brain tumors, indicating its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target (Goode2018A; Rosenberg2018A).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), variations in PRKCA expression and alternative splicing have been linked to disease susceptibility. Specific polymorphisms in the PRKCA gene affect splicing and expression levels, potentially contributing to MS pathogenesis by altering immune response pathways (Paraboschi2014Functional).

In lung adenocarcinoma, high PRKCA expression is associated with poor prognosis and lower overall survival rates. PRKCA expression levels correlate with tumor stage and lymph node metastasis, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker in this cancer type (Jiang2019HDGF).

## Interactions
PRKCA (protein kinase C alpha) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the RAF1 protein, which is part of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, playing a role in cell proliferation and differentiation (Konopatskaya2009PKCα). PRKCA also interacts with GRIN2B, a subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory function (Konopatskaya2009PKCα). Additionally, PRKCA is known to interact with VASP, a protein associated with actin filament assembly, which is crucial for cell motility and adhesion (Konopatskaya2009PKCα).

PRKCA participates in multiprotein complexes and can be activated by diacylglycerol and calcium ions, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Kikkawa1983Protein). The binding of phorbol esters to PRKCA forms a quaternary complex with phosphatidylserine and calcium ions, highlighting its role as a receptor for tumor-promoting phorbol esters (Kikkawa1983Protein). This interaction is competitive with diacylglycerol, a physiological activator of PRKCA, indicating its involvement in mediating the effects of phorbol esters on cellular functions and proliferation (Kikkawa1983Protein).
