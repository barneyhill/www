# SLC18A3

## Overview
The SLC18A3 gene encodes the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), a critical protein belonging to the solute carrier family. VAChT is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the transport of acetylcholine into synaptic vesicles, facilitating neurotransmitter storage and release in cholinergic neurons. This process is essential for effective neuromuscular communication and cognitive function, as acetylcholine is a key neurotransmitter involved in muscle activation and autonomic nervous system regulation (Eiden2004The; Lawal2013SLC18:). The protein's structure, characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, is highly conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary importance (Lawal2013SLC18:). Mutations in SLC18A3 are linked to congenital myasthenic syndromes, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in neuromuscular disorders (O’Grady2016Variants; Della2021Phenotypical).

## Structure
The SLC18A3 gene encodes the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), a protein integral to the transport of acetylcholine into synaptic vesicles. VAChT is a glycoprotein composed of 530 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 68-70 kDa. It is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of the Major Facilitator Superfamily fold, and includes two potential N-linked glycosylation sites located within the luminal loop between the first and second transmembrane domains (Kim1999Mutational; Zhang2024Structural).

The tertiary structure of VAChT, as determined by cryo-electron microscopy, reveals a lumen-facing conformation with tightly sealed intracellular gates formed by hydrophobic interactions. The extracellular gate is open but partially blocked by specific residues, such as Met51 and Glu309, which regulate substrate access (Zhang2024Structural). Key residues like Asp398 and Asp425 are crucial for acetylcholine binding and transport, while others like Asp193 and Asp398 are involved in vesamicol binding (Kim1999Mutational).

VAChT may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are important for its function and membrane trafficking (Kim1999Mutational; Lawal2013SLC18:). The protein's structure and function are conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Lawal2013SLC18:).

## Function
The SLC18A3 gene encodes the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), which is essential for the transport of acetylcholine into synaptic vesicles in cholinergic neurons. This process is crucial for the exocytotic release of acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter involved in muscle activation, autonomic nervous system function, and cognitive processes (Eiden2004The; Lawal2013SLC18:). VAChT operates as an amine/proton antiporter, utilizing a proton gradient generated by ATP hydrolysis to drive the uptake of acetylcholine into vesicles (Eiden2004The). 

In healthy human cells, VAChT ensures effective neuromuscular communication by facilitating the storage and release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and within the central nervous system (Hakonen2019SLC18A3; Della2021Phenotypical). The transporter is localized to the membrane of presynaptic secretory vesicles, where it plays a critical role in maintaining normal synaptic transmission and communication between neurons (O’Grady2016Variants). VAChT's function is vital for proper neurotransmission at cholinergic nerve endings, impacting both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (O’Grady2016Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC18A3 gene, which encodes the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), are associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), a group of neuromuscular disorders characterized by impaired neuromuscular transmission. These mutations can lead to a range of clinical symptoms, including severe motor and cognitive impairments, ptosis, muscle weakness, and respiratory problems (O’Grady2016Variants; Della2021Phenotypical). Patients with compound heterozygous missense and nonsense variants in SLC18A3 often present with severe phenotypes, including muscular hypotonia, joint issues, and respiratory insufficiency (Della2021Phenotypical).

Electrophysiological studies in patients with SLC18A3 mutations have shown a presynaptic defect, with significant electrodecrement on low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation, indicating impaired acetylcholine release (O’Grady2016Variants). Treatment with pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, has shown partial effectiveness in some cases, while other treatments like 3,4-diaminopyridine have been ineffective (Della2021Phenotypical). The clinical features of SLC18A3-related CMS align with mouse models of VAChT deficiency, which exhibit severe neuromuscular dysfunction and early death in homozygous knockout mice (O’Grady2016Variants).
