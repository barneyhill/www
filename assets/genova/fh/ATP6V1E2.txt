# ATP6V1E2

## Overview
The ATP6V1E2 gene encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit E2, a crucial component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein is part of the V1 domain, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, driving proton translocation across cellular membranes. The V-ATPase complex plays a vital role in acidifying intracellular compartments such as lysosomes and endosomes, which is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation and neurotransmitter release. The E2 isoform of the subunit E is ubiquitously expressed and functionally conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular physiology (SunWada2003VacuolarH+PumpingATPasesinLuminalAcidicOrganellesandExtracellularCompartments:CommonRotationalMechanismandDiversePhysiologicalRoles).

## Function
The ATP6V1E2 gene encodes the E2 isoform of the V-ATPase subunit E, which is a component of the V1 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This complex is crucial for acidifying intracellular compartments, such as lysosomes and endosomes, in eukaryotic cells. The E2 isoform is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues and is localized in perinuclear organelles, indicating its widespread role in cellular acidification processes (SunWada2003VacuolarH+PumpingATPasesinLuminalAcidicOrganellesandExtracellularCompartments:CommonRotationalMechanismandDiversePhysiologicalRoles).

The V-ATPase complex, including the E2 isoform, is involved in ATP hydrolysis, which drives proton translocation across membranes. This activity is essential for maintaining the acidic environment necessary for the function of lysosomes and other acidic organelles. The acidic environment is critical for processes such as protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (SunWada2003VacuolarH+PumpingATPasesinLuminalAcidicOrganellesandExtracellularCompartments:CommonRotationalMechanismandDiversePhysiologicalRoles).

The E2 isoform is functionally conserved across species, as evidenced by its ability to complement the yeast vma4 mutation. It retains proton transport activity at higher temperatures, highlighting its robust role in energy coupling and proton transport in various cellular contexts (SunWada2003VacuolarH+PumpingATPasesinLuminalAcidicOrganellesandExtracellularCompartments:CommonRotationalMechanismandDiversePhysiologicalRoles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the ATP6V1E2 gene can significantly impact cellular pH homeostasis, leading to various medical conditions. Alterations in ATP6V1E2 expression or function are associated with renal tubular acidosis, a disorder characterized by the kidneys' inability to properly acidify urine, resulting in metabolic acidosis. This condition can lead to growth retardation, kidney stones, and bone demineralization due to the body's inability to maintain acid-base balance.

Additionally, ATP6V1E2 dysregulation may contribute to osteoporosis, a disease marked by decreased bone density and increased fracture risk. The impaired function of vacuolar ATPase, due to mutations in ATP6V1E2, can disrupt the acidification process necessary for bone resorption, affecting bone remodeling and strength.

Neurodegenerative diseases are also linked to ATP6V1E2 mutations. The gene's role in lysosomal function is crucial for cellular waste processing and recycling. Disruption in this process can lead to the accumulation of toxic substances within cells, contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. The precise mechanisms by which ATP6V1E2 mutations contribute to these diseases are still under investigation, but the gene's role in maintaining cellular pH and lysosomal function is critical.
