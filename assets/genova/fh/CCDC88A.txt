# CCDC88A

## Overview
The CCDC88A gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 88A, commonly referred to as Girdin or GIV. This protein is a multifunctional actin-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization. Girdin is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins, and a C-terminal domain that binds to actin and Akt, a serine/threonine kinase involved in various signaling pathways (Nahorski2016CCDC88A; Lin2014Structural). Girdin is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation, and it is essential for early brain development and the proper positioning of neuronal cells (Enomoto2009Roles; Nahorski2016CCDC88A). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Gαi3 protein, underscore its role in modulating G-protein signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics, impacting cell motility and cancer metastasis (Ghosh2010A). Additionally, mutations in CCDC88A have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Nahorski2016CCDC88A).

## Structure
The CCDC88A gene encodes the protein Girdin, also known as GIV, which is involved in cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization. Girdin is a multidomain protein with several key structural features. It contains a conserved N-terminal domain with homology to the microtubule-binding region of the Hook protein family, a coiled-coil central domain that facilitates binding to heterotrimeric G proteins, and a C-terminal domain that interacts with actin and Akt (Nahorski2016CCDC88A). The C-terminal region also includes a SH2-like domain, characterized by an antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices, which is crucial for phosphotyrosine ligand recognition and interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases (Lin2014Structural).

Girdin undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as GIV-L, which includes a PDZ-binding module (PBM) and a guanine-nucleotide exchange modulator (GEM) module. The PBM localizes GIV-L to cell junctions, while the GEM module is responsible for binding and activating G-proteins (Ear2021A). The presence of these domains and motifs allows Girdin to play a role in various cellular processes, including cell migration and signal transduction. The protein's modular structure and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, influence its interactions and functional roles (Lin2014Structural).

## Function
The CCDC88A gene encodes the protein girdin, which is involved in several critical cellular processes. Girdin is an actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation by interacting with G-protein signaling pathways (Nahorski2016CCDC88A; Enomoto2005AktPKB). It is crucial for the migration of various cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cancer cells, and neuronal cells, and is essential for early brain development (Nahorski2016CCDC88A).

Girdin interacts with the disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) protein, which is important for the proper positioning and migration of dentate granule cells in the brain's dentate gyrus during postnatal development (Enomoto2009Roles). This interaction is crucial for axonal development and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell migration and positioning (Enomoto2009Roles).

In healthy human cells, girdin also plays a role in contact-dependent growth inhibition, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis, acting as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts, such as in well-differentiated colorectal cancer cell lines (Ear2020Evolution). Girdin's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it influences actin organization and cell motility (Enomoto2005AktPKB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC88A gene are associated with PEHO-like syndrome, a condition characterized by severe intellectual disability, early onset epileptic seizures, optic nerve and cerebellar atrophy, pedal edema, and early death. A specific homozygous frameshift mutation, c.2313delT/p.Leu772X, leads to a truncated girdin protein, resulting in the loss of essential C-terminal functions. This mutation is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is linked to significant neurodevelopmental defects, including microcephaly, hypotonia, seizures, and severe developmental delays (Nahorski2016CCDC88A).

In addition to its role in neurodevelopmental disorders, altered expression of CCDC88A is implicated in the replication and secretion of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). CCDC88A enhances HBV replication by promoting endosomal trafficking and blocking autophagic degradation. Overexpression of CCDC88A increases the formation of late endosomes and reduces autophagic degradation, facilitating HBV progeny secretion. Conversely, silencing CCDC88A decreases endosome formation and restores lysosomal activity, leading to reduced HBV replication (Wang2021CCDC88AGIV). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both neurodevelopmental disorders and viral infections, underscoring its clinical significance.

## Interactions
CCDC88A, also known as GIV or Girdin, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as migration and signaling. It interacts with the serine/threonine kinase Akt, serving as a substrate that is phosphorylated upon growth factor stimulation. This phosphorylation is crucial for actin cytoskeleton remodeling, facilitating cell migration and potentially leading to cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Tanouchi2016CCDC88A). CCDC88A also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Gαi3 protein, forming a complex that is regulated by ligand stimulation. This interaction is essential for recruiting Gαi3 and actin to EGFR, influencing downstream signaling pathways (Ghosh2010A).

The protein binds to Gα subfamilies, including Gαi and Gαs, through a conserved domain, and is involved in signaling pathways such as Akt and Wnt (ENOMOTO2006Girdin; LeNiculescu2005Identification). CCDC88A also interacts with Par-3, a scaffold protein, through its CT domain, which is important for cell polarity during migration (Ohara2012Involvement). These interactions highlight CCDC88A's role in modulating G-protein signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics, impacting cell motility and cancer metastasis.
