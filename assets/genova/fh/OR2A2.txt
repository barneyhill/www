# OR2A2

## Overview
The OR2A2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily A member 2, which is a part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium (Connor2018The). As a transmembrane receptor, it is involved in the initial steps of olfactory signal transduction by binding specific odor molecules and activating associated G-proteins. The expression and function of OR2A2 are influenced by various factors, including age, maternal BMI, and environmental exposures such as nitrogen dioxide (Lee2022Prenatal). Evolutionary studies suggest that olfactory receptor genes, including OR2A2, have undergone relaxed negative selection, allowing for greater genetic variability and potential functional diversity within human populations (Pierron2013Current).

## Function
The OR2A2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Connor2018The). The molecular function of OR2A2 includes G protein-coupled receptor activity and taste receptor activity, as indicated by its Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (Lee2022Prenatal).

In addition to its role in olfaction, the OR2A2 gene has been associated with various environmental and physiological factors. It is linked to age, maternal body mass index (BMI), and exposure to nitrogen dioxide, suggesting that its expression and function may be influenced by these factors (Lee2022Prenatal). The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its potential impact on broader physiological functions beyond olfaction, although the specific mechanisms in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated. The relaxation of negative selection on olfactory receptor genes, including OR2A2, suggests an evolutionary tolerance for deleterious mutations, which may affect the gene's function and variability in the human population (Pierron2013Current).
