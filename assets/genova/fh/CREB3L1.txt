# CREB3L1

## Overview
CREB3L1 is a gene that encodes the cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 1, a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, particularly in response to stress. The protein, also known as OASIS, is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It becomes active through regulated intramembrane proteolysis, allowing its N-terminal domain to translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression. CREB3L1 plays a significant role in the ER stress response, hormone synthesis, and extracellular matrix formation, and is involved in osteoblast differentiation and thyroid function. It interacts with several proteins, including DYNLL1, to enhance its transcriptional activity and is implicated in various diseases, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, cancer, and fibrosis (Zhao2024The; García2017CREB3L1mediated; Greenwood2024Dimerization).

## Structure
The CREB3L1 protein, also known as OASIS, is a 519 amino acid long protein that features several key structural components. It contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic region with a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain spanning amino acids 292-353, which is essential for DNA binding and nuclear localization (Guillemyn2019A). This domain includes a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) crucial for its function. The protein also has a transmembrane domain that anchors it in the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Guillemyn2019A).

Under stress conditions, CREB3L1 undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) at the Golgi apparatus, releasing the N-terminal active factor that translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes (Guillemyn2019A). Mutations in the bZIP domain, such as p.(Ala304Val), can lead to conformational changes that impair nuclear translocation by affecting the NLS and the protein's α-helical conformation (Guillemyn2019A).

CREB3L1 is part of the CREB/ATF family and is involved in cellular stress responses, particularly in osteoblasts and thyroid cells, where it regulates the secretory pathway and Golgi complex expansion (García2017CREB3L1mediated).

## Function
CREB3L1, also known as cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 1, is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and becomes active through regulated intramembrane proteolysis in the Golgi apparatus, allowing its N-terminus to function as a transcription factor (Zhao2024The). CREB3L1 plays a crucial role in the ER stress response, hormone synthesis and secretion, extracellular matrix formation, and cell proliferation (Greenwood2024Dimerization).

In the thyroid, CREB3L1 is activated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to the expansion of the Golgi complex and increased expression of transport factors, which are essential for the secretory pathway (García2017CREB3L1mediated). It also regulates the expression of the sodium/iodide symporter, important for thyroid hormone synthesis (Zhao2024The). In bone tissues, CREB3L1 is involved in osteoblast differentiation and bone morphogenesis by activating the transcription of Type I collagen (Zhao2024The).

CREB3L1 also influences neuroendocrine functions, such as the regulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) transcription, which is crucial for hydromineral homeostasis (Zhao2024The). Its interaction with the DYNLL1 protein enhances the transcriptional activation of CREB3L1 target genes, including AVP (Greenwood2024Dimerization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CREB3L1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Somatic mutations in CREB3L1 contribute to osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by fragile bones. A specific 3-bp in-frame deletion in exon 7 of the CREB3L1 gene has been linked to both mild and severe forms of OI, with homozygous individuals experiencing more severe symptoms (Keller2018Monoallelic).

In cancer, CREB3L1 expression is frequently altered. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CREB3L1 is often epigenetically silenced through DNA methylation, which is associated with high-grade tumors and poor prognosis. This silencing may contribute to the aggressive nature of TNBC by promoting metastasis and reducing the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin (Ward2016Epigenetic). In thyroid cancer, CREB3L1 expression is elevated, correlating with tumor stage and negatively impacting overall survival (Zhao2024The).

CREB3L1 is also implicated in fibrosis, acting as a downstream factor in the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway, contributing to tissue fibrosis in conditions such as renal and liver fibrosis (Zhao2024The). Its role in these diseases highlights the clinical significance of CREB3L1 in both genetic disorders and cancer progression.

## Interactions
CREB3L1, a member of the CREB3 subfamily of bZIP transcription factors, engages in various protein interactions that influence its function as a transcription factor. One significant interaction is with the hub protein DYNLL1, which enhances CREB3L1's transcriptional activity. This interaction is facilitated by a TQT binding motif in CREB3L1, crucial for DYNLL1 protein interactions. DYNLL1 acts as a molecular glue, potentially aiding in CREB3L1 heterodimerization with other proteins like CREB3L2 (Greenwood2024Dimerization).

CREB3L1 is also involved in the ER stress response, where it interacts with proteins such as ATF6 and XBP1, playing a role in the unfolded protein response. It regulates the expression of genes like DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (Ddit3) and X-Box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) in response to stress (Zhao2024The).

In the context of cancer and fibrosis, CREB3L1 interacts with karyopherin subunit alpha 2 (KPNA2) to facilitate its nuclear translocation, enhancing IL-1α synthesis and promoting cancer-associated fibroblasts differentiation. It also forms a complex with Smad4 in the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway, contributing to tissue fibrosis (Zhao2024The).
