# ELOVL6

## Overview
ELOVL6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6, which is a microsomal enzyme involved in the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the fatty acid elongation process. ELOVL6 plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by converting medium-chain fatty acids into long-chain fatty acids, which are essential for various cellular functions, including membrane composition and energy storage (Corominas2013Polymorphism; Matsuzaka2009Elovl6:). The activity of ELOVL6 is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), particularly SREBP-1c, and its function is linked to metabolic processes such as insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis (Matsuzaka2009Elovl6:; WeissHersh2019Saturated). Alterations in ELOVL6 expression have been associated with various metabolic disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as well as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (Wang2023A; WeissHersh2019Saturated; Wang2024Identifying).

## Function
The ELOVL6 gene encodes a microsomal enzyme that plays a critical role in the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, specifically those with 12, 14, and 16 carbon atoms, converting them into longer-chain fatty acids. This enzyme is integral to the endogenous fatty acid synthesis pathway, contributing to the formation of long-chain fatty acids essential for cellular functions (Matsuzaka2009Elovl6:). ELOVL6 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the elongation process by adding two carbon units to fatty acyl-CoA substrates (Corominas2013Polymorphism).

In healthy human cells, ELOVL6 is involved in maintaining the balance of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes, which is crucial for lipid metabolism and energy storage (WeissHersh2019Saturated). The enzyme's activity affects the composition of fatty acids, increasing levels of palmitate and palmitoleate while reducing stearate and oleate levels (Matsuzaka2009Elovl6:). ELOVL6 expression is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), particularly SREBP-1c, which are key regulators of lipid metabolism (Matsuzaka2009Elovl6:). The enzyme's function is linked to energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity, with implications for conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes (WeissHersh2019Saturated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ELOVL6 gene have been linked to several metabolic and liver-related conditions. In the context of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), ELOVL6 plays a significant role in the development of hepatic insulin resistance and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by modifying fatty acid composition. The absence of ELOVL6 function has been shown to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, providing protection against liver injury, but it also promotes gallstone formation in certain mouse models (Kuba2015Absence).

ELOVL6 is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's Disease (PD), ELOVL6 is identified as a potential biomarker related to lipid metabolism, with its expression being downregulated in PD patients. This suggests a role in PD pathogenesis, possibly through pathways involving oxidative phosphorylation (Wang2024Identifying).

In cancer biology, ELOVL6 is involved in metabolic reprogramming, promoting lipogenesis in cancer cells. Its knockdown in hepatocellular carcinoma cells reduces cell proliferation and tumor growth, indicating its potential as a target for cancer therapies (Wang2023A).

ELOVL6 also plays a role in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, where its expression is modulated by dexmedetomidine, a sedative that exhibits protective effects against such injuries (Yuan2024Alleviation).
