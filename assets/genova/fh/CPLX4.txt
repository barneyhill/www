# CPLX4

## Overview
CPLX4 is a gene that encodes the protein complexin 4, which is a crucial component in the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, particularly within the retina. Complexin 4 is categorized as a synaptic protein due to its role in modulating neurotransmitter release at synapses. It achieves this by binding to the SNARE complex, thereby stabilizing it and facilitating the rapid, calcium-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles necessary for efficient synaptic transmission (Meyer2024Characterization; Sivakumar2024Synergistic). The expression of CPLX4 is predominantly observed in the retina, where it is localized in the ribbon synapses of rod and cone photoreceptors as well as cone bipolar cells, contributing to the specialized release mechanisms required for continuous neurotransmitter release in these cells (Meyer2024Characterization; Sivakumar2024Synergistic). The protein's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as farnesylation, which are essential for its membrane targeting and synaptic role (Meyer2024Characterization; Sivakumar2024Synergistic).

## Function
Complexin 4 (CPLX4) is a protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, a key process in neurotransmitter release at synapses. It functions by binding to the SNARE complex, which is essential for vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. This interaction stabilizes the SNARE complex, facilitating rapid calcium-triggered fusion necessary for synaptic transmission (Meyer2024Characterization; Sivakumar2024Synergistic). CPLX4 is primarily expressed in the retina, specifically in rod and cone photoreceptor terminals and cone bipolar cells, where it contributes to the unique release machinery of ribbon synapses, specialized for continuous neurotransmitter release (Meyer2024Characterization; Sivakumar2024Synergistic).

CPLX4 contains a CAAX box motif for post-translational farnesylation, which aids in membrane targeting and is crucial for its function in modulating synaptic transmission (Meyer2024Characterization; Sivakumar2024Synergistic). This protein also plays a dual role in synaptic transmission by facilitating evoked release and suppressing spontaneous release, ensuring precise regulation of neurotransmitter release (Meyer2024Characterization). In the absence of CPLX4, there are alterations in synaptic vesicle dynamics and electroretinographic recordings, indicating its importance in maintaining normal retinal function (Babai2016Functional).

## Interactions
Complexin 4 (CPLX4) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily within the context of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. CPLX4 interacts with the SNARE complex, which includes proteins such as Syntaxin 1 (Stx1), SNAP25, and Synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP2). These interactions are facilitated by the central α helix of CPLX4, which binds to the groove between Stx1 and Synaptobrevin 2, stabilizing the SNARE complex and enabling rapid Ca2+-triggered fusion (Meyer2024Characterization). CPLX4 also interacts with Syntaxin 3 (Stx3), which substitutes for Stx1 in retinal ribbon synapses, indicating its role in specialized synaptic environments (Lux2024Lightdependent).

In the retina, CPLX4 is specifically expressed in ribbon synapses of photoreceptors and bipolar cells, where it interacts with the ribbon synapse-specific protein RIBEYE. However, the interaction between CPLX4 and RIBEYE could not be conclusively validated in some experimental setups, possibly due to technical limitations (Meyer2024Characterization).

CPLX4 also interacts with the G protein transducin, specifically its subunits Gαt1 and Gβ1, in the context of rod photoreceptor ribbon synapses. These interactions suggest a role for CPLX4 in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, although it is not required for the light-induced translocation of transducin (Lux2024Lightdependent).
