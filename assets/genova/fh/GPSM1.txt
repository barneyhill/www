# GPSM1

## Overview
GPSM1, or G protein signaling modulator 1, is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic protein involved in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. The protein, also referred to as GPSM1, functions primarily as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), modulating the activity of Gα i/o subunits by maintaining them in their GDP-bound state. This regulatory role is crucial for various cellular processes, including the modulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP levels (Kwon2012Gprotein). GPSM1 is implicated in diverse physiological functions, such as inflammation regulation, metabolic homeostasis, and cellular repair mechanisms. It is expressed in various tissues, including macrophages, where it influences inflammatory pathways, and in the kidney, where it plays a role in epithelial cell recovery post-injury (Lenarczyk2014Localization; Yan2022GPSM1). Additionally, GPSM1 has been associated with several clinical conditions, including leukemia, primary ovarian insufficiency, obesity, and polycystic kidney disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yan2022GPSM1; Kwon2012Gprotein; Cai2020Depletion; Zhang2021Knockdown).

## Function
GPSM1, or G protein signaling modulator 1, is a cytoplasmic protein that plays a significant role in regulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. It modulates the activity of G proteins by acting as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), binding to Gα i/o subunits in their GDP-bound state. This interaction potentially affects adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP levels, which are crucial for various cellular processes (Kwon2012Gprotein).

In macrophages, GPSM1 influences the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway, affecting the transcription of TNFAIP3, a key regulator in terminating NF-κB-driven inflammatory signals. The loss of GPSM1 activates this pathway, leading to increased TNFAIP3 transcription and repression of NF-κB signaling, thereby reducing inflammation (Yan2022GPSM1). GPSM1 is also involved in metabolic homeostasis, as its deficiency in macrophages leads to increased energy expenditure and protection against diet-induced obesity (Yan2022GPSM1).

In the kidney, GPSM1 is expressed in the distal tubular segments and is involved in epithelial cell repair and recovery, particularly during the proliferative phase following ischemia-reperfusion injury (Lenarczyk2014Localization). In ovarian granulosa cells, GPSM1 regulates the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway, influencing cell survival and apoptosis (Cai2020Depletion).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPSM1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), GPSM1 is upregulated, and its high expression is associated with poor overall survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Knockdown of GPSM1 in leukemia cell lines inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in leukemia (Zhang2021Knockdown).

In primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a specific mutation in GPSM1, c.1840C > A, has been identified as a susceptibility locus. This mutation is linked to increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation in ovarian granulosa cells, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of POI (Cai2020Depletion).

GPSM1 also plays a role in metabolic disorders. Its expression is elevated in the visceral fat of individuals with obesity, correlating with clinical traits of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). GPSM1 influences pro-inflammatory pathways in macrophages, contributing to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Mice with GPSM1 deficiency show protection against diet-induced obesity and metabolic disturbances, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders (Yan2022GPSM1).

In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), GPSM1 deficiency accelerates cystic disease progression in mouse models, suggesting its involvement in cyst formation and renal function impairment (Kwon2012Gprotein).

## Interactions
GPSM1, also known as G protein signaling modulator 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with Gα i/o subunits in their GDP-bound state, acting as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) to modulate G protein signaling (Kwon2012Gprotein). GPSM1 can bind up to four Gα i subunits, although the expected impact on cAMP production in renal epithelial cells has not been observed (Kwon2012Gprotein).

GPSM1 also interacts with Gβγ subunits, which may release free Gβγ to mediate biological functions such as mitotic spindle orientation and ion channel function. This interaction enhances the activity of the PC1/PC2 ion channel complex, a nonselective cation channel, by potentially interacting with Gβγ subunits. The coexpression of PC1 with PC2 is necessary for GPSM1 to affect channel activity, indicating a possible role for Gβγ in modulating this interaction (Kwon2012Gprotein).

In macrophages, GPSM1 interacts with the Gα i3 protein, influencing the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling axis. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of NF-κB signaling, as Gα i3 knockdown blocks GPSM1-induced P65 phosphorylation (Yan2022GPSM1). GPSM1's role in these interactions highlights its importance in various cellular processes and signaling pathways.
