# CYP3A7

## Overview
CYP3A7 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 7, a crucial component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the fetal liver and is involved in the metabolism of endogenous steroids and xenobiotics, playing a vital role in fetal development. Structurally, CYP3A7 is characterized by a high content of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and catalytic activity (Wright2019Structural). Functionally, it is responsible for the 16α-hydroxylation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate derivative, as well as the metabolism of all-trans retinoic acid, which is essential for protecting the fetus from excessive estradiol exposure and embryotoxicity (Lacroix1997Expression; Li2019Neonatal). The expression of CYP3A7 declines after birth, as CYP3A4 becomes the predominant isoform, reflecting a shift in metabolic needs (Lacroix1997Expression). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various disease states, including cancer, where specific alleles like CYP3A7*1C have been linked to altered drug metabolism and disease outcomes (Johnson2016Cytochrome).

## Structure
CYP3A7 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, primarily expressed in the fetal liver. The protein's structure is characterized by a high content of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of the P450 fold, which contributes to its stability and catalytic activity (Wright2019Structural). The tertiary structure of CYP3A7 reveals a more rigid active site compared to CYP3A4, due to unique folding of the F-G segment and the extension of the β3-β4 strands, which result in a narrower substrate channel and steric constraints (Sevrioukova2021Structural).

Key structural features include a rotameric switch in the F304 residue, which affects the F-G fragment and its interactions with the I-E-D-helical core, leading to a more rigid structure (Sevrioukova2021Structural). The F304 residue in CYP3A7 adopts an 'upward' conformation, influencing the surrounding hydrophobic interactions and access to the heme (Sevrioukova2021Structural). The protein's quaternary structure involves crystallographic dimers formed by antiparallel D-helices and G'-helices, with polar and hydrophobic interactions contributing to dimerization (Sevrioukova2021Structural).

CYP3A7 also has a splice variant, CYP3A7-3AP1, which results in a longer protein with a unique sequence due to a frameshift mutation (Li2019Neonatal). This variant is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with higher expression in fetal livers.

## Function
CYP3A7 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme predominantly expressed in the fetal liver, where it plays a crucial role in the metabolism of endogenous steroids and xenobiotics. It is involved in the 16α-hydroxylation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate derivative (DHEAS), which is important for regulating steroid hormone levels and protecting the fetus from excessive estradiol exposure (Lacroix1997Expression; Li2019Neonatal). This enzyme also metabolizes all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) to less toxic metabolites, protecting against embryotoxicity and teratogenicity (Sevrioukova2021Structural; Li2019Neonatal).

CYP3A7 is the major cytochrome P450 isoform in fetal liver, contributing significantly to the biotransformation of various substrates during fetal development (Lacroix1997Expression). Its activity is highest in the fetal liver and declines after birth as CYP3A4 expression increases, reflecting a shift in metabolic needs from fetal to adult life (Lacroix1997Expression). Despite its reduced catalytic ability compared to CYP3A4, CYP3A7's role in steroid metabolism is crucial for fetal development and adaptation to extrauterine life (Sevrioukova2021Structural).

## Clinical Significance
The CYP3A7 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in the metabolism of endogenous hormones and xenobiotics, which can influence various disease states and conditions. Mutations and alterations in CYP3A7 expression are linked to fetal development issues, such as intrauterine growth retardation and premature birth, due to its role in metabolizing dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and synthesizing estrogen during pregnancy (Li2019Neonatal).

The CYP3A7*1C allele, resulting from a gene conversion event with CYP3A4, leads to the expression of CYP3A7 in adults and is associated with adverse outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), breast cancer, and lung cancer. This allele is linked to reduced serum DHEAS and estrone levels, potentially affecting cancer outcomes by altering the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents that are CYP3A substrates (Johnson2016Cytochrome).

In breast cancer, the CYP3A7*1C allele is associated with increased lymph node metastasis and mortality, while in lung cancer, it correlates with higher all-cause mortality. In CLL, it is linked to an increased risk of disease progression (Johnson2016Cytochrome). These findings suggest that CYP3A7 plays a significant role in cancer prognosis and treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
CYP3A7, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, engages in several interactions critical for its enzymatic function. One significant interaction is with cytochrome P450 reductase, an electron donor protein. The T409R mutation in CYP3A7 enhances the electrostatic potential on its proximal face, facilitating the docking of cytochrome P450 reductase through complementary electrostatic interactions. This interaction is crucial for the enzymatic activity of CYP3A7, as it promotes the binding of the redox partner and stimulates the enzyme's turnover (Sevrioukova2021Structural).

CYP3A7 is also involved in regulatory interactions with nuclear receptors. The pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) modulate CYP3A7 expression. PXR, in particular, binds as a heterodimer with the retinoic acid receptor (RXR) to activate CYP3A7 transcription through specific enhancer modules (Li2019Neonatal). The CYP3A7*1C allele, which involves a promoter region swap with CYP3A4, affects PXR and CAR binding, leading to postnatal expression of CYP3A7 (Burk2002Molecular). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network influencing CYP3A7 expression and activity.
