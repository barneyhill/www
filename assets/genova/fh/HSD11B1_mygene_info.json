In addition, the encoded protein can catalyze the reverse reaction, the conversion of cortisone to cortisol.

Mutations in this gene and H6PD (hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (glucose 1-dehydrogenase)) are the cause of cortisone reductase deficiency. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.[provided by RefSeq, May 2011].", "symbol": "HSD11B1", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1415736"}, "unigene": "Hs.195040", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P28845", "TrEMBL": ["A0A087WU76", "X5D2L1", "A0A0A0MQV1"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "11?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1"}}
