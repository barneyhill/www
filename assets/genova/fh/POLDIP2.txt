# POLDIP2

## Overview
POLDIP2, or polymerase delta interacting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and mitochondrial function. The protein, also referred to as POLDIP2, is characterized by its interaction with DNA polymerase delta and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), enhancing the efficiency of DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms. It plays a significant role in translesion synthesis, facilitating the bypass of DNA lesions and maintaining genomic stability. Beyond its nuclear functions, POLDIP2 is involved in mitochondrial activities, influencing mitochondrial morphology and reactive oxygen species production, which are essential for cellular homeostasis. Additionally, POLDIP2 impacts cellular redox signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly in vascular smooth muscle cells, by regulating the activity of Nox4, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex. This regulation affects cell migration, proliferation, and cytoskeletal integrity, underscoring POLDIP2's role in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Lyle2009Poldip2; Hernandes2017Polymerase; Kulik2021Crystal).

## Structure
The POLDIP2 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes distinct domains and dynamic regions. Its primary structure is composed of a sequence of amino acids that form a high β-strand content, as confirmed by circular dichroism analysis (Kulik2021Crystal). The secondary structure features a globular fold with a YccV-like domain and a DUF525 domain. The YccV-like domain (residues 67-200) includes a five-membered antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices, while the DUF525 domain (residues 233-368) has a fibronectin type III/immunoglobulin fold, comprising two opposing four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (Kulik2021Crystal).

The tertiary structure of POLDIP2 reveals a compact two-domain β-strand-rich globular structure with a central channel that may influence structural changes mediated by redox conditions (Kulik2021Crystal). The protein's quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but its interactions with other proteins suggest a role in forming complexes.

POLDIP2 contains three putative PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box motifs, with PIP2 being the most accessible for PCNA binding due to its location on a flexible loop (Kulik2021Crystal). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation on Ser 147 and Ser 150, which may affect its interaction with PCNA (Kulik2021Crystal). The protein's dynamic flexibility, particularly in the N-terminal domain, facilitates interactions with various partners, enhancing its role in genome stability and mitochondrial metabolism (Kulik2021Crystal).

## Function
POLDIP2, or Polymerase δ-interacting protein 2, is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily DNA replication and repair. It interacts with DNA polymerase δ and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), enhancing the efficiency of DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms. POLDIP2 plays a significant role in translesion synthesis (TLS), facilitating the bypass of DNA lesions by interacting with TLS polymerases such as Pol η and Pol λ, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Hernandes2017Polymerase; Kulik2021Crystal).

In addition to its nuclear functions, POLDIP2 is involved in mitochondrial activities. It contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence and localizes within the mitochondrial matrix, where it influences mitochondrial morphology and function. This includes roles in mitochondrial fusion and the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which are crucial for cellular homeostasis (Hernandes2017Polymerase; Kulik2021Crystal).

POLDIP2 also impacts cellular redox signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly in vascular smooth muscle cells, by regulating the activity of Nox4, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex. This regulation affects cell migration, proliferation, and cytoskeletal integrity, highlighting POLDIP2's role in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Lyle2009Poldip2).

## Clinical Significance
POLDIP2 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular processes. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), POLDIP2 is downregulated in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. Its overexpression in NSCLC cells enhances tumor growth and invasiveness, while knockdown reduces these characteristics, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Huang2022The; Chen2018Knockdown). POLDIP2 is also involved in cardiovascular diseases, where it regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and extracellular matrix composition. Alterations in POLDIP2 expression can lead to increased arterial stiffness and affect vascular function, contributing to conditions like atherosclerosis and hypertension (Sutliff2013Polymerase; Hernandes2017Polymerase).

In neurological diseases, POLDIP2 is upregulated after ischemic stroke, increasing cytokine production and blood-brain barrier permeability. It also plays a role in Tau aggregation, impacting Alzheimer's disease progression (Huang2022The). In renal diseases, POLDIP2 is involved in pathways affecting renal fibrosis and fluid retention (Huang2022The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of POLDIP2 in various diseases, suggesting that mutations, expression alterations, or interaction changes could have significant impacts on disease progression and treatment strategies (Huang2022The).

## Interactions
POLDIP2 (DNA polymerase delta interacting protein 2) is a multifunctional protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids involved in DNA replication and repair. It binds to the small subunit p50 of DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), enhancing Pol δ's activity and stabilizing its interaction with PCNA (Gagarinskaya2020A). POLDIP2 also interacts with PrimPol, a primase/polymerase, enhancing its DNA polymerase activity by increasing its processivity and DNA binding capacity, although it has minimal effect on PrimPol's primase activity (Guilliam2016PolDIP2). This interaction is facilitated by a unique arginine cluster in POLDIP2, which enhances PrimPol's primer-template and dNTP binding affinity (Kasho2020A).

POLDIP2 is involved in translesion synthesis (TLS) and interacts with other TLS polymerases such as Pol η, Rev1, and the Rev7 subunit of Pol ζ, stimulating their catalytic activities and facilitating error-free bypass of DNA lesions (Gagarinskaya2020A). It also binds to viral proteins, including the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein and the Epstein-Barr virus replication protein BBLF2/3, suggesting a role in viral DNA replication (Gagarinskaya2020A).
