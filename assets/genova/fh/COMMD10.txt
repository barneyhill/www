# COMMD10

## Overview
COMMD10 is a gene that encodes the protein COMM domain containing 10, which is a member of the COMMD protein family. This protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal COMM domain, which is essential for its ability to form dimeric structures and engage in protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for its role in various cellular processes, including endosomal membrane trafficking and the regulation of ion channels. COMMD10 is involved in the modulation of NF-κB signaling, copper homeostasis, and embryonic development, particularly in neural plate formation. It is expressed in multiple tissues, with significant expression in the liver, stomach, and spleen, and is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. The protein's interactions with other COMMD family members and its involvement in the CCC complex underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating transmembrane protein trafficking (Phan2023COMMD10; Fan2019Expression; Healy2018Structural).

## Structure
COMMD10 is a member of the COMMD protein family, characterized by a conserved C-terminal COMM domain essential for dimerization and protein-protein interactions (Healy2018Structural). The COMM domain forms a tightly interlocked dimeric structure, facilitating both homo- and heterodimerization with other COMMD proteins, such as COMMD2 and COMMD5, to form stable heteromeric complexes (Healy2018Structural). These interactions are crucial for the protein's role in endosomal membrane trafficking and association with the CCC complex (Healy2018Structural).

The N-terminal region of COMMD10, known as the HN domain, is more variable and may confer unique functions, although it is not essential for membrane association (Healy2018Structural). COMMD10 interacts with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits, suggesting a regulatory role in ion channel trafficking and ubiquitination (Ware2018Epithelial).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of COMMD10 are not provided, the protein's ability to form heteromeric complexes and its interactions with other proteins are well-documented, highlighting its functional significance in cellular processes (Ware2018Epithelial; Healy2018Structural).

## Function
COMMD10 (COMM domain containing 10) is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including the regulation of NF-κB signaling, copper homeostasis, and endosomal trafficking. In healthy human cells, COMMD10 plays a significant role in modulating the inflammatory response by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, which is crucial for controlling inflammation and immune responses. This protein is known to reduce the nuclear translocation of the p65 NF-κB subunit, thereby suppressing excessive inflammatory responses and potentially affecting tumorigenesis (Mouhadeb2018Impaired; Fan2019Expression).

COMMD10 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the liver, stomach, and spleen. It is located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, where it may act as a transcription factor, particularly in hepatocytes, influencing liver diseases (Fan2019Expression). The protein is also involved in embryonic development, particularly in neural plate development during embryogenesis, highlighting its essential role in early development (Phan2023COMMD10).

COMMD10 interacts with other COMMD proteins and is part of the CCC complex, which is involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating the trafficking of transmembrane proteins (Mouhadeb2018Impaired).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COMMD10 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In HCC, COMMD10 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Reduced expression of COMMD10 in HCC tissues is associated with increased tumor progression and decreased apoptosis, leading to poorer overall survival in patients. Overexpression of COMMD10 enhances apoptosis by modulating the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-9/3 pathway, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker for early-stage HCC (Yang2021COMMD10; You2023COMMD).

In CRC, downregulation of COMMD10 is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with lymphatic and distant metastasis. COMMD10 inhibits NF-κB signaling by targeting the p65 subunit, reducing its nuclear translocation, and potentially accelerating its ubiquitination. This suppression of NF-κB activity is crucial in preventing the expression of genes involved in inflammation and metastasis (Yang2017FMNL2).

COMMD10 expression also varies across other cancer types, with high expression correlating with better survival outcomes in renal clear cell carcinoma. Its role in regulating oncogenes like NF-κB and HIF suggests that COMMD10 could be a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Fan2019Expression; You2023COMMD).

## Interactions
COMMD10 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It specifically binds to the p65 subunit of the NF-κB complex, inhibiting its nuclear translocation and thereby suppressing NF-κB signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (Yang2021COMMD10). This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal domain of COMMD10, which binds to the Rel homology domain of p65 (Yang2021COMMD10).

COMMD10 is also involved in the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) by interacting with its subunits and affecting their trafficking and function. It interacts with the α-, β-, and γENaC subunits, influencing their ubiquitination and endocytosis through its interaction with Nedd4-2, a negative regulator of ENaC (Ware2018Epithelial).

In addition, COMMD10 forms complexes with other COMMD family members, such as COMMD5, through its C-terminal COMM domain. This domain facilitates the formation of homo- and heterodimeric complexes, which are part of the CCC complex involved in endosomal membrane trafficking (Healy2018Structural). COMMD10 also interacts with CCDC22 and CCDC93, proteins that are part of the CCC complex, through its COMM domain (Healy2018Structural).
