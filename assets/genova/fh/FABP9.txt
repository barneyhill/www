# FABP9

## Overview
FABP9, or fatty acid binding protein 9, is a gene that encodes a member of the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family, specifically known as testis-type FABP (TFABP). The protein encoded by FABP9 is primarily expressed in the testis and is involved in the binding and transport of long-chain fatty acids within cells. It plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and signaling, particularly in the context of sperm maturation and fertility. The protein's structure is characterized by a conserved beta-barrel, which facilitates the binding of fatty acids, and is crucial for maintaining sperm quality by protecting fatty acids from oxidation. Despite its specific expression in the testis, FABP9 shares structural homology with other FABPs, indicating similar functional roles in lipid handling (Nam2024Evaluation; Smathers2011The; Storch2008The).

## Structure
FABP9, also known as testis-type FABP (TFABP), is a member of the fatty acid-binding protein family, characterized by a conserved beta-barrel structure. This structure is formed by ten antiparallel beta-strands, creating a solvent-accessible ligand-binding cavity that accommodates long-chain fatty acids (Rademacher2002Solution; Storch2008The). The cavity is larger than the volume of the fatty acid it binds and contains ordered water molecules that are hydrogen-bonded to internal polar residues (Storch2008The). 

The protein's tertiary structure is highly conserved across the FABP family, despite moderate sequence similarity, and includes two short alpha helices that cap the beta-barrel (Smathers2011The). FABP9 shares significant homology with other FABPs, such as M-FABP, A-FABP, and H-FABP, suggesting similar binding affinities for long-chain fatty acids (Smathers2011The). 

FABP9 is primarily expressed in the testis and plays a role in determining germ cell fate and preserving sperm quality. It is located at chromosome 8q21.13 and is found in the inner acrosomal membrane and outer face of the nuclear envelope of mammalian sperm (Smathers2011The). The protein's structure allows for conformational flexibility, which is crucial for its function in binding and releasing ligands (Nam2024Evaluation). Specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of FABP9 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
FABP9, also known as Testis FABP or T-FABP, is a member of the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family, primarily expressed in the testis. It is located at chromosome 8q21.13 and is found in the inner acrosomal membrane and outer face of the nuclear envelope of mammalian sperm (Smathers2011The). FABP9 is involved in the binding and transport of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) within cells, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and signaling. This protein is hypothesized to protect sperm fatty acids from oxidation, thereby maintaining their ability to fertilize oocytes (Smathers2011The).

During spermatogenesis, FABP9 is expressed in the mammalian testis, suggesting its involvement in sperm maturation and fertility. Although FABP9 knockout mice exhibit significant increases in sperm head abnormalities, they remain fertile, indicating that other proteins, such as FABP12, might compensate for its function (Smathers2011The). The protein's role in healthy cells includes trafficking hydrophobic ligands to various cellular compartments for storage, oxidation, membrane synthesis, and signaling, as well as interacting with phospholipid-rich membranes and other proteins for ligand transfer (Smathers2011The).
