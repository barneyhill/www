# AURKB

## Overview
Aurora kinase B (AURKB) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, known as aurora kinase B, which plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. As a member of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), aurora kinase B is essential for accurate chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, ensuring proper cell division (Hauf2003The; Krenn2015The). The protein's kinase activity is tightly regulated through phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins, such as INCENP, borealin, and survivin, which are components of the CPC (Elkins2012Crystal; Borah2021Aurora). Dysregulation of AURKB expression or function is associated with various cancers, where it contributes to genomic instability and tumor progression, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Zhang2024Overexpression; Borah2021Aurora).

## Structure
Aurora kinase B (AURKB) is a serine/threonine protein kinase with a conserved molecular structure that includes an N-terminal domain, a kinase domain, and a C-terminal domain. The kinase domain is highly conserved among aurora kinases and features a bilobal structure with a β-stranded lobe on the N-terminal side and an α-helical lobe on the C-terminal side, connected by a hinge region (Tang2017Aurora; Borah2021Aurora). The C-terminal lobe contains the catalytic T-loop, which is crucial for its activation through auto-phosphorylation at Thr232 (Goldenson2014The; Borah2021Aurora).

AURKB is part of the chromosomal passenger complex, which includes INCENP, survivin, and borealin, forming its quaternary structure (Borah2021Aurora). This complex is essential for its role in mitosis and cytokinesis. AURKB undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which regulates its activity and stability (Abdul2019Structural).

The protein also contains degrons such as the KEN motif, D-box, and DAD/A box, which mediate its degradation (Borah2021Aurora). These structural features and modifications are critical for AURKB's function in cell cycle regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.

## Function
Aurora kinase B (AURKB) is a critical component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which plays a vital role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. AURKB is involved in several key processes, including the regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) (Krenn2015The). It phosphorylates various substrates, such as the Ndc80 complex, to modulate microtubule-binding affinity and kinetochore stability, which is essential for chromosome bi-orientation (Krenn2015The).

AURKB's activity is crucial for correcting erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments by destabilizing them, thus preventing premature mitotic exit and ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Hauf2003The; Krenn2015The). It indirectly activates the SAC by generating unattached kinetochores, which are necessary for SAC signaling (Krenn2015The). AURKB also plays a role in the recruitment of checkpoint proteins such as BubR1 and Bub1 to kinetochores, which is essential for maintaining the spindle checkpoint (Hauf2003The).

The kinase's activity is regulated by its subcellular localization, which changes during different mitotic phases to target distinct substrates (Krenn2015The). This regulation is influenced by tension-dependent spatial separation from its substrates, affecting its phosphorylation potential (Krenn2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Aurora kinase B (AURKB) is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression, which often correlates with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AURKB overexpression is associated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals. It is considered an independent predictor of prognosis and a potential biomarker for HCC detection (Zhang2024Overexpression). In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), AURKB is frequently overexpressed, contributing to genetic instability and shorter progression-free survival (Smith2005Overexpression). 

In bladder cancer, AURKB knockdown reduces cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest, highlighting its role in cancer progression through modulation of the p53 DNA damage response pathway (Li2024AURKB). AURKB is also overexpressed in other malignancies, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, glioblastoma, and gastric cancer, where it is linked to reduced survival and increased tumor invasiveness (Borah2021Aurora). The gene's deregulation can lead to aneuploidy and genomic instability, making it a target for therapeutic intervention (Borah2021Aurora).

## Interactions
Aurora kinase B (AURKB) is a key component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which includes INCENP, borealin, and survivin. This complex is crucial for regulating mitotic events such as chromosome-microtubule attachment and cytokinesis. AURKB interacts with the C-terminal region of INCENP, which is essential for its activation and localization. The binding of INCENP to AURKB involves a domain swap of the activation loop, resulting in a unique conformation of the DFG motif (Elkins2012Crystal; Carmena2012The).

AURKB also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. It phosphorylates p53 at specific sites, leading to its degradation via the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. This interaction suppresses the expression of p53 target genes involved in cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis, such as p21 and PUMA (Gully2012Aurora; Wu2011Aurora). The interaction between AURKB and p53 is mediated by NIR, forming a complex that suppresses p53's transcriptional activity (Wu2011Aurora).

AURKB's activity is regulated by other kinases, such as Chk1, which phosphorylates it at Ser311, and by phosphatases like PP1 and PP2A, which counteract its phosphorylation of substrates at the kinetochore (Carmena2012The).
