# OR9A2

## Overview
The OR9A2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 9 subfamily A member 2, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules and the initiation of olfactory signal transduction. Olfactory receptors, including OR9A2, are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The OR9A2 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity of odorant recognition and the perception of smell. Variations in this gene may influence olfactory sensitivity and have been studied in the context of olfactory disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
