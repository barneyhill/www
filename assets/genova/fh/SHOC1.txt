# SHOC1

## Overview
The SHOC1 gene encodes the protein shortage in chiasmata 1, which plays a pivotal role in meiotic recombination, particularly in the formation and stabilization of crossover recombination intermediates. This protein is part of the XPF/RAD1/MUS81 family of nucleases, characterized by a conserved ERCC4-(HhH)2 core structure, although it lacks nuclease activity. Instead, SHOC1 is involved in binding and stabilizing DNA branched structures, such as Holliday junctions, to facilitate proper chromosome segregation during meiosis. It interacts with proteins like TEX11 and SPO16, forming complexes essential for crossover formation and chromosome synapsis. Mutations in SHOC1 are linked to conditions such as non-obstructive azoospermia, highlighting its critical role in fertility and meiotic progression (Yao2020Biallelic; Guiraldelli2018SHOC1).

## Structure
The SHOC1 protein is characterized by a conserved ERCC4-(HhH)2 core structure, which is typical of the XPF/RAD1/MUS81 family of nucleases. This core includes two helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motifs linked by a connector helix, which are involved in non-sequence specific DNA binding (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). The SHOC1 protein preferentially binds to single-stranded DNA and DNA branched structures, such as Holliday junctions and D-loops, with the (HhH)2 domains playing a crucial role in this binding (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). Despite its structural similarity to nucleases, SHOC1 lacks in vitro endonuclease activity, suggesting a role in stabilizing DNA structures rather than cleaving them (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1).

SHOC1 interacts with TEX11, a protein involved in chromosome synapsis and crossover formation, indicating its involvement in meiotic recombination (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). The protein may function as a monomer in mammals, although it could potentially interact with other proteins like EME1 or FAAP24 (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). The SHOC1 protein's structure and interactions suggest it plays a critical role in the formation and stabilization of crossover recombination intermediates during meiosis.

## Function
The SHOC1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the formation of crossover recombination intermediates during mammalian meiosis. It is involved in the mid-stage steps of crossover (CO) formation, which is crucial for proper chromosome segregation during meiosis (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). SHOC1 is characterized by putative ERCC4-like nuclease motifs, similar to members of the XPFG/MUS81 family of nucleases, but it appears to lack nuclease activity. Instead, SHOC1 is proposed to bind DNA branched structures to stabilize them, protecting against dissociation by anti-crossover activities (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). 

SHOC1 exhibits high affinity for single-stranded DNA and ATPase activity, similar to human recombinant FANCM-FAAP24, which targets DNA structures containing single-stranded DNA (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). It interacts with TEX11, a protein involved in chromosome synapsis and CO formation, suggesting a role in linking SHOC1 to chromosome structure and recombination sites (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). SHOC1's interaction with TEX11 and other synaptonemal complex components indicates its involvement in the recruitment and stabilization of recombination proteins (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). The absence of SHOC1 may lead to embryonic lethality, highlighting its essential role in meiosis (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SHOC1 gene are associated with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition characterized by a complete lack of sperm in the ejaculate due to testicular atrophy. This condition is linked to meiotic arrest, where spermatogenesis is halted at the zygotene stage of meiosis I prophase I, preventing the formation of haploid germ cells (Yao2020Biallelic). SHOC1 mutations, particularly bi-allelic loss-of-function variants, lead to truncated proteins that disrupt normal meiotic progression, resulting in infertility (Rotte2024Genotypespecific; Cioppi2021Genetics).

In mouse models, SHOC1 deficiency results in sterility and early spermatocyte arrest, highlighting its crucial role in meiotic recombination and chromosomal synapsis. This deficiency leads to persistent double-strand breaks and incomplete synapsis, causing meiotic arrest (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). The gene's dysfunction is also linked to increased apoptosis in seminiferous tubules and defective crossover formation, further contributing to male infertility (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1).

The clinical implications of SHOC1 mutations extend to potential fertility treatments, where preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) might be beneficial for couples dealing with male-factor infertility related to SHOC1 and other ZZS complex genes (Rotte2024Genotypespecific).

## Interactions
The SHOC1 protein is integral to the formation of crossover recombination intermediates during mammalian meiosis. It interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate this process. SHOC1 forms a complex with TEX11, a protein required for normal synapsis and crossover formation in mice. This interaction suggests that TEX11 may act as a scaffold protein, assisting in the recruitment and stabilization of SHOC1 and other proteins to recombination sites (Guiraldelli2018SHOC1). 

SHOC1 also interacts with the SPO16 protein, forming a dimeric complex that is crucial for the stabilization of recombination intermediates. This complex is involved in the processing of meiotic recombination intermediates, promoting the formation of crossover-prone structures (Zhang2019SPO16). 

In Arabidopsis, SHOC1 forms an XPF-ERCC1-like complex with the protein PTD, which is essential for class I crossover formation. This complex is thought to recognize and stabilize branched DNA structures, potentially recruiting other factors to promote crossover formation (Macaisne2011SHOC1). 

These interactions highlight SHOC1's role in stabilizing DNA structures and facilitating the formation of crossovers during meiosis.
