# TAB1

## Overview
TAB1 (TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a pivotal adaptor protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein product of TAB1 is integral to the activation of TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a serine/threonine kinase, which plays a crucial role in mediating inflammatory and stress responses. TAB1 facilitates the autophosphorylation and activation of TAK1, thereby influencing key signaling cascades such as the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. These pathways are essential for regulating cell survival, immune responses, and development. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it responds to external stress signals and maintains cellular homeostasis (Xu2021TAK1-TABs; Ajibade2013Cell; Roh2014TAK1).

## Function
TAB1 (TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 1) is a critical adaptor protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the activation of TAK1 (MAP3K7). In healthy human cells, TAB1 is essential for the kinase activity of TAK1, as it constitutively binds to the N-terminal kinase domain of TAK1, facilitating its autophosphorylation and activation. This interaction is crucial for regulating key signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are involved in cell survival, immune response, and development (Xu2021TAK1-TABs; Roh2014TAK1).

TAB1 is involved in the phosphorylation and activation of TAK1, which is necessary for the downstream signaling pathways that prevent apoptosis and promote cell survival. It is also implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses, as it plays a role in the phosphorylation of TAK1 at threonine 187 (Thr187) after TNF-a and IL-1b stimulations, which is crucial for NF-kB and MAPK activation (Xu2021TAK1-TABs).

In the cellular context, TAB1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it maintains cellular homeostasis and responds to external stress signals. Its role is vital for the proper functioning of immune signaling and stress response pathways (Ajibade2013Cell).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the TAB1 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In lung adenocarcinoma, TAB1 S438 phosphorylation is associated with poor prognosis and promotes tumorigenesis by sustaining p38 MAPK activation, which is crucial for cancer cell survival under glucose deprivation (Wei2022GFAT1linked). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TAB1 is a direct target of microRNA-889, and its suppression by miR-889 reduces cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Dong2019microRNA‑889).

In diabetic nephropathy, TAB1 is upregulated under high glucose conditions, leading to increased glycolysis and pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. This contributes to kidney damage, and targeting TAB1 with siRNA or lentivirus has shown potential in reducing inflammation and pathological manifestations of the disease (Zeng2020TAB1).

In colorectal cancer, miR-873 targets TAB1, and its downregulation leads to increased NF-κB signaling and cell proliferation. This interaction suggests that miR-873 and TAB1 play significant roles in CRC progression and could serve as therapeutic targets (Gong2018miR‑873).

In endometritis, miR-211 negatively regulates TAB1, reducing inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, highlighting its potential therapeutic value in treating inflammatory diseases (Yang2021MicroRNA211).

## Interactions
TAB1 (TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 1) is a key adaptor protein involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for signaling pathways related to inflammation and stress responses. TAB1 interacts with TAK1 (MAP3K7), forming a complex that is essential for the activation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways. This interaction is facilitated by the ubiquitination of TAB1, which enhances its binding to TAK1 and promotes TAK1 phosphorylation (Charlaftis2014The; Zhao2021TRIM26).

TAB1 also interacts with p38α MAPK, recruiting it to the TAK1 complex, which is necessary for the phosphorylation of other proteins such as TAB3. This interaction is important for the regulation of the TAK1 complex and the activation of downstream signaling pathways (Xin2013Crystal; Mendoza2008Roles).

In addition, TAB1 forms a specific interface with the BIR1 domain of XIAP, which is crucial for XIAP-induced NF-κB activation. This interaction involves significant van der Waals forces and is essential for TAK1 activation, highlighting the role of TAB1 in NF-κB signaling (Lu2007XIAP). These interactions underscore the importance of TAB1 in cellular signaling and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
