# AQP10

## Overview
AQP10 is a gene that encodes the protein aquaporin 10, a member of the aquaglyceroporin subfamily of aquaporins. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane channel that facilitates the transport of water and small solutes, such as glycerol, across cell membranes. Aquaporin 10 is predominantly expressed in the small intestine, particularly in the duodenum and jejunum, where it plays a crucial role in water absorption. Additionally, it is involved in glycerol transport in adipose tissue, contributing to processes like lipogenesis and lipolysis. The protein's unique structural features, including a pH-dependent gating mechanism, allow it to regulate glycerol flux, which is significant for maintaining glycerol homeostasis and influencing metabolic processes (Gotfryd2018Human; Laforenza2013Aquaporin10; Hatakeyama2001Cloning).

## Structure
The human AQP10 protein is a member of the aquaglyceroporin subfamily of aquaporins, characterized by its ability to transport water and glycerol. The primary structure of AQP10 consists of 301 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of approximately 31.8 kDa (Ishibashi2002Cloning). The protein includes six transmembrane domains, a common feature among aquaporins, and contains two NPA motifs, NPAFS and NPARD, which are crucial for its function (Ishibashi2002Cloning).

The secondary structure of AQP10 involves six transmembrane helices (TM1-TM6) that form a conducting channel (Gotfryd2018Human). The tertiary structure reveals a unique feature in its selectivity filter, known as the aromatic and arginine (ar/R) selectivity filter, which is wider than in other aquaporins, suggesting a distinct selectivity mechanism (Gotfryd2018Human). AQP10 also has a cytoplasmic gate that is pH-dependent, involving the His80 residue, which regulates glycerol permeability (Gotfryd2018Human).

In terms of quaternary structure, AQP10 forms a tetramer, with each monomer providing an independent channel (Pimpão2021Mechanisms). The protein has three putative glycosylation sites and two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, indicating potential post-translational modifications (Ishibashi2002Cloning). AQP10 exists in two forms: a fully-spliced form with aquaglyceroporin function and an unspliced form with poor function due to the absence of a sixth transmembrane domain (Ishibashi2024New).

## Function
Aquaporin 10 (AQP10) is a protein that functions as a channel facilitating the transport of water and small solutes across cell membranes. In healthy human cells, AQP10 is primarily expressed in the small intestine, particularly in the duodenum and jejunum, where it plays a significant role in water absorption. This protein increases osmotic water permeability, although to a lesser extent than AQP8, and its activity is inhibited by mercury chloride, indicating its function as a water channel (Hatakeyama2001Cloning).

AQP10 is also involved in glycerol transport, particularly in adipose tissue. It has a unique pH-dependent gating mechanism that regulates glycerol flux, which is crucial for processes like lipogenesis and lipolysis in adipocytes. The protein's structure includes a glycerol-specific gate and a pH sensor, His80, which triggers structural changes under low pH conditions, facilitating glycerol passage (Gotfryd2018Human). This mechanism allows AQP10 to play a role in glycerol homeostasis and fat metabolism, potentially impacting obesity and metabolic diseases (Gotfryd2018Human). AQP10's presence in adipocytes suggests it contributes to glycerol efflux, which is important for maintaining normal adiposity (Laforenza2013Aquaporin10).
