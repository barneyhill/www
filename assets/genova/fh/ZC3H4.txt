# ZC3H4

## Overview
ZC3H4 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type containing 4 protein, which is characterized by the presence of CCCH-type zinc finger motifs. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of transcription, particularly in the termination of non-coding RNA transcription. It functions as a scaffold within the ZWC complex, interacting with other proteins such as WDR82 and CK2, and plays a crucial role in maintaining transcriptional homeostasis by suppressing divergent antisense RNA transcription. The protein's interactions with RNA polymerase II and its presence at transcription start sites underscore its significance in transcriptional regulation. ZC3H4 is metazoan-specific and has been implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including its potential role in the pathogenesis of silicosis and its association with somatic mutations in pineal cysts (Park2022ZWC; Yang2018Silica‐induced; Estell2021ZC3H4).

## Structure
ZC3H4 is a protein characterized by the presence of CCCH-type zinc finger motifs, which are involved in RNA binding (Estell2021ZC3H4). These zinc finger motifs are flanked by intrinsically disordered regions, suggesting a flexible structure that may facilitate interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Estell2021ZC3H4). The protein is metazoan-specific and shares structural similarities with the Drosophila Suppressor of Sable (Su(s)), although they have little sequence homology (Estell2021ZC3H4). 

ZC3H4 interacts with WDR82, a key transcriptional termination factor, indicating its role in transcription regulation (Estell2021ZC3H4). The protein is also associated with RNA polymerase II, suggesting a mechanism for its recruitment to promoter-proximal regions (Estell2021ZC3H4). While the specific tertiary and quaternary structures of ZC3H4 are not detailed, its interaction with other proteins and its role in transcriptional regulation imply a complex structural organization. 

The protein's function is further modulated by its interaction with circular RNAs, such as circZC3H4, which regulate its expression and are involved in processes like epithelial to mesenchymal transition (Jiang2019The). However, specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ZC3H4 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating non-coding transcription in human cells. It is involved in the termination of transcription for non-coding RNAs, particularly antisense RNAs and those transcribed from super-enhancers. ZC3H4 is metazoan-specific and its depletion leads to the upregulation and extension of unstable transcripts, highlighting its importance in maintaining transcriptional homeostasis (Estell2021ZC3H4). The protein is found at loci where it functions directly in transcription, and its tethering to reporter RNA promotes degradation by the exosome (Estell2021ZC3H4).

ZC3H4 interacts with WDR82, a known transcriptional termination factor, suggesting a shared pathway in transcription regulation (Estell2021ZC3H4). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveal that ZC3H4 occupies promoter regions, with a broader distribution than Pol II, indicating its role is not limited to transcriptional start sites (Estell2021ZC3H4). The gene's recruitment to chromatin is supported by its ability to crosslink to RNA, and its occupancy is more pronounced at distal intergenic regions, including super-enhancers (Estell2021ZC3H4). These findings suggest that ZC3H4 is directly involved in transcriptional regulation, particularly in non-coding RNA and certain protein-coding genes (Estell2021ZC3H4).

## Clinical Significance
The ZC3H4 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the context of pineal cysts, somatic mutations in the ZC3H4 gene were identified in two samples, making it the only gene with mutations detected in more than one sample. However, the clinical significance of these mutations in pineal cysts remains uncertain (Yan2021Germline).

ZC3H4 is also involved in the pathogenesis of silicosis, a lung disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis due to silica exposure. The gene plays a role in macrophage activation, with increased expression of ZC3H4 protein observed in alveolar macrophages upon silica exposure. This activation contributes to fibroblast proliferation and migration, key processes in fibrosis (Yang2018Silica‐induced).

Additionally, ZC3H4 is part of the ZWC complex, which regulates transcription by suppressing divergent antisense RNA transcription. Depletion of ZC3H4 leads to increased antisense transcription, suggesting its role in maintaining transcriptional fidelity. While the clinical implications of these transcriptional changes are not fully understood, they highlight the gene's importance in transcription regulation (Park2022ZWC).

## Interactions
ZC3H4 is involved in several protein interactions, forming part of the ZWC complex, which includes WDR82, CK2α, and CK2β. ZC3H4 acts as a scaffold within this complex, facilitating interactions with WDR82 and CK2, and is crucial for the interaction between WDR82 and CK2 (Park2022ZWC). The ZWC complex is associated with transcription start sites of active genes, where it plays a role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with the Ser5-phosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). This interaction is essential for suppressing divergent antisense RNA transcription at active gene promoters (Park2022ZWC).

ZC3H4 also interacts with WDR82, a known transcription termination factor, suggesting a role in transcription termination and RNA biogenesis (Estell2021ZC3H4). The interaction with WDR82 is significant, as both proteins share a common pathway in restricting non-coding transcription (Estell2021ZC3H4). ZC3H4's recruitment to its targets may occur through interactions with WDR82, which binds to Pol II phosphorylated on Serine 5 (Estell2021ZC3H4). These interactions highlight ZC3H4's role in regulating transcription and maintaining genomic stability.
