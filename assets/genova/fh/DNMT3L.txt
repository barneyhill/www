# DNMT3L

## Overview
DNMT3L is a gene that encodes the DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein, a regulatory protein involved in the epigenetic modification of DNA. Although DNMT3L itself lacks intrinsic DNA methyltransferase activity, it plays a pivotal role in facilitating DNA methylation by interacting with the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. This interaction is crucial for the establishment of genomic methylation patterns, particularly during germ cell development and early embryogenesis, where DNMT3L is highly expressed. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind to the N-terminal tail of histone H3 when it is unmethylated at lysine 4, thereby influencing the recruitment and activation of DNMT3A and DNMT3B. DNMT3L's function is essential for processes such as genomic imprinting and the silencing of retrotransposons, contributing to genomic stability and integrity (Ooi2007DNMT3L; Veland2018DNMT3L).

## Structure
DNMT3L is a regulatory protein that lacks intrinsic DNA methyltransferase activity but plays a crucial role in DNA methylation by interacting with DNMT3A and DNMT3B. Structurally, DNMT3L contains a PHD-like domain at its N-terminus, which interacts with histone H3 tails that are unmethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4) (Jurkowska2008Formation; Veland2018DNMT3L). The C-terminal region of DNMT3L resembles the classical fold of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases, although it does not bind the cofactor itself (Jia2007Structure).

DNMT3L forms a heterotetrameric complex with DNMT3A, consisting of two DNMT3A and two DNMT3L molecules, which is essential for the methylation of imprinted genes (Jurkowska2008Formation; Jia2007Structure). This complex is characterized by a butterfly shape and involves hydrophobic interactions at the DNMT3L-DNMT3A interface, which are crucial for the catalytic activity of DNMT3A (Jurkowska2008Formation; Jia2007Structure). The interaction between DNMT3L and DNMT3A stabilizes the active-site loop of DNMT3A, enhancing its enzymatic function (Jia2007Structure).

DNMT3L is highly expressed in germ cells and early embryos, where it is essential for establishing maternal genomic imprints (Veland2018DNMT3L). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and function. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, or tertiary structures of DNMT3L are not provided in the available context.

## Function
DNMT3L is a regulatory protein that plays a crucial role in establishing DNA methylation patterns, particularly during germ cell development. Although DNMT3L lacks intrinsic DNA methylation activity, it enhances the activity of the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B by interacting with them. This interaction is essential for the proper establishment of genomic methylation patterns, which are critical for processes such as genomic imprinting and the silencing of retrotransposons (Ooi2007DNMT3L; Suetake2004DNMT3L).

DNMT3L specifically binds to the N-terminal tail of histone H3 when it is unmethylated at lysine 4, facilitating the recruitment or activation of DNMT3A2 to induce de novo DNA methylation. This binding is inhibited by methylation at lysine 4, indicating a role in recognizing specific histone modifications to guide methylation processes (Ooi2007DNMT3L; Jurkowska2008Formation).

In healthy cells, DNMT3L is involved in maintaining genomic stability by ensuring uniform methylation patterns across CpG sites, which is important for silencing repetitive elements and maintaining genome integrity. Its absence can lead to meiotic defects and the reactivation of retrotransposons, highlighting its importance in germ cell development and overall organismal health (Wienholz2010DNMT3L; Liao2012Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DNMT3L gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Polymorphisms in DNMT3L, such as rs2070565, have been linked to increased susceptibility to male infertility, specifically azoospermia, and early-onset schizophrenia, particularly in individuals with a family history of the condition (Saravanaraman2020De). Additionally, certain haplotypes, like ACCC + T for rs8129776, rs7354779, rs113593938, and rs2276248, are associated with a higher risk of ovarian endometriosis (Saravanaraman2020De).

The DNMT3L gene plays a role in genomic imprinting, and its dysregulation can lead to developmental disorders and cancer. Although DNMT3L itself is catalytically inactive, it acts as a co-factor for DNMT3A and DNMT3B, enhancing their methylation activity, which is crucial for establishing DNA methylation patterns during development (AAPOLA2004Epigenetic; Velasco2018Genetics). A rare polymorphic variant of DNMT3L, R271Q, is associated with subtelomeric hypomethylation, suggesting a potential link to genome instability (Hamidi2015Genetic). These genetic alterations in DNMT3L are implicated in disease predisposition, pathogenesis, progression, adverse treatment outcomes, and shorter survival (Saravanaraman2020De).

## Interactions
DNMT3L interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA methylation processes. It forms a complex with DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, enhancing their methylation activity. This interaction is facilitated by the carboxyl-terminal half of DNMT3L, which directly binds to DNMT3A and DNMT3B, stimulating their activity without binding to DNA itself (Suetake2004DNMT3L). DNMT3L also interacts with the N-terminal tail of histone H3, specifically recognizing unmethylated lysine 4 (H3K4). This interaction is crucial for recruiting or activating DNMT3A and DNMT3B for de novo DNA methylation (Ooi2007DNMT3L; Jurkowska2008Formation).

In addition to its interactions with DNMT3A and DNMT3B, DNMT3L forms complexes with transcription factors, such as NFkB-p65, to target specific DNA sequences. The DNMT3L/DNMT3B/NFkB-p65 complex is important for the methylation of specific DNA regions, with DNMT3L acting as a bridge between DNMT3B and NFkB-p65 (Pacaud2014DNMT3L). These interactions highlight DNMT3L's role in modulating DNA methylation through protein-protein interactions and its ability to influence chromatin structure and gene expression.
