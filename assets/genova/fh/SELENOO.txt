# SELENOO

## Overview
SELENOO is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial protein selenoprotein O, which is part of the selenoprotein family characterized by the inclusion of the amino acid selenocysteine. Selenoprotein O plays a crucial role in maintaining redox homeostasis and cellular stress responses, primarily through its redox-active C-x-x-U motif. This motif enables the protein to engage in reversible redox interactions, which are essential for cellular oxidative stress management. Additionally, selenoprotein O exhibits a unique activity within the protein kinase superfamily, known as AMPylation, where it transfers AMP from ATP to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues on protein substrates. This activity underscores its importance in cellular redox balance and mitochondrial function, potentially influencing aging and disease resistance (Labunskyy2014Selenoproteins:; Dogaru2023“Alphabet”; Tsuji2021Historical).

## Function
Selenoprotein O (SELENOO) is a mitochondrial protein involved in maintaining redox homeostasis and cellular stress responses. It contains a C-x-x-U motif, which suggests a role in redox activity, similar to other selenoproteins. This motif allows SELENOO to interact in a redox manner with target proteins, a process that is reversible and dependent on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations, indicating a thiol-dependent oxidoreduction capability (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”).

SELENOO also exhibits a novel activity within the protein kinase superfamily, known as AMPylation. It transfers AMP from ATP to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues on protein substrates. This activity is crucial for proteins involved in redox homeostasis, suggesting SELENOO's role in maintaining cellular redox balance, which is vital for cellular health and function (Tsuji2021Historical).

The presence of a protein kinase-like domain in SELENOO further supports its involvement in these processes, although its exact function remains partially characterized. The protein's localization in the mitochondria underscores its importance in energy metabolism and oxidative stress management, potentially influencing aging and disease resistance (Labunskyy2014Selenoproteins:; Tsuji2021Historical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SELENOO gene have been associated with various health conditions. The variant rs5771225 (p.Val3Ala) in the SELENOO gene is linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with an allele frequency of 0.22 (Santesmasses2021Pathogenic). In the context of cancer, SELENOO is one of the top 10 mutated genes within the selenoproteome, exhibiting a high frequency of missense mutations. However, these mutations have not been shown to significantly affect survival outcomes in cancer patients (Jia2020Potential).

SELENOO is involved in AMPylation, a process that transfers AMP from ATP to Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis (Tsuji2021Historical). Despite its role in cellular stress responses, SELENOO has a high LOEUF score, indicating a relatively high tolerance to inactivation, suggesting it may not be essential for development in mice (Santesmasses2019Tolerance). While SELENOO's exact role in disease mechanisms remains under investigation, its involvement in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress highlights its potential significance in neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
Selenoprotein O (SELENOO) is involved in redox interactions within the mitochondria, primarily through its C-x-x-U structural motif, which is characteristic of selenoproteins. This motif allows SELENOO to engage in redox activity, potentially forming reversible protein complexes. Experimental evidence suggests that SELENOO can trap redox protein targets when its motif is altered to S-x-x-C, while modifications to S-x-x-S or C-x-x-S prevent interprotein disulfide bond formation. These interactions are influenced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations, indicating a reversible redox interaction that is specific to thiol-dependent oxidoreduction processes (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”).

There is also a hypothesis that SELENOO may possess kinase activity, which could imply interactions with substrates or regulatory proteins involved in phosphorylation pathways (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). However, specific protein partners or nucleic acid interactions for SELENOO have not been detailed in the available literature, and further research is needed to elucidate these potential interactions. The role of SELENOO in mitochondrial dynamics and cellular signaling pathways remains an area of active investigation (Tinkov2020Selenium).
