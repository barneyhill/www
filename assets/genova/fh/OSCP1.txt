# OSCP1

## Overview
The OSCP1 gene encodes the organic solute carrier partner 1 protein, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of various organic solutes across cell membranes. This protein is characterized by its ability to form dimers and trimers, which may be essential for its function as a transporter. OSCP1 is predominantly expressed in the testis and brain, where it plays significant roles in the transport of solutes across the blood-testis barrier and in neuronal function, respectively. The protein's localization in multiple cellular compartments, including the plasma membrane and mitochondria, suggests its involvement in diverse cellular processes. Clinically, OSCP1 is implicated in several cancers, where its downregulation is often associated with poor prognosis and disease progression, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Yi2017The; Hiratsuka2011Neuronal; Hiratsuka2008Intratesticular).

## Structure
The OSCP1 protein, encoded by the human OSCP1 gene, is involved in the transport of organic solutes. The primary structure of OSCP1 consists of 379 amino acids, with an alternative splice variant that includes a 10-amino acid insert, resulting in a 389-amino acid isoform. This insert is present only in the brain and contains a potential casein kinase II phosphorylation site, suggesting its importance in the central nervous system (Yi2017The).

The secondary structure of OSCP1 has not been fully characterized, but it is suggested to have multiple transmembrane domains, similar to other solute carrier proteins (Huu2014Structural). The protein is predicted to have three transmembrane domains based on hydropathy analysis, differing from many membrane transporters that typically have more (Kobayashi2005Isolation).

OSCP1 is known to form dimers and trimers, indicating a quaternary structure that may be necessary for its function as a transporter (Huu2014Structural). The protein localizes in various cellular compartments, including the plasma membrane, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria, suggesting interactions with multiple cellular partners (Huu2014Structural).

## Function
The OSCP1 gene encodes the organic solute carrier protein 1, which is involved in the transport of various organic solutes across cell membranes. In humans, OSCP1 is predominantly expressed in the testis and is thought to play a role in the transport of organic solutes across the blood-testis barrier. The protein is involved in the high-affinity transport of a wide range of organic compounds, including drugs and other solutes, in a pH-dependent and sodium-independent manner (Hiratsuka2008Intratesticular). Immunohistochemical analysis has localized the human OSCP1 protein on the syncytiotrophoblast basal membrane in the placenta, suggesting a role in drug clearance to protect the fetus from chemical toxicity (Hiratsuka2008Intratesticular).

In mice, OSCP1 is expressed in spermatogenic cells, except spermatogonia, and is localized in the cytosol, indicating it may mediate substrate uptake into meiotic and spermiogenic germ cells (Hiratsuka2008Intratesticular). The protein is also expressed in the brain, where it is localized to the cytosol of neuronal cells, including pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, suggesting a potential role in neuronal function and development (Hiratsuka2011Neuronal).

## Clinical Significance
The OSCP1 gene, also known as NOR1, is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. Downregulation of OSCP1 is observed in several malignancies, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), gastric, colon, rectum, and cervical cancers. This downregulation is often linked to the hypermethylation of its promoter region, which is a significant epigenetic modification contributing to its silencing in these cancers (Yi2017The). In NPC, reduced expression of OSCP1 is associated with poor survival outcomes, highlighting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Yi2017The).

Genetic variations in OSCP1, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been associated with an increased risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and liver cancer. Specific SNPs, like rs1416840 and rs2275477, are linked to NPC risk (Yi2017The). In hematological malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hypermethylation of OSCP1 is associated with disease progression and treatment resistance (Yi2017The).

OSCP1's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and energy metabolism, which are critical processes in tumorigenesis (Yi2017The). Its re-expression in cancer cells can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yi2017The).
