# ATP1B2

## Overview
The ATP1B2 gene encodes the beta-2 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a transmembrane protein complex essential for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This protein is crucial for various physiological processes, including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and cell volume regulation. The beta-2 subunit, specifically, plays a significant role in the assembly, stabilization, and membrane targeting of the Na+/K+ ATPase complex, influencing its activity and localization within cells (Plössl2019Identification; Zeying2012Tissuespecific). In the retina, ATP1B2 is vital for anchoring retinoschisin to retinal membranes, thereby maintaining retinal structural integrity (Plössl2019Identification). The protein's interactions and post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are critical for its function and cellular interactions (Clausen2017The; RamírezSalinas2024In). Mutations or altered expression of ATP1B2 have been linked to neurological and retinal disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Plössl2017Retinoschisin; Huang2020Comprehensive).

## Structure
The ATP1B2 gene encodes the beta-2 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a membrane protein essential for ion transport. The primary structure of the beta-2 subunit consists of 290 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of approximately 33,412 Da (MartinVasallo1989Identification). The protein features a short intracellular N-terminal domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a large extracellular C-terminal domain (Clausen2017The; Shyjan1991Evolution).

The secondary structure includes an Ig-like β-sandwich configuration in the extracellular domain, which is stabilized by three conserved disulfide bonds (Clausen2017The; RamírezSalinas2024In). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a stable three-dimensional shape, crucial for its function and interaction with other subunits (Shyjan1991Evolution).

In terms of quaternary structure, the beta-2 subunit forms part of the Na+/K+ ATPase complex, interacting with alpha subunits to facilitate ion transport (MartinVasallo1989Identification). The beta-2 subunit can form homophilic trans-dimers, which are important for cell adhesion, particularly in the nervous system (RamírezSalinas2024In).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at multiple sites, which are critical for proper cellular localization and function (Clausen2017The; RamírezSalinas2024In). These modifications also play a role in the protein's adhesive properties and interactions with other cellular components (RamírezSalinas2024In).

## Function
The ATP1B2 gene encodes the beta-2 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a crucial enzyme responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This gradient is essential for various cellular processes, including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and regulation of cell volume (Zeying2012Tissuespecific). The Na+/K+ ATPase is a heterodimeric complex composed of a catalytic alpha subunit and a regulatory beta subunit, with ATP1B2 being one of the beta subunit isoforms (Plössl2019Identification).

In healthy human cells, ATP1B2 plays a significant role in the proper assembly and stabilization of the Na+/K+ ATPase complex, influencing its activity and localization within the cell (Plössl2019Identification). The beta-2 subunit is involved in the maturation and membrane targeting of the enzyme, which is crucial for its function in maintaining ion gradients (Zeying2012Tissuespecific). In the retina, ATP1B2 is specifically required for anchoring the protein retinoschisin to retinal membranes, which is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the retina (Plössl2019Identification). This interaction is essential for the proper localization and function of retinoschisin, contributing to retinal health (Plössl2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ATP1B2 gene, which encodes the beta-2 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, have been implicated in various neurological and retinal disorders. Retinoschisin, a protein linked to X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS), interacts with the Na+/K+ ATPase, specifically requiring the ATP1B2 subunit for binding. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and signaling of Na+/K+ ATPase in the retina. Deficiency in retinoschisin or disruptions in its interaction with ATP1B2 can lead to dysregulation of Na+/K+ ATPase signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of XLRS, a degenerative retinal disease (Plössl2017Retinoschisin).

High expression levels of ATP1B2 have been associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. Downregulation of ATP1B2 in glioblastoma cells has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor proliferation and progression (Huang2020Comprehensive). Although the context does not provide specific information on diseases directly caused by mutations in ATP1B2, its involvement in these conditions highlights its clinical significance in both retinal and neurological health.

## Interactions
ATP1B2, a subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with retinoschisin, a protein important for retinal integrity. This interaction is mediated by specific regions on ATP1B2, particularly patch II, where the residue T240 is critical for binding. Mutations at this site, such as T240L, disrupt the interaction without affecting the overall structure of ATP1B2 (Plössl2019Identification).

ATP1B2 also forms part of a complex with ATP1A3, another subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, which is necessary for the membrane anchorage of retinoschisin. This complex is essential for the proper localization and function of retinoschisin in the retina (Friedrich2010The). In addition to retinoschisin, ATP1B2 interacts with Kv channel subunits Kv2.1 and Kv8.2, forming a protein complex in the photoreceptor inner segments (Schmid2022Retinoschisin).

The β2 subunit of ATP1B2 is also involved in trans-dimerization interactions, particularly in CHO and MDCK cells, where it engages in β2-β2 trans-dimerization. This interaction is influenced by glycosylation, which plays a significant role in stabilizing these interactions (RamírezSalinas2024In).
