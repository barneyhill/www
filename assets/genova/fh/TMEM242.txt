# TMEM242

## Overview
TMEM242 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 242, which is integral to mitochondrial function. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in the assembly and function of ATP synthase, a crucial enzyme for mitochondrial energy production. TMEM242 plays a significant role in the assembly of the c8 ring and its association with the ATP synthase complex, although the precise mechanisms of its action are not fully understood. The protein's importance is underscored by its co-essentiality with ATP synthase components, as well as its physical interactions with ATP synthase subunits, which are critical for maintaining mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism in human cells (Replogle2021Mapping; Tauchmannová2024Variability). Despite its involvement in these fundamental processes, the clinical significance of TMEM242 remains largely unexplored, with no direct links to specific diseases currently established (Replogle2021Mapping).

## Function
TMEM242 is a transmembrane protein involved in the assembly and function of ATP synthase, a critical enzyme in mitochondrial energy production. The protein plays a role in the assembly of the c8 ring and its association with the ATP synthase complex, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Tauchmannová2024Variability). Knockdown of TMEM242 results in a transcriptional signature similar to the loss of ATP synthase, indicating its involvement in ATP synthase function. This is supported by findings that TMEM242 physically interacts with ATP synthase subunits and regulates its complex assembly, suggesting it is essential for ATP synthase activity (Replogle2021Mapping).

In cellular studies, TMEM242 knockdown has been shown to decrease basal respiration, highlighting its role in mitochondrial respiration (Replogle2021Mapping). The protein's function is further supported by its co-essentiality with ATP synthase components, as identified in the Cancer Dependency Map (Replogle2021Mapping). TMEM242's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the TMEM242 gene remains largely unexplored, with current research not providing specific associations between TMEM242 mutations or expression alterations and particular diseases or conditions. Studies have identified TMEM242 as a mitochondrial gene of unknown function, with its knockdown affecting mitochondrial respiration, as measured by the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using a Seahorse analyzer (Replogle2021Mapping). Despite its involvement in mitochondrial processes, no direct links to specific mitochondrial diseases have been established.

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, TMEM242 is mentioned as a potential multi-pass membrane protein with high expression in the brain, but no direct disease associations have been confirmed (Chaves2019Copy). Similarly, TMEM242 is included in a microdeletion region associated with Coffin–Siris syndrome 1, but its specific role in the syndrome is not detailed (Lu2021Identification).

Research on transmembrane proteins in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mentions TMEM242 in relation to mitochondrial complex I assembly, yet no specific disease associations are provided (Fan2022Transmembrane). Overall, while TMEM242 is implicated in various cellular processes, its clinical significance requires further investigation.

## Interactions
TMEM242 is involved in the assembly and function of the ATP synthase complex in mitochondria. It has been identified as having a role similar to that of ATP synthase components, as its knockdown produces a transcriptional signature akin to the loss of ATP synthase. This suggests that TMEM242 is involved in ATP synthase activity, supported by its co-essentiality with ATP synthase components and its physical interaction with ATP synthase subunits (Replogle2021Mapping). TMEM242, along with TMEM70, is implicated in the assembly of the c8 ring and its association with the ATP synthase complex, although the exact mechanism of its function is not completely explained (Tauchmannová2024Variability). The deletion of TMEM242, along with TMEM70, prevents ATP synthase assembly, impacting complex I, which indicates its role in the structural arrangement of ATP synthase (Beasley2021TMEM135). However, specific interactions of TMEM242 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise role and interactions within the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex.
