# WDR91

## Overview
WDR91 is a gene that encodes the protein WD repeat domain 91, which is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats. These repeats form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions crucial for cellular processes such as endosomal trafficking and neuronal development (Liu2017WDR91). The protein is involved in regulating endosomal phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate levels, playing a significant role in the maturation and trafficking of endosomes (Ahmad2023Discovery). WDR91 interacts with several proteins, including WDR81 and Beclin1, forming complexes that are essential for maintaining the integrity of the endolysosomal pathway (Rapiteanu2016A). Mutations in the WDR91 gene have been implicated in neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in neuronal development and cellular homeostasis (Toma2019Using).

## Structure
WDR91 is a protein characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. These repeats form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, a common motif in WD40-repeat domains, facilitating interactions with other proteins such as Rab7, a small GTPase (Liu2017WDR91). The WD40-repeat region of WDR91 spans amino acids 392-741 and is crucial for its interaction with Rab7, with key residues F570, N571, and H572 playing essential roles in this interaction (Liu2017WDR91). The protein also contains a coiled-coil domain at the N terminus (amino acids 178-215), which is involved in binding with Beclin1 (Liu2017WDR91).

The WDR domain of WDR91, specifically residues 392-747, adopts a seven-bladed β-propeller fold and forms a head-to-head dimer mediated by a β-hairpin loop (Ahmad2023Discovery). The protein's structure includes a side pocket at the bottom of the WDR domain, which is a target for small-molecule ligands (Ahmad2023Discovery). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may influence the function and interactions of WDR91, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's role in endosomal trafficking and neuronal development is linked to its structural features and interactions (Liu2017WDR91).

## Function
WDR91 is a protein involved in the regulation of endosomal phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) levels, which is crucial for endosome maturation and trafficking. It plays a significant role in the transition from early to late endosomes, a process essential for endosomal fusion, recycling, and transport (Ahmad2023Discovery). WDR91 interacts with proteins such as WDR81, Beclin1, and Rab7 to modulate the activity of the class III PI3K complex, thereby downregulating PtdIns3P levels in endosomes. This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is implicated in physiological processes like neuronal development (Ahmad2023Discovery).

The WDR81-WDR91 complex is essential for the trafficking and degradation of internalized plasma membrane proteins, facilitating the delivery of cargo from early to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. This complex is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the endolysosomal pathway, which is important for cellular processes such as receptor trafficking and degradation (Rapiteanu2016A). WDR91 is also identified as a positive regulator of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) activity in melanoma cells, highlighting its role in endosomal maturation and trafficking (Menchon2024A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR91 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders. Although WDR91 was initially identified in studies exploring its potential link to colorectal cancer, it was excluded as a candidate gene for cancer predisposition due to its primary function being related to neuronal development rather than tumorigenesis (Toma2019Using). The WDR91 gene is part of a complex with WDR81, which plays a critical role in endosomal trafficking and degradation processes. This complex is essential for the proper functioning of endolysosomal pathways, and disruptions can lead to cellular dysfunction (Rapiteanu2016A).

Alterations in WDR91 expression or function can impact cellular processes like autophagy, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis. While the clinical significance of WDR91 mutations is not directly addressed in some studies, the gene's interaction with WDR81 suggests its involvement in neurological conditions (Rapiteanu2016A). The WDR81-WDR91 complex is evolutionarily conserved and plays a significant role in protein trafficking, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Rapiteanu2016A). Although specific diseases directly linked to WDR91 mutations are not detailed, its role in cellular processes suggests potential implications in neurodevelopmental delays and intellectual disabilities.

## Interactions
WDR91 is known to interact with several proteins, forming complexes that play crucial roles in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with WDR81, forming the WDR81-WDR91 complex. This complex is essential for the trafficking and degradation of tetherin, a viral restriction factor, and is involved in maintaining the morphology and function of the endolysosomal pathway. The absence of WDR81 leads to swollen endolysosomal compartments and impaired receptor trafficking, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Rapiteanu2016A).

WDR91 also interacts with Beclin1, a component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, to inhibit its activity. This interaction is crucial for regulating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate levels, which are important for endosomal maturation and trafficking (Ahmad2023Discovery; Rapiteanu2016A).

In addition to these interactions, WDR91 has been identified as a promoter of phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide (PS-ASO) activity in melanoma cells. This suggests that WDR91 may play a role in the mechanistic uptake and trafficking of ASOs, although the specific nature of these interactions remains to be fully elucidated (Menchon2024A).
