# UGT2A1

## Overview
UGT2A1 is a gene that encodes the UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member A1, a crucial enzyme involved in the glucuronidation process, which is a phase II metabolic reaction. This enzyme belongs to the glycosyltransferase 1 (GT1) family and is characterized by a GT-B fold structure, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Fujiwara2016Structure). UGT2A1 is predominantly expressed in the nasal mucosa and olfactory epithelium, where it plays a significant role in the detoxification of odorants and other compounds by converting them into more water-soluble glucuronide conjugates for excretion (Neiers2021The). The gene produces multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, with some variants affecting the enzyme's activity and potentially influencing susceptibility to tobacco-related cancers (Bushey2011Characterization; Bushey2012Identification). UGT2A1's activity is also modulated by protein-protein interactions and regulatory mechanisms, including microRNA-mediated regulation, which can impact its role in detoxification processes (Sutliff2019Regulation).

## Structure
The UGT2A1 protein is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, which plays a crucial role in the glucuronidation process. The protein typically consists of a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a large luminal domain. It is predicted to have a GT-B fold, which is common among glycosyltransferase 1 (GT1) family proteins. This fold consists of two Rossmann domains with a catalytic cleft, essential for its enzymatic activity (Fujiwara2016Structure).

The UGT2A1 gene produces multiple isoforms through alternative splicing. A notable splice variant, UGT2A1⌬exon3, lacks exon 3, resulting in a protein that is 44 amino acids shorter than the wild-type UGT2A1_i1. This deletion affects the UDPGA cosubstrate binding pocket, rendering the UGT2A1_i2 isoform inactive (Bushey2012Identification).

UGT2A1 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, predominantly in the nasal mucosa, and is involved in the detoxification processes. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which are common in membrane-bound enzymes like UGTs (Fujiwara2016Structure; Sneitz2009Human). The quaternary structure of UGT2A1 involves the formation of homo- and hetero-oligomers, which can influence its enzymatic activity (Fujiwara2016Structure).

## Function
UGT2A1 is a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme involved in the glucuronidation process, a phase II metabolic reaction that enhances the solubility and excretion of various compounds by attaching glucuronic acid to them. This enzyme plays a crucial role in detoxifying and metabolizing endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, including drugs and carcinogens, in the liver and other tissues (Perreault2013The; Bushey2011Characterization).

UGT2A1 is highly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, particularly in the olfactory cilia of sensory neurons, where it is involved in the glucuronoconjugation of odorants. This activity is essential for terminating olfactory signals by converting odorants into glucuronide conjugates, which are then excreted into the olfactory mucus (Neiers2021The). The enzyme's localization in the plasma membrane of olfactory cilia allows for efficient interaction with odorants, facilitating their rapid metabolism (Neiers2021The).

In addition to its role in the olfactory system, UGT2A1 is involved in the glucuronidation of bile acids, which is important for detoxifying cytotoxic bile acids in the liver, especially under cholestatic conditions (Perreault2013The). UGT2A1 also exhibits activity against polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are tobacco carcinogens, indicating its role in metabolizing certain carcinogens (Bushey2011Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the UGT2A1 gene have been implicated in tobacco-related cancer susceptibility. UGT2A1 is involved in the detoxification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are carcinogens found in tobacco smoke. Variants of UGT2A1, such as those resulting from nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at codons 75 and 308, have been shown to significantly affect the enzyme's activity. The 75Arg308Gly variant, in particular, exhibits reduced glucuronidation activity against PAHs, potentially influencing an individual's susceptibility to tobacco-related cancers (Bushey2011Characterization).

A novel splice variant of UGT2A1, UGT2A1Δexon3, has been identified and characterized. This variant lacks exon 3 and results in an inactive isoform that negatively regulates the active UGT2A1_i1 isoform. The presence of this inactive variant may increase susceptibility to tobacco-related cancers, particularly in the respiratory and aerodigestive tracts, by reducing the detoxification capacity of UGT2A1 (Bushey2012Identification).

Additionally, the regulation of UGT2A1 by microRNAs, specifically miR-196a-5p and miR-196b-5p, can significantly reduce UGT2A1 mRNA levels and enzyme activity, potentially impacting cancer risk by altering the detoxification process (Sutliff2019Regulation).

## Interactions
UGT2A1, a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, participates in specific protein-protein interactions that influence its enzymatic activity. A notable interaction involves a splice variant of UGT2A1, known as UGT2A1_i2, which lacks exon 3. This variant forms a complex with the active isoform UGT2A1_i1, resulting in a reduction of the latter's glucuronidation activity. The interaction between UGT2A1_i1 and UGT2A1_i2 is suggested to occur in a 1:1 stoichiometry, likely forming a dimer, which acts as a negative regulator of UGT2A1_i1 (Bushey2012Identification).

The study by Bushey and Lazarus demonstrated that the expression of UGT2A1_i2 affects the activity of UGT2A1_i1 by forming hetero-oligomers, leading to a significant decrease in the Vmax of UGT2A1_i1 against certain substrates, although the Km remains unchanged (Bushey2012Identification). These interactions are specific to UGT2A1 and do not extend to other UGT family members, such as UGT1A7, UGT1A10, and UGT2B17, as coexpression with these isoforms did not significantly alter their glucuronidation activities (Bushey2012Identification). This specificity suggests a unique regulatory mechanism within the UGT2A1 isoforms.
