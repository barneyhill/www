# SPMIP6

## Overview
SPMIP6 is a gene that encodes the protein sperm microtubule inner protein 6, which is integral to the structural organization of cilia, particularly within the axoneme of the sperm flagellum. This protein is characterized by Mn repeat units and a conserved NWE motif, which facilitate its binding to the microtubule lattice and localization to the cilia outer doublet seam. These features underscore its role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of sperm cells (Andersen2024Uncovering). SPMIP6 is also implicated in cell differentiation processes, particularly in the context of cryopreserved human sperm, where its reduced transcript levels may influence sperm motility and function, thereby affecting fertilization and early embryo development (Stigliani2024A). Despite these changes, cryopreserved sperm remains viable for use in assisted reproductive technologies, highlighting the gene's significance in preserving sperm quality and function (Stigliani2024A).

## Structure


## Function
SPMIP6, also known as sperm microtubule inner protein 6, is involved in the structural organization of cilia, particularly in the axoneme, which is the core structure of the sperm flagellum. This protein contains Mn repeat units that bind to the microtubule lattice, playing a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of sperm cells (Andersen2024Uncovering). The Mn repeats and a conserved NWE motif in SPMIP6 are associated with its localization to the cilia outer doublet seam, suggesting its involvement in the structural organization of cilia (Andersen2024Uncovering).

In the context of cryopreserved human sperm, SPMIP6 is implicated in cell differentiation processes. The transcript levels of SPMIP6 are reduced in cryopreserved sperm, which may affect sperm motility and function, potentially impacting fertilization and early embryo development (Stigliani2024A). Despite these molecular changes, cryopreserved sperm can still be used successfully in assisted reproductive technologies, indicating that SPMIP6 plays a role in maintaining sperm quality and function (Stigliani2024A).
