# SETD1B

## Overview
SETD1B is a gene that encodes the protein SET domain containing 1B, a histone lysine methyltransferase. This enzyme is a crucial component of the COMPASS complex, which is responsible for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with active transcription and euchromatin formation. The SETD1B protein plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, particularly in neuronal cells, where it influences cognitive functions such as learning and memory. It is characterized by several functional domains, including a catalytic SET domain essential for its methyltransferase activity. Mutations in the SETD1B gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Weerts2021Delineating; Michurina2020SETD1B; Chen2019High‑level).

## Structure
The SETD1B protein is a lysine-specific histone methyltransferase that is part of the COMPASS complex, responsible for methylating histone H3 at lysine-4, a modification associated with active gene transcription and euchromatin (Weerts2021Delineating). The protein consists of 1,966 amino acids and includes several functional domains. The N-terminus contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), while the middle region features two long disordered regions, a conserved lysine-serine-aspartic acid (LSD) motif, and a coiled-coil structure. The C-terminus includes a catalytic SET domain essential for its histone methyltransferase activity, flanked by the N-SET domain with a conserved WDR5-interacting (WIN) motif and a post-SET domain (Weerts2021Delineating).

The SET domain is crucial for the protein's function, catalyzing the methylation of histone 3 lysine 4, and consists of 130 amino acids (Den2019A). The protein's structure is further stabilized by interactions within the COMPASS complex, which includes subunits like WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, DPY30, and WDR82 (Kranz2020The). SETD1B also interacts with RBM15 via the LSD motif, a feature not present in its paralog SETD1A (Kranz2020The). The protein's stability and function can be affected by mutations, particularly those impacting the SET domain and its interactions (Weerts2021Delineating).

## Function
SETD1B is a gene encoding a histone lysine methyltransferase that specifically methylates histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with active transcription. This methylation process is crucial for regulating gene expression, particularly in the context of neuronal identity and cognitive functions. SETD1B is involved in the regulation of genes with broad H3K4me3 peaks at their transcription start sites, which are essential for learning and memory processes in the hippocampus (Michurina2021Postnatal; Michurina2020SETD1B).

In healthy human cells, SETD1B plays a significant role in maintaining the expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function. The presence of SETD1B at the single-cell level enables efficient expression of genes important for hippocampal neuron function and memory consolidation (Michurina2020SETD1B). The gene's activity is particularly crucial in excitatory forebrain neurons, where its loss leads to impaired learning and memory, highlighting its importance in cognitive function (Michurina2020SETD1B).

SETD1B is part of the COMPASS complex and is active in the cell nucleus, where it influences chromatin structure and impacts processes like development and differentiation (Michurina2020SETD1B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SETD1B gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include intellectual disability, language delay, seizures, and autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with SETD1B variants often exhibit global developmental delay, with developmental issues frequently preceding the onset of seizures (Weerts2021Delineating; Roston2020SETD1Bassociated). The gene's mutations are linked to a specific DNA hypermethylation signature, which serves as a diagnostic marker for SETD1B-related syndromes (Krzyzewska2019A).

SETD1B mutations have also been implicated in various cancers. Alterations in SETD1B expression are associated with primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumors, where specific mutations like A1054del contribute to increased cell proliferation and tumor aggressiveness (Yang2019SET). In hepatocellular carcinoma, high levels of SETD1B expression correlate with larger tumor size and poorer prognosis, suggesting its role as a potential prognostic marker (Chen2019High‑level).

The clinical phenotype of SETD1B-related disorders shows variability, with males often more severely affected, indicating possible sex-linked susceptibility (Weerts2021Delineating). The gene's involvement in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer highlights its critical role in maintaining normal cellular functions.

## Interactions
SETD1B is a component of the COMPASS complex, which is involved in histone methylation, specifically trimethylating histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4). This complex includes noncatalytic components such as WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30, which are essential for its function in chromatin modification and gene regulation (Schmidt2018The; Chen2019High‑level). SETD1B interacts with WDR82, a protein that recruits the SETD1B complex to transcription start sites by binding to the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (Lee2008Wdr82). 

SETD1B also associates with RBM15, a member of the m6A RNA methyltransferase complex, through its LSD motif, although there is no direct evidence of SETD1B's involvement in RNA methylation (Kranz2020The). In the context of hematopoiesis, SETD1B interacts with CFP1, a component shared with the SETD1A complex, and is crucial for maintaining hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell homeostasis (Schmidt2018The). The protein's interactions with these components suggest its role in transcription regulation, mRNA splicing, and export, contributing to its function in various biological processes and disease contexts (Schmidt2018The).
