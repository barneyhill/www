# MED21

## Overview
MED21 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 21, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. The Mediator complex serves as a bridge facilitating communication between gene-specific transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, thereby playing a pivotal role in the transcription of protein-coding genes. MED21, specifically, is part of the middle module of the Mediator complex and forms a heterodimer with the MED7 subunit, characterized by a highly elongated, α-helical structure. This structural configuration is essential for the interaction of the core Mediator with RNA polymerase II and other subunits, influencing various cellular processes such as cell growth, development, and differentiation (Sato2016Role; Borggrefe2011Interactions). In mammals, MED21 is indispensable for cell viability and early development, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality observed in knockout models (Hentges2011Mediator). The protein's interactions with other Mediator subunits and its involvement in transcriptional regulation underscore its significance in maintaining cellular function and integrity (Hallberg2006Functional; Guglielmi2004A).

## Structure
The MED21 protein is a subunit of the Mediator complex, specifically part of the middle module, and forms a heterodimer with the MED7 subunit. The MED21-MED7 heterodimer is characterized by a highly elongated structure that is almost entirely α-helical, consisting of two domains: a four-helix bundle and a coiled-coil domain (Sato2016Role; Larivière2012A). The N-terminus of MED21 is located near a conserved region of MED7, contributing to a hinge-like structure that is crucial for the interaction of the core Mediator with RNA polymerase II and other subunits (Sato2016Role). 

The structure of the MED7-MED21 heterodimer is mostly conserved between yeast and mammalian Mediators, indicating a high degree of structural similarity, although the overall conformation of the Middle module differs due to flexing at the MED7-MED21/MED4-MED9 interface (Zhao2021Structure). This flexing contributes to the differences in the overall conformation of the Middle module between yeast and mammals. The MED21 protein is involved in forming a coiled coil with MED7C, and its structure is central to the module's architecture, interacting with other subunits like Med10 and Med31 (Larivière2013Model).

## Function
MED21, a component of the Mediator complex, plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. It is involved in the transcriptional activation process by facilitating the interaction between RNA polymerase II and gene-specific transcription factors, thereby influencing the transcription of protein-coding genes (Taatjes2010The; Borggrefe2011Interactions). MED21 is part of the MED7/21 subcomplex, which forms a four-helix bundle domain, suggesting its structural importance within the Mediator complex (Borggrefe2011Interactions).

In mammals, MED21 is essential for cell viability and early development. Its critical role is highlighted by the embryonic lethality observed in Med21 knockout mouse embryos, which indicates its necessity for embryonic transcription and basic cellular functions (Hentges2011Mediator). Although specific gene expression defects due to MED21 deletion have not been analyzed in mammals, studies in other organisms suggest that MED21 regulates developmentally important genes rather than global transcription (Hentges2011Mediator).

MED21 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly and stabilization of the Mediator complex, thereby modulating transcriptional responses and influencing various cellular processes such as cell growth, development, and differentiation (Hentges2011Mediator).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MED21, a subunit of the yeast Mediator complex, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcription regulation. It interacts with several other Mediator subunits, including Med17 (Srb4), Med22 (Srb6), Med10, Med7, and Med4, forming part of the head and middle modules of the complex (Hallberg2006Functional; Guglielmi2004A). These interactions are essential for the structural integrity and function of the Mediator complex, facilitating its role as a transcriptional coactivator (Guglielmi2004A).

MED21 also interacts with Med31 (Soh1), linking the middle and tail modules of the Mediator complex (Guglielmi2004A). The interaction between MED21 and Med10 is particularly dependent on specific amino acid residues, highlighting the importance of these regions for stable complex formation (Hallberg2006Functional). MED21's interaction with Med7 and Med10 is strong, while its interaction with Med4 is weaker (Hallberg2006Functional).

In addition to its role in the yeast Mediator complex, MED21 has been shown to interact with Theileria annulata cyclophilin1 (TaCyp1) in host cells, suggesting a potential role in transcription regulation during infection (Zhao2018Theileria). These interactions underscore MED21's versatile role in mediating transcriptional responses across different biological contexts.
