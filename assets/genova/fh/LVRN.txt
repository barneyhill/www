# LVRN

## Overview
The LVRN gene encodes the protein laeverin, a membrane-bound aminopeptidase involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration and immune response. Laeverin is characterized by its transmembrane domain and a zinc-binding motif within its catalytic domain, classifying it as a metalloprotease. This structural configuration is essential for its enzymatic activity, facilitating the hydrolysis of peptide bonds. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may affect its stability and function. Laeverin's role in cellular interactions and signaling pathways underscores its significance in physiological and pathological contexts, including its involvement in embryonic signaling and potential implications in diseases such as lung adenocarcinoma and COVID-19 (Kamenarova2024Rare; Aghamir2023Whole; Pradhan2013Systems).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LVRN gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of COVID-19, a study identified a cluster of 13 genes, including LVRN, that significantly impact severe outcomes of the disease. Mutations in these genes are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, and individuals carrying pathogenic variants in this cluster are more likely to develop severe or critical COVID-19, with an odds ratio of 2.67. A specific likely pathogenic variant in LVRN, c.1856dupA (p.Asn619Lysfs*26), was found in a severely infected 72-year-old male (Kamenarova2024Rare).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the LVRN gene has been identified as methylated, with varying methylation patterns across different stages of the disease. It is highly hypomethylated in Stage I and hypermethylated in Stage II, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Pradhan2013Systems).

Additionally, mutations in the LVRN gene have been noted in kidney transplant recipients, where it is suggested to play a role in transplant rejection. The gene encodes a cell surface aminopeptidase involved in embryonic signaling pathways, and its variants may influence graft rejection (Aghamir2023Whole).

## Interactions
LVRN, or laeverin, is a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing cellular processes such as cell migration and immune response. It is known to interact with multiple proteins, potentially forming part of multiprotein complexes. These interactions may be transient, allowing LVRN to engage in activating or inhibitory roles within cellular signaling pathways. The specific proteins that LVRN interacts with have not been detailed in the provided context, but its involvement in protein processing suggests a role in modulating the activity of other proteins through its aminopeptidase function. This modulation can impact processes like cell migration, where precise protein interactions and signaling are crucial. LVRN's potential to form part of multiprotein complexes indicates its role in more stable interactions, which could be essential for maintaining cellular structure or function. Its transient interactions, on the other hand, might allow it to quickly respond to changes in the cellular environment, thus playing a dynamic role in immune responses. The exact nature and partners of these interactions remain unspecified in the context provided.
