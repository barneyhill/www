# WDR43

## Overview
WDR43 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 43 protein, which is integral to ribosome biogenesis and transcription regulation in human cells. The protein is characterized by an N-terminal WD40 repeat domain, which forms a beta-propeller structure facilitating protein-protein interactions, and a C-terminal domain involved in RNA-binding (Bi2019RNA; Sondalle2016The). WDR43 is primarily localized in the nucleolus and is a component of the small-subunit processome, playing a critical role in pre-rRNA transcription and processing (Sondalle2016The). It interacts with various transcription machinery components, including RNA polymerase II, to modulate transcription elongation and release of paused polymerase (Bi2019RNA). The protein's function is conserved across eukaryotic species, underscoring its essential role in cellular processes (Sondalle2016The). Additionally, alterations in WDR43 expression have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Huang2021Expression; Sondalle2016The).

## Structure
WDR43 is a protein characterized by the presence of an N-terminal WD40 repeat domain and a C-terminal domain that includes a UTP12 subdomain and an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (Bi2019RNA). The WD40 domain is known for forming a beta-propeller structure, which facilitates protein-protein interactions (Sondalle2016The). The C-terminal domain is responsible for RNA-binding activity, as demonstrated by its robust RNA signals, unlike the N-terminal domain (Bi2019RNA).

The protein is post-translationally modified, with known modifications including SUMO3 at lysines 75 and 384 and phosphorylation at serine 77 (Sondalle2016The). These modifications may influence its interactions and functions, although their specific roles are not fully explored.

WDR43 forms part of a complex with other proteins such as CIRH1A and UTP15, indicating a quaternary structure involving direct binding interactions (Sato2013Interaction). This complex is localized primarily in the nucleolus, particularly in the fibrillar center region, suggesting a role in ribosome biogenesis (Sato2013Interaction). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in pre-rRNA transcription and processing (Sondalle2016The).

## Function
The WDR43 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and transcription regulation in human cells. WDR43 is a nucleolar protein involved in pre-rRNA transcription and processing, essential for ribosome assembly and function. It is part of the small-subunit processome (SSUP) and interacts with various components of the transcription machinery, including RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and transcription elongation factors, to facilitate transcription elongation and release of paused Pol II (Bi2019RNA).

WDR43 is recruited to chromatin by nascent RNA, where it acts as a promoter-associated RNA-binding protein, modulating Pol II activity and enhancing transcription by promoting Pol II pause release and elongation at target genes (Bi2019RNA). It binds to GC-rich RNA and is involved in coordinating mRNA synthesis with rRNA production, which is crucial for maintaining the pluripotency state in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Bi2019RNA).

In addition to its role in transcription, WDR43 is involved in ribosome biogenesis, interacting with the 5' ETS of 45S rRNA and its promoter, and its chromatin association is sensitive to Pol I or Pol II inhibition (Bi2019RNA). The protein's function is conserved across eukaryotic species, highlighting its essential role in cellular processes (Sondalle2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WDR43 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In craniofacial development, mutations in WDR43 can lead to defects due to disrupted ribosome biogenesis, which affects cranial neural crest cells. This disruption results in increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation, contributing to conditions like Treacher Collins syndrome and 3-M syndrome, a growth disorder (Sondalle2016The).

In cancer, WDR43 expression levels are associated with disease progression and prognosis. In cervical cancer, higher expression levels of WDR43 correlate with lower overall survival rates, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Huang2021Expression). In colorectal cancer, WDR43 is upregulated and contributes to cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion, potentially through its interaction with vimentin, a protein involved in these processes (Li2021WD40).

WDR43 is also involved in cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage and may serve as a therapeutic target. The gene's expression changes significantly in these conditions, and targeting it with drugs like cromolyn shows potential in reducing inflammation and preventing dementia (Wang2023Cromolyn). Additionally, WDR43 has been identified as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in osteoarthritis and Parkinson's disease, with its expression linked to immune cell interactions and inflammation (Heng2022WDR43).

## Interactions
WDR43 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and transcription regulation. In HeLa cells, WDR43 colocalizes with CIRH1A and UTP15 in the nucleolar FC region, forming a complex similar to the yeast t-UTP sub-complex. These proteins directly bind to each other, indicating a stable interaction (Sato2013Interaction). WDR43 also interacts with RNA Pol II subunits and other transcription-related proteins, such as 7SK snRNP components, elongation factors, and topoisomerases, which are crucial for transcription elongation and regulation (Bi2019RNA).

In embryonic stem cells, WDR43 associates with chromatin at promoters and enhancers, interacting with active transcription machinery, including Pol II, Mediator, and pluripotency regulators like OCT4 and MYC (Bi2019RNA). It binds to various RNAs, including 45S rRNA, snoRNAs, and snRNAs, with a strong affinity for 7SK snRNA, which is involved in Pol II pause release (Bi2019RNA). WDR43's RNA-binding activity is essential for its chromatin association, and its interactions with nascent transcripts and active transcription sites highlight its role in transcription and chromatin dynamics (Bi2019RNA).
