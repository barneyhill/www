# SPPL2B

## Overview
SPPL2B is a gene that encodes the protein signal peptide peptidase-like 2B, which is a member of the GxGD-type aspartyl intramembrane proteases. This protein is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains and is primarily located at the plasma membrane, where it functions as an intramembrane protease. SPPL2B is involved in the regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of type II transmembrane proteins, playing a critical role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and membrane trafficking. The protein's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune system function, as it influences the cleavage of substrates such as the transferrin receptor-1 and TNFα, impacting processes like cellular iron uptake and inflammatory cytokine expression (Maccioni2022Signal; Mentrup2020Physiological). Additionally, SPPL2B has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases (Maccioni2022Signal; Mentrup2019Atherogenic).

## Structure
SPPL2B is a member of the GxGD-type aspartyl intramembrane proteases, characterized by multiple transmembrane domains, typically featuring nine transmembrane helices. The catalytic center of SPPL2B involves two critical aspartyl residues located in transmembrane domains 6 and 7, embedded in signature motifs, with a QPALLY motif in transmembrane domain 9 completing the catalytic site (Mentrup2020Physiological). These motifs are crucial for its proteolytic activity, and mutations in these motifs can affect catalytic function (Fluhrer2007Signal).

SPPL2B is primarily located at the plasma membrane and does not require additional co-factors for its catalytic activity, although it may form multimeric complexes or associate with other proteins (Mentrup2020Physiological). The protein is involved in the cleavage of type II transmembrane proteins, such as TNFα, through a multistep process that releases peptides to the cytosol (Fluhrer2007Signal; Mentrup2020Physiological).

Post-translational modifications of SPPL2B may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context. The molecular structure of SPPL2B itself is not detailed in the excerpts, focusing instead on its functional mechanisms and substrate interactions.

## Function
SPPL2B (signal peptide peptidase-like 2B) is an intramembrane protease primarily located at the plasma membrane and is part of the SPP/SPPL family, which is distinct from the presenilin family of proteases. It is involved in the regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of type II transmembrane proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and protein glycosylation (Mentrup2020Physiological).

SPPL2B is known to cleave substrates like the transferrin receptor-1, which is involved in cellular iron uptake, and TNFα, where it releases an intracellular domain that promotes the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) (Maccioni2022Signal; Mentrup2020Physiological). This protease is also involved in the processing of proteins related to Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, such as BRI2, which negatively regulates Aβ production by binding to amyloid precursor protein (APP) and inhibiting its processing by secretases (Maccioni2022Signal).

SPPL2B's activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes related to protein cleavage and regulation of inflammatory pathways, contributing to cellular homeostasis and immune system function (Maccioni2022Signal; Mentrup2020Physiological).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SPPL2B gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). SPPL2B is involved in the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which influences the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ), a peptide associated with AD. Overexpression of SPPL2B enhances APP cleavage and Aβ generation, while knockout of SPPL2B results in decreased levels of soluble APP and Aβ, indicating its crucial role in APP proteolysis and Aβ production (Maccioni2022Signal). SPPL2B expression exhibits a biphasic pattern in AD, with increased expression in early stages and decreased expression in later stages, particularly in the cortex and hippocampus, suggesting a complex role in AD progression (Maccioni2022Signal).

In addition to its role in neurodegenerative diseases, SPPL2B, along with SPPL2a, is involved in the regulation of atherosclerosis. Deficiency in SPPL2a/b leads to the accumulation of LOX-1 NTFs, which enhances pro-atherogenic signaling and promotes atherosclerosis, characterized by larger and more advanced plaques (Mentrup2019Atherogenic; Mentrup2020Physiological). These findings suggest that SPPL2B plays a significant role in both neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
Signal Peptide Peptidase-Like 2b (SPPL2b) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. SPPL2b interacts with the transmembrane protein BRI2, which plays a role in modulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage. BRI2 negatively regulates APP processing by masking secretase access, and SPPL2b's interaction with BRI2 affects this regulation, potentially leading to increased amyloid-beta (Aβ) production, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Maccioni2022Signal).

SPPL2b is also involved in the proteolysis of the Lectin-like oxidised low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1). This interaction is crucial for controlling the levels of LOX-1 N-terminal fragments (NTFs), which are significant in signaling pathways related to atherosclerosis. SPPL2b, along with SPPL2a, regulates these fragments, thereby influencing pro-atherogenic signaling and endothelial activation (Mentrup2019Atherogenic; Mentrup2020Physiological).

These interactions highlight SPPL2b's role in modulating key signaling pathways and its potential impact on diseases such as Alzheimer's and atherosclerosis, making it a target of interest for therapeutic interventions.
