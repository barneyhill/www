# KATNAL1

## Overview
KATNAL1 is a gene that encodes the protein katanin catalytic subunit A1 like 1, which is a member of the AAA-ATPase family. This protein is primarily involved in microtubule severing, a critical process for regulating microtubule dynamics within cells. KATNAL1 is characterized by its AAA ATPase domain, which facilitates its function in microtubule disassembly, and it contains additional domains such as the Vsp4_C and MIT domains that contribute to its activity and interactions (Smith2012KATNAL1; Nithiananatham2017Structural). The protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and neuronal development, by modulating microtubule architecture (Banks2017A). KATNAL1 is particularly crucial in the testis, where it regulates microtubule dynamics in Sertoli cells, essential for spermiogenesis and male fertility (Smith2012KATNAL1). While mutations in KATNAL1 have been linked to male infertility in murine models, its role in human infertility remains to be fully elucidated (Smith2012KATNAL1; Fedick2014Lack).

## Structure
The KATNAL1 protein is characterized by its AAA ATPase domain, which is essential for its function in microtubule severing. This domain includes a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) with a Rossman fold and a helical bundle domain (HBD), stabilized by conserved N-terminal and C-terminal helices (Nithiananatham2017Structural). The primary structure of KATNAL1 includes residues 184 to 490, with the Walker A and B motifs present in the nucleotide binding pocket, although no nucleotide is bound in the monomeric state (Nithiananatham2017Structural). 

In terms of secondary structure, KATNAL1 contains alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its tertiary structure by forming a monomeric AAA-ATPase fold (Nithiananatham2017Structural). The quaternary structure of KATNAL1 is not typically present in its monomeric state, but it can form hexameric structures under certain conditions, such as when ATP is bound (Nithiananatham2017Structural). 

KATNAL1 also contains a Vsp4_C domain, which is important for its function, and a Microtubule Interacting and Transport (MIT) domain at the N-terminal, as confirmed by ab initio structure modeling (Smith2012KATNAL1). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
The KATNAL1 gene encodes a microtubule severing protein that is crucial for regulating microtubule dynamics in Sertoli cells, which are essential for spermiogenesis and male fertility. In healthy cells, KATNAL1 functions similarly to KATANIN p60, disrupting the cellular microtubule lattice, which is important for cell division and the retention of sperm during maturation in the testis (Smith2012KATNAL1). KATNAL1 is widely expressed in various body systems, but its critical role is observed in the testis, specifically in Sertoli cells from prenatal life. It is essential for the retention of spermatids during spermiogenesis, as its loss leads to premature exfoliation of immature spermatids, resulting in infertility (Smith2012KATNAL1).

KATNAL1 is part of the AAA-ATPase protein family, which is involved in essential cellular processes such as mitosis, ciliary biogenesis, and growth cone motility. In neurons, these enzymes are crucial for axonal elongation and synaptic development (Banks2017A). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in areas requiring microtubule remodeling, influencing processes like cell migration and axon guidance. It plays a role in cell division, intracellular transport, and neuronal development by regulating microtubule disassembly (Banks2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KATNAL1 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly due to their impact on Sertoli cell microtubule dynamics, which are crucial for spermiogenesis. A specific point mutation in the ATPase domain of KATNAL1, resulting in a Leucine to Valine substitution, has been identified as a cause of male infertility in mice. This mutation leads to a loss of function, disrupting microtubule dynamics and causing premature release of immature sperm, ultimately resulting in infertility (Smith2012KATNAL1). The mutation's significance is highlighted by the conservation of the affected Leucine residue across species for over 400 million years (Smith2012KATNAL1).

Despite the evidence from murine models, studies in humans have not found a significant association between KATNAL1 gene variants and azoospermia, a condition characterized by a lack of sperm in semen. Research involving human subjects did not identify any significant differences in the frequency of KATNAL1 variants between azoospermia cases and controls, suggesting that KATNAL1 may not play a major role in this condition in humans (Fedick2014Lack). These findings indicate that while KATNAL1 is crucial for male fertility in mice, its role in human infertility remains unclear.

## Interactions
KATNAL1, a microtubule severing protein, interacts with various proteins involved in cellular processes critical for spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. It binds to the CapZ subunit CAPZA2 and interacts with several regulators of actin-network organization, indicating its role in cytoskeletal dynamics (Dunleavy2022Male). KATNAL1 also associates with ACRBP, essential for acrosome granule formation and maintenance, and interacts with proteins related to Golgi organization, such as Rab2, Rab6, VCP, and LMAN1, highlighting its involvement in vesicle transport processes (Dunleavy2022Male).

KATNAL1 is part of a network that includes components of the ARP2/3 complex, which is involved in actin polymerization and dynamics, crucial for blood-testis-barrier integrity and spermiation (Dunleavy2022Male). It shares 48 candidate interacting proteins with KATNA1 and KATNB1, suggesting overlapping functions among these katanins (Dunleavy2022Male). KATNAL1's interactions with cytoskeletal and vesicle-transport related proteins indicate its role in regulating dynein-and vesicle-based cargo machinery interactions with microtubules (Dunleavy2022Male). These interactions are essential for its function in spermatogenesis, particularly in microtubule severing and regulation during male meiosis (Dunleavy2022Male).
