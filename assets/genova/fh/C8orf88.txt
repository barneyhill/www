# C8orf88

## Overview
C8orf88 is a gene located on chromosome 8 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 8 open reading frame 88. This protein is characterized by its interaction with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) through a conserved eIF4E-binding motif (4E-BM), which is crucial for its function in the regulation of protein synthesis (Pugsley2023C8ORF88:). Despite its structural similarity to 4E-BP1, C8orf88 lacks the conserved phosphorylation sites typically involved in the regulation of 4E-BP1, suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism (Pugsley2023C8ORF88:). Predominantly expressed in the testis, particularly in spermatocytes and early spermatids, C8orf88's expression decreases as these cells mature, indicating a potential role in spermatogenesis (Pugsley2023C8ORF88:). The precise biological functions and clinical significance of C8orf88 remain areas of active research.

## Structure
The C8orf88 gene encodes a polypeptide consisting of 117 amino acids. Sequence alignment with 4E-BP homologs shows approximately 20-26% identity, particularly in the 4E-BM (eIF4E-binding motif) region, which is crucial for its interaction with eIF4E (Pugsley2023C8ORF88:). The AlphaFold predicted structure of C8orf88, when superimposed with 4E-BP1 in the eIF4E:4E-BP1 crystal structure, shows an excellent fit across the 4EBM, suggesting a similar tertiary structure in the region that interacts with eIF4E (Pugsley2023C8ORF88:).

C8orf88 lacks the conserved phosphorylation sites found in 4E-BP1, indicating a different regulatory mechanism. However, a minor phosphorylation site at S70 has been identified, though its significance is not yet determined (Pugsley2023C8ORF88:). The protein is predominantly expressed in the testis, particularly in spermatocytes and early spermatids, and its expression diminishes as they mature (Pugsley2023C8ORF88:). The study does not provide specific details on the primary, secondary, or quaternary structure of C8orf88, nor does it mention any splice variant isoforms or specific domains beyond the 4E-BM.
