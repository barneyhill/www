# GFM2

## Overview
The GFM2 gene encodes the GTP-dependent ribosome recycling factor mitochondrial 2 (mtEFG2), a protein integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis. As a ribosome recycling factor, mtEFG2 is involved in the disassembly of ribosomal complexes post-translation, facilitating the recycling of ribosomes for subsequent protein synthesis cycles. This function is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial efficiency and energy production. The protein operates within the mitochondrial matrix, interacting with ribosomal subunits and GTP to perform its role in the ribosome recycling phase of mitochondrial translation. Mutations in the GFM2 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with various mitochondrial diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Glasgow2017Novel; Zhang2024Coregulation; Fukumura2015Compound).

## Function
The GFM2 gene encodes the protein mtEFG2, which is crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This protein functions as a ribosome recycling factor, facilitating the disassembly of ribosomal complexes after the termination of mitochondrial translation. This process is essential for the recycling of ribosomes, allowing them to be reused for subsequent rounds of protein synthesis, thereby maintaining efficient mitochondrial function and energy production (Glasgow2017Novel; Zhang2024Coregulation).

mtEFG2 operates within the mitochondrial matrix, where it interacts with ribosomal subunits and GTP to perform its role. The recycling of ribosomes is a critical step in the mitochondrial translation machinery, which consists of initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling phases. GFM2 specifically contributes to the ribosome recycling phase, ensuring the proper functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, which is responsible for ATP production in cells (Zhang2024Coregulation; Fukumura2015Compound).

Mutations in the GFM2 gene can lead to defects in the OXPHOS system, resulting in various mitochondrial diseases. These mutations can impair mitochondrial protein synthesis, leading to deficiencies in the respiratory chain and associated clinical phenotypes (Glasgow2017Novel; Fukumura2015Compound).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GFM2 gene are associated with several mitochondrial diseases, most notably Leigh syndrome and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Leigh syndrome is a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities, often leading to early death. In some cases, it is complicated by arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, which involves joint contractures (Fukumura2015Compound). Patients with GFM2 mutations may exhibit symptoms such as optic atrophy, severe mental retardation, and progressive cerebellar atrophy (Fukumura2015Compound).

Novel variants in GFM2 have been linked to early-onset neurological presentations, including developmental delays, dystonia, and epilepsy. These conditions are often accompanied by elevated lactate levels and abnormalities in brain imaging (Glasgow2017Novel). The GFM2 gene mutations can lead to impaired expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction (Glasgow2017Novel).

Alterations in GFM2 expression have also been implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in the context of high glucose conditions, which are relevant to diabetes. Increased expression of GFM2 correlates with decreased cellular respiration, suggesting a potential role in mitochondrial dysfunction (Zhang2024Coregulation).

## Interactions
GFM2, also known as GTP-dependent ribosome recycling factor mitochondrial 2, plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by interacting with mitochondrial ribosomes. It facilitates the disassembly of mitoribosomes at the end of translation, working in cooperation with the mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor (mtRRF) to ensure continued protein synthesis (Gouiza2024Expanding). GFM2 is involved in the termination stage of mitochondrial translation, where it aids in the recycling of the mitoribosome through GTP hydrolysis (Glasgow2017Novel). 

In studies involving Mus musculus, GFM2 was observed to accumulate in mutant tissues with CLPP-deleted hearts, suggesting its involvement in mitochondrial protein synthesis and processing. This accumulation was noted alongside other proteins such as CLPX, POLDIP2, and GRSF1, indicating potential interactions within the translational elongation/termination pathway (Auburger2022The). 

The co-regulation and synteny of GFM2 with NSA2, a cytosolic ribosomal biogenesis factor, suggest a mechanistic link between protein synthesis in mitochondria and the cytosol. This relationship is modulated by zinc via the MTF1 transcription factor, highlighting a regulatory interaction at the genetic level (Zhang2024Coregulation).
