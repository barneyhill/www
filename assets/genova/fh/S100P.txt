# S100P

## Overview
S100P is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein P, a member of the S100 family of proteins characterized by their EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways that regulate cell cycle, growth, differentiation, and metabolism (Parkkila2008The; Sato2002S100P). S100P is expressed in several normal tissues, with notable expression in the placenta and esophagus, and is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in cellular signaling (Parkkila2008The). The protein's ability to interact with a wide range of targets, including the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and various cytokines, underscores its multifunctionality and potential role in disease progression (Kazakov2022CalciumBound; Donato2012Functions). S100P is also implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Basu2008Functional; Hao2023S100P).

## Structure
The S100P protein is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs. These motifs consist of a 12-residue calcium-binding loop flanked by two α-helices, which are crucial for calcium ion binding (Kazakov2022CalciumBound). The primary structure of S100P includes specific residues such as E5, Y88, and F89, which are important for its interactions with other proteins, including the V domain of the RAGE receptor and various four-helical cytokines (Kazakov2022CalciumBound; Penumutchu2014Structural).

In its secondary structure, S100P forms stable symmetric homodimers, with each monomer consisting of four-helix bundles (Permyakov2019Monomeric). The tertiary structure of S100P is altered upon calcium binding, which exposes hydrophobic surfaces and facilitates dimer formation through non-covalent interactions between large hydrophobic areas of the monomers (Permyakov2019Monomeric). The quaternary structure involves the formation of dimers, and potentially higher-order oligomers, which are significant for its biological functions (Kazakov2022CalciumBound).

S100P is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. The protein's structural flexibility and intrinsic disorder contribute to its ability to interact with a wide range of targets, highlighting its multifunctionality (Kazakov2022CalciumBound).

## Function
S100P is a calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in the differentiation of human esophageal epithelial cells (EECs). It is part of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein family and is involved in calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways, which regulate cell cycle, growth, differentiation, and metabolism (Parkkila2008The; Sato2002S100P). In healthy human cells, S100P expression is inducible by extracellular calcium ions, which are crucial for the differentiation of EECs. The protein is expressed in the suprabasal and upper layers of the epithelium, indicating its involvement in early terminal differentiation (Sato2002S100P).

S100P is also expressed in various normal tissues, with the highest levels found in the placenta and esophagus. It is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in cellular signaling pathways (Parkkila2008The; SantamariaKisiel2006Calciumdependent). The protein's interaction with other molecules, such as ezrin/radixin/moesin, suggests its role in cell motility and structural organization (Donato2012Functions). These interactions and its calcium-binding properties enable S100P to influence cellular responses to external stimuli, contributing to processes like cell growth and survival.

## Clinical Significance
S100P is implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancers, including prostate, pancreatic, breast, and colorectal cancers. In prostate cancer, S100P overexpression is associated with increased androgen receptor expression, contributing to the growth of hormone-refractory prostate cancer and potentially explaining continued androgen activity during androgen deprivation therapy (Basu2008Functional). In pancreatic cancer, high S100P expression correlates with a less immunogenic tumor microenvironment, reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration, and poor survival outcomes, suggesting its role in immunosuppression and resistance to immunotherapy (Hao2023S100P).

In breast cancer, S100P promotes cell proliferation and migration, interacting with proteins like CCND1 and E-cadherin, and is linked to poor prognosis, particularly in hormone receptor-positive subtypes (Cong2020CalciumBinding). In colorectal cancer, S100P expression is elevated and associated with increased tumor proliferation and invasion, with its expression regulated by MACC1 and linked to poor prognosis (Schmid2022Calciumbinding; Lu2012S100P).

S100P's interactions with proteins such as ezrin and RAGE contribute to its role in metastasis and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Donato2012Functions).

## Interactions
S100P, a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, is known for its interactions with various proteins, particularly four-helical cytokines. It acts as a promiscuous binding partner for these cytokines, with 22 out of 32 tested cytokines showing binding affinities ranging from 1 nM to 3 µM. This interaction suggests that S100P may function as a poorly selective inhibitor of cytokine signaling, potentially influencing disease progression and serving as a therapeutic target (Kazakov2022CalciumBound).

The protein also interacts with the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), with a cytokine-binding site on S100P overlapping with the RAGE-binding site. This overlap indicates that S100P might interfere with cytokine-receptor interactions, affecting signaling pathways (Kazakov2022CalciumBound).

S100P specifically recognizes erythropoietin (EPO) among the S100 protein family, with interactions occurring under conditions of calcium excess. These interactions have equilibrium dissociation constants ranging from 81 nM to 0.5 µM, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of EPO activity, particularly in neoplastic diseases (Kazakov2022Erythropoietin).

Additionally, S100P interacts with interferon beta (IFN-β), with a strong preference for the monomeric Ca2+-bound form. This interaction is highly specific, with dissociation constants of 0.3 nM for the monomeric form, indicating a potential inhibitory role in the assembly of the IFN-β receptor complex (Kazakov2020Highly).
