# ADAMTS8

## Overview
ADAMTS8 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 8, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family. This protein is categorized as a secreted protease and is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, primarily through its antiangiogenic properties. It achieves this by inhibiting the formation of new blood vessels, a function that is crucial for maintaining normal vascular function in healthy tissues (Dunn2006Expression). The protein structure of ADAMTS8 includes several domains, such as a metalloproteinase catalytic domain and thrombospondin type 1 sequence repeats, which facilitate its role in cleaving extracellular matrix proteoglycans and interacting with other proteins (Kelwick2015The; PORTER2005The). ADAMTS8 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and lungs, and its dysregulation has been linked to diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and certain cancers, where it may serve as a prognostic marker (Liang2020Prognostic; Mougin2021ADAMTS).

## Structure
ADAMTS8 is a member of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a multi-domain structure. The protein includes a signal peptide, a pro-domain, a metalloproteinase catalytic domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 sequence repeat (TSR) motif, followed by a cysteine-rich domain and a spacer region (Kelwick2015The; PORTER2005The). The metalloproteinase domain features a consensus zinc-binding motif, HEXXHXXG/N/SXXHD, and a methionine residue within the sequence V/IMA/S, known as the 'Met-turn' (PORTER2005The). The disintegrin-like domain is cysteine-rich and stacks against the metalloproteinase active-site cleft (Kelwick2015The).

ADAMTS8 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can affect its secretion, localization, and function (Kelwick2015The). The protein is secreted and binds to the extracellular matrix, playing a role in extracellular matrix remodeling (Dunn2006Expression). ADAMTS8 is known for its anti-angiogenic properties, which are thought to be mediated through its thrombospondin motifs (PORTER2005The). The protein's structure allows it to cleave extracellular matrix proteoglycans, although it exhibits weak aggrecanase activity compared to other ADAMTS family members (PORTER2005The).

## Function
ADAMTS8 is a secreted protease with antiangiogenic properties, meaning it can inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, a function particularly relevant in maintaining normal vascular function in healthy tissues (Dunn2006Expression). In normal human tissues, ADAMTS8 is expressed at moderate to high levels in the brain, lung, aorta, and several fetal tissues, suggesting a role in normal tissue homeostasis and possibly in regulating angiogenesis (Dunn2006Expression). The protein is present in the Purkinje and molecular cell layers of neurons and in astrocytes in the white matter of the normal cerebellum (Dunn2006Expression).

ADAMTS8 exerts its antiangiogenic effects by binding to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and preventing its interaction with the VEGFR2 receptor, thereby inhibiting VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in endothelial cells (Flannery2006MMPs). This inhibition is achieved through the suppression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, resulting in decreased levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK, which are part of a signaling pathway involved in cell growth and survival (Chen2016Downregulation). These molecular activities highlight ADAMTS8's role in regulating angiogenesis and maintaining the extracellular matrix in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
ADAMTS8 has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), ADAMTS8 expression is increased in the lungs and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). This upregulation is associated with increased PASMC proliferation, which contributes to the pathogenesis of PAH. Deletion of ADAMTS8 in PASMCs has been shown to decrease their proliferation and enhance AMP-activated protein kinase/acetyl-CoA Carboxylase signaling, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Mougin2021ADAMTS).

In cancer, ADAMTS8 is highly methylated in gastric cancer, leading to reduced mRNA expression. This underexpression is linked to the progression of liver cancer through the ERK signaling pathway. The gene's expression level is also a predictor of poor overall survival in cancer patients, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker (Liang2020Prognostic).

ADAMTS8 is also involved in the pathology of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), where it is downregulated in smooth muscle cells from AAA patients. A genome-wide association study identified ADAMTS8 as a locus associated with increased AAA risk, highlighting its significance in vascular diseases (Mougin2021ADAMTS).

## Interactions
ADAMTS8, a member of the ADAMTS family, is involved in protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in extracellular matrix remodeling. The phylogenetic study by Dennler et al. identified interactions of ADAMTS-8 with SPP1, associated with sequence modules B1545 and B1552, suggesting a role in the gain of new functional modules in the ADAMTS-TSL family (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). This interaction highlights the potential for ADAMTS8 to participate in complex regulatory networks within the extracellular matrix.

The study also places ADAMTS-8 within the hyalectanase group, which includes other ADAMTS proteins known for their roles in degrading proteoglycans such as aggrecan and versican (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). Although specific interactions of ADAMTS8 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, its inclusion in this group suggests similar functional interactions. The evolutionary analysis of the ADAMTS-TSL family indicates that ADAMTS8, like other members, may have acquired new protein-protein interactions through the gain of conserved sequence modules, contributing to its functional specificity and potential involvement in tissue development and inflammation (Dennler2023Phylogenetic).
