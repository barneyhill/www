# RTF1

## Overview
RTF1 is a gene that encodes the RTF1 homolog, a protein that is a critical component of the Paf1/RNA polymerase II complex (Paf1C). This complex is integral to the regulation of transcription elongation and chromatin structure in eukaryotic cells. The RTF1 protein is characterized by specific domains, such as the Plus3 domain and the histone modification domain (HMD), which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, thereby influencing transcriptional processes. RTF1 is involved in the monoubiquitylation of histone H2B, a modification necessary for subsequent histone H3 methylation, which is associated with active transcription regions. Additionally, RTF1 interacts with transcription elongation factors and chromatin remodelers, playing a pivotal role in maintaining proper chromatin boundaries and gene expression. These functions underscore its importance in cellular differentiation and development, as well as its potential implications in disease prevention (Van2017Emerging; Warner2007Rtf1; Van2016The).

## Structure
The RTF1 protein is a component of the PAF1 complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. Structurally, RTF1 is characterized by several domains and features that contribute to its function. The Plus3 domain of RTF1 is essential for its interaction with phosphorylated Spt5, a processivity factor for RNA polymerase II. This domain contains three invariant positively charged amino acids and shows structural similarity to nucleic acid-binding PAZ domains, allowing it to interact with single-stranded DNA in vitro (Chen2020Spt5).

The histone modification domain (HMD) of RTF1 is involved in stimulating H2B ubiquitylation through interaction with Rad6. This domain includes two helices, helix A and helix B, and a loop region that interacts with both helices to complete the fold. Specific residues within the HMD, such as E100, R103, and E104, are crucial for Rad6 binding and H2B K123 ubiquitylation activity (Van2016The).

In terms of quaternary structure, RTF1 forms part of the PAF1 core complex, interacting with components like Ctr9 and Paf1 through its C-terminal region. This interaction is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, with specific residues such as Lys507 and Tyr510 playing key roles (Qin2023Structural). The C-terminal tail of RTF1 is particularly important for its association with the PAF1C complex (Qin2023Structural).

## Function
The RTF1 gene encodes a component of the Paf1 complex (Paf1C), which is involved in regulating transcription and chromatin structure in human cells. RTF1 plays a crucial role in the monoubiquitylation of histone H2B, a modification that is essential for subsequent methylation of histone H3 at lysines 4 and 79, marks associated with active transcription regions (Van2017Emerging). This process is facilitated through the interaction of RTF1 with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6, which stimulates H2B ubiquitylation (Van2016The).

RTF1 is also involved in the recruitment and retention of transcription-related factors at highly transcribed genes, influencing gene expression by maintaining normal levels of these factors in active genes (Van2016The). In addition to its role in histone modification, RTF1 is implicated in transcription elongation, where it interacts with the elongation factor Spt5 and is recruited to RNA polymerase II by the kinase Bur1 (Van2017Emerging).

In the cellular context, RTF1 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, impacting gene expression and cellular differentiation (Van2017Emerging). These molecular activities of RTF1 are critical for maintaining proper chromatin boundaries and are linked to various biological processes, including development and disease prevention.

## Interactions
The RTF1 protein, a component of the Paf1 complex, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcription regulation. RTF1 interacts with other components of the Paf1 complex, such as Paf1 and Ctr9, through its carboxy-terminal regions, which are essential for these interactions (Warner2007Rtf1). It also interacts with the chromatin remodeler Chd1, with the amino terminus of RTF1, specifically region 1, being necessary for this interaction (Warner2007Rtf1). This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of Chd1 to active open reading frames (ORFs) and is involved in suppressing transcriptional defects (Warner2007Rtf1).

RTF1 also interacts with the transcription elongation factor Spt5 through its OAR domain, which is crucial for the recruitment of the Paf1 complex to chromatin (Mayekar2013The). This interaction is mediated by the OAR domain of RTF1 and the C-terminal repeat domain of Spt5, and it is essential for tethering the Paf1 complex to the RNA polymerase II elongation machinery (Mayekar2013The). These interactions highlight RTF1's role in coordinating transcription elongation and histone modification processes.
