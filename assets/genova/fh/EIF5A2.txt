# EIF5A2

## Overview
EIF5A2 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2, a protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation, particularly during the elongation phase. This protein is characterized by a unique post-translational modification known as hypusination, which is essential for its function and occurs at lysine 50 (BarbaAliaga2022Role; Wu2020Recent). EIF5A2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with ribosomes to facilitate protein synthesis and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Wu2020Recent). The protein also plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, influencing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and the translation of mitochondrial targeting signals (BarbaAliaga2022Role). EIF5A2 is implicated in cancer progression, with its overexpression often associated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis across multiple cancer types, making it a potential therapeutic target (Wu2020Recent; Ning2020Eukaryotic).

## Structure
EIF5A2 is a eukaryotic translation initiation factor characterized by a unique post-translational modification known as hypusination, which is essential for its function (BarbaAliaga2022Role; Wu2020Recent). This modification occurs at lysine 50 and is crucial for the protein's activity (Wu2020Recent). EIF5A2 shares a high degree of amino acid identity with its paralog EIF5A1, with both proteins having a conserved domain structure that includes an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain (BarbaAliaga2022Role).

The N-terminal domain of EIF5A2 contains the hypusine modification site, which is critical for its interaction with deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) (Wu2020Recent). The protein's secondary structure is predominantly composed of β-sheets, contributing to its overall tertiary structure (BarbaAliaga2022Role). Although specific details on the quaternary structure of EIF5A2 are not provided, it is known to interact with other proteins, such as DHS, during the hypusination process (Wątor2023CryoEM).

EIF5A2 is also subject to acetylation at lysine 47, which affects its subcellular localization (Wu2020Recent). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including translation elongation and transcriptional regulation, particularly in cancer development (Ning2020Eukaryotic).

## Function
EIF5A2, a eukaryotic translation initiation factor, plays a significant role in mRNA translation, particularly during the elongation phase. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. EIF5A2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with ribosomes to facilitate protein synthesis (Wu2020Recent).

In healthy human cells, EIF5A2 is implicated in the regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a critical cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of EIF5A2 in neuroblastoma cells leads to the downregulation of UPR-related genes, suggesting its role in modulating cellular stress responses and potentially influencing aging processes (Liu2023EIF5A2).

EIF5A2 also affects mitochondrial function, as it is involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. It plays a role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and the translation of mitochondrial targeting signals, which are essential for proper mitochondrial performance (BarbaAliaga2022Role). The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as hypusination, which is crucial for its function and localization within the cell (Wu2020Recent).

## Clinical Significance
EIF5A2 is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. In ovarian cancer, EIF5A2 overexpression correlates with advanced disease stages and poor survival outcomes, contributing to tumor metastasis by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activating the TGFβ pathway (Zhao2024Eukaryotic; Guan2004Oncogenic). In bladder cancer, high EIF5A2 expression is linked to decreased metastasis-free survival and increased cell motility and invasiveness, indicating its role in promoting EMT and cancer cell aggressiveness (Wei2014EIF5A2). 

In colorectal cancer, EIF5A2 overexpression is associated with metastasis and poor survival, suggesting its utility as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Ning2020Eukaryotic). Similarly, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, EIF5A2 is linked to tumor invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance (Ning2020Eukaryotic). In hepatocellular carcinoma, EIF5A2 overexpression is associated with shorter survival and increased metastasis, highlighting its role in tumor progression (Ning2020Eukaryotic). 

EIF5A2's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in other malignancies, such as prostate, cervical, and lung cancers, where its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Wu2020Recent; Ning2020Eukaryotic). These findings suggest EIF5A2 as a potential therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
EIF5A2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes and cancer progression. One of the key interactions of EIF5A2 is with the HERC3 protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. HERC3 ubiquitinates EIF5A2 at multiple lysine residues, leading to its degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inhibiting the migration, invasion, and metastasis of colorectal cancer cells (Zhang2022HERC3). The interaction between HERC3 and EIF5A2 is dependent on the RCC1 domain of HERC3 and has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown assays (Zhang2022HERC3).

EIF5A2 is also involved in the regulation of translation and interacts with ribosomes. It is associated with actively translating ribosomes, promoting cancer cell protrusions and invasive capacity (MartínezFérriz2023Eukaryotic). EIF5A2's role in translation is further supported by its ability to bind to the 80S ribosomal complex, preventing ribosome stalling and stimulating protein synthesis (BarbaAliaga2022Role). These interactions highlight EIF5A2's involvement in both protein synthesis and cancer-related processes.
