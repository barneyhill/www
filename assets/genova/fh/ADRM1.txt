# ADRM1

## Overview
The ADRM1 gene encodes the ADRM1 protein, also known as hRpn13, which functions as a ubiquitin receptor within the 26S proteasome, a critical component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. As a proteasome-interacting protein, ADRM1 is not an integral subunit but serves as an auxiliary component that enhances the proteasome's ability to process ubiquitinated proteins. The protein is characterized by its interaction with the deubiquitinating enzyme UCH37, facilitating the disassembly of polyubiquitin chains, which is essential for efficient proteolysis (Hamazaki2006A; Qiu2006hRpn13ADRM1GP110). ADRM1 is implicated in various cellular processes and has been associated with several cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Huang2016The; Fejzo2015ADRM1‐amplified).

## Structure
The ADRM1 protein, also known as hRpn13, is a component of the 26S proteasome and plays a role in protein degradation. It is a 407-residue protein with a molecular weight of approximately 42 kDa, although it was initially mischaracterized as a 110 kDa glycosylated membrane protein (Hamazaki2006A; Qiu2006hRpn13ADRM1GP110). ADRM1 is composed of three regions: the N-terminal, C-terminal, and an insertion region. The N-terminal region is conserved and essential for proteasome association, while the C-terminal region interacts with the deubiquitinating enzyme UCH37 through KEKE motifs, enhancing its isopeptidase activity (Hamazaki2006A; Qiu2006hRpn13ADRM1GP110).

The protein is found in both the cytosol and nucleus, similar to the distribution of proteasomes, and is not an integral subunit but rather an auxiliary component (Hamazaki2006A; Qiu2006hRpn13ADRM1GP110). ADRM1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Anchoori2013A). The C-terminal region of ADRM1 is partially conserved in fission yeast, indicating evolutionary conservation of its functional domains (Qiu2006hRpn13ADRM1GP110). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in recruiting UCH37 to the proteasome, thereby facilitating protein degradation.

## Function
The ADRM1 gene encodes a protein known as hRpn13, which functions as a subunit of the 26S proteasome, specifically within the 19S regulatory complex. This protein plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. hRpn13 acts as a ubiquitin receptor, binding ubiquitinated proteins through its N-terminal Pru domain, facilitating their recognition and processing by the proteasome (Husnjak2008Proteasome). 

hRpn13 is involved in recruiting the deubiquitinating enzyme UCH37 to the proteasome, enhancing its isopeptidase activity, which is crucial for the disassembly of polyubiquitin chains during protein degradation (Hamazaki2006A; Qiu2006hRpn13ADRM1GP110). This interaction is vital for maintaining the deubiquitinating activity of the 26S proteasomes, which is necessary for efficient proteolysis (Hamazaki2006A). 

The protein is localized in both the cytosol and nucleus, aligning with the distribution of proteasomes, and is present in the majority of 26S proteasomes, although not as a constitutive subunit (Hamazaki2006A). Knockdown studies indicate that hRpn13 is not essential for proteolysis or cell viability, suggesting an auxiliary role in proteasome-dependent protein degradation (Hamazaki2006A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADRM1 gene, also known as the 26S proteasome ubiquitin receptor, have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, ADRM1 is frequently amplified and overexpressed, particularly in the 20q13.3 region, which is associated with increased cell migration, metastasis, and recurrence. Knockdown of ADRM1 in gastric cancer cell lines results in reduced colony formation and cell migration, suggesting its role in promoting malignant behavior (Fejzo2015ADRM1‐amplified; Jang2014ADRM1).

In colorectal cancer, ADRM1 overexpression is observed in a significant portion of cases and is correlated with advanced disease stages, including lymph node metastasis. Knockdown of ADRM1 in colorectal cancer cells leads to reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, indicating its role in enhancing tumor growth and survival (Ning2022GMEB2; He2009Knockdown).

ADRM1 is also involved in the degradation of mutant huntingtin protein aggregates, which are associated with Huntington's disease. Overexpression of ADRM1 aids in the removal of these aggregates, while its down-regulation leads to their accumulation, highlighting its potential role in neurodegenerative diseases (Huang2016The).

## Interactions
ADRM1, also known as hRpn13, is a proteasome-interacting protein that plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It interacts with the 26S proteasome, specifically binding to the base subunit Rpn2 through its N-terminal region. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of the deubiquitinating enzyme UCH37 to the proteasome (Hamazaki2006A; VanderLinden2017Structure). The C-terminal region of ADRM1 binds directly to UCH37, enhancing its isopeptidase activity, which is essential for the disassembly of ubiquitin conjugates during proteasomal degradation (Qiu2006hRpn13ADRM1GP110).

The interaction between ADRM1 and UCH37 involves KEKE motifs in their C-terminal regions, and this binding is necessary for maintaining normal levels of UCH37 proteins (Hamazaki2006A). ADRM1 is not an integral subunit of the proteasome, as some 26S proteasomes do not contain it, but it is essential for the deubiquitinating activity of UCH37 (Hamazaki2006A). ADRM1 also interacts with other proteins such as tubulin a-1 and tubulin b-1, indicating its involvement in additional cellular processes beyond proteasome function (Qiu2006hRpn13ADRM1GP110).
