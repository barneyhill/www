# NOS3

## Overview
The NOS3 gene encodes the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), a critical component in the production of nitric oxide (NO) within the cardiovascular system. As a member of the nitric oxide synthase family, eNOS is a key enzyme involved in the regulation of vascular tone and homeostasis. It is primarily expressed in endothelial cells, where it catalyzes the conversion of L-arginine to NO, a potent vasodilator and signaling molecule. The activity of eNOS is tightly regulated through various mechanisms, including phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions, which are essential for its role in modulating vascular function and blood pressure (OliveiraPaula2016Endothelial; Kolluru2010eNOS). Beyond its vascular functions, eNOS is also expressed in other tissues, such as cardiac myocytes and neurons, indicating its broader significance in NO signaling pathways (OliveiraPaula2016Endothelial). Variations in the NOS3 gene have been associated with several cardiovascular and endothelial-related diseases, underscoring its clinical importance (Zhang2012Pharmacogenetic; Guey2023Biallelic).

## Structure
The NOS3 gene encodes the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which plays a crucial role in producing nitric oxide (NO) in the cardiovascular system. The enzyme is a dimer composed of two identical 134 kD monomers, each containing a C-terminal reductase domain and an N-terminal oxidase domain. The reductase domain binds NADPH, FMN, and FAD, while the oxidase domain contains binding sites for heme, zinc, BH4, and L-arginine. These domains are connected by a calmodulin-binding sequence, which is essential for the regulation of the enzyme's activity (OliveiraPaula2016Endothelial).

The primary structure of NOS3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein chain, while its secondary structure consists of alpha helices and beta sheets. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, and the quaternary structure is characterized by the dimerization of the enzyme, which is stabilized by heme and BH4 binding (OliveiraPaula2016Endothelial).

NOS3 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and S-nitrosylation, which regulate its activity. These modifications are crucial for the enzyme's function in maintaining vascular homeostasis (OliveiraPaula2016Endothelial). The enzyme's structure is further characterized by a unique α-β fold in the oxygenase domain, which is similar to other NOS isoforms (ALDERTON2001Nitric).

## Function
The NOS3 gene encodes endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an enzyme crucial for producing nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells. NO is a signaling molecule that plays a vital role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by regulating vascular tone, inhibiting leukocyte adhesion, and preventing platelet aggregation (OliveiraPaula2016Endothelial). eNOS-derived NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase in smooth muscle cells, leading to the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This process decreases intracellular calcium levels, promoting smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation (OliveiraPaula2016Endothelial; Fleming2003Molecular).

eNOS is primarily located in the caveolae of endothelial cells, where it is regulated by interactions with proteins such as caveolin and calmodulin (Albrecht2002Protective). The enzyme's activity is modulated by phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions, which are essential for its function and NO production (Kolluru2010eNOS). eNOS also plays a role in angiogenesis and vascular repair by influencing endothelial cell migration and proliferation (Kolluru2010eNOS).

In addition to its vascular functions, eNOS is expressed in other cell types, including cardiac myocytes and neurons, indicating its broader role in NO signaling beyond the endothelium (OliveiraPaula2016Endothelial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the NOS3 gene, which encodes endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), have been linked to various diseases and conditions due to their impact on nitric oxide (NO) production and vascular function. NOS3 polymorphisms, such as g.-786T>C and Glu298Asp, are associated with increased susceptibility to migraines, including migraine with aura, and can influence the intensity of pain and age of onset (OliveiraPaula2016Endothelial). These genetic variations also play a role in erectile dysfunction, affecting the risk and onset of the condition, as well as the effectiveness of treatments like PDE-5 inhibitors (OliveiraPaula2016Endothelial).

In cardiovascular diseases, NOS3 variants such as 2690 C.T and 2922 A.G have been associated with coronary heart disease and heart failure, respectively. These polymorphisms can influence the effectiveness of antihypertensive treatments, particularly with drugs like amlodipine (Zhang2012Pharmacogenetic). NOS3 mutations are also implicated in moyamoya cerebral angiopathy, where biallelic variants disrupt NO signaling, leading to abnormal vascular remodeling (Guey2023Biallelic).

In high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), missense variants in NOS3, such as E298D, are linked to structural destabilization of the enzyme, reducing NO production and impairing endothelial function (Kanipakam2020Structural). These genetic alterations highlight the clinical significance of NOS3 in various vascular and endothelial-related conditions.

## Interactions
NOS3, also known as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), engages in various protein-protein interactions that regulate its activity and localization. A key interaction is with calmodulin, which activates eNOS by binding in response to increased intracellular calcium levels (Kone2003Protein; Hiroi2008Dynamic). This interaction is competitive with α-actinin-4, which binds to the calmodulin-binding domain of eNOS, inhibiting its activity by displacing calmodulin (Hiroi2008Dynamic). The R4 domain of α-actinin-4 is crucial for this binding, and its interaction with eNOS is significant for regulating eNOS activity and subcellular localization (Hiroi2008Dynamic).

eNOS also interacts with caveolin-1, which inhibits its activity by forming complexes that prevent nitric oxide release (Kone2003Protein). Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) acts as an allosteric activator, enhancing eNOS activity by facilitating its association with Akt, which promotes phosphorylation and nitric oxide production (Kone2003Protein; Taylor2013Folic). Additionally, eNOS interacts with the CAT-1 arginine transporter, enhancing nitric oxide release through a mechanism independent of arginine transport (LI2005Interaction). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network governing NOS3 function.
