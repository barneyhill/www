# PRXL2C

## Overview
PRXL2C is a gene that encodes the protein peroxiredoxin like 2C, which is part of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes. These enzymes play a crucial role in reducing oxidative stress within cells by catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. The peroxiredoxin like 2C protein is involved in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative damage and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and apoptosis. Its function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative damage, which can lead to various diseases if dysregulated. The study of PRXL2C and its encoded protein is significant for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying oxidative stress-related conditions and developing potential therapeutic strategies (Qiu2020aarFDC).
