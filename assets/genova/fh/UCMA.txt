# UCMA

## Overview
UCMA, or upper zone of growth plate and cartilage matrix associated, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein involved in cartilage and bone biology. The protein, also referred to as UCMA, is primarily expressed in the extracellular matrix of cartilage and plays a crucial role in chondrocyte differentiation and the maintenance of cartilage integrity. It is characterized by a coiled-coil domain and undergoes post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine sulfation and vitamin-K-dependent γ-carboxylation, which are essential for its function (Neacsu2011Ucmaa; SurmannSchmitt2008Ucma). UCMA interacts with fibrillin-2, influencing osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization, thereby contributing to bone homeostasis (Lee2019Unique). Alterations in UCMA expression have been linked to skeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis and Paget's disease of bone, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining skeletal health (Michou2012Genetic; Stock2017A).

## Structure
The UCMA protein, encoded by the UCMA gene, is a small secreted protein consisting of 138 amino acids. It features a 27-amino acid signal peptide, indicating its secretion into the extracellular matrix (SurmannSchmitt2008Ucma; Tagariello2008Ucma). The protein undergoes proteolytic processing by furin-like proteases, resulting in an N-terminal fragment of 37 amino acids and a C-terminal fragment of 74 amino acids, with the latter being the biologically active form (Neacsu2011Ucmaa; SurmannSchmitt2008Ucma).

UCMA is characterized by a coiled-coil domain, which suggests potential oligomerization, and a conserved RGKR/S cleavage site for proprotein convertases (Neacsu2011Ucmaa; Tagariello2008Ucma). The C-terminal fragment is rich in acidic and basic residues and is subject to post-translational modifications, including tyrosine sulfation and vitamin-K-dependent γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues, which are crucial for its function (Neacsu2011Ucmaa; SurmannSchmitt2008Ucma).

Alternative splicing of the UCMA gene results in multiple isoforms, which differ in their exon composition and affect the protein's secretion and function. Some isoforms lack specific exons, impacting the presence of the secretion signal peptide and Gla residues (Le2010Identification).

## Function
The UCMA gene encodes a secreted protein known as the unique cartilage matrix-associated protein, which plays a significant role in cartilage development and bone growth. UCMA is primarily expressed in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, where it is involved in chondrocyte differentiation and the maintenance of cartilage integrity. The protein is secreted as an uncleaved precursor and is processed into a biologically active C-terminal fragment, Ucma-C, which is distributed throughout the cartilage matrix (SurmannSchmitt2008Ucma).

UCMA is expressed during the early stages of chondrocyte differentiation and is associated with collagen fibrils in the cartilage matrix. It is particularly prominent in resting chondrocytes and declines as chondrocytes mature (SurmannSchmitt2008Ucma). The protein does not affect chondrocyte proliferation or differentiation but inhibits osteogenic differentiation, suggesting a role in maintaining the balance between cartilage and bone formation (SurmannSchmitt2008Ucma).

In osteoblasts, UCMA is a direct transcriptional target of the transcription factors Runx2 and Osterix, promoting osteoblast differentiation and nodule formation. Its expression is crucial for proper osteoblast function and bone formation, indicating its importance in skeletal development (Lee2015Ucma).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the UCMA gene have been implicated in several skeletal disorders. In osteoarthritis, UCMA is overexpressed in affected cartilage, and its deficiency in mice leads to increased cartilage damage, suggesting a chondroprotective role. UCMA inhibits aggrecanase activity, which is involved in cartilage degradation, and its deficiency results in increased aggrecan degradation and chondrocyte apoptosis (Stock2017A). 

UCMA is also associated with Paget's disease of bone (PDB). Genetic studies have identified specific haplotypes of the UCMA/GRP gene that are significantly associated with PDB in certain populations, indicating a potential genetic predisposition linked to this gene (Michou2012Genetic). 

In zebrafish, knockdown of the UCMA ortholog ucmaa results in severe skeletal developmental defects, including disrupted notochord function and impaired growth, due to a secondary loss of collagen II and aggrecan. This suggests that similar mechanisms could be relevant in human skeletal diseases, such as 'warfarin embryopathies,' which are characterized by cartilage hypoplasia and ectopic calcification when vitamin K antagonists affect UCMA's function during pregnancy (Neacsu2011Ucmaa).

## Interactions
UCMA, also known as the upper zone of growth plate and cartilage matrix associated protein, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cartilage and bone biology. One significant interaction is with fibrillin-2 (FBN2), a major component of microfibrils important for elastic fiber formation. UCMA directly interacts with FBN2, and this interaction is independent of calcium binding. This was demonstrated through pull-down assays using proteins expressed in HEK293-FT cells, where the interaction persisted even in the absence of calcium, as confirmed by the use of specific antibodies and a mutated version of UCMA lacking Gla residues (Lee2019Unique).

UCMA is also known to influence the expression of FBN2. In osteoblasts, the expression of FBN2 is proportional to UCMA levels, suggesting a regulatory relationship. This was observed in experiments where UCMA overexpression led to increased FBN2 expression, while UCMA knockdown resulted in decreased FBN2 expression (Lee2019Unique).

These interactions highlight UCMA's role in osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization, suggesting its involvement in the molecular dynamics of bone homeostasis and its potential implications in joint diseases like osteoarthritis (Lee2019Unique).
