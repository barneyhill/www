# SNAP23

## Overview
SNAP23 is a gene that encodes the synaptosome-associated protein 23, a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) protein family, which is integral to the process of vesicle fusion and membrane trafficking. The SNAP23 protein is ubiquitously expressed across various cell types and is involved in numerous exocytosis events, playing a pivotal role in cellular communication and function. Unlike some other SNARE proteins, SNAP23 lacks a transmembrane domain but is anchored to membranes through palmitoylation of its cysteine-rich region. It forms part of the SNARE complex by interacting with other SNARE proteins, such as syntaxin and VAMP, facilitating the fusion of vesicles with target membranes. This protein is crucial in processes such as the exocytosis of von Willebrand factor in endothelial cells and the trafficking of receptors in neurons, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and physiological homeostasis (STDENIS1999SNAP23; Zhu2015SNAP23; Raynaud2018SNAP23–Kif5).

## Structure
SNAP23 is a member of the SNARE protein family, characterized by its role in vesicle fusion processes. The primary structure of SNAP23 includes a sequence of amino acids forming the SNARE motif, which is crucial for its function in membrane fusion events (STDENIS1999SNAP23). The protein lacks a transmembrane domain but contains a cysteine-rich region that is essential for its membrane association. This region undergoes palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that facilitates its attachment to the plasma membrane (STDENIS1999SNAP23; Agarwal2019The).

The secondary structure of SNAP23 likely includes coiled-coil regions, which enable interactions with other SNARE proteins such as syntaxin and VAMP, forming part of the SNARE complex (STDENIS1999SNAP23). The cysteine-rich domain is crucial for the protein's membrane localization and function, with specific cysteine residues undergoing palmitoylation to anchor the protein to the membrane (Agarwal2019The).

In terms of quaternary structure, SNAP23 interacts with other SNARE proteins to form complexes necessary for exocytosis. It can functionally replace SNAP25 in certain exocytosis processes, indicating its versatile role in SNARE complex assembly (STDENIS1999SNAP23). The protein's interaction with Snapin, a SNARE-binding protein, further highlights its involvement in various membrane-fusion events (BUXTON2003Identification).

## Function
SNAP23 is a SNARE protein that plays a critical role in membrane fusion events necessary for intracellular membrane traffic. It is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types, including adipocytes, mast cells, platelets, pancreatic acinar cells, kidney epithelial cells, and neutrophils, where it regulates a wide variety of exocytosis events (Kaul2015Expression). In endothelial cells, SNAP23 is essential for the exocytosis of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a process crucial for vascular homeostasis. It forms complexes with other SNARE proteins such as STX4, VAMP3, and VAMP8, facilitating vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane (Zhu2015SNAP23).

SNAP23 is also involved in the trafficking and membrane localization of the group I metabotropic glutamate mGlu1 receptor in neurons. It interacts with the mGlu1 receptor and is part of a complex with Kif5, a molecular motor, which is crucial for the receptor's transport along microtubules and its cell surface expression. This process is significant for synaptic plasticity and the regulation of synaptic transmission (Raynaud2018SNAP23–Kif5). SNAP23's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular communication and function across different tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SNAP23 gene have been linked to several metabolic and cellular conditions. SNAP23 plays a critical role in adipocyte survival by regulating BAX-dependent programmed cell death. Deficiency in SNAP23 leads to increased BAX protein levels, resulting in enhanced adipocyte cell death and contributing to a lipodystrophic phenotype characterized by insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and liver steatosis (Feng2018SNAP23). This condition is marked by the absence of adipose tissue and severe metabolic disturbances, including hyperlipidemia and hepatomegaly (Feng2018SNAP23).

SNAP23 is also implicated in cystic fibrosis, where a specific intronic variant, SNAP23:c.267-9T4C, has been associated with lung function parameters. This variant may influence splicing and alter the interaction with CFTR, potentially modifying disease severity by affecting CFTR function (Gisler2012Identification).

In endothelial cells, SNAP23 is essential for the exocytosis of von Willebrand factor, and its deficiency impairs this process, highlighting its role in vascular function (Zhu2015SNAP23). Overall, alterations in SNAP23 expression or function can lead to significant impacts on metabolic health and cellular processes, contributing to various disease states.

## Interactions
SNAP23 is a t-SNARE protein that participates in various protein interactions crucial for vesicle fusion and membrane trafficking. It forms complexes with other SNARE proteins, such as syntaxin-4 and VAMP-2, in non-neuronal cells. These interactions are regulated by phosphorylation, with casein kinase II and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) affecting the binding dynamics (Foster1998Binary). SNAP23 also interacts with Snapin, a ubiquitously expressed SNARE-binding protein, in non-neuronal cells. This interaction is specific and involves the C-terminal helical domain of Snapin (BUXTON2003Identification).

In endothelial cells, SNAP23 is involved in the exocytosis of von Willebrand factor (VWF) by forming complexes with STX4, VAMP3, and VAMP8. This interaction is essential for endothelial exocytosis and is enhanced upon stimulation with histamine or calcium ionophore (Zhu2015SNAP23). SNAP23 also plays a role in platelet exocytosis, forming a complex with syntaxin 2, which is crucial for the calcium-induced release of dense core granules (Chen2000Molecular). These interactions highlight SNAP23's role in various cellular processes involving vesicle trafficking and exocytosis.
