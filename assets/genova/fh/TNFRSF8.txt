# TNFRSF8

## Overview
TNFRSF8, also known as CD30, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The protein, TNF receptor superfamily member 8, is characterized by its extracellular cysteine-rich domains, which are essential for ligand binding, and a cytoplasmic domain that mediates signal transduction. This receptor is primarily expressed on activated T and B cells and certain lymphoma cells, playing a pivotal role in immune regulation and serving as a marker for specific neoplasms (So2019The; Oso2021Homology). TNFRSF8 is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, through its interactions with ligands and other signaling molecules. Its expression and function are significant in the context of immune responses and have implications in lymphoproliferative disorders and cancer, where it is considered a potential biomarker for immunotherapy responses (Dostert2019The; Dong2022Thirteen).

## Structure
TNFRSF8, also known as CD30, is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The protein features an extracellular domain characterized by cysteine-rich motifs, which are typical of TNF receptor family members and are crucial for ligand binding (So2019The). The transmembrane domain anchors the protein in the cell membrane, while the cytoplasmic domain is involved in signal transduction, mediating cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Oso2021Homology).

The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may influence its stability and function. TNFRSF8 is expressed on activated T and B cells, as well as on certain types of lymphoma cells, where it plays a role in immune regulation and is a marker for some neoplasms (Oso2021Homology).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TNFRSF8 are not provided in the available context, the protein's involvement in immune signaling pathways and its structural characteristics align with those of other TNF receptor family members, which typically form trimeric complexes upon ligand binding (Dostert2019The).

## Function
TNFRSF8, also known as CD30, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is primarily expressed on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as memory T cells. Its expression is induced through signaling pathways involving CD28. CD30 interacts with its ligand, CD30L (TNFSF8), which is expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This interaction is crucial for promoting T-cell survival, expansion, and cytokine production, which are essential for effective immune responses (Dostert2019The).

CD30 plays a significant role in the differentiation of Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells involved in autoimmune responses. CD30-deficient T cells exhibit impaired Th17 differentiation and produce IL-2 under Th17 polarization conditions. The ligation of CD30 is necessary to suppress IL-2 signaling during Th17 differentiation, highlighting its role in modulating immune responses (Dostert2019The).

In regulatory T cells (Tregs), early CD30 signaling is important for their suppressive functionality. This is particularly evident in FoxP3-deficient mice, where the additional genetic deletion of CD30 abrogates disease symptoms, indicating its role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases (Dostert2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TNFRSF8 gene, also known as CD30, are associated with several lymphoproliferative disorders. CD30 is notably expressed in Hodgkin's lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, where it can activate NF-κB independently of its ligand, leading to hyperactivation that suppresses the cell cycle and induces apoptosis (So2019The). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), CD30 is expressed in approximately 20% of cases and is associated with a distinct molecular subtype characterized by specific genetic mutations. These include higher mutation frequencies in genes such as TNFAIP3, TNFRSF14, and SOCS1, and lower mutation frequencies in CD79B and MYD88 (Huo2022Molecular). 

The expression of TNFRSF8 is also linked to immune responses in various cancers. It has been identified as a potential biomarker for predicting responses to immunotherapy, particularly anti-PD-1 therapy, due to its role in immune cell infiltration and type I anti-tumor responses (Dong2022Thirteen). Additionally, TNFRSF8 expression is associated with poorer overall survival in cancer patients, suggesting its involvement in oncogenic pathways (Dong2022Thirteen). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TNFRSF8 in cancer prognosis and treatment.

## Interactions
TNFRSF8, also known as CD30, is a receptor that interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in immune responses. One of its primary interactions is with its ligand, CD30L (TNFSF8), which is expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells. This interaction is crucial for T-cell survival, expansion, and cytokine production, and is similar to other T-cell co-stimulatory receptors (Dostert2019The). 

CD30 also interacts with TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), specifically TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5. These interactions are involved in the activation of signaling pathways such as NF-κB and apoptosis. The recruitment of these TRAF proteins by CD30 influences various cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (So2019The). 

In the context of cancer, TNFRSF8 is associated with oncogenic signaling pathways, which may influence patient outcomes. It is also noted for its role in immune cell infiltration and type I anti-tumor responses, making it a potential biomarker for immunotherapy responses, particularly in relation to PD-1 blockade (Dong2022Thirteen).
