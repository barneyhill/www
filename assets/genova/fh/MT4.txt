# MT4

## Overview
Metallothionein 4 (MT4) is a gene that encodes the protein metallothionein 4, which is part of the metallothionein family known for their role in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification. The MT4 protein is characterized by its ability to bind metal ions such as zinc and copper through the formation of metal-thiolate clusters, which are essential for its function in metal binding and detoxification processes (Meloni2006Organization). Unlike other metallothioneins, MT4 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, predominantly in stratified squamous epithelia, and is implicated in processes such as keratinocyte differentiation and protection against metal-induced oxidative stress (Meloni2006Organization; Moleirinho2011Gains). The gene's expression and methylation patterns have been studied in the context of various clinical conditions, including cancer, where it may serve as a potential biomarker for disease progression and prognosis (Tong2019Evaluation).

## Function
Metallothionein 4 (MT4) is a protein involved in metal ion homeostasis, primarily binding zinc and copper ions. It is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, predominantly in stratified squamous epithelia, and plays a role in regulating zinc or copper metabolism (Meloni2006Organization). MT4 forms metal-thiolate clusters, which are crucial for its function in metal binding and detoxification processes. These clusters are organized into two distinct domains: a 3-metal cluster in the β-domain and a 4-metal cluster in the α-domain, with all 20 cysteine residues participating in metal binding (Meloni2006Organization).

MT4 is thought to contribute to zinc-dependent processes such as keratinocyte differentiation and the proteolytic processing of keratins, suggesting a role in epithelial cell function (Meloni2006Organization). It may also provide protection against cadmium toxicity, although its exact metal binding specificity remains unclear (Meloni2006Organization). The protein's stability and metal-binding characteristics are influenced by its structural organization, which is similar to other metallothioneins but exhibits unique features that may affect its reactivity with metal-chelating agents (Cai2005The). MT4's expression and function in specific tissues suggest it has specialized roles in maintaining metal ion balance and protecting cells from metal-induced oxidative stress (Moleirinho2011Gains).

## Clinical Significance
The MT4 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in metal detoxification and homeostasis. A significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MT4 gene, located in intron 2 (c.98-137 A>G), has been associated with physiological and pathophysiological processes. This SNP is linked to altered renal function in individuals exposed to lead, as evidenced by higher serum creatinine and urea levels in workers with the AG genotype compared to those with the AA genotype. Additionally, individuals carrying the G allele exhibited higher blood pressure, with the AA genotype showing the strongest correlation with increased serum uric acid levels (Raudenska2014Metallothionein).

In the context of cancer, MT4 expression is generally downregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is often associated with increased DNA methylation in gastric cancer, although MT4 is an exception to the typical inverse correlation between methylation and mRNA expression observed in other metallothionein isoforms (Tong2019Evaluation). The MT4 gene's expression and methylation patterns may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting progression and prognosis in gastric cancer (Tong2019Evaluation). However, the specific impact of MT4 mutations or expression alterations on other diseases remains less well-documented.
