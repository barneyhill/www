# HGH1

## Overview
HGH1 is a gene that encodes the HGH1 homolog protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. The HGH1 homolog is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein that plays a role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular growth regulation. It is evolutionarily conserved across multiple species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular function. The protein is implicated in the assembly of ribosomal subunits, which are essential for protein synthesis within the cell. Mutations or dysregulation of the HGH1 gene may have clinical significance, potentially contributing to disorders related to impaired cellular growth and proliferation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
