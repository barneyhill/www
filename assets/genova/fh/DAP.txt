# DAP

## Overview
The DAP (death associated protein) gene encodes a family of proteins that play a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis, a fundamental process for cellular homeostasis and development. Among these, DAP kinase is a prominent serine/threonine kinase characterized by its multidomain structure, including a kinase domain, a calmodulin regulatory domain, and a death domain, which collectively contribute to its proapoptotic functions (Raveh2000A; LevyStrumpf1998Death). The protein encoded by the DAP gene is involved in various cellular signaling pathways that mediate cell death, survival, and stress responses, thereby maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis (Kimchi1998DAP). DAP kinase acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression frequently lost in cancer due to hypermethylation, and is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where it influences pathological processes (Katzenellenbogen1999Hypermethylation; Kim2019DeathAssociated).

## Structure
The DAP-kinase gene encodes a protein involved in apoptosis, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids forming a serine/threonine kinase with a molecular weight of 160 kDa (LevyStrumpf1998Death). The secondary structure features a classical 12 subdomain composition typical of serine/threonine kinases, along with eight ankyrin repeats and two P-loop motifs (LevyStrumpf1998Death). The tertiary structure is defined by a multidomain organization, including a kinase domain, a calmodulin regulatory domain, a death domain, and a serine-rich C-terminal tail (Raveh2000A; Cohen1999DapKinase).

The death domain, crucial for proapoptotic activity, consists of six alpha-helices, with unique loops that may facilitate specific protein interactions (Raveh2000A). The C-terminal tail acts as a negative regulatory region, with its deletion enhancing apoptotic activity (Raveh2000A). DAP-kinase undergoes post-translational modifications, such as autophosphorylation, which are essential for its function (LevyStrumpf1998Death). The protein's activity is regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin, and removal of the calmodulin regulatory domain results in a constitutively active kinase (LevyStrumpf1998Death). The protein does not homodimerize, suggesting interactions with novel proteins (Raveh2000A).

## Function
The DAP (death associated protein) gene is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, a critical process for maintaining cellular homeostasis. DAP genes, including DAP-1, DAP-3, and DAP-5, encode proteins that are integral to apoptotic pathways. DAP-1 encodes a proline-rich protein that, when overexpressed, promotes cell death, indicating its role as a positive mediator of apoptosis (Kimchi1998DAP). DAP-3 is a nucleotide-binding protein that also induces cell death upon overexpression, highlighting its essential role in apoptosis across species (LevyStrumpf1998Death; Kimchi1998DAP).

DAP-5, homologous to the translation initiation factor eIF4G, lacks the N-terminal region necessary for cap-binding, suggesting it may not support cap-dependent translation. Instead, it may function similarly to a truncated form of eIF4G, potentially affecting translation under apoptotic stress. A mini-protein derived from DAP-5 can confer resistance to apoptosis, indicating its involvement in both promoting and inhibiting cell death, depending on its expression level (LevyStrumpf1998Death; Kimchi1998DAP).

These proteins are primarily active in the cytoplasm and are involved in various signaling pathways that influence cell survival, proliferation, and stress responses, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance between cell survival and apoptosis in healthy cells (Kimchi1998DAP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DAP (death-associated protein) gene are linked to various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, DAP kinase, a product of the DAP gene, acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is often lost in tumors due to hypermethylation, which silences the gene and contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. This loss is observed in several cancers, including B-cell malignancies, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and head and neck cancer (Katzenellenbogen1999Hypermethylation; Inbal1997DAP). The absence of DAP kinase disrupts the p19 ARF/p53 apoptotic checkpoint, providing a selective advantage for cancer cells (Raveh2000DAP).

In neurodegenerative diseases, DAP kinase is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In AD, DAPK1 is overexpressed, leading to increased tau protein stability and phosphorylation, which are associated with neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, key pathological features of the disease (Kim2019DeathAssociated). DAPK1 also influences amyloid precursor protein processing, promoting amyloidogenic pathways and increasing neurotoxic amyloid-beta production, a critical step in AD pathogenesis (Chen2019DeathAssociated). In PD, DAPK1 is linked to neuronal synucleinopathy and dopaminergic neuron cell death (Kim2019DeathAssociated).
