# LHFPL6

## Overview
LHFPL6 is a gene that encodes the protein LHFPL tetraspan subfamily member 6, which is part of the tetraspanin family. This protein is characterized by its three putative transmembrane domains, indicating its role in membrane organization and function. LHFPL6 is involved in the proton-coupled organic cation (H+/OC) antiport activity at the blood-brain barrier, where it plays a crucial role in the transport of specific substrates, potentially impacting drug delivery to the brain (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the central nervous system, and has been identified as a candidate prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for gastric cancer (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased). Additionally, genetic variants of LHFPL6 have been linked to conditions such as lipoedema and longevity, highlighting its potential significance in both metabolic and aging-related processes (Gurinovich2021Effect; Grigoriadis2021Investigation).

## Function
LHFPL6 is involved in proton-coupled organic cation (H+/OC) antiport activity at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), playing a role in the transport of specific substrates across this barrier. This function is crucial for maintaining the transport of organic cations, which are important for drug delivery to the brain (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased). LHFPL6, along with TM7SF3, was identified as a component of the H+/OC antiporter through a proteomics-based method known as the PICK method, which combines photo-affinity labeling with proteomics analysis (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased).

The protein encoded by LHFPL6 is expressed in various tissues, including central nervous system cells, and is considered a candidate prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for gastric cancer (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased). It has three putative transmembrane domains, suggesting its involvement in membrane organization and function (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased). In cellular models, knockdown of LHFPL6, along with TM7SF3, resulted in a significant decrease in the uptake of H+/OC antiporter substrates, indicating its critical role in this transport mechanism (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased). While LHFPL6 alone may not significantly alter substrate uptake, it may function in conjunction with TM7SF3 to facilitate the H+/OC antiporter activity (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased).

## Clinical Significance
The LHFPL6 gene has been implicated in several health conditions through its genetic variants and expression alterations. In the context of lipoedema, a condition characterized by abnormal fat accumulation, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the LHFPL6 gene on chromosome 13 have been associated with the disease. These SNPs, including rs1409440, rs7994616, and rs11616618, are suggested to regulate the expression of LHFPL6, particularly in lower leg skin tissue. The study indicates a potential genetic link between LHFPL6 and lipoedema, with a strong association of autosomal dominant inheritance with sex limitation observed in affected family members (Grigoriadis2021Investigation).

LHFPL6 has also been associated with longevity. A rare SNP, rs9576827, correlates with higher levels of NENF, a protein linked to increased neuronal survival, suggesting a role in cognitive function preservation in centenarians. This SNP is also a protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) for SVEP1, a serum protein associated with aging (Gurinovich2021Effect).

In cancer research, LHFPL6 has been identified as a novel gene associated with hepatoblastoma, a type of liver cancer, suggesting its potential involvement in carcinogenesis (Yang2022The). However, further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of LHFPL6 in these and other conditions.

## Interactions
LHFPL6, a member of the LHFPL tetraspan subfamily, is implicated in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is involved in the proton-coupled organic cation (H+/OC) antiport mechanism at the blood-brain barrier, where it potentially interacts with TM7SF3. The co-expression of LHFPL6 and TM7SF3 in HEK293 cells has been shown to increase the uptake of certain substrates, suggesting a collaborative role in the antiporter function, although these increases were not statistically significant (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased). Knockdown experiments in hCMEC/D3 cells demonstrated that reducing LHFPL6 expression decreased the uptake of H+/OC antiporter substrates by more than 25%, indicating its specific involvement in this transport process (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased).

LHFPL6 is also associated with genetic variants linked to longevity. The SNP rs9576827 in the LHFPL6 gene correlates with the expression of proteins such as SVEP1 and ARRDC3, which are overexpressed in centenarians, and LMAN2, which is underexpressed in centenarians. These interactions suggest a role for LHFPL6 in modulating protein expression patterns associated with aging and longevity (Gurinovich2021Effect). However, specific protein interaction pathways or mechanisms involving LHFPL6 remain to be fully elucidated.
