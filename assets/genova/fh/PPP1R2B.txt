# PPP1R2B

## Overview
The PPP1R2B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 2B, which is a member of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitor family. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of PP1, a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes, including cell division, protein synthesis, and muscle contraction. By modulating PP1 activity, PPP1R2B influences numerous signaling pathways and cellular functions. Dysregulation of PPP1R2B has been implicated in several neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
