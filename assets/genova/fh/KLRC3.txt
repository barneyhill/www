# KLRC3

## Overview
KLRC3, or killer cell lectin-like receptor C3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the C-type lectin superfamily, primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells. The protein product of KLRC3 functions as a receptor involved in the immune response, particularly in the recognition and elimination of virus-infected cells. It forms a heterodimer with CD94, creating an activating receptor that interacts with non-classical MHC class Ib molecules, such as HLA-E, to modulate NK cell activity (Nakata2013Low). This receptor is crucial for maintaining immune surveillance and defense against infections. Additionally, KLRC3 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and reproductive disorders, where its expression and regulation can significantly impact disease progression and immune response (Zhang2023Identification; Dabous2024Regulation).

## Function
KLRC3, also known as killer cell lectin-like receptor C3, encodes a protein that is primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. This protein is part of the C-type lectin superfamily and plays a crucial role in the immune response by regulating NK cell activity. KLRC3 forms a heterodimer with CD94, encoded by the KLRD1 gene, to create an activating receptor on NK cells. This receptor is involved in recognizing and responding to virus-infected cells by binding to non-classical MHC class Ib molecules, such as HLA-E in humans, and interacting with the adaptor molecule DAP12 to activate NK cells (Nakata2013Low).

The activation of NK cells through the KLRC3-CD94 heterodimer is essential for effective immune responses, particularly in recognizing and eliminating virus-infected cells. This process contributes to the body's protective immune response, highlighting the importance of KLRC3 in maintaining immune surveillance and defense against infections (Nakata2013Low). In healthy individuals, the proper expression and function of KLRC3 are vital for effective NK cell-mediated immune responses, ensuring the immune system can adequately respond to threats (Nakata2013Low).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KLRC3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and repeated implantation failure (RIF), KLRC3 is identified as a downregulated gene. This downregulation may lead to insufficient activation and defective function of natural killer (NK) cells, which are crucial for maintaining immunological balance at the maternal-fetal interface. Such alterations can contribute to pathological pregnancies, including pre-eclampsia, recurrent miscarriage, and RIF (Zhang2023Identification).

In cervical cancer, KLRC3 expression is regulated by miR-141, which is upregulated in cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-141 leads to reduced expression of KLRC3, supporting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. This suggests that KLRC3 plays a role in tumor suppression, and its downregulation may facilitate cancer progression (Dabous2024Regulation).

KLRC3 is also associated with immune phenotypes in lung adenocarcinoma. It is identified as a core gene within a regulatory network linked to better prognosis and improved response to immunotherapy, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in enhancing immunotherapy efficacy (Mao2022Integrative).

## Interactions
KLRC3, also known as NKG2E, is involved in interactions with other proteins that are crucial for immune response modulation. One of the primary interactions of KLRC3 is with HLA-E, a non-classical MHC class I molecule. This interaction is significant for the immune system as it can influence the activation or inhibition of natural killer (NK) cells. The binding of KLRC3 to HLA-E involves two hydrogen bonds at the C-terminal of KLRC3, which may stabilize the flexible loop of KLRC3, suggesting a differential binding affinity compared to KLRC2, another member of the same receptor family (Yang2023Characterization).

In the context of cervical cancer, KLRC3 expression is regulated by miR-141, a microRNA that is upregulated in cancer cells. miR-141 negatively regulates KLRC3 expression, which may impact cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by modulating immune cell interactions. This regulation is part of a broader mechanism where miR-141 affects several genes associated with NK cell receptors, potentially altering immune responses against tumors (Dabous2024Regulation). These interactions highlight the role of KLRC3 in both normal immune function and pathological conditions such as cancer.
