# STIL

## Overview
STIL (SCL/TAL1 interrupting locus) is a gene that encodes the STIL centriolar assembly protein, a pivotal component in the process of centriole duplication and centrosome formation in human cells. The STIL protein is categorized as a centriolar assembly protein and plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell division by ensuring the proper formation and function of centrioles, which are essential for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. The protein contains several functional domains, including a central coiled-coil domain and a STAN domain, which facilitate its interactions with other centriolar proteins such as PLK4 and SAS-6, thereby promoting centriole biogenesis and stability (Arquint2015STIL; Arquint2016The). Mutations in the STIL gene have been linked to developmental disorders like primary microcephaly and are implicated in various cancers, where they contribute to genomic instability and tumor progression (Li2022STIL; Arquint2014STIL).

## Structure
The STIL protein, encoded by the human STIL gene, is essential for centriole duplication and centrosome formation. It features a central coiled-coil domain (CCD), which is crucial for its oligomerization and function in centriolar assembly. The CCD forms an alpha-helical structure stabilized by specific hydrophobic residues, such as leucine residues L718 and L736, which are critical for its oligomerization into dimers and tetramers (David2016Molecular). Mutations in these residues can significantly affect the protein's stability and its ability to interact with other proteins like PLK4, a kinase involved in centriole duplication (David2016Molecular).

The STIL protein also contains a STAN domain, which is phosphorylated by PLK4, facilitating interactions with SAS-6, another protein involved in centriole assembly (Arquint2016The). The interaction between STIL and PLK4 is mediated by the coiled-coil region of STIL, which binds to the Polo-box 3 (PB3) domain of PLK4, playing a critical role in relieving PLK4's auto-inhibition and promoting centriole duplication (Arquint2015STIL). The STIL protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may have distinct functions (Arquint2015STIL).

## Function
The STIL gene encodes a protein essential for centriole duplication in human cells, a critical process for proper cell division. STIL localizes to the centrosomes, particularly at the pericentriolar material surrounding parental centrioles, and is involved in the formation and stability of the cartwheel structure, which is crucial for procentriole assembly (Vulprecht2012STIL; Arquint2014STIL). It interacts with other centriolar proteins such as CPAP and hSAS6, facilitating their recruitment to the procentriole, which is necessary for centriole biogenesis (Vulprecht2012STIL; Tang2011The).

STIL's expression is tightly regulated throughout the cell cycle, accumulating in late G1 and early S phases and diminishing as cells exit mitosis (Tang2011The). It shuttles between the cytoplasm and centrosomes, a process independent of the cell cycle phase, and is necessary for the recruitment of SAS6 to centrioles (Vulprecht2012STIL). The protein is also involved in primary cilia formation, as its absence leads to a lack of primary cilia, which can be restored by reintroducing STIL (Vulprecht2012STIL).

Mutations in STIL can lead to centriole amplification and are associated with developmental disorders such as primary microcephaly, highlighting its critical role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Arquint2014STIL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STIL gene are associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by reduced brain size. These mutations interfere with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-mediated degradation pathway, leading to centriole amplification due to the deletion of a C-terminal KEN box, which makes STIL resistant to proteasomal degradation (Arquint2014STIL). 

In cancer, alterations in STIL expression have been observed in various types, including lung, prostate, bladder, and ovarian cancers. Upregulation of STIL is linked to worse cancer outcomes and increased metastatic potential. It acts as an oncogene by promoting cancer progression through pathways like the mitotic spindle and G2M checkpoint (Li2022STIL). STIL's interaction with FOXM1 in lung cancer promotes tumor progression and metastasis, with high expression levels associated with poor prognosis (Wang2022A).

A specific mutation, S76L, in STIL disrupts its interaction with BRCA1, leading to centrosome amplification and increased cell migration, contributing to cancer development by causing DNA damage and centrosome amplification (Sanghi2024Oncogenic).

## Interactions
STIL, a crucial protein for centriole duplication, interacts with several other proteins involved in centriolar assembly. It directly interacts with CPAP, a protein that regulates centriolar microtubule assembly, facilitating procentriole formation (Tang2011The). STIL also interacts with PLK4, a kinase essential for centriole biogenesis. This interaction is mediated through the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of STIL, which binds to the Polo-box 3 (PB3) region of PLK4. This binding is necessary for centriole duplication and involves a zipper-type coiled-coil interaction (Arquint2015STIL). 

STIL's interaction with PLK4 is crucial for protecting PLK4 from degradation and for its activation, which is necessary for the recruitment of SAS-6 to the procentriole, facilitating cartwheel formation (Arquint2016The). STIL also interacts with CEP85, which is required for the activation of PLK4 and the localization of STIL to centrosomes. This interaction is essential for robust PLK4 activation and efficient centriole assembly (Liu2018Direct). These interactions highlight STIL's central role in the regulation and execution of centriole duplication.
