"summary": "This gene encodes a member of a family of enzymes that function to add glutathione to target electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins, and products of oxidative stress. This action is an important step in detoxification of these compounds. This subfamily of enzymes has a particular role in protecting cells from reactive oxygen species and the products of peroxidation. Polymorphisms in this gene influence the ability of individuals to metabolize different drugs. This gene is located in a cluster of similar genes and pseudogenes on chromosome 6. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
