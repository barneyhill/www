# OR1C1

## Overview
OR1C1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily C member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odorants, contributing significantly to the sense of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odor molecules, such as linalool, to initiate signal transduction pathways that result in olfactory perception (Ieki2022Functional). The OR1C1 gene is considered unique to humans, suggesting a specialized role in human olfactory functions (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). While its primary function is associated with olfactory processes, the broader implications of OR1C1 in other tissues remain to be fully elucidated (Flegel2016Characterization).

## Function
OR1C1 is an olfactory receptor involved in the detection of odorants, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is responsible for initiating signal transduction pathways upon binding with specific odor molecules. In healthy human cells, OR1C1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to odorants such as linalool, a citrus-scented compound, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory perception (Ieki2022Functional).

The receptor's activation involves a signaling cascade that includes the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is crucial for transmitting the olfactory signal to the brain (Tong2021Ectopic). The gene OR1C1 has been identified as unique to humans, highlighting its potential role in human-specific olfactory functions (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). Despite its known involvement in olfactory perception, the specific function of OR1C1 in other healthy human tissues remains less clear, as studies have primarily focused on its role in the olfactory system (Flegel2016Characterization).
