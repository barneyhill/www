# SLC6A20

## Overview
The SLC6A20 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 6 member 20, which is a sodium chloride-dependent transporter involved in the transport of amino acids across cell membranes. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 6 (SLC6) and is primarily expressed in the intestine and kidney, where it plays a critical role in amino acid homeostasis and cellular osmoregulation. SLC6A20 facilitates the co-transport of L-proline, hydroxy L-proline, and betaine with sodium and chloride ions, contributing to the reabsorption of these amino acids and preventing their loss in urine (Jv2023Genetic; Verrey2009Kidney). Structurally, the protein is characterized by twelve transmembrane domains and a 5 + 5 helical architecture, which are essential for its function (Pramod2013SLC6; Seow2004Hartnup). Mutations in the SLC6A20 gene can lead to disorders such as iminoglycinuria, affecting renal amino acid transport and associated with conditions like nephrolithiasis and hypertension (Freissmuth2017SLC6; Jv2023Genetic).

## Structure
The SLC6A20 protein, a member of the solute carrier family 6, is a sodium chloride-dependent transporter primarily expressed in the intestine and kidney. It mediates the co-transport of L-proline with two sodium ions and one chloride ion, and also transports hydroxy L-proline and betaine with high affinity (Jv2023Genetic). The protein is predicted to have twelve transmembrane domains, with both the N and C termini located intracellularly, a common feature among SLC6 transporters (Seow2004Hartnup). 

The tertiary structure of SLC6 transporters, including SLC6A20, involves a 5 + 5 helical architecture, where transmembrane domains (TMs) 1-5 and TMs 6-10 form two antiparallel pentahelical bundles. TMs 11 and 12 are peripheral and may play roles in regulation rather than transport (Pramod2013SLC6). The protein's structure is crucial for its function in amino acid transport and is influenced by interactions with accessory proteins like collectrin and ACE-2, which are necessary for proper cell surface delivery and catalytic activity (Freissmuth2017SLC6). 

Mutations in SLC6A20 can lead to disorders such as iminoglycinuria, affecting the renal transport of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline (Freissmuth2017SLC6).

## Function
The SLC6A20 gene encodes a transporter protein that is part of the solute carrier family 6, specifically functioning in the uptake of proline and other small amino acids across cell membranes. This protein is primarily active in the kidneys and intestines, where it plays a crucial role in amino acid homeostasis and cellular osmoregulation. In the kidney, SLC6A20 is localized to the brush border membrane of the proximal tubule, where it mediates the cotransport of L-proline, hydroxy-L-proline, and betaine with two sodium ions and one chloride ion, but does not transport glycine (Verrey2009Kidney; Jv2023Genetic). This transporter is essential for the reabsorption of these amino acids, preventing their loss in urine and maintaining metabolic balance (Verrey2009Kidney).

SLC6A20's function is dependent on its association with collectrin for surface expression in the kidney, as evidenced by reduced expression and increased urinary L-proline loss in collectrin knock-out mice (Verrey2009Kidney). Mutations in SLC6A20 can lead to conditions such as iminoglycinuria, characterized by abnormal renal transport of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, and are associated with nephrolithiasis, hypertension, and glycosuria (Jv2023Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC6A20 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily affecting renal function. The gene is associated with autosomal recessive sub-amino aciduria, such as iminoglycinuria, which involves abnormal renal transport of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline (Jv2023Genetic). A specific heterozygous mutation, c.1072T > C (p.Cys358Arg), has been identified in a family with nephrolithiasis, a condition characterized by kidney stones. This mutation is associated with hyperglycinuria, which is hypothesized to contribute to the formation of kidney stones in affected individuals (Jv2023Genetic).

The SLC6A20 gene is also implicated in the regulation of proline transport in the kidney. Mutations such as T199M in SLC6A20 can significantly reduce transport activity, contributing to conditions like iminoglycinuria when combined with mutations in other transporter genes like SLC36A2 (Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria). These genetic alterations can lead to complex phenotypes involving the loss of urinary solutes, highlighting the gene's role in renal amino acid reabsorption (Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria).
