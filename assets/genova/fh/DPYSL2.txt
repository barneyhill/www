# DPYSL2

## Overview
The DPYSL2 gene encodes the protein dihydropyrimidinase-like 2, also known as collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), which is a member of the dihydropyrimidinase-like protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of neuronal development and synaptic function, playing a critical role in axonal guidance, synaptic plasticity, and cytoskeletal dynamics. CRMP2 is characterized by its dihydropyrimidinase domain and is subject to various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and SUMOylation, which modulate its activity and interactions with other proteins. It is highly expressed during key developmental periods and is implicated in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, due to its influence on neuronal growth and synaptic transmission (Desprez2023Contribution).

## Structure
DPYSL2, also known as CRMP2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal development and axonal guidance. The primary structure of DPYSL2 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the DPYSL2 gene. Its secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its function. In its quaternary structure, DPYSL2 often forms a tetramer, which is a complex of four protein subunits.

The protein contains a dihydropyrimidinase domain, which is significant for its enzymatic activity. DPYSL2 is subject to various post-translational modifications, with phosphorylation being a common modification that can influence its activity and interactions. This protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which contribute to its functional diversity and allow it to participate in different cellular processes. These structural features and modifications enable DPYSL2 to perform its role in the nervous system effectively.

## Function
The DPYSL2 gene encodes a protein known as collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), which is part of the dihydropyrimidinase-like protein family. This protein plays a crucial role in synaptic physiology and neurodevelopmental processes. It is involved in axonal growth and elongation, dendritic spine formation, and synaptic plasticity, primarily through its interactions with microtubules and actin, which coordinate cytoskeleton dynamics (Desprez2023Contribution). 

DPYSL2 is highly expressed during prenatal and perinatal periods, indicating its importance in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. It interacts with the cytoplasmic loops of the CaV2.2 channel, leading to increased calcium influx and neurotransmitter release (Desprez2023Contribution). The protein also modulates ion channel function through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and SUMOylation, affecting calcium and sodium channel activity (Desprez2023Contribution).

In neurons, DPYSL2 is enriched in neurites during axonogenesis and plays a role in axonal guidance by promoting microtubule assembly and influencing growth cone collapse (Desprez2023Contribution). It also regulates the trafficking of glutamatergic receptors, enhancing synaptic transmission and plasticity (Desprez2023Contribution). DPYSL2's involvement in these processes is essential for maintaining normal neuronal function and cognitive behaviors (Desprez2023Contribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DPYSL2 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, variants in DPYSL2, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the 5'-untranslated region, have been associated with increased risk. These variants may affect the gene's expression and its regulation via the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for neuronal development and function (Pham2016The; Liu2015Functional). The 13DNR allele, a specific variant, has been shown to reduce the expression of the CRMP2B protein isoform, impacting axonal growth and neuronal development, which are critical processes in schizophrenia (Pham2016The).

DPYSL2 is also implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID). De novo missense mutations in DPYSL2 have been identified in individuals with ASD and ID, leading to loss of function and impaired interaction with tubulin, affecting neuronal structure and function (Desprez2023Contribution). In animal models, Dpysl2 deficiency results in reduced spine density and dendritic branching, with behavioral impairments reminiscent of schizophrenia and ASD-related phenotypes (Desprez2023Contribution). These findings underscore the gene's role in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
DPYSL2, also known as CRMP2, is involved in various physical interactions crucial for its role in synaptic function and neurodevelopment. It interacts with endophilin2, promoting the insertion of the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors into the post-synaptic membrane, which enhances synaptic currents in hippocampal neurons (Desprez2023Contribution). DPYSL2 also downregulates the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors on cortical neurons and regulates the trafficking of presynaptic voltage-gated Na+ (NaV1.7) and Ca2+ (CaV2.2) channels (Desprez2023Contribution).

Post-translational modifications of DPYSL2, such as phosphorylation by Cdk5, enhance its association with CaV2.2, increasing calcium influx and neurotransmitter release (Desprez2023Contribution). SUMOylation of DPYSL2 affects calcium influx and increases the surface expression of NaV1.7 channels (Desprez2023Contribution). DPYSL2 also interacts with syntaxin1, a protein involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and neurotransmitter release (Desprez2023Contribution).

In the context of cancer, DPYSL2 interacts with JAK1, influencing the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is associated with cancer cell migration and metastasis (Rmaileh2021Dihydropyrimidinaselike). This interaction highlights DPYSL2's role in linking cytoskeletal molecules with oncogenic signaling pathways (Rmaileh2021Dihydropyrimidinaselike).
