# BET1L

## Overview
BET1L is a gene that encodes the Bet1 golgi vesicular membrane trafficking protein like, which is a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in vesicle-mediated transport, particularly in the trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. As a Qc-SNARE protein, Bet1 is integral to the formation of SNARE complexes that facilitate vesicle fusion, thereby maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the Golgi apparatus (Khakurel2022GARP; Lynch2021Transcriptome). The protein's activity is essential for proper intracellular trafficking, impacting cellular secretion and membrane composition. BET1L has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including uterine fibroids and endometrial cancer, highlighting its significance in both cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (Bateman2017Race‐specific; Edwards2013BET1L).

## Structure


## Function
The BET1L gene encodes a protein involved in vesicle-mediated transport, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. This protein is a part of the SNARE complex, which is essential for the fusion of vesicles, facilitating the transport of proteins and lipids between Golgi compartments (Khakurel2022GARP; Lynch2021Transcriptome). BET1L plays a crucial role in maintaining Golgi structure and function, impacting cellular secretion and membrane composition (Khakurel2022GARP).

In healthy human cells, BET1L is primarily localized in the periphery of the nuclei in skeletal myocytes, correlating with its function as a SNARE protein for transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus (Lynch2021Transcriptome). The protein is also involved in the stability and localization of Golgi resident proteins, contributing to the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus (Khakurel2022GARP). BET1L's role in vesicle-mediated transport is supported by gene ontology analysis and protein-protein interactomes, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and function (Lynch2021Transcriptome). The protein's activity is crucial for proper trafficking of proteins within cells, a fundamental process in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Edwards2013BET1L).

## Clinical Significance
The BET1L gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily related to its role in uterine fibroids and leiomyomas. Studies have shown that specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BET1L, such as rs2280543, are associated with uterine fibroid risk among European Americans and uterine leiomyoma risk in the Han Chinese population (Liu2018Association; Edwards2013BET1L). In European Americans, the SNP rs939917 in BET1L is linked to an increased risk of uterine fibroids, with an odds ratio of 1.86, indicating a significant genetic predisposition (Edwards2013BET1L). Conversely, in the Han Chinese population, the SNP rs2280543 is associated with a reduced risk of uterine leiomyomas, suggesting a protective effect (Liu2018Association).

BET1L has also been associated with endometrioid endometrial cancer, where its expression levels differ between racial groups, potentially influencing disease outcomes. In white patients, BET1L is correlated with progression-free survival, highlighting its role in disease progression (Bateman2017Race‐specific). These findings underscore the gene's involvement in various reproductive and cancer-related conditions, suggesting that alterations in BET1L expression or function can significantly impact disease risk and progression.

## Interactions
BET1L is a Qc-SNARE protein involved in the formation of SNARE complexes that facilitate vesicle fusion within the Golgi apparatus. It is a component of the STX5/GOSR1/BET1L/YKT6 SNARE complex, which is crucial for the fusion of intra-Golgi recycling vesicles (Khakurel2022GARP). BET1L interacts with intra-Golgi SNAREs such as STX5, GOSR1, and YKT6, as well as trans-Golgi SNAREs like STX16, STX6, VTI1A, and VAMP4 (D’Souza2020Golgi). The formation of these SNARE complexes is reduced in cells deficient in the COG complex, indicating BET1L's role in Golgi trafficking (D’Souza2020Golgi).

BET1L's abundance is affected by the depletion of the COG8 subunit of the COG complex, which impacts the formation of the STX5 Golgi SNARE complex (D’Souza2020Golgi). In GARP-KO cells, BET1L is significantly depleted and mislocalized, suggesting its critical role in maintaining Golgi homeostasis and function (Khakurel2022GARP). These interactions highlight BET1L's involvement in the stability and function of the Golgi apparatus, particularly in vesicle tethering and fusion processes.
