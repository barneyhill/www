# HMOX1

## Overview
HMOX1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme heme oxygenase 1, a crucial component in the catabolism of heme. Heme oxygenase 1 is an oxidoreductase enzyme that facilitates the conversion of heme into biliverdin, free iron, and carbon monoxide, thereby playing a significant role in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress (Dunn2014New; Ryter2022Heme). The enzyme is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum but is also found in other cellular compartments, including mitochondria and the nucleus, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Dunn2014New). HMOX1 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including iron recycling, inflammation modulation, and protection against vascular injury. Its expression and activity are tightly regulated, and alterations in the HMOX1 gene have been associated with several diseases, such as cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases (Dunn2014New; Schipper2015A; Ryter2022Heme).

## Structure
Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme into biliverdin, free iron, and carbon monoxide. The primary structure of HMOX1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the HMOX1 gene. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of a heme-binding pocket essential for its enzymatic activity. The tertiary structure of HMOX1 is characterized by this heme-binding pocket, which is crucial for binding and processing heme molecules.

HMOX1 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that may be important for its function. The enzyme contains a heme oxygenase domain, which is responsible for its catalytic activity. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can occur in HMOX1, potentially affecting its activity and stability. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of HMOX1 exist, which can lead to structural and functional diversity within the protein.

The enzyme's structure allows it to interact effectively with its substrates and participate in the regulation of heme levels within the cell, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress.

## Function
Heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) is a critical enzyme involved in the degradation of heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and free iron, playing a vital role in cellular defense against oxidative stress. This process is essential for iron recycling and maintaining cellular homeostasis by reducing the levels of free heme, which can be toxic (Dunn2014New; Ryter2022Heme). HMOX1 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum but can also be found in other cellular compartments such as mitochondria, caveolae, and the nucleus, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes beyond heme degradation (Dunn2014New).

In the nucleus, HMOX1 can regulate gene transcription and activate transcription factors like Nrf2, enhancing the expression of antioxidant genes, which contributes to its protective role against oxidative stress (Dunn2014New; Ayer2016Heme). The enzyme also modulates cellular responses to stress by influencing the activity of NADPH oxidase and reducing oxidative damage (Dunn2014New). HMOX1's products, such as CO and bilirubin, have recognized anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties, contributing to its role in maintaining vascular health and protecting endothelial cells from injury (Ayer2016Heme; Ryter2022Heme).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HMOX1 gene, which encodes heme oxygenase-1, are linked to various diseases and conditions. HMOX1 deficiency in humans is rare, with only a few reported cases, leading to severe symptoms such as growth retardation, iron metabolism disorders, and vascular injury (Dunn2014New; Yachie2021Heme). In mice, Hmox1 deficiency results in inflammatory phenotypes and iron overload syndrome (Dunn2014New).

Variations in the HMOX1 promoter, particularly the length of GT repeats, affect transcriptional activity and are associated with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. Shorter GT repeats are linked to increased HMOX1 activity and reduced oxidative stress, while longer repeats are associated with increased inflammation and coronary artery disease risk (Dunn2014New; Ryter2022Heme).

HMOX1 is also implicated in cancer, where its overexpression is observed in various types, including lung adenocarcinoma, and is associated with increased metastasis and poor survival rates (Consoli2021Heme; Chen2022HMOX1). In neurodegenerative disorders, HMOX1 up-regulation in astroglia can facilitate neuropathological lesions, contributing to conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (Ayuso2014An; Schipper2015A).

## Interactions
Heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and cellular localization. HMOX1 interacts with nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key regulator of antioxidant response. Under oxidative stress, a 28-kDa isoform of HMOX1 translocates to the nucleus, where it stabilizes Nrf2 by preventing its degradation through glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β)-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination. This interaction enhances Nrf2's nuclear accumulation, promoting the transcription of antioxidant genes (Biswas2014Nuclear).

HMOX1 also interacts with DNA, acting as a putative DNA-binding protein. It binds to specific DNA sequences, potentially regulating gene expression. This binding is facilitated by three identified DNA binding domains, with a preference for GC-rich regions often found in gene promoters (Scaffa2022Identification). HMOX1's interaction with DNA and proteins involved in DNA replication and repair, such as PARP1 and RAD51C, suggests its role in a G-quadruplex-resolving complex, influencing genomic stability (Krzeptowski2021Proximity).

These interactions highlight HMOX1's multifaceted role in cellular defense mechanisms, particularly under oxidative stress conditions.
