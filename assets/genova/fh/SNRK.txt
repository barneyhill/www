# SNRK

## Overview
SNRK (SNF related kinase) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which is a member of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family. The protein product of the SNRK gene plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism and inflammatory response regulation. It is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and cardiomyocytes, where it modulates inflammatory pathways and maintains insulin sensitivity and cardiac health. The SNRK protein is characterized by a distinct molecular structure, including a kinase domain and a ubiquitin-associated domain, which contribute to its unique regulatory functions within the AMPK family. Its involvement in critical cellular processes, such as DNA damage response and nuclear morphology, underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing pathological conditions like cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (Stanczyk2023DNA; Li2013Identification; Thirugnanam2019Cardiomyocyte‐Specific).

## Structure
The SNRK protein, a member of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family, has a distinct molecular structure that includes specific domains and unique binding modes. The primary structure of SNRK consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, with notable domains such as the kinase domain (KD) and the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, particularly within the UBA domain, which is composed of three α helices (Wang2018Crystal).

The tertiary structure of SNRK reveals a canonical bilobal kinase fold, with a small N-lobe and a large C-lobe in the kinase domain. The UBA domain folds over the interface between these lobes, creating a unique KD-UBA binding mode that is distinct from other AMPK family members. This interaction is primarily hydrophobic, involving specific residues such as the imidazole ring of His134, which is sandwiched between aromatic side chains of Tyr322 and Phe330 from the UBA domain (Wang2018Crystal).

The quaternary structure of SNRK is not explicitly detailed in the available context, but the protein's unique domain interactions suggest a complex regulatory mechanism. The UBA domain in SNRK does not bind (poly)-ubiquitin chains but is involved in regulating kinase activity, highlighting its functional divergence within the AMPK family (Wang2018Crystal).

## Function
SNRK (SNF related kinase) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular energy metabolism and inflammation. It is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, where it acts as a suppressor of adipocyte inflammation. SNRK influences the phosphorylation of proteins involved in inflammatory pathways, such as caspase recruitment domain family member 6 (Card6), IFIH1, and ZBP1, which activate nuclear factor-kB transcription factors. This regulation is essential for maintaining insulin sensitivity and normal adipocyte function by modulating inflammatory responses and lipolysis (Li2013Identification).

In cardiomyocytes, SNRK is involved in preventing cardiac inflammation and fibrosis, particularly during cardiac remodeling processes. It interacts with the NF-kB pathway, inhibiting the translocation of NF-kB subunits into the nucleus, thereby repressing proinflammatory signaling. This function is critical for maintaining cardiac health and preventing heart failure (Thirugnanam2019Cardiomyocyte‐Specific).

SNRK also plays a role in the DNA damage response and nuclear morphology through its interaction with DSTN, affecting actin polymerization. This interaction is important for maintaining nuclear stability and preventing cardiac hypertrophy (Stanczyk2023DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SNRK gene have been implicated in several cardiovascular conditions. SNRK plays a critical role in cardiac hypertrophy and DNA damage response (DDR). Its downregulation leads to increased DNA damage and maladaptive nuclear changes, exacerbating cardiac hypertrophy. This is particularly evident in SNRK knockout mice, which show worsened cardiac function and hypertrophy under pressure overload conditions (Stanczyk2023DNA). 

SNRK also acts as a repressor of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. In cardiomyocytes, the absence of SNRK results in increased expression of inflammatory signaling proteins and fibrosis, particularly under angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion. This is associated with the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which drives the transcription of proinflammatory mediators (Thirugnanam2019Cardiomyocyte‐Specific). 

In the context of myocardial infarction, SNRK is involved in energy metabolism and ATP synthesis. The formation of circ-SNRK, a circular RNA derived from SNRK, is crucial for maintaining energy production and reducing cell apoptosis. Alterations in circ-SNRK expression can impact cardiac function, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for heart failure (Wang2021Negative).
