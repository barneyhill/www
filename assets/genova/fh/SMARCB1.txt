# SMARCB1

## Overview
SMARCB1 is a gene that encodes a protein known as SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily b, member 1, commonly referred to as BAF47 or INI1. This protein is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. As a chromatin remodeler, SMARCB1 is involved in various cellular processes, including neural differentiation and tumor suppression. The protein's function is mediated through its interactions with other components of the BAF complex and its ability to bind to nucleosomes, facilitating chromatin remodeling. Mutations or deletions in the SMARCB1 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly malignant rhabdoid tumors and other cancers, underscoring its significance as a tumor suppressor (Versteege1998Truncating; Chen2020A; Valencia2019Recurrent).

## Structure
The SMARCB1 protein, also known as BAF47 or hSNF5, is a core component of the mSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. It contains a highly conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) that is crucial for its function. This domain, spanning amino acids 357-377, adopts an alpha-helical structure, with flanking regions in a dynamic random coil state (Valencia2019Recurrent). The CTD is characterized by a cluster of basic, positively charged amino acids that facilitate binding to the nucleosome's acidic patch, a key interaction for chromatin remodeling (Valencia2019Recurrent).

Mutations in the CTD, such as K364del and R377H, disrupt this interaction, affecting the mSWI/SNF complex's ability to remodel chromatin and are associated with Coffin-Siris syndrome and various cancers (Valencia2019Recurrent). The SMARCB1 protein also interacts with other components of the BAF complex, forming a heterotrimeric subcomplex with SMARCC2, which is essential for the assembly and tumor suppression function of the complex (Chen2020A). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its function and interactions.

## Function
The SMARCB1 gene encodes a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which is crucial for regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. In healthy human cells, SMARCB1 is involved in the regulation of pluripotency and differentiation, particularly in neural induction. It functions by repressing bivalent genes and antagonizing chromatin accessibility at super-enhancers, which are regions of DNA that enhance gene activity to maintain stem cells in an immature state. By silencing these super-enhancers, SMARCB1 allows stem cells to differentiate into brain cells, playing a significant role in neural induction (Langer2019Tumor).

SMARCB1 is also involved in the regulation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and several cancer-related genes, including the retinoblastoma (RB)-mediated repression of E2F target genes. It interacts with transcription factors, histone acetyltransferases, and transcriptional regulators to activate target gene expression, leading to acetylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27 Ac) (Kalimuthu2016Gene). SMARCB1 is essential for the assembly and function of the BAF complex, which is involved in tumor suppression. It is biallelically inactivated in about 98% of malignant rhabdoid tumors, indicating its crucial role in preventing tumor development (Chen2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SMARCB1 gene are associated with a variety of diseases, particularly those involving tumorigenesis. SMARCB1 is a tumor suppressor gene, and its inactivation is a hallmark of malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs), which are aggressive pediatric cancers that can occur in the kidney, brain, and soft tissues. These tumors are characterized by biallelic inactivation of SMARCB1, often through deletions or truncating mutations (Kalimuthu2016Gene; Versteege1998Truncating). 

SMARCB1 mutations are also linked to rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome type 1 (RTPS1), which predisposes individuals to early-onset malignant tumors in the central nervous system, kidneys, and soft tissues (Holsten2018Germline). Schwannomatosis, a condition characterized by the development of multiple schwannomas, is another disease associated with SMARCB1 mutations (Eaton2010Spectrum). 

Loss of SMARCB1 expression is a diagnostic marker for epithelioid sarcoma (ES) and is observed in over 90% of ES cases (Hornick2009Loss). SMARCB1 abnormalities are also implicated in other cancers, such as renal medullary carcinoma and undifferentiated chordomas, highlighting its role in various tumor types (Kalimuthu2016Gene).

## Interactions
SMARCB1, also known as INI1 or BAF47, is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. It interacts with other proteins within the mSWI/SNF complex, such as SMARCA4 (BRG1) and SMARCC1/2 (BAF155/170), forming part of the BAF core module. This interaction is essential for the assembly and function of the SWI/SNF complexes, which are involved in ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling (Mashtalir2018Modular).

SMARCB1's C-terminal domain (CTD) interacts with nucleosomes, particularly binding to the nucleosome's acidic patch. This interaction is crucial for the chromatin remodeling activity of the mSWI/SNF complex. Mutations in the SMARCB1 CTD, such as K364del, can disrupt this interaction, leading to reduced DNA accessibility and impaired chromatin remodeling (Valencia2019Recurrent).

SMARCB1 also interacts with the oncoprotein transcription factor MYC, inhibiting its DNA-binding ability and impeding its target gene recognition. This interaction suggests that SMARCB1's tumor-suppressive functions are partly mediated by inhibiting MYC (Weissmiller2019Inhibition).
