# RASSF7

## Overview
RASSF7 is a gene located on chromosome 11p15 that encodes the protein Ras association domain family member 7, which is part of the Ras association domain family. This protein is characterized by an N-terminal Ras association (RA) domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, although it lacks the SARAH domain found in other RASSF family members (Volodko2014RASSF; van2007The). RASSF7 is involved in several cellular processes, including the regulation of the JNK signaling pathway and cell cycle modulation through its interactions with proteins such as c-Myc and N-Ras (Takahashi2010RASSF7; Kumaraswamy2018The). The protein's role in inhibiting pro-apoptotic signaling and its involvement in oncogenic pathways underscore its significance in cell survival and cancer biology (Takahashi2010RASSF7; Kumaraswamy2018The). Alterations in RASSF7 expression, such as promoter hypermethylation, have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Djos2012The).

## Structure
RASSF7 is a protein encoded by the RASSF7 gene, located on chromosome 11p15. It is part of the Ras association domain family and contains an N-terminal Ras association (RA) domain, which is a conserved motif shared among Ras effectors, although it is not confirmed if RASSF7 directly binds Ras (van2007The). Unlike other RASSF family members, RASSF7 lacks the SARAH domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Richter2009The; Volodko2014RASSF).

RASSF7 is composed of three transcripts (A-C) due to alternative splicing, which primarily differ in the C-terminus (Volodko2014RASSF; van2007The). The protein includes a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its interaction with the Hippo signaling pathway, specifically inhibiting MST1 phosphorylation and promoting the nuclear translocation of YAP (Zheng2017The). This domain is suggested to have a function similar to the SARAH domain found in classical RASSFs (Zheng2017The).

RASSF7 interacts with c-Myc through its RA and helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (HLH-L-Zip) domains, which are important for forming a stable heterodimeric complex with c-Myc, affecting its function and stability (Kumaraswamy2018The). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which leads to its degradation under certain conditions (Volodko2014RASSF).

## Function
RASSF7 (Ras association domain family member 7) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating the JNK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, RASSF7 negatively regulates pro-apoptotic JNK signaling by inhibiting the activity of phosphorylated MKK7, a kinase that activates JNK. This inhibition helps maintain a balance between cell survival and apoptosis, particularly under stress conditions (Takahashi2010RASSF7).

RASSF7 interacts with the GTP-bound form of N-Ras, enhancing its anti-apoptotic effects and promoting cell survival. This interaction is particularly important during stress responses, such as UV irradiation, where RASSF7 helps prevent inappropriate JNK activation and subsequent apoptosis (Takahashi2010RASSF7).

The protein is also involved in cell cycle regulation by modulating the activity of the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc. RASSF7 down-regulates c-Myc's transcriptional activity, affecting cell cycle progression and reducing c-Myc-induced DNA synthesis. This regulation is achieved through the interaction of RASSF7 with c-Myc, leading to its polyubiquitination and degradation (Kumaraswamy2018The).

## Clinical Significance
RASSF7 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In neuroblastoma, RASSF7 frequently undergoes promoter hypermethylation, leading to reduced expression levels. This epigenetic silencing is thought to contribute to tumorigenesis by preventing RAS-induced apoptosis, thereby promoting pro-survival pathways (Djos2012The). The gene's expression is notably low or absent in most neuroblastoma cell lines, but can be upregulated following treatment with demethylating agents, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies (Djos2012The).

RASSF7 also plays a role in modulating the oncogenic protein c-Myc. It destabilizes c-Myc by promoting its polyubiquitination and degradation, thereby inhibiting c-Myc-mediated oncogenic transformation. This interaction is crucial for regulating cell proliferation and has been proposed as a therapeutic target in c-Myc-driven cancers (Kumaraswamy2018The). An inverse correlation between RASSF7 and c-Myc expression levels has been observed in human cancers, indicating that alterations in RASSF7 expression can significantly impact cancer progression (Kumaraswamy2018The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RASSF7 in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
RASSF7 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It negatively regulates the pro-apoptotic JNK signaling pathway by interacting with phosphorylated MKK7, inhibiting its ability to activate JNK. This interaction is crucial for protecting cells from inappropriate JNK activation, which can lead to apoptosis (Takahashi2010RASSF7). RASSF7 also interacts with N-Ras, particularly in its GTP-bound form, which is essential for its anti-apoptotic response to stress stimuli (Takahashi2010RASSF7).

In the context of oncogenic signaling, RASSF7 interacts with the c-Myc transcription factor. It forms a heterodimeric complex with c-Myc, which is critical for modulating c-Myc-induced cell proliferation and migration. This interaction involves the RA and HLH-L-Zip domains of RASSF7 and is necessary for the negative regulation of c-Myc function, affecting DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (Kumaraswamy2018The). RASSF7 competes with MYC-associated factor X (MAX) to bind c-Myc, reducing the formation of the c-Myc/Max complex and thereby inhibiting c-Myc's transcriptional activity (Kumaraswamy2018The).
