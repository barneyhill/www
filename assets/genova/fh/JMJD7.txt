# JMJD7

## Overview
JMJD7 is a gene that encodes the protein jumonji domain containing 7, which is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing protein family. This protein functions primarily as a hydroxylase, rather than a demethylase, and is involved in the regulation of gene expression through histone modification. Structurally, JMJD7 is characterized by a complex arrangement of α-helices and β-strands, with a catalytic domain that includes a metal-binding triad essential for its enzymatic activity (Markolovic2018The). Functionally, JMJD7 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and transcription elongation by facilitating nucleosome-free regions (Liu2017Clipping). It interacts with Developmentally Regulated GTP Binding Proteins 1 and 2 (DRG1/2), catalyzing lysyl hydroxylation, which influences RNA binding and ribonucleoprotein complex formation (Markolovic2018The). Clinically, JMJD7 has been implicated in cancer, particularly breast cancer, where its enzymatic activity is crucial for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Liu2017Clipping).

## Structure
The JMJD7 protein is structurally similar to JmjC hydroxylases and is characterized by a complex arrangement of secondary and tertiary structures. It comprises 9 α-helices, 18 β-strands, and 2-3 additional helices. The catalytic domain features a distinctive 2OG oxygenase distorted double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) core barrel, formed from 8 β-strands arranged as two antiparallel major and minor sheets (Markolovic2018The). The active site of JMJD7 includes a metal-binding triad (H178, D180, and H277) that coordinates a metal ion in an octahedral geometry, essential for its enzymatic function (Markolovic2018The).

JMJD7 crystallizes as an oligomer with two or four molecules in each asymmetric unit and is dimeric in solution. This dimerization involves hydrophobic interactions between α-helices from both N- and C-terminal regions and a disulfide bond involving Cys-47, suggesting a structural similarity to other JmjC hydroxylases, which are commonly observed as dimers (Markolovic2018The). The protein lacks a hydrophobic region necessary for binding the Nε-methyl lysine group of JmjC KDMs, indicating it functions more as a hydroxylase than a demethylase (Markolovic2018The).

## Function
JMJD7 is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing protein family, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression through histone modification. It functions as a protease that cleaves arginine-methylated histone tails, a process crucial for transcriptional regulation and epigenetic gene regulation (Liu2017Clipping). This activity is not limited to demethylation but involves the direct cleavage of the peptide backbone adjacent to methylated arginine residues, suggesting a mechanism where methylated arginines are completely destroyed rather than recycled (Liu2017Clipping).

JMJD7 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and transcription elongation by facilitating nucleosome-free regions (Liu2017Clipping). In breast cancer cell lines, the knockout of JMJD7 results in increased arginine methylation and reduced cell proliferation, indicating its role in cell proliferation and potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Liu2017Clipping). The enzymatic activity of JMJD7 is essential for its function, as the introduction of an enzymatically inactive version does not rescue the proliferation phenotype (Liu2017Clipping). These findings suggest that JMJD7 plays a significant role in histone modification and gene regulation in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
JMJD7 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In breast cancer cell lines, such as MDA-MB231, knockout of JMJD7 results in increased arginine methylation of histones H3 and H4, which is associated with a significant decrease in the colony-forming abilities of these cancer cells. This suggests a potential role of JMJD7 in tumorigenesis, as its enzymatic activity appears crucial for cancer cell growth (Liu2017Clipping). The introduction of wild-type JMJD7 into JMJD7-deficient cells can rescue normal proliferation, whereas an enzymatically inactive version cannot, highlighting the importance of its enzymatic function in cancer cell proliferation (Liu2017Clipping).

JMJD7 is also involved in the regulation of transcription through its enzymatic activities on histone tails, which is crucial for the proliferation of certain cell types, including breast cancer cells (Liu2018Specific). The absence of JMJD7 leads to increased levels of arginine-methylated histones, indicating its role in maintaining histone homeostasis (Liu2018Specific). These findings suggest that alterations in JMJD7 expression or function could have significant implications for cancer and potentially other diseases related to epigenetic dysregulation (Liu2017Clipping).

## Interactions
JMJD7 interacts with Developmentally Regulated GTP Binding Proteins 1 and 2 (DRG1/2), which are identified as its substrates. These interactions are confirmed through immunoaffinity purifications and reciprocal immunoprecipitations, demonstrating that JMJD7 specifically interacts with DRG1/2 but not with the related hydroxylase JMJD4. The interaction is activity-dependent, as mutations in JMJD7, such as the H178A mutation, disrupt these interactions (Markolovic2018The). JMJD7 catalyzes lysyl hydroxylation at specific sites on DRG1 and DRG2, which is a novel post-translational modification that influences the binding of DRG proteins to RNA. This hydroxylation occurs at conserved lysine residues within a helix-turn-helix motif, enhancing the RNA binding affinity of DRG2 (Markolovic2018The).

JMJD7 and DRG1/2 co-localize in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, supporting their interaction (Markolovic2018The). The study also suggests that JMJD7-mediated hydroxylation facilitates the interaction of DRG GTPases with RNA, potentially influencing ribonucleoprotein complex formation and function (Markolovic2018The). These interactions are highly conserved across animals, indicating a significant evolutionary role for JMJD7 in cellular processes (Markolovic2018The).
