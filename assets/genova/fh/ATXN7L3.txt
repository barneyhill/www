# ATXN7L3

## Overview
ATXN7L3 is a gene that encodes the protein ataxin 7 like 3, which is a critical component of the deubiquitination module (DUBm) within the human SAGA complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in histone modification and gene regulation, particularly through the deubiquitination of histones H2A and H2B, which are essential processes for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Lang2011The). Ataxin 7 like 3 is characterized by the presence of a ZnF-Sgf11 domain, which is vital for the allosteric regulation of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP22 and for the binding of the SAGA DUBm to nucleosomes (Lang2011The). Beyond its role in the SAGA complex, ataxin 7 like 3 is involved in broader regulatory mechanisms, coordinating the activity of multiple H2B deubiquitinases, which are important for cellular proliferation and tumor growth (Atanassov2016ATXN7L3). The protein's activity in the nucleus significantly impacts gene expression and various cellular processes, highlighting its importance in organismal development and disease (Lang2011The).

## Function
ATXN7L3 is a crucial component of the deubiquitination module (DUBm) within the human SAGA complex, which plays a significant role in histone modification and gene regulation. The protein is involved in the deubiquitination of histones H2A and H2B, processes essential for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Lang2011The). ATXN7L3 contains a ZnF-Sgf11 domain that is important for the allosteric regulation of USP22, a deubiquitinating enzyme, and for the binding of the SAGA DUBm to nucleosomes (Lang2011The). This domain is also crucial for the assembly and stability of the DUBm, as its absence impairs the SAGA complex's deubiquitination activity, leading to increased levels of ubiquitinated histones (Lang2011The).

In addition to its role in the SAGA complex, ATXN7L3, along with ENY2, coordinates the activity of multiple H2B deubiquitinases, including USP22, USP27X, and USP51, which are important for cellular proliferation and tumor growth (Atanassov2016ATXN7L3). These deubiquitinases form complexes that are independent of the SAGA complex, highlighting ATXN7L3's role in broader regulatory mechanisms beyond the SAGA complex (Atanassov2016ATXN7L3). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression, impacting various cellular processes and organismal development (Lang2011The).

## Clinical Significance
ATXN7L3 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating histone H2B deubiquitination, a process crucial for cellular proliferation and tumor growth. Alterations in the expression or activity of ATXN7L3 can impact cancer progression. Increased expression of ATXN7L3 correlates with higher breast cancer incidence, and its depletion limits tumor growth in xenograft models, suggesting its involvement in cancer development (Atanassov2016ATXN7L3). In cervical cancer, ATXN7L3 is activated by circ_0085616, which sponges miR-503-5p, leading to enhanced tumorigenesis. This interaction suggests that ATXN7L3 acts as an oncogene in cervical cancer (Lin2020Identification).

ATXN7L3 is also involved in a novel gene fusion, UBTF::ATXN7L3, which defines a new subtype of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). This fusion is associated with poor responses to conventional chemotherapy, necessitating intensified treatment strategies (Bastian2022UBTF::ATXN7L3). The same fusion has been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, indicating a shared driver function in different B-lymphoid malignancies (Bastian2022UBTF::ATXN7L3).

Additionally, ATXN7L3's interactions with other proteins, such as ENY2, are crucial for its stability and function. Disruptions in these interactions can affect cellular processes related to proliferation and tumor growth (Atanassov2016ATXN7L3).

## Interactions
ATXN7L3 is a component of the SAGA complex, where it plays a crucial role in histone deubiquitination. It interacts with ENY2 and USP22, forming a deubiquitinase module (DUBm) that is essential for the deubiquitination of histone H2B (Li2016Cytoplasmic). ATXN7L3 also interacts with USP27X and USP51, which are deubiquitinases that require ATXN7L3 and ENY2 for their activity. These interactions are competitive, as USP22, USP27X, and USP51 vie for binding to ATXN7L3 and ENY2 (Atanassov2016ATXN7L3).

In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, ATXN7L3 interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERa), acting as a coactivator for ERa-mediated transactivation. This interaction is direct and occurs both in the presence and absence of estrogen, enhancing the transcription of target genes such as SMAD7 (Sun2020ATXN7L3). ATXN7L3 is recruited to ERa-binding regions of the SMAD7 gene, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Sun2020ATXN7L3).

ATXN7L3's paralog, ATXN7L3B, competes with it for binding to ENY2, which can destabilize ATXN7L3 due to reduced association with ENY2 (Li2016Cytoplasmic). Despite their sequence similarities, ATXN7L3 and ATXN7L3B have distinct cellular functions, with ATXN7L3B showing weaker deubiquitinase activity (Li2016Cytoplasmic).
