# ZNF324B

## Overview
ZNF324B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 324B, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function. The protein encoded by ZNF324B is implicated in various biological processes, including cellular differentiation and cancer progression. In particular, zinc finger protein 324B has been associated with kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and laryngeal carcinoma, where it may play roles in tumor suppression and cell proliferation, respectively (Czerwinska2021Low; Liping2023Biological). Additionally, ZNF324B serves as a stable reference gene in studies involving human pluripotent stem cells, highlighting its consistent expression across different cellular contexts (Holmgren2015Identification).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF324B has been implicated in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where its expression levels are associated with clinical outcomes. Studies have shown that higher expression of ZNF324B is linked to better survival outcomes in KIRC patients, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role. However, ZNF324B does not possess prognostic value in KIRC, as its overexpression is significantly negatively associated with tumor dedifferentiation status, indicating that higher-grade tumors with cancer stemness characteristics express lower levels of ZNF324B (Czerwinska2021Low).

In the context of laryngeal carcinoma, ZNF324 is upregulated and negatively regulated by miRNA-203b-3p. The overexpression of ZNF324 can partially reverse the inhibitory effects of miRNA-203b-3p on cancer cell proliferation, suggesting that ZNF324 plays a role in promoting the proliferation of laryngeal carcinoma cells. This interaction indicates that ZNF324 could be a potential therapeutic target in laryngeal carcinoma (Liping2023Biological).

ZNF324B has also been identified as a stable reference gene in differentiating human pluripotent stem cells, indicating its consistent expression across various differentiation protocols, although this does not directly relate to disease (Holmgren2015Identification).
