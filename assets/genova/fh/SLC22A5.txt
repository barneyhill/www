# SLC22A5

## Overview
The SLC22A5 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 5, commonly known as organic cation transporter novel family member 2 (OCTN2). OCTN2 is a transmembrane protein that functions as a high-affinity sodium ion-dependent transporter, primarily responsible for the uptake of carnitine into cells. Carnitine is crucial for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, where they undergo beta-oxidation to produce energy, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and liver (Tamai1998Molecular; Juraszek2019SLC22A5). The protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains and is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, heart, and placenta, playing a vital role in maintaining carnitine homeostasis (Tamai1998Molecular; Nezu1999Primary). Mutations in the SLC22A5 gene can lead to primary carnitine deficiency, a disorder that affects fatty acid oxidation and can result in severe clinical manifestations if untreated (Chen2021Gene; Longo2016Primary).

## Structure
The SLC22A5 gene encodes the OCTN2 protein, a sodium ion-dependent carnitine transporter. The primary structure of OCTN2 consists of 557 amino acids (Tamai1998Molecular). The secondary structure includes 12 transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of its role as a transporter across cell membranes (Tamai1998Molecular; Nezu1999Primary). The protein also contains three N-glycosylation sites, which are important for its stability and function (Tamai1998Molecular).

The tertiary structure of OCTN2 is defined by its transmembrane domains and the presence of a sugar-transporter protein signature sequence motif, which is crucial for its function in carnitine transport (Nezu1999Primary). The quaternary structure may involve the formation of homodimers, although specific details on this aspect are not extensively covered in the provided context.

Post-translational modifications of OCTN2 include glycosylation, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, affecting its transport to the cell surface (Juraszek2019SLC22A5). These structural features enable OCTN2 to effectively transport carnitine across plasma membranes, playing a vital role in lipid metabolism and energy production.

## Function
The SLC22A5 gene encodes the organic cation transporter novel family member 2 (OCTN2), a high-affinity sodium ion-dependent transporter responsible for the uptake of carnitine in human cells. Carnitine is essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, where they undergo beta-oxidation to produce energy, particularly in energy-demanding tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and liver (Tamai1998Molecular; Juraszek2019SLC22A5). OCTN2 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, and placenta, and is crucial for maintaining carnitine homeostasis by facilitating its reabsorption in the kidney and absorption in the intestine (Tamai1998Molecular; Tamai2012Pharmacological).

The transporter operates as a sodium co-transporter for carnitine influx and can also function in a sodium-independent manner for the efflux of substrates, particularly acyl-carnitine esters, when their intracellular concentrations are higher than extracellular levels (Yee2021Emerging). The activity and localization of OCTN2 are regulated by interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins and other regulatory proteins, ensuring its proper function in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Juraszek2019SLC22A5). Defects in OCTN2 can lead to systemic carnitine deficiency, resulting in conditions such as cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness (Tamai2012Pharmacological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC22A5 gene, which encodes the organic cation/carnitine transporter 2 (OCTN2), are associated with primary carnitine deficiency (PCD), a condition characterized by impaired fatty acid oxidation due to defective carnitine transport. This autosomal recessive disorder can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including hypoketotic hypoglycemia, skeletal and cardiac myopathy, and cardiomyopathy, which can be life-threatening if untreated (Chen2021Gene; Li2010Molecular; Longo2016Primary).

The clinical presentation of PCD varies widely, from asymptomatic individuals to those experiencing severe symptoms such as progressive infantile-onset cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death (Chen2021Gene; Jolfayi2024A). Mutations such as c.760C>T (p.R254*) and c.1400C>G (p.S467C) are among the most common and have been identified in specific populations, including Southern China and Taiwan (Lin2020Screening; Chen2021Gene).

Treatment with oral levocarnitine supplementation is effective in preventing severe outcomes and improving clinical symptoms, although early diagnosis through newborn screening is crucial for optimal management (Magoulas2012Systemic; Li2010Molecular). Despite the effectiveness of treatment, some cases may be missed by newborn screening, necessitating improved detection strategies (Longo2016Primary).

## Interactions
The SLC22A5 gene encodes the OCTN2 protein, a high-affinity carnitine transporter that interacts with various proteins to regulate its activity and trafficking. One significant interaction is with caveolin-1, a protein found in cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane known as lipid rafts. This interaction is enhanced by the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which increases the presence of OCTN2 on the cell surface without direct phosphorylation. Instead, PKC activation promotes the translocation of OCTN2 to the plasma membrane and its association with caveolin-1, suggesting a role in the formation of multiprotein complexes that facilitate carnitine transport (Czeredys2013Caveolin1).

OCTN2 also interacts with PDZ-domain containing proteins, which enhance its transport activity. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of OCTN2's function and its role in cellular metabolism (Juraszek2019SLC22A5). Additionally, OCTN2 has been shown to interact with flotillin-1, another raft-associated protein, although the interaction with caveolin-1 is more prominent (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). These protein interactions are significant for the transporter's role in energy homeostasis and its potential involvement in pathological conditions such as cancer (Juraszek2019SLC22A5).
