# OXA1L

## Overview
OXA1L is a gene that encodes the OXA1L mitochondrial inner membrane protein, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial protein insertase family, specifically the YidC/Alb3/Oxa1 family. This protein plays a vital role in the co-translational insertion of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane, a process essential for the assembly and function of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. The OXA1L protein is characterized by its transmembrane nature, consisting of five transmembrane helices and a C-terminal tail that interacts with mitochondrial ribosomes to facilitate protein insertion. This interaction is critical for the biogenesis of key components of the OXPHOS system, such as the F1Fo-ATP synthase and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, thereby maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Thompson2018OXA; Haque2010Identification).

## Structure
The human OXA1L protein is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the insertion of mitochondrial translation products into the inner membrane. Structurally, OXA1L consists of an N-terminal section, five transmembrane helices, and a C-terminal tail exposed in the mitochondrial matrix (Haque2010Identification). The C-terminal tail (Oxa1L-CTT) is approximately 100 amino acids long and is involved in binding to mitochondrial ribosomes, facilitating the co-translational insertion of proteins (Haque2010Properties).

The secondary structure of Oxa1L-CTT is characterized by a long α-helical region and several shorter helical segments, with predictions indicating 25-30% helical content (Haque2010Properties). Circular dichroism spectroscopy has shown that Oxa1L-CTT is 16-20% α-helical in aqueous solutions, and its helical content increases in the presence of trifluoroethanol, suggesting stabilization of the helices (Haque2010Properties).

Oxa1L-CTT can form oligomers, existing in equilibrium between monomer, dimer, and tetramer forms, with oligomerization being influenced by salt concentrations (Haque2010Properties). The protein's basic nature, with a pI of 10.7, likely influences its oligomerization behavior (Haque2010Properties).

## Function
OXA1L is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and function of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes in human cells. It is involved in the co-translational insertion of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for the proper assembly of respiratory complexes I, III, IV, and V (Thompson2018OXA). OXA1L interacts with both mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits, facilitating the integration of these proteins into the mitochondrial membrane (Haque2010Identification).

The protein is part of the YidC/Alb3/Oxa1 membrane protein insertase family and is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production. In healthy human cells, OXA1L is necessary for the stability of nascent polypeptides and the assembly of OXPHOS complexes, which are vital for cellular energy homeostasis (Thompson2018OXA; Haque2010Properties). The C-terminal tail of OXA1L binds to mitochondrial ribosomes, coordinating the synthesis and membrane insertion of newly synthesized proteins (Haque2010Identification). This function is essential for the biogenesis of the F1Fo-ATP synthase and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, key components of the OXPHOS system (Stiburek2007Knockdown).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OXA1L gene are associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy and combined oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defects. These mutations can lead to severe clinical manifestations, including hypotonia, developmental delay, and encephalopathy. Patients with OXA1L mutations often exhibit deficiencies in OXPHOS complexes I, IV, and V, with a notable deficiency in complex IV observed in skeletal muscle (Thompson2018OXA). The pathogenicity of these mutations has been confirmed by rescuing the OXPHOS defect in patient fibroblasts through the introduction of wild-type OXA1L (Thompson2018OXA).

OXA1L is also implicated in asthma and atopy. Polymorphisms in the OXA1L gene, such as SNP rs4981436, have been associated with increased asthma susceptibility in certain populations. These genetic variants may influence the expression levels of OXA1L, potentially affecting mitochondrial function and contributing to the pathophysiology of asthma (Pires2018Polymorphisms).

Overall, OXA1L mutations and polymorphisms can lead to significant mitochondrial dysfunction, impacting energy production and contributing to various clinical conditions. The gene's role in mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiratory complex assembly underscores its importance in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Thompson2018OXA).

## Interactions
The OXA1L protein, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, is involved in several critical interactions within the mitochondria. It primarily interacts with mitochondrial ribosomes, facilitating the insertion of mitochondrially synthesized proteins into the inner membrane. The C-terminal tail of OXA1L (Oxa1L-CTT) binds to the large ribosomal subunit (39S) of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes, with a stoichiometry of approximately two Oxa1L-CTT molecules per ribosome. This interaction is enthalpy-driven and salt-sensitive, indicating an electrostatic nature (Haque2010Properties).

Oxa1L-CTT also forms oligomers, predominantly dimers, which are influenced by the presence of Mg2+, suggesting that Mg2+ induces local conformational changes in the protein (Haque2010Identification). The protein interacts with several ribosomal proteins, including MRPL13, MRPL20, MRPL28, MRPL48, MRPL49, and MRPL51, which are located on the solvent side of the large ribosomal subunit (Haque2010Identification).

The interaction of OXA1L with ribosomes is crucial for the co-translational insertion of proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane, a process that is independent of the presence of nascent polypeptide chains (Szyrach2003Ribosome). This interaction is essential for the efficient membrane insertion of proteins such as subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase (Szyrach2003Ribosome).
