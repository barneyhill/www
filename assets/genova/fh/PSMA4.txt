# PSMA4

## Overview
PSMA4 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 4, a critical component of the 20S core particle of the proteasome complex, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation. The proteasome 20S subunit alpha 4 is categorized as a proteasome subunit and is integral to maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating various cellular processes. The PSMA4 gene is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly and function of the proteasome, influencing cellular functions and organismal health (Rousseau2018Regulation). The protein encoded by PSMA4 is involved in the formation of canonical and alternative proteasome isoforms, which are essential for cellular adaptation to environmental stresses and resistance to toxic metal ions (Rousseau2018Regulation). Given its significant role in cellular homeostasis and stress response, PSMA4 is of considerable interest in clinical research, particularly in the context of cancer, where its expression levels have been linked to patient outcomes and tumor progression (Li2021Integrated).

## Structure
The PSMA4 gene encodes the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 4, a component of the 20S core particle of the proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. The primary structure of PSMA4 consists of a 783 bp coding region predicting a protein of 261 amino acids with a molecular weight of 29,500 and an isoelectric point of 7.74 (Elenich1999The). The secondary structure includes conserved motifs such as the N-terminal 'signature' PROS boxes, the RPxG motif, and the GxxxD motif, which are characteristic of proteasome subunits (Elenich1999The).

In terms of tertiary structure, the PSMA4 subunit, like other alpha subunits, is likely to have a core structure consisting of two antiparallel beta sheets flanked by alpha helices, forming a sandwich-like topology (Löwe1995Crystal). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of PSMA4 into the outer rings of the 20S proteasome, which is a cylindrical structure composed of four heptameric rings, with the alpha subunits forming the outer rings (Elenich1999The).

Post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation have been identified in various subunits of the 20S proteasome, including PSMA4, which may influence its function and stability (Vimer2020Comparative).

## Function
PSMA4 encodes a subunit of the 20S proteasome, which is a core component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation. This system is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating various cellular processes. The 20S proteasome is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular functions and organismal health (Rousseau2018Regulation).

In healthy human cells, PSMA4 is involved in the assembly of the canonical proteasome, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. The proteasome degrades ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, thereby regulating protein levels and removing damaged or misfolded proteins (Rousseau2018Regulation). The assembly of the proteasome involves multiple chaperones that ensure the correct formation of the proteasome's α-ring, a crucial step in the assembly of the 20S proteasome (Rousseau2018Regulation).

PSMA4 also plays a role in the formation of alternative proteasome isoforms, such as the α4-α4 proteasome, which can enhance cellular resistance to toxic metal ions and help cells adapt to environmental stresses (Rousseau2018Regulation). This suggests that PSMA4 contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress response in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSMA4 gene, which encodes a component of the 20S core proteasome complex, have significant clinical implications in cancer. High expression levels of PSMA4 are associated with poor survival outcomes in certain cancers, such as adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) (Li2021Integrated). In contrast, in some cancers like ovarian cancer, high expression of certain proteasome genes, though not specifically PSMA4, is linked to better survival outcomes (Li2021Integrated). The overexpression of PSMA4 and other proteasome genes is often observed in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a dependency on the ubiquitin-proteasome system for tumor progression (Larsson2022Pancancer).

PSMA4 is also implicated in the immune microenvironment of tumors, with its expression showing significant associations with immune subtypes and immune-related scores, indicating a potential role in modulating immune responses in cancer (Li2021Integrated). Additionally, alterations in PSMA4 expression or interactions may affect cellular stress responses, as seen in the formation of alternative proteasome isoforms that enhance resistance to environmental stresses (Rousseau2018Regulation). These findings highlight the potential of PSMA4 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
PSMA4, a subunit of the 20S proteasome complex, is involved in various protein interactions critical for its function in proteasomal degradation. It interacts with specific proteins, such as the Hepatitis C virus F protein, promoting its ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation (UIPD) through interaction with amino acids 40 to 60 of the F protein (SánchezLanzas2014Proteins). 

In addition to its role in UIPD, PSMA4 is a key component in the assembly of the 20S proteasome and can associate with regulatory particles like the 19S complex to form the 26S proteasome. This interaction is crucial for the proteasome's function in protein degradation pathways (Bartolome2024Quantitative). 

The study by Bartolome et al. utilized a proximity labeling strategy, ProteasomeID, to map the interactome of PSMA4, identifying 608 protein groups enriched in the PSMA4-BirA* dataset. This includes known proteasome subunits, assembly factors, and other complexes such as the SCF and CCT complexes (Bartolome2024Quantitative). The ProteasomeID approach also identified novel proteasome substrates and interacting proteins, highlighting PSMA4's extensive involvement in proteasome-related interactions (Bartolome2024Quantitative).
