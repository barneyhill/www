# TACO1

## Overview
The TACO1 gene encodes a mitochondrial RNA-binding protein known as the translational activator of cytochrome c oxidase I, which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This protein is essential for the translation of the mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1), a critical component of complex IV in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. TACO1 facilitates the translation process by binding to mt-Co1 mRNA and interacting with the mitochondrial ribosome, ensuring the proper assembly and function of complex IV, which is vital for cellular respiration and ATP production (Richman2016Loss). The protein's structure, characterized by three domains, is crucial for its RNA-binding capability, with domain 1 being particularly important for this function (Richman2016Loss). Mutations in the TACO1 gene are associated with mitochondrial disorders, such as late-onset Leigh syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Richman2016Loss).

## Structure


## Function
The TACO1 gene encodes a translational activator protein that is essential for the translation of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1) in mitochondria. This protein specifically binds to the mitochondrial-encoded mt-Co1 mRNA, facilitating its translation by associating with the mitochondrial ribosome (Richman2016Loss). TACO1's role is crucial for the assembly of complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, as it influences the insertion of COXI into the inner mitochondrial membrane, a rate-limiting step in complex IV assembly (Richman2016Loss). 

In healthy cells, TACO1 ensures the efficient translation of mt-Co1 mRNA without affecting its stability, highlighting its specific function in the biogenesis of complex IV (Richman2016Loss). The protein's structure consists of three domains, with domain 1 being positively charged and crucial for RNA binding (Richman2016Loss). TACO1 is active in the mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production by ensuring the proper synthesis of COXI, a component of the respiratory chain complex IV (Richman2016Loss). This function is critical for tissues with high-energy demands, supporting cellular respiration and ATP production (Richman2016Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TACO1 gene are clinically significant as they are linked to late-onset Leigh syndrome (LS) and cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. A specific mutation, a single-base-pair insertion at position 472 (472insC), causes a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon and the loss of the TACO1 protein. This results in a deficiency in complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation (Richman2016Loss). Patients with TACO1 mutations experience late-onset symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, dystonia, and visual impairment, which are less severe compared to typical early-onset LS (Richman2016Loss).

In mouse models, TACO1 mutations lead to similar mitochondrial dysfunctions, with observable symptoms such as motor dysfunction, visual impairments, and cardiac hypertrophy, mirroring the human condition (Richman2016Loss). These models have been instrumental in understanding the disease pathology and exploring potential treatments (Richman2016Loss). Additionally, environmental factors like viral infections can exacerbate the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by TACO1 mutations, highlighting the importance of managing such factors in affected individuals (Ferreira2020Murine). The TACO1 gene's role in mitochondrial function underscores its significance in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and its impact on diseases when mutated (Richman2016Loss).

## Interactions
TACO1 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial translation by interacting with mt-Co1 mRNA and the mitochondrial ribosome. It binds to multiple regions of the mt-Co1 mRNA, which is essential for the translation of the COXI protein, a component of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) (Richman2016Loss). TACO1 associates with the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, facilitating the initiation of translation of mt-Co1 (Richman2016Loss). This interaction is necessary for the efficient translation of COXI, and the loss of TACO1 results in a specific reduction in COXI translation, leading to complex IV deficiency (Richman2016Loss).

Structurally, TACO1 has a unique three-domain configuration, similar to bacterial DUF28 proteins, which is important for its RNA-binding capability (Richman2016Loss). The positively charged domain 1 is critical for its interaction with mt-Co1 mRNA, and mutations in this domain significantly reduce its RNA-binding capacity (Richman2016Loss). TACO1's interaction with PET117 has also been identified, where PET117 stabilizes TACO1, thereby facilitating COX1 translation. PET117 deficiency leads to increased TACO1 turnover via the proteasome, highlighting the importance of this interaction in maintaining TACO1 stability and function (Sun2023PET117).
