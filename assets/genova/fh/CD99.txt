# CD99

## Overview
CD99 is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein, also known as the Xg blood group, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, apoptosis, and differentiation. The CD99 protein is characterized by its small size and high degree of O-glycosylation, which is essential for its function in cell adhesion and migration (Çelik2018Clofarabine; Sullivan2013Neutrophil). It is involved in homophilic interactions that facilitate the transendothelial migration (TEM) of leukocytes, a critical process in immune response and inflammation (Sullivan2013Neutrophil). The protein's structure includes an extracellular domain rich in O-linked carbohydrates and a short cytoplasmic domain, which suggests potential interactions contributing to its quaternary structure (Bedau2016Ectodomain; Bixel2007A). CD99 is expressed in various cell types, with significant roles in T cell differentiation and lymphocyte diapedesis, and is implicated in several diseases, including Hodgkin's Disease, acute myeloid leukemia, and Ewing's sarcoma (Vaikari2019Clinical; Ventura2015CD99; Pasello2018CD99).

## Structure
CD99 is a small, highly O-glycosylated type I transmembrane protein with an apparent molecular weight of 32 kDa (Çelik2018Clofarabine; Sullivan2013Neutrophil). The protein consists of an extracellular domain of approximately 100 amino acids, which is rich in O-linked carbohydrates (Bedau2016Ectodomain; Bixel2007A). The primary structure of CD99 does not show significant homology to any known protein family, except for moderate similarity to CD99L2, which shares 32% amino acid identity (Bixel2007A; Sullivan2013Neutrophil).

CD99 undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily O-glycosylation, which is crucial for its function in cell adhesion and migration (Bedau2016Ectodomain; Çelik2018Clofarabine). The protein is involved in homophilic interactions that facilitate transendothelial migration (TEM) of leukocytes (Sullivan2013Neutrophil). CD99 is also subject to proteolytic cleavage by the metalloprotease meprin β, which affects its role in TEM by increasing cell permeability (Bedau2016Ectodomain).

The protein's cytoplasmic domain is short, less than 40 amino acids, and divergent, suggesting potential interactions that contribute to its quaternary structure (Sullivan2013Neutrophil). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CD99 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
The CD99 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is involved in several critical cellular processes, including cell adhesion, apoptosis, and differentiation. In healthy human cells, CD99 is expressed at varying levels across different cell types, with particularly high expression in cortical thymocytes, pancreatic islet cells, ovarian granulosa cells, Sertoli cells of the testes, endothelial cells, and bone marrow CD34+ cells (Vaikari2019Clinical; Pasello2018CD99). 

CD99 plays a significant role in the immune system, particularly in T cell differentiation and lymphocyte diapedesis, which is the movement of lymphocytes through the endothelial barrier to inflamed tissues (Huijbers2019Targeting; Pasello2018CD99). It is crucial for the regulation of transendothelial migration (TEM) of various immune cells, including leukocytes and monocytes, influencing inflammation and immune responses (Pasello2018CD99). 

The protein exists in two isoforms, which have distinct functional roles. Both isoforms are necessary for apoptosis induction, while either can modulate cell adhesion. The long isoform is required for actin cytoskeleton activation, and on B cells, the short form inhibits homotypic adhesion, whereas the long form promotes it (Pasello2018CD99). CD99-mediated signaling is thought to result from homophilic interactions among CD99 molecules on interacting cells, emphasizing the importance of its expression level in determining physiological functions (Pasello2018CD99).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD99 gene are associated with several diseases. In Hodgkin's Disease (HD), Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells consistently lack CD99 expression. This downregulation is linked to the generation of H-RS-like cells, which exhibit morphological and immunophenotypic characteristics typical of H-RS cells, such as increased cell size, multinucleation, and deregulated cytokine secretion. The absence of CD99 may contribute to defective cell-cycle progression and chromosomal abnormalities, potentially playing a role in the pathogenesis of HD (Kim1998Generation).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CD99 is significantly overexpressed, particularly in cells with FLT3-ITD mutations, and is inversely associated with TP53 mutations. This overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation and viability, making CD99 a potential therapeutic target in AML. CD99 expression is also associated with specific clinical characteristics and risk groups in AML patients (Vaikari2019Clinical).

In Ewing's sarcoma, CD99 is highly expressed and contributes to oncogenesis and inhibition of differentiation. Targeting CD99 in Ewing's sarcoma cells can inhibit NF-kB signaling and promote neural differentiation, suggesting its role in maintaining tumorigenicity (Ventura2015CD99).

## Interactions
CD99 is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins, forming complexes that play significant roles in cellular processes. It associates with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, as well as the tetraspanin CD81, forming a complex that is crucial for T cell activation and immune response regulation (Pata2011Association). These interactions are observed in both the long and short isoforms of CD99 and are confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting techniques (Pata2011Association).

CD99 is also recruited into the immunological synapse during T cell activation, where it colocalizes with F-actin, indicating its role in synapse formation (Pata2011Association). The protein is partially associated with lipid rafts, which are membrane microdomains involved in cell signaling, and this association is important for its function in T cell activation (Oh2007CD99; Pata2011Association).

Additionally, CD99 forms homodimers through its extracellular domain, as demonstrated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis and surface plasmon resonance (Choi2007Detection). These interactions suggest that CD99 plays a multifaceted role in immune cell signaling and regulation.
