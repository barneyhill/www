# KIAA0513

## Overview
KIAA0513 is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly within the central nervous system. The KIAA0513 protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, with notable presence in regions such as the cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus, suggesting its involvement in neurological functions (Lauriat2006Characterization). Although the protein lacks well-defined functional domains, it interacts with several proteins, including KIBRA and HAX-1, which are associated with synaptic signaling and apoptosis, respectively (Lauriat2006Characterization). These interactions imply a role for KIAA0513 in neuroplasticity and cytoskeletal regulation. Furthermore, KIAA0513 has been identified as a hub gene in Alzheimer's disease, with its expression significantly altered in disease states, indicating its potential relevance in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders (Zhu2020Identification). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions of KIAA0513 remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
KIAA0513 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the brain. The protein is expressed ubiquitously across tissues, with higher abundance in the brain, especially in regions such as the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, pons, putamen, and amygdala (Lauriat2006Characterization). It is primarily located in the cytoplasm, as indicated by immunofluorescence analysis in transfected mouse L cells (Lauriat2006Characterization).

KIAA0513 interacts with proteins involved in synaptic and apoptotic signaling, such as KIBRA and HAX-1, which are linked to the cytoskeleton and have roles in synaptic signaling and anti-apoptotic functions, respectively (Lauriat2006Characterization). These interactions suggest that KIAA0513 may play a role in neuroplasticity, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal regulation (Lauriat2006Characterization). Despite these associations, the precise function of KIAA0513 in healthy human cells remains unclear due to its limited homology to proteins of known function and lack of functional domains (Lauriat2006Characterization).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, KIAA0513 has been identified as a hub gene, with its expression being significantly down-regulated in Alzheimer's disease samples, suggesting a potential role in neuronal function and cognitive processes (Zhu2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
KIAA0513 has been implicated in several neurological conditions, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. In Alzheimer's disease, KIAA0513 is identified as one of the 19 downregulated hub genes in a key module associated with the disease. Its expression is significantly reduced in the cortices of 5xFAD mice, a model for AD, and decreases as the disease progresses through different Braak stages. KIAA0513 is negatively associated with β-secretase activity and Aβ42 levels, which are markers of AD progression. Interestingly, KIAA0513 is upregulated in blood samples from individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD compared to cognitively normal individuals, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis of AD (Zhu2020Identification).

In schizophrenia, KIAA0513 is upregulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of affected individuals, although this finding has not been consistently replicated in subsequent studies. The gene is not considered a major susceptibility gene for schizophrenia but may be part of a disrupted signaling pathway in affected individuals. KIAA0513 interacts with proteins involved in synaptic and apoptotic signaling, such as KIBRA and HAX-1, indicating its potential involvement in neuroplasticity and apoptosis, processes often altered in schizophrenia (Lauriat2006Characterization).

## Interactions
KIAA0513 is known to interact with several proteins, suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified three specific interacting proteins: KIBRA/WWC1, HAX-1, and INTS4. KIBRA is associated with synaptic transmission and cytoskeletal transport, indicating a potential role for KIAA0513 in neuroplasticity and synaptic signaling (Lauriat2006Characterization). The interaction between KIAA0513 and KIBRA was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation, supporting a functional relationship between these proteins (Lauriat2006Characterization).

HAX-1, another interacting partner, is involved in anti-apoptotic functions and interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that KIAA0513 may play a role in apoptosis and cytoskeletal regulation (Lauriat2006Characterization). INTS4, part of the integrator complex involved in small nuclear RNA processing and endocytosis, also interacts with KIAA0513, indicating a possible involvement in RNA processing pathways (Lauriat2006Characterization).

These interactions highlight the potential roles of KIAA0513 in neuroplasticity, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal dynamics, although its precise functions remain to be fully elucidated (Lauriat2006Characterization).
