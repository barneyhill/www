# MRPS27

## Overview
The MRPS27 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S27, which is a vital component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for the oxidative phosphorylation system, a key process in cellular energy production (Gonçalves2021The). MRPS27 is characterized by its pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domains, which are known for RNA-binding capabilities, suggesting a role in RNA interaction and mitochondrial gene expression regulation (Zhang2021A). The protein's interactions with other ribosomal proteins and factors, such as ICT1 and ERAL1, underscore its importance in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome (Rackham2014Supernumerary). Additionally, MRPS27 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer, where its expression levels may influence tumor progression and response to treatment (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

## Structure
The MRPS27 protein is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is encoded by the MRPS27 gene and consists of 472 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 55.02 kD and an isoelectric point of 4.81 (Zhang2021A). The protein contains two conserved pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domains, which are known for their RNA-binding capabilities, and a unique MRP-S27 domain (Zhang2021A). These domains suggest a role in RNA interaction and possibly in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression.

MRPS27 is predicted to localize in mitochondria, and it also contains a nuclear localization signal, indicating potential dual localization and function within the cell (Zhang2021A). The protein's structure allows it to associate with other ribosomal proteins and factors, such as ICT1 and ERAL1, which are essential for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded polypeptides (Rackham2014Supernumerary). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of MRPS27 are not provided, its domain composition and interactions suggest a complex role in mitochondrial function and possibly in transcriptional regulation under certain conditions (Zhang2021A).

## Function
MRPS27 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is part of the small 28S subunit of the mitoribosome. It plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. This system is crucial for energy production in cells, impacting cellular metabolism and overall energy homeostasis in the organism (Gonçalves2021The).

In healthy human cells, MRPS27 is involved in maintaining the efficiency of mitochondrial translation and respiratory function. Knockdown of MRPS27 has been shown to reduce the abundance of respiratory complexes and decrease cytochrome c oxidase activity, which are vital for effective mitochondrial respiration and energy production (Gonçalves2021The). This indicates that MRPS27 is essential for the proper assembly and function of the mitoribosome, ensuring the synthesis of proteins necessary for mitochondrial function.

MRPS27 is also part of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain family, which is known for regulating mitochondrial RNA metabolism and translation. It is located in the mitochondria, where it forms a protein-RNA inter-subunit bridge, further highlighting its role in mitochondrial translation processes (Zhang2021A).

## Clinical Significance
MRPS27 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function. Alterations in MRPS27 expression have been observed in several cancer types. For instance, MRPS27 is significantly downregulated in cisplatin-resistant oral squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a role in drug resistance (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). Additionally, MRPS27 expression is altered in other cancers, including cervical, breast, and gastric cancers, where it is generally downregulated (Oviya2021Mitochondrial). These expression changes indicate that MRPS27 may influence cancer cell metabolism and response to cytotoxic drugs, potentially serving as a biomarker for cancer progression and treatment response (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

MRPS27 knockdown in human cells leads to decreased abundance of respiratory complexes and cytochrome c oxidase activity, indicating potential mitochondrial dysfunction (Davies2012MRPS27). This dysfunction could contribute to mitochondrial-related diseases, although specific diseases linked to MRPS27 mutations or expression alterations are not detailed in the available literature (Davies2012MRPS27). The gene's role in mitochondrial translation and its potential extraribosomal functions suggest that dysregulation could impact cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis, influencing disease progression (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

## Interactions
MRPS27 is known to participate in several interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial function. It is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome's small 28S subunit and interacts with mitochondrial RNAs, particularly associating with the 12S rRNA and tRNA Glu, which suggests its involvement in mitochondrial RNA processing and translation (Davies2012MRPS27; Gopisetty2016Mammalian). MRPS27 also co-migrates with the small ribosomal subunit protein MRPS15, confirming its association with the small subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes (Davies2012MRPS27).

In addition to its role in mitochondrial translation, MRPS27 has been shown to interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction suggests a potential involvement in p53-related pathways, which may influence cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Revathi2021Expression). MRPS27 also interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, such as the immature colon carcinoma transcript-1 (ICT1) and the mitochondrial ribosome assembly factor Era G-protein-like 1 (ERAL1), which are associated with the large ribosomal subunit, indicating a role in ribosomal assembly or function (Rackham2014Supernumerary). These interactions highlight MRPS27's multifaceted role in mitochondrial biology and cellular processes.
