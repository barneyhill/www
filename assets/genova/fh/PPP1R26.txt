# PPP1R26

## Overview
The PPP1R26 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 26, which is a regulatory component of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of PP1, thereby influencing key cellular functions such as cell cycle progression, metabolism, and signal transduction. In particular, PPP1R26 has been implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing and transcriptional control, especially in the context of cancer biology. It is notably upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it contributes to tumor progression and metastasis by promoting glycolysis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Yang2022PPP1R26). The protein's interactions with other cellular components underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Yang2022PPP1R26).

## Clinical Significance
The PPP1R26 gene is significantly implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is upregulated in HCC tissues and serves as an independent diagnostic factor predicting a worse prognosis for patients. This upregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to cancer progression (Yang2022PPP1R26). PPP1R26 promotes glycolysis by binding to PTBP1 and facilitating the alternative splicing of PKM2, a key enzyme in glycolysis. This metabolic reprogramming supports the malignancy of cancer cells (Yang2022PPP1R26). 

Additionally, PPP1R26 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for metastasis. It forms a complex with phosphorylated PKM2 and TGIF2, inhibiting the transcription of CDH1, a gene associated with EMT, thereby promoting cancer cell invasiveness (Yang2022PPP1R26). Targeting PPP1R26 with shRNA has been shown to reduce tumor growth in mouse models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in HCC treatment (Yang2022PPP1R26). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPP1R26 in HCC, linking its expression to enhanced glycolysis and metastasis, which are critical for tumor growth and spread.

## Interactions
PPP1R26, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1, is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PPP1R26 is upregulated and plays a significant role in cancer progression by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It binds to PTBP1, a splicing factor, to regulate the alternative splicing of PKM2, a key enzyme in glycolysis. This interaction is crucial for the expression of PKM2, as PPP1R26 facilitates the splicing of PKM2 mRNA, increasing its expression while decreasing PKM1 levels (Yang2022PPP1R26).

PPP1R26 also forms a complex with phosphorylated PKM2 (p-Ser37-PKM2) and TGIF2 in the nucleus, which inhibits the transcription of CDH1. This complex leads to increased nuclear accumulation of PKM2 and suppression of CDH1 transcription by loosening TGIF2's binding to the CDH1 promoter, allowing recruitment of HDAC3 and histone H3 deacetylation (Yang2022PPP1R26). These interactions highlight PPP1R26's role in promoting glycolysis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (Yang2022PPP1R26). The interactions of PPP1R26 with PTBP1 and PKM2 are essential for its function in metabolic reprogramming and cancer progression.
