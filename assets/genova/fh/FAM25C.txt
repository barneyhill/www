# FAM25C

## Overview
FAM25C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 25, member C. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular signaling or transport processes across the cell membrane. The FAM25C protein is implicated in various cellular functions, although its specific roles and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Research into FAM25C is ongoing, with studies exploring its potential interactions and significance in different biological pathways and disease contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC).
