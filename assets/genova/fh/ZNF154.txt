# ZNF154

## Overview
ZNF154 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 154, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 154 is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression modulation and chromatin remodeling. The gene's expression and regulation have been studied extensively in the context of cancer, where its hypermethylation is frequently observed and associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Zhang2018ZNF154; Reinert2012Diagnosis). As a result, ZNF154 is being investigated as a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a target for therapeutic interventions (He2022Targeted; Miller2021Assessing).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF154 is implicated in various cancers due to its hypermethylation, which leads to downregulation of its expression. In prostate cancer, ZNF154 hypermethylation is associated with decreased transcription levels and is linked to poor outcomes and biochemical recurrence, making it a potential independent risk factor for recurrence prediction (Zhang2018ZNF154). The gene's hypermethylation is also observed in bladder cancer, where it serves as a biomarker for recurrence, although it shows limitations in diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancers (Reinert2012Diagnosis).

In esophageal squamous carcinoma, ZNF154 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its hypermethylation is linked to increased proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Targeted demethylation strategies have shown potential in reversing these effects, suggesting a therapeutic avenue (He2022Targeted). ZNF154 hypermethylation is also noted in other cancers, such as pancreatic, ovarian, liver, and colon cancers, where it is being explored as a biomarker for early detection through liquid biopsies (Miller2021Assessing). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF154 in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
