# TMEM63C

## Overview
TMEM63C is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 63C, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is enriched at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MERCs), where it functions as an osmosensitive calcium-permeable cation channel. TMEM63C plays a significant role in maintaining cellular and organelle homeostasis by regulating the morphology and dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. It is highly expressed in the nervous system and is involved in lipid and calcium trafficking, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, TMEM63C is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the kidney's filtration barrier, particularly in podocytes. Mutations in the TMEM63C gene have been linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia and chronic kidney disease, highlighting its importance in both neurological and renal health (Tábara2022TMEM63C; Schulz2019Analysis).

## Structure
The TMEM63C protein is a transmembrane protein that functions as a monomer and contains 11 transmembrane helices, designated TM0 to TM10. The N-terminus of the protein is oriented extracellularly, while the C-terminus is intracellular. A notable feature of its structure is a long cytosolic domain composed primarily of α-helices located between TM2 and TM3. TM3 and TM4 are tilted towards the membrane and are situated at the outer boundary of the transmembrane region, while TM7 and TM8 are shorter and do not span the entire membrane (Qin2023CryoEM).

The protein's structure is similar to its plant orthologue, OSCA, with a sequence identity of 21.6% for the full length. Both TMEM63C and OSCA have conserved structures with 11 transmembrane α-helices, although differences exist in the pore region. Specifically, a short α-helix at the cytoplasmic side of TM6 swings to TM4 to avoid clashing with TM0, resulting in a different pore profile for TMEM63C (Qin2023CryoEM).

TMEM63C is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and is enriched at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MERCs), which are crucial for lipid and calcium trafficking (Tábara2022TMEM63C). The protein is involved in regulating both ER and mitochondrial morphologies (Tábara2022TMEM63C).

## Function
TMEM63C is a transmembrane protein that functions as an osmosensitive calcium-permeable cation channel, primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and enriched at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MERCs) (Tábara2022TMEM63C). It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular and organelle homeostasis by regulating the morphology and dynamics of the ER and mitochondria. TMEM63C is involved in lipid and calcium trafficking at MERCs, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Tábara2022TMEM63C).

In healthy human cells, TMEM63C is highly expressed in the nervous system and is implicated in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function. It influences mitochondrial fission and fusion cycles, with its silencing leading to elongated mitochondria and its overexpression causing mitochondrial fragmentation (Tábara2022TMEM63C). Despite these morphological changes, mitochondrial respiration remains largely unaffected, although maximal respiration is slightly decreased when TMEM63C is silenced (Tábara2022TMEM63C).

TMEM63C is also involved in maintaining the integrity of the kidney's filtration barrier, as evidenced by its expression in podocytes and its role in preventing podocyte damage and maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier (Schulz2019Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM63C gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the context of HSP, TMEM63C mutations are associated with both pure and complex forms of the disease, characterized by progressive lower-limb weakness and spasticity. These mutations lead to mitochondrial morphology defects, which are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of HSP. The gene is highly expressed in the nervous system, and its disruption affects mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology, potentially impacting neuronal bioenergetics and axonal health (Tábara2022TMEM63C).

In kidney-related conditions, TMEM63C is linked to hypertension-induced albuminuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Altered expression of TMEM63C in podocytes, cells critical for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier, is associated with kidney damage. In FSGS patients, a significant loss of TMEM63C expression in podocytes correlates with impaired cell viability and increased apoptosis, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of kidney diseases (Schulz2019Analysis). These findings highlight TMEM63C as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in both neurological and renal disorders.
