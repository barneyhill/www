# TMSB4Y

## Overview
TMSB4Y, or thymosin beta 4 Y-linked, is a gene located on the Y chromosome that encodes a protein involved in actin binding and regulation. The protein, categorized as an actin-binding protein, plays a crucial role in the organization and dynamics of the cytoskeleton by sequestering G-actin monomers. This function is essential for maintaining cell structure and facilitating processes such as cell motility, proliferation, and differentiation, which are vital for wound healing and tissue regeneration (Nailwal2017Azoospermia; Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics). TMSB4Y is particularly significant in male-specific biological processes due to its location in the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (Ginalski2004Protein). The protein's interaction with β-actin suggests its involvement in modulating cytoskeletal turnover and influencing cell cycle progression, thereby impacting cell morphology and proliferation (Wong2015TMSB4Yis). Additionally, TMSB4Y has been implicated in cancer biology and immune responses, highlighting its diverse roles in human health and disease (Łysiak2021Deletions; Torikai2004A).

## Function
TMSB4Y (thymosin beta 4 Y-linked) is a gene located on the Y chromosome that encodes a protein involved in actin binding and regulation. This protein plays a significant role in the organization of the cytoskeleton by sequestering G-actin monomers, which influences cytoskeletal dynamics and is crucial for maintaining cell structure and function (Nailwal2017Azoospermia). TMSB4Y is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cell motility, proliferation, and differentiation. These processes are essential for wound healing and tissue regeneration (Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics).

In healthy human cells, TMSB4Y interacts with β-actin, a key component of the actin cytoskeleton, which is involved in cell morphology and cell cycle regulation (Wong2015TMSB4Yis). The protein's interaction with β-actin suggests that it may modulate actin cytoskeletal turnover and influence cell cycle progression, thereby playing a role in regulating cell morphology and proliferation (Wong2015TMSB4Yis). This function is particularly relevant in the context of male-specific biological processes, as TMSB4Y is part of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (Ginalski2004Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMSB4Y gene have been associated with various clinical outcomes, particularly in the context of glioblastoma. Lower mRNA expression levels of TMSB4Y are linked to significantly shorter overall survival in glioblastoma patients. Specifically, patients with low TMSB4Y expression had a median overall survival of 12.6 months compared to 15.8 months for those with higher expression levels, indicating that TMSB4Y expression could serve as a prognostic marker for this type of cancer (Łysiak2021Deletions).

In the realm of immunology, TMSB4Y encodes a minor histocompatibility antigen that is recognized by HLA-A*3303-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This antigen is involved in immune responses post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and may play a role in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (Torikai2004A). The TMSB4Y/A33 antigen is derived from an unconventional open reading frame, highlighting its unique role in immune recognition (Torikai2004A).

While TMSB4Y is frequently deleted in glioblastoma, these deletions do not significantly impact survival outcomes, suggesting that the gene's expression level rather than its deletion is more clinically relevant in this context (Łysiak2021Deletions).

## Interactions
TMSB4Y, a gene located on the Y chromosome, encodes a protein that interacts with β-actin, a key component of the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction has been demonstrated through proximity ligation assays (PLA) and immunoprecipitation techniques, indicating that TMSB4Y and β-actin are in close proximity and interact directly after induction with doxycycline (Wong2015TMSB4Yis). The interaction between TMSB4Y and β-actin is significant as it influences cell morphology and proliferation, suggesting that TMSB4Y may modulate cytoskeletal turnover and affect cell cycle progression (Wong2015TMSB4Yis).

The study of TMSB4Y in the context of male breast cancer has shown that its expression leads to changes in cell morphology and a reduction in cell proliferation, which are attributed to its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton (Wong2015TMSB4Yis). This interaction is thought to contribute to the tumor suppressor properties of TMSB4Y, potentially through its role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton and influencing cellular dynamics (Wong2015TMSB4Yis). These findings highlight the importance of TMSB4Y in cellular processes and its potential role in cancer biology.
