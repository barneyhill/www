# PLPP1

## Overview
Phospholipid phosphatase 1 (PLPP1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phospholipid phosphatase 1, a critical component in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily located in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. PLPP1 is responsible for the dephosphorylation of various lipid phosphates, including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which are key regulators of cell division, migration, and survival (Tang2015Lipid). The enzyme's activity influences cellular lipid composition and signaling pathways, impacting processes such as vasculogenesis, neural development, and immune homeostasis (Tang2015Lipid). Alterations in PLPP1 expression have been linked to significant clinical outcomes, particularly in breast cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and patient survival (Benesch2023Decreased; Tang2019Increasing).

## Function
PLPP1, also known as phospholipid phosphatase 1, plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling by dephosphorylating lipid phosphates. It is involved in the dephosphorylation of extracellular lipid phosphates such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), as well as more hydrophobic lipids like phosphatidic acid (PA) and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) (Tang2015Lipid). This activity is essential for regulating bioactive lipid mediators that influence cell division, migration, and survival (Tang2015Lipid).

PLPP1 is primarily active in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences cellular lipid composition and signaling pathways. By hydrolyzing extracellular PA, PLPP1 suppresses endothelial membrane permeability and affects intracellular signaling pathways by regulating the levels of PA and diacylglycerol (DG), which are involved in activating signaling proteins such as ERK, mTOR, and Akt (Tang2015Lipid). This regulation is crucial for maintaining physiological levels of LPA and S1P, which are important for various cellular functions, including vasculogenesis, neural development, and immune homeostasis (Tang2015Lipid).

PLPP1's activity also impacts cell migration and calcium mobilization, highlighting its role in cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Tang2015Lipid).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLPP1 gene, which encodes lipid phosphate phosphatase 1 (LPP1), have significant clinical implications in breast cancer. Studies have shown that LPP1 mRNA levels are significantly lower in breast tumors compared to normal breast tissue, regardless of the tumor subtype, such as ER+ or HER2+ (Tang2019Increasing). This reduced expression is associated with decreased disease-free survival rates in breast cancer patients (Tang2019Increasing). Increasing LPP1 expression in breast cancer cells has been found to decrease invasion and metastasis, which is linked to reduced production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) regulated by AP-1 transcription factors (Tang2019Increasing).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), LPP1 expression is particularly low, and its expression is lowest in stage II tumors compared to stages I and III (Benesch2023Decreased). High LPP1 expression correlates with decreased cell proliferation and better overall survival, suggesting that low LPP1 levels contribute to a pro-cancer phenotype, promoting tumor progression and immune evasion (Benesch2023Decreased). These findings indicate that targeting LPP1 expression could be a promising therapeutic strategy for managing breast cancer, particularly in aggressive forms like TNBC (Tang2019Increasing).
