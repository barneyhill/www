# ZCCHC3

## Overview
ZCCHC3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 3 protein, which is integral to the innate immune response. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate nucleic acid binding, allowing it to interact with both RNA and DNA. This interaction is crucial for the protein's role as a co-sensor in the detection of cytosolic double-stranded DNA, enhancing the activity of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and promoting antiviral responses. ZCCHC3 also plays a role in suppressing LINE-1 retrotransposition, thereby maintaining genomic stability. The protein's involvement in immune signaling pathways and its interactions with various proteins, such as RIG-I and MDA5, underscore its importance in modulating immune responses and its potential implications in cancer and other diseases (Lian2018The; Unknownauthors2023ComprehensivePancancerAnalysisIdentifiedZCCHC3asanImmunologicalandPrognosticBiomarker; Goodier2023ZCCHC3).

## Structure
The ZCCHC3 protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger CCHC-type motifs, which are involved in nucleic acid binding. The protein contains an N-terminal region and three tandem zinc finger domains located at its C-terminus (Lian2018The). These zinc finger domains are crucial for binding to both RNA and DNA, facilitating interactions with various proteins involved in the innate immune response, such as RIG-I, MDA5, and cGAS (Lian2018The; Lian2018ZCCHC3). The zinc fingers can independently bind to viral RNA and DNA, suggesting a functional similarity to the C-terminal domains of RIG-I and MDA5 (Lian2018The).

The protein also contains low complexity domains of unknown function between residues 4 and 142 (Goodier2023ZCCHC3). The C-terminus, which includes three C2HC zinc fingers (residues 335-387), is involved in binding double-stranded RNA and DNA (Goodier2023ZCCHC3). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation have been identified, with serine residues S66, S72, and S363 being potential phosphorylation sites (Goodier2023ZCCHC3). These modifications may influence the protein's function and stability. The protein can form multimers, as it has been shown to bind itself, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions and multimerization (Goodier2023ZCCHC3).

## Function
ZCCHC3 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by facilitating the recognition of viral RNA and DNA in healthy human cells. It acts as a co-sensor with cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) for the detection of cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), enhancing the binding of cGAS to dsDNA and promoting the production of the second messenger cGAMP. This process is essential for the activation of downstream antiviral responses, including the transcription of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are critical for defending against DNA viruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and vaccinia virus (VACV) (Lian2018ZCCHC3).

ZCCHC3 is also involved in the suppression of LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition, a process where retrotransposons duplicate within the genome. It interacts with L1 ORF1p in stress granules, cytoplasmic aggregates that form under stress conditions, and is thought to limit retrotransposition by affecting RNA stability and protein levels (Zhang2022The; Goodier2023ZCCHC3). ZCCHC3's activity in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with viral RNA and DNA, underscores its role in modulating immune signaling pathways and maintaining genomic integrity (Lian2018The; Goodier2023ZCCHC3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZCCHC3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and immune responses. In cancer, ZCCHC3 expression is associated with different prognostic outcomes across various types. High expression levels of ZCCHC3 are considered a risk factor in cancers such as lower-grade glioma (LGG) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), while it acts as a protective factor in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) (Unknownauthors2023ComprehensivePancancerAnalysisIdentifiedZCCHC3asanImmunologicalandPrognosticBiomarker). In osteosarcoma, ZCCHC3 is overexpressed and contributes to tumor progression by promoting cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Wang2021ELF1activated).

ZCCHC3 also plays a significant role in the immune response to viral infections. It is essential for the activation of antiviral genes and signaling pathways, particularly in response to RNA viruses, by interacting with RIG-I-like receptors (Lian2018The). Deficiency in ZCCHC3 impairs the immune response, leading to increased susceptibility to viral infections (Lian2018The). Additionally, ZCCHC3 is involved in the suppression of LINE-1 retrotransposition, a process that, if dysregulated, can contribute to genomic instability (Goodier2023ZCCHC3). These findings suggest that ZCCHC3 is a critical regulator in both cancer progression and immune defense mechanisms.

## Interactions
ZCCHC3 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in the innate immune response. It binds to viral RNA and facilitates the sensing of viral RNA by RIG-I and MDA5, which are RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). This interaction enhances the binding of RIG-I to 5' ppp-dsRNA and MDA5 to poly(I:C), crucial for initiating antiviral responses (Lian2018The). ZCCHC3 also promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of the CARD domains of RIG-I and MDA5, a modification essential for their activation, by interacting with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 (Lian2018The).

ZCCHC3 acts as a co-sensor for cGAS in the recognition of cytosolic dsDNA, enhancing cGAS binding to dsDNA and promoting its activation. This interaction is crucial for the transcription of downstream effector genes in response to viral infections (Lian2018ZCCHC3). ZCCHC3 also binds to the GagNC protein of HIV-1, preventing GagNC from binding to viral RNA, which suppresses viral production and infectivity (Yi2023Host).

In addition to its role in antiviral responses, ZCCHC3 interacts with the LINE-1 ORF1 ribonucleoprotein particle, inhibiting LINE-1 retrotransposition. This interaction is part of its function as a stress granule protein, where it associates with the RNA exosome complex (Goodier2023ZCCHC3).
