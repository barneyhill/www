# FUT10

## Overview
FUT10 is a gene that encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 10, which is a member of the fucosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the fucosylation process, a type of glycosylation that adds fucose, a hexose sugar, to glycoproteins and glycolipids. Fucosyltransferase 10 is particularly significant in the synthesis of Lewis X (Le X) antigens on N-glycans, playing a crucial role in maintaining neural stem cells in an undifferentiated state and facilitating neural development. The enzyme exhibits unique α1,3-fucosyltransferase activity and is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies proteins and lipids, influencing cellular communication and stability. FUT10's expression is notably observed in the embryonic brain's ventricular zone/subventricular zone, implicating its role in neural precursor cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, FUT10 has been linked to cancer-related processes, such as cell migration and proliferation in breast cancer, and its expression levels have been studied in colon adenocarcinoma (Kumar2013The; Patnaik2007Characterization; Wang2022Fucosyltransferases; Keeley2019The).

## Function
FUT10 (fucosyltransferase 10) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the maintenance and function of stem cells, particularly neural stem cells (NSCs). It is involved in the synthesis of Lewis X (Le X) antigens on N-glycans, which are carbohydrate structures present on glycoproteins and glycolipids. This fucosylation process is crucial for maintaining stem cells in an undifferentiated state and facilitating neural development (Kumar2013The).

FUT10 exhibits unique α1,3-fucosyltransferase activity with stringent substrate specificity, differentiating it from other fucosyltransferases like FUT9. While FUT9 is thought to synthesize most Le X moieties in the brain, FUT10's role is more specialized, particularly in stem cell maintenance and neural precursor cell migration (Kumar2013The). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies proteins and lipids, influencing cellular communication and stability (Patnaik2007Characterization).

In the embryonic brain, FUT10 is expressed in the ventricular zone/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ), suggesting its involvement in neural precursor cell proliferation and migration. Knockdown of FUT10 expression impairs these processes, highlighting its essential role in neural development (Kumar2013The).

## Clinical Significance
FUT10 is implicated in various cancer-related processes due to its role in fucosylation. In breast cancer, increased FUT10 expression is associated with enhanced cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis-related gene expression. Inhibition of fucosylation can block these cancer cell activities, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Keeley2019The). In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), FUT10 expression is elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, although its high expression correlates with a lower TNM stage, indicating a possible protective role in cancer progression (Wang2022Fucosyltransferases). 

FUT10 is also regulated by transcription factors such as HNF1a and HNF4a, which are involved in inflammatory responses and plasma protein glycosylation. This regulation is crucial for processes like the acute phase response to infection, although specific diseases directly linked to FUT10 mutations are not detailed (Lauc2010Genomics). Despite its involvement in cancer, the clinical significance of FUT10 in other diseases remains less clear, as the context does not provide specific associations with conditions outside of cancer-related processes.
