# ZNF431

## Overview
ZNF431 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 431, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can bind to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger protein 431 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by binding to specific DNA sequences and influencing the expression of target genes. The precise biological roles and mechanisms of action of ZNF431 are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and may be implicated in certain developmental and pathological processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
