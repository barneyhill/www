# ZNF277

## Overview
ZNF277 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 277, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are integral to the protein's function, facilitating its role as a transcriptional regulator and its involvement in protein-protein interactions. Zinc finger protein 277 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it participates in transcriptional repression, RNA binding, and chromatin remodeling. It interacts with various proteins, including the ribosomal protein uS5 and components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), highlighting its role in modulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Clinically, alterations in the ZNF277 gene have been linked to specific language impairment and colon cancer, underscoring its significance in both developmental and oncogenic processes (Xie2022Zinc; Dionne2019The).

## Structure
ZNF277 is a zinc finger protein characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function. The protein contains two typical C2H2 zinc finger domains and three additional atypical ones, which are essential for its interaction with the ribosomal protein uS5. The integrity of specific zinc finger domains, particularly ZF#5, is critical for stable binding to uS5, indicating the importance of these domains in the protein's structure and function (Dionne2019The).

The primary structure of ZNF277 includes sequences rich in cysteine and histidine residues, typical of zinc finger proteins, which facilitate the formation of zinc finger motifs. These motifs are involved in protein-protein interactions, as seen in the binding with uS5 (Dionne2019The). The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in zinc finger domains, although specific details are not provided in the context.

ZNF277 is also involved in forming complexes with other proteins, such as PDCD2L, suggesting a potential quaternary structure where ZNF277 may interact with multiple protein partners (Dionne2019The). The protein's function and interactions are influenced by its zinc finger domains, which are essential for recognizing and binding specific protein partners.

## Function
ZNF277 is a zinc finger protein involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator, influencing gene expression by binding to DNA through its C2H2-type zinc finger domains (Dionne2019The). ZNF277 is known to interact with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5, forming an extra-ribosomal complex that competes with PRMT3 for binding to uS5. This interaction suggests a role for ZNF277 in modulating protein-protein interactions beyond its transcriptional activities (Dionne2019The).

ZNF277 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it is involved in transcriptional repression and RNA binding. It recognizes specific RNA elements, such as the Nanos Response Element of p38-MAPK14 mRNA, indicating its role in post-transcriptional regulation (Dionne2019The). The protein also plays a role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing, as evidenced by its interaction with polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to repress the Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor gene locus. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular senescence and differentiation processes (Negishi2010A).

Overall, ZNF277's activities in the nucleus and its interactions with other proteins highlight its significant role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF277 gene have been associated with specific language impairment (SLI) and colon cancer. A study identified a homozygous microdeletion of exon 5 in ZNF277 in a child with SLI, which resulted in a frame-shift mutation and a premature stop codon, likely leading to a lack of functional protein due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This microdeletion was inherited from both parents, who were heterozygous and had language problems in childhood. The study found that ZNF277 microdeletions were more frequent in SLI probands compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in language impairment (Ceroni2014Homozygous).

In colon cancer, ZNF277 is identified as an oncogene. It is overexpressed in colon cancer tissues and is involved in promoting tumor initiation and progression. ZNF277 interacts with BMI1 in the PRC1 complex, repressing the expression of p21 WAF1, a tumor suppressor, thereby inhibiting cellular senescence and promoting proliferation. Knockdown of ZNF277 in colon cancer cells leads to increased p21 WAF1 levels and reduced tumor growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Xie2022Zinc). The gene's expression is regulated by β-catenin signaling, further linking it to cancer pathways (Xie2022Zinc).

## Interactions
ZNF277, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It physically associates with BMI1, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), in human colon cancer cells. This interaction suggests that ZNF277 is part of the PRC1 complex, contributing to the repression of p21 WAF1 expression, which is crucial for inhibiting cellular senescence and promoting tumorigenesis (Xie2022Zinc). ZNF277 also interacts with the ribosomal protein uS5, forming an extra-ribosomal complex. This interaction is mediated by the C2H2 zinc finger domains of ZNF277, with ZF#5 being essential for stable association. The interaction is direct and does not depend on nucleic acids (Dionne2019The).

ZNF277 competes with PRMT3 for binding to uS5, indicating a regulatory role in the DNA and RNA-binding activities of uS5. The ZNF277-uS5 complex is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleolus, suggesting a role in ribosome biogenesis and possibly in the regulation of ribosomal protein assembly (Dionne2019The).
