# DDB2

## Overview
DDB2 (damage specific DNA binding protein 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is essential for repairing UV-induced DNA damage. The DDB2 protein is a key component of the UV-DDB complex, functioning primarily as a DNA damage recognition factor. It is characterized by a seven-bladed WD40 beta propeller domain, which facilitates its interaction with DNA and other proteins. DDB2 forms a heterodimeric complex with DDB1, playing a critical role in chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, and cell cycle control. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which are crucial for its function in DNA repair and cellular processes (Bao2022A; Gilson2019Emerging). Mutations in the DDB2 gene are linked to xeroderma pigmentosum group E (XP-E), a condition marked by increased sensitivity to UV light and a predisposition to skin cancer (Nichols2003Basal). Additionally, DDB2 expression levels have been associated with various cancer types, influencing tumor progression and treatment responses (Gilson2019Emerging).

## Structure
The DDB2 protein is a crucial component of the UV-DDB complex involved in DNA repair, specifically recognizing UV-induced DNA damage. It is encoded by the XPE gene and consists of 428 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 48 kDa (Bao2022A). The primary structure of DDB2 includes a seven-bladed WD40 beta propeller domain, spanning residues 137-454, which is essential for its DNA-binding capabilities (Bao2022A; Gilson2019Emerging). This domain facilitates sequence-specific protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, crucial for DDB2's function in damage recognition (Gilson2019Emerging).

The secondary structure of DDB2 features an N-terminal helix-loop-helix motif, which interacts with the DDB1 protein, forming a heterodimeric complex (Bao2022A; Gilson2019Emerging). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the WD40 domain, allowing DDB2 to insert a hairpin into the minor groove of DNA, stabilizing flipped-out lesions and kinking the DNA duplex (Scrima2008Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, DDB2 forms a complex with DDB1, and this interaction is mediated by the helix-loop-helix domain of DDB2 and the WD40 domains of DDB1 (Gilson2019Emerging). Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, regulate DDB2's activity, particularly in response to DNA damage (Fischer2011The).

## Function
DDB2 (damage specific DNA binding protein 2) is a crucial component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system, primarily involved in recognizing and repairing UV-induced DNA damage, such as (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (Kattan2008Damaged; Gilson2019Emerging). It functions as part of a heterodimeric complex with DDB1, facilitating the recruitment of other repair proteins to DNA lesions (Kattan2008Damaged). DDB2 also plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, and cell cycle regulation. It acts as a transcription regulator by participating in chromatin remodeling and activating complexes like SWI/SNF and STAGA, which aid in chromatin unfolding and RNA polymerase recruitment (Gilson2019Emerging).

DDB2 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, with its expression peaking at the G1/S boundary. It interacts with the E2F1 transcription factor, stimulating E2F1-activated transcription, and is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Nag2001The; Nichols2003Basal). DDB2 also mediates the degradation of CDT2, affecting the stability of CDT1, a key regulator of DNA replication, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Wu2021DDB2). The protein is localized in the nucleus and is ubiquitously present in human tissues, with its expression being cell cycle-dependent (Gilson2019Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDB2 gene are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum group E (XP-E), a rare hereditary disease characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light and a high predisposition to skin cancers. These mutations impair the DDB2-DDB1 interactions, leading to defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity, which is crucial for repairing UV-induced DNA damage (Itoh2003Impaired; Nichols2003Basal). Patients with XP-E often exhibit a mild form of the disease with late onset of symptoms, and their cells lack the activity of the damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB) (Nichols2003Basal).

Altered expression of DDB2 is linked to various cancers. Low DDB2 expression levels correlate with poor outcomes in melanoma, colon, ovarian, lung, breast, brain, and head and neck cancers, suggesting its role in tumor suppression (Gilson2019Emerging). In breast cancer, high DDB2 levels are found in ER-positive and non-invasive models, while lower levels are observed in aggressive ER-negative breast cancer cells (Gilson2019Emerging). DDB2 also influences cancer cell sensitivity to treatments like PARP inhibitors and cisplatin, highlighting its potential impact on cancer treatment outcomes (Gilson2019Emerging).

## Interactions
DDB2 is a key component of the UV-DDB complex, which includes DDB1, and plays a crucial role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) by recognizing UV-induced DNA damage. It forms a heterodimeric complex with DDB1, and this complex can bind to DNA in both monomeric and dimeric forms (Gilson2019Emerging; Beecher2020Expanding). DDB2 acts as a substrate receptor in the CUL4A-DDB1-DDB2 complex, which is involved in the ubiquitination of proteins at DNA damage sites, facilitating chromatin remodeling and repair factor recruitment (Bao2022A; Gilson2019Emerging).

DDB2 interacts with XPC, enhancing the recruitment of this protein to DNA damage sites, which is essential for efficient NER (Bao2022A). It also interacts with histone acetyltransferase complexes like CBP/p300 and chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF, which are important for transcription and DNA repair (Bao2022A). DDB2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and PARylation, which influence its stability and interactions at damage sites (Bao2022A; Beecher2020Expanding).

Beyond DNA repair, DDB2 interacts with proteins involved in apoptosis and senescence, such as p21 Waf1/Cip1, and is implicated in the degradation of CDT2 in cancer cells (Bao2022A). It also plays a role in modulating transcription and cell cycle progression by interacting with transcription factors like E2F1 (Gilson2019Emerging).
