# ZZEF1

## Overview
Zinc finger ZZ-type and EF-hand domain containing 1, encoded by the ZZEF1 gene, is a protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger and EF-hand domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding and calcium ion binding, respectively. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and signal transduction, due to its structural domains that facilitate interactions with DNA and other proteins. The ZZEF1 gene has garnered attention in cancer research, particularly in the context of colon cancer, where it is considered a potential somatic driver gene. Its expression patterns and interactions within tissue-specific networks suggest a significant role in oncogenic processes, highlighting its importance in the study of cancer biology (UrzúaTraslaviña2024Coexpression).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZZEF1 has been implicated in the development of certain cancers, particularly colon cancer. Studies have identified ZZEF1 as a potential somatic driver gene in colon cancer, with significant p-values suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (UrzúaTraslaviña2024Coexpression). The gene's role in cancer is supported by its co-expression with other cancer-associated genes within tissue-specific networks, which are more enriched for cancer-specific driver genes compared to multi-tissue networks (UrzúaTraslaviña2024Coexpression). This suggests that alterations in ZZEF1 expression or mutations may contribute to the oncogenic processes in colon cancer.

The research highlights the limited overlap between genes identified in cancer GWAS loci and established cancer driver genes, yet ZZEF1 emerges as a significant driver when analyzed within the context of tissue-specific co-expression networks (UrzúaTraslaviña2024Coexpression). This indicates that ZZEF1 may play a crucial role in the genetic landscape of cancer susceptibility and progression, particularly in tissues where it is co-expressed with other cancer-related genes. The study's findings underscore the importance of considering tissue-specific interactions and co-expression patterns when evaluating the clinical significance of ZZEF1 in cancer.
