# H2AC21

## Overview
H2AC21 is a gene that encodes a variant of the histone H2A protein, which is a core component of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histone proteins, including H2A, play a critical role in the structural organization of chromatin by forming nucleosomes, around which DNA is wrapped. This organization is essential for DNA packaging within the nucleus and influences key cellular processes such as gene expression, DNA repair, and replication. The H2A clustered histone 21 protein, encoded by H2AC21, is involved in maintaining chromatin stability and structure, thereby impacting transcription regulation and genome integrity (Dong2022Identification). Variants of histone H2A, such as the one encoded by H2AC21, are integral to chromatin dynamics and have been implicated in various cellular responses and disease states, including cancer (Fu2022A; Zhang2022Development).

## Structure


## Function
H2AC21 encodes a variant of the histone H2A protein, which is a fundamental component of chromatin structure in eukaryotic cells. Histones, including H2A, are integral to the formation of nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin, where DNA is wrapped around an octamer of core histones, including H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. This structure is crucial for DNA packaging within the nucleus and plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, DNA repair, and replication by influencing chromatin dynamics and accessibility (Dong2022Identification).

In healthy human cells, H2AC21 is involved in maintaining chromatin structure and stability, which impacts cellular processes such as transcription regulation and genome stability. The binding of linker histone H1 to nucleosomes, which includes H2A variants like H2AC21, promotes higher-order chromatin organization, affecting the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins (Dong2022Identification). Although specific functions of H2AC21 in healthy cells are not detailed, its role in chromatin structure suggests it may respond to mechanical stimuli, as indicated by its downregulation in human dermal fibroblasts subjected to mechanical stretch (Dong2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The H2AC21 gene, encoding a variant of the histone H2A, has been implicated in several cancer types due to alterations in its expression levels. In esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), H2AC21 is one of the four necroptosis-related genes used to construct a prognostic model, which effectively classifies patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on survival outcomes (Zhang2022Development). This suggests that changes in H2AC21 expression may be associated with disease progression and patient prognosis in EAC.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), H2AC21 is among the top five genes with the highest frequencies of gain alterations, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis. However, it was not included in the risk signature developed for predicting prognosis and response to immunotherapy in HCC patients (Fu2022A).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, H2AC21 is significantly downregulated, with a log2 fold change of -7.111029988, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease's molecular pathology (Jafari2022Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of H2AC21 in various cancers, where its altered expression may contribute to disease development and progression.
