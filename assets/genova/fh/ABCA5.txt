# ABCA5

## Overview
The ABCA5 gene encodes ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 5, a protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This family is characterized by its role in transporting various molecules across cellular membranes using ATP hydrolysis. ABCA5 is a full transporter, featuring two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding folds, which facilitate its function in cellular processes such as cholesterol transport and lysosomal maintenance. The protein is predominantly expressed in hair follicles and the lysosomal compartment of cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and lysosomal integrity. This function is essential for processes like autophagy and the regulation of hair growth. Additionally, ABCA5 is implicated in neurological functions, particularly in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein processing, which is relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology (DeStefano2014Mutations; Petry2003Cloning; Fu2014ABCA5).

## Structure
The ABCA5 protein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, characterized by its full transporter structure, which includes two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs) (Petry2003Cloning; Kaminski2006ABC). The primary structure of ABCA5 consists of 1,642 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 183 kDa (Albrecht2006The; Petry2003Cloning). The protein is predicted to have up to 16 transmembrane segments, arranged in sets of two transmembrane domains followed by their respective NBFs, a typical arrangement for ABC full transporters (Petry2003Cloning).

The secondary structure includes membrane-spanning α-helices, with the N-terminal half predicted to have up to 8 membrane-spanning segments, separated by a cytoplasmic loop of 127 amino acids (Petry2003Cloning). The C-terminal domain also contains up to 8 membrane-spanning segments (Petry2003Cloning).

ABCA5 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is crucial for its proper folding and function (DeStefano2014Mutations). A splice variant, ABCA5 V20+16, results in a truncated protein with up to 9 membrane-spanning segments, terminating after 925 amino acids, and is suggested to function as a half-transporter (Albrecht2006The; Petry2003Cloning).

## Function
The ABCA5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically involved in cholesterol transport and lysosomal function. In healthy human cells, ABCA5 is expressed in hair follicles, particularly in the outer and inner root sheaths, as well as in the perifollicular dermis. This expression pattern suggests a role in regulating hair growth by maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and lysosomal integrity (DeStefano2014Mutations).

ABCA5 is localized to the lysosomal compartment, where it facilitates the efflux of cholesterol, particularly in macrophages. This function is crucial for maintaining lysosomal integrity and autophagy, processes essential for intracellular digestion and recycling of organelles (DeStefano2014Mutations). The protein's activity in lysosomes is important for the progression through the hair cycle, as deficiencies in lysosomal proteases can lead to hair loss due to hyperproliferation of epithelial cells in the hair follicle (DeStefano2014Mutations).

In neurons, ABCA5 regulates cholesterol efflux, influencing the processing of amyloid precursor protein (AβPP) and reducing amyloid-β production, which is relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology (Fu2014ABCA5). This highlights its role in cholesterol regulation and its potential impact on neurodegenerative diseases.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCA5 gene have been linked to several medical conditions. One significant association is with congenital generalized hypertrichosis terminalis (CGHT), a rare condition characterized by excessive hair growth. Studies have identified loss-of-function mutations in ABCA5 that lead to reduced expression and localization of the protein in hair follicles, resulting in excessive hair overgrowth. These mutations disrupt lysosomal function and cholesterol handling, contributing to the CGHT phenotype (DeStefano2014Mutations).

ABCA5 mutations have also been implicated in cardiac conditions. In a study involving a 5-year-old boy with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (IVT), two novel heterozygous variants in ABCA5 were identified. These mutations may lead to reduced mRNA levels and affect cholesterol trafficking, potentially linking ABCA5 to cardiac arrhythmias (Du2020FamilyBased).

Additionally, ABCA5 has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Altered expression of ABCA5 in the hippocampus of AD brains suggests its involvement in amyloid precursor protein processing, impacting amyloid-β peptide production. This indicates a potential role for ABCA5 in AD through its regulation of cholesterol efflux and amyloid-β production (Fu2014ABCA5).
