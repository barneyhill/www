# NOTCH1

## Overview
NOTCH1 is a gene that encodes the notch receptor 1, a transmembrane protein integral to the Notch signaling pathway, which is pivotal in regulating cell fate decisions, differentiation, and proliferation across various cell types. The NOTCH1 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats that facilitate ligand binding, and an intracellular domain that transduces signals to the nucleus (Arnett2018Structural; Kovall2010Mechanistic). As a receptor, NOTCH1 plays a crucial role in numerous physiological processes, such as neurogenesis, hematopoiesis, and vascular homeostasis, by acting as a mechanosensor and maintaining cellular integrity (Mack2017NOTCH1). Dysregulation of NOTCH1, often through mutations, is implicated in various pathologies, including cancers like T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as congenital heart defects (Villamor2012NOTCH1; KerstjensFrederikse2016Cardiovascular; Ferrarotto2017Activating).

## Structure
The NOTCH1 protein is a transmembrane receptor involved in cell signaling, characterized by a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes a large extracellular domain composed of multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, which are crucial for ligand binding. These EGF repeats are approximately 40 amino acids long and contain three intradomain disulfide bonds, contributing to their stability (Arnett2018Structural). The ligand-binding region primarily involves EGF repeats 11-13, which interact with ligands such as Delta-like 4 (DLL4) in an antiparallel orientation (Luca2015Structural).

The secondary structure of NOTCH1 includes beta-sheets within the EGF repeats, which adopt an elongated conformation stabilized by calcium ions (Kovall2010Mechanistic). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these repeats into a rod-like conformation, forming a ligand-binding domain (Arnett2018Structural).

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in NOTCH1 function. O-linked fucosylation, particularly at Thr466, is critical for ligand binding and receptor activation, influencing interactions with ligands like DLL4 and Jagged1 (Arnett2018Structural). Glycosylation by Fringe glycosyltransferases further modulates receptor activity (Kovall2010Mechanistic). The intracellular domain of NOTCH1 includes RAM, ANK, and PEST sequences, which are involved in signal transduction and protein degradation (Kovall2010Mechanistic).

## Function
NOTCH1 is a critical component of the Notch signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, NOTCH1 is involved in neurogenesis, lens development, hematopoiesis, and the maintenance and differentiation of germ cells. It regulates cell fate decisions by promoting self-renewal and differentiation, often through binary lineage decisions (Schwanbeck2015The).

In keratinocytes, NOTCH1 is essential for coordinating the transition between growth arrest and differentiation. It induces the expression of p21 WAF1/Cip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which is crucial for growth suppression and differentiation (Rangarajan2001Notch). NOTCH1 also acts as a tumor suppressor in keratinocytes by regulating ROCK1/2 and MRCKα kinases, preventing oncogenic transformation (Lefort2007Notch1).

In endothelial cells, NOTCH1 functions as a mechanosensor, responding to shear stress from blood flow. It maintains junctional integrity, promotes cell elongation, and suppresses proliferation, contributing to vascular homeostasis and protection against atherosclerosis (Mack2017NOTCH1). NOTCH1 signaling is crucial for maintaining endothelial cell polarity and regulating intracellular calcium dynamics, which are important for cell cycle regulation and cell-cell junction integrity (Mack2017NOTCH1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NOTCH1 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and congenital heart defects. In adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), activating NOTCH1 mutations define a distinct subgroup of patients with poor prognosis and a propensity for bone and liver metastasis. These mutations lead to ligand-independent expression of the NOTCH1 target gene HES1, contributing to a more aggressive disease course (Ferrarotto2017Activating).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), NOTCH1 mutations, especially those affecting the PEST domain, result in impaired degradation and stabilization of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain. This leads to increased signaling, promoting cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. These mutations are associated with poor clinical outcomes and a higher risk of transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Villamor2012NOTCH1; Rosati2018NOTCH1).

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), more than 50% of cases harbor activating NOTCH1 mutations, which are often located in the heterodimerization or PEST domains. These mutations result in constitutive activation of the signaling pathway, contributing to leukemogenesis (Abualhaj2019The).

NOTCH1 mutations are also linked to congenital heart defects, particularly left-sided congenital heart disease (LS-CHD), where they are associated with a high penetrance of cardiovascular malformations (KerstjensFrederikse2016Cardiovascular).

## Interactions
NOTCH1 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell signaling. In T cells, NOTCH1 interacts with components of the T cell signalosome, particularly the CBM complex, which includes CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1. This interaction is essential for NF-κB activation, as NOTCH1 helps in the assembly of the CBM complex by associating with CARMA1 and BCL10. The absence of NOTCH1 disrupts these interactions, leading to reduced NF-κB activity (Shin2014NOTCH1).

NOTCH1 also physically associates with PKCθ in activated T cells, suggesting a cooperative role in T cell activation. This interaction is observed through co-localization and immunoprecipitation studies, indicating that NOTCH1 and PKCθ work together to facilitate T cell signaling (Shin2014NOTCH1).

In the context of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, NOTCH1 interacts with EXT1 and FBXW7. EXT1 modulates NOTCH1 activity by influencing its degradation through FBXW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction affects the levels of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain and its downstream signaling (Daakour2016Systematic).

NOTCH1 also interacts with presenilin 1 (PS1), which is involved in the maturation and processing of the Notch receptor. This interaction is specific and occurs within the cell, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Ray1999Evidence).
