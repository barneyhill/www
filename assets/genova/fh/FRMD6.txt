# FRMD6

## Overview
FRMD6 is a gene that encodes the protein FERM domain containing 6, commonly referred to as Willin. This protein is characterized by the presence of a FERM domain, which is crucial for its role in membrane association and interaction with other proteins and phospholipids (Beck2020FERM; GunnMoore2016Willing). Willin is a multifunctional protein involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, a key regulator of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Lyu2020Expression). It acts as an upstream activator of this pathway, influencing the activity of transcriptional factors like YAP/TAZ, thereby affecting cell morphology and behavior (Kronenberg2020WillinFRMD6). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the nervous system, where it plays a role in cellular architecture and function through interactions with other proteins such as MST kinase and 14-3-3 sigma (Park2024FRMD6). Additionally, FRMD6 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, including cancer and aging-related conditions, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Li2021Linc00887; Park2024FRMD6).

## Structure
The FRMD6 protein, also known as Willin, is characterized by the presence of a FERM domain located at its N-terminus, which is crucial for its function in membrane association and interaction with other proteins and phospholipids (Beck2020FERM; GunnMoore2016Willing). This domain is highly conserved across species, with significant homology to the Drosophila protein Expanded, sharing 60% homology with the Ex FERM domain (GunnMoore2016Willing). The FERM domain enables the protein to fold into a recognizable structure similar to ERM proteins and merlin, despite only having up to 47% homology with these proteins (GunnMoore2016Willing).

FRMD6 is a 622 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 71 kDa (Beck2020FERM). The protein's intracellular distribution is influenced by interactions with growth factors and cell-cell contact, and it is known to co-localize with actin, although no direct binding sequences have been identified (GunnMoore2016Willing). The protein is also involved in the Hippo signaling pathway and actin cytoskeleton dynamics, with its nuclear localization regulated by phosphorylation and association with 14-3-3 proteins (Borkúti2024FERM). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of FRMD6 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The human gene FRMD6 encodes a multifunctional protein known as Willin, which plays a significant role in the Hippo signaling pathway, a critical regulator of cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis (Lyu2020Expression). In healthy human cells, FRMD6 is involved in modulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Borkúti2024FERM). The protein is found in various subcellular locations, including the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and nucleus, indicating its diverse functional roles (Lyu2020Expression).

FRMD6 acts as an upstream activator of the Hippo signaling pathway, influencing the activity of the transcriptional factor YAP/TAZ. This regulation affects cell morphology and behavior, including cell proliferation and migration (Kronenberg2020WillinFRMD6). In the nervous system, FRMD6 is expressed in fibroblasts and Schwann cells, where it activates the Hippo pathway, leading to increased phosphorylation of MST1/2, LATS1/2, and YAP, which prevents TEAD-mediated transcription and suppresses cell proliferation (Lyu2020Expression).

FRMD6 also interacts with c-Met, a growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, in the nuclei of glioblastoma cells, suggesting a role in regulating nuclear calcium signaling and potentially influencing cell growth and differentiation (Borkúti2024FERM).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FRMD6 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and aging-related conditions. In cervical cancer, FRMD6 is a target of miR-454-3p, and its expression is downregulated in cancer cells. The long intergenic noncoding RNA Linc00887 can upregulate FRMD6 by sponging miR-454-3p, thereby activating the Hippo signaling pathway, which inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for FRMD6 in this context (Li2021Linc00887).

In the realm of aging, FRMD6 is identified as a regulator of cellular senescence, a process linked to aging and age-related diseases. It is upregulated in senescent cells and can induce senescence through its interaction with the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for cell cycle regulation and response to mechanical stress, and FRMD6's role in this pathway suggests its involvement in conditions like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where senescent cells accumulate in fibrotic areas (Park2024FRMD6).

FRMD6's expression is also associated with neurodegenerative conditions, as it has been correlated with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment, indicating its broader role in the nervous system (Beck2020FERM).

## Interactions
FRMD6, also known as Willin, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes. It is an upstream activator of the Hippo signaling pathway, interacting directly with MST kinase. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of YAP, a key component of the pathway, thereby influencing cell fate towards senescence (Park2024FRMD6). Co-immunoprecipitation analyses have shown that FRMD6 physically interacts with MST1, as they can pull down each other, and this interaction is enhanced in senescent cells (Park2024FRMD6).

FRMD6 also interacts with 14-3-3 sigma, a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control and apoptosis. This interaction is part of the mechanism by which FRMD6 activates Hippo signaling (Park2024FRMD6). In the context of neuronal differentiation, FRMD6 influences the mechanical phenotype of cells by interacting with proteins like vinculin, which is associated with focal adhesion complexes, and affects the assembly of these complexes (Kronenberg2020WillinFRMD6). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of FRMD6 in regulating cellular architecture and function.
