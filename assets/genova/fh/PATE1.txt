# PATE1

## Overview
PATE1 is a gene that encodes the protein prostate and testis expressed 1, which is primarily expressed in the male reproductive system, particularly in the prostate and testis. The PATE1 protein is characterized by a small, cysteine-rich structure and belongs to the three-fingered protein (TFP)/Ly-6/uPAR domain family, known for its distinctive three-finger structure that facilitates diverse intermolecular interactions (Margalit2012Involvement; Levitin2008PATE). This secreted protein plays a crucial role in sperm maturation and function, particularly in processes such as sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction, which are essential for fertilization (Margalit2012Involvement; Liu2015Aged). PATE1's involvement in sperm-oocyte interaction and its phospholipase activity underscore its importance in reproductive health, with alterations in its expression linked to conditions such as idiopathic asthenozoospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility (Liu2015Aged; Zhang2016Association).

## Structure
The PATE1 gene encodes a protein primarily expressed in the prostate and testis, characterized by a small, cysteine-rich structure. The protein includes a signal peptide at the N-terminus, which is encoded by the first exon, and 10 conserved cysteine residues that form a distinct disulfide bonding pattern typical of the three-fingered protein (TFP)/Ly-6/uPAR domain (Margalit2012Involvement; Levitin2008PATE). This domain is known for its three-finger structure, similar to that found in snake venom neurotoxins, allowing for diverse intermolecular interactions (Loughner2016Organization).

The PATE1 protein is secreted and has been implicated in sperm maturation and function, with a specific localization in the equatorial segment of the sperm head (Margalit2012Involvement). It is part of a family of proteins that may exhibit phospholipase activity, which is crucial for sperm maturation and fertilization processes (Margalit2012Involvement). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by alternative splicing, which can result in different isoforms, although these do not alter the downstream reading frames due to the use of a +1 phase in splicing events (Levitin2008PATE).

## Function
The PATE1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the male reproductive system, particularly in sperm function and fertility. PATE1 is primarily expressed in the testis, epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle, and is associated with sperm maturation and motility (SolerGarcía2005The; Liu2015Aged). The protein is localized in the equatorial segment of the sperm head, suggesting its involvement in sperm-oocyte interaction, including sperm-egg fusion and penetration (Margalit2012Involvement; Liu2015Aged).

PATE1 is believed to contribute to sperm capacitation, a process essential for acquiring the ability to fertilize an egg, and is involved in the acrosome reaction, which is crucial for sperm to penetrate the oocyte (Margalit2012Involvement). The protein exhibits phospholipase activity, which is important for the extensive plasma membrane remodeling that sperm undergo during maturation in the epididymal duct (Zhang2016Association). This activity may influence various cellular processes, including cell signaling and interaction, which are vital for maintaining sperm quality and motility (Liu2015Aged). The decline in PATE1 expression with age is associated with reduced sperm motility, highlighting its role in maintaining reproductive health (Liu2015Aged).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PATE1 gene have been associated with idiopathic asthenozoospermia (AZS), a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility. A significant mutation identified in the PATE1 gene is the 1423G mutation, which results in the substitution of glutamic acid with arginine at the 47th amino acid position (Q47R). This mutation is more prevalent in AZS patients compared to fertile men and is predicted to be 'probably damaging' to the protein's structure and function, potentially affecting sperm development and maturation (Zhang2016Association).

Alterations in PATE1 expression have also been linked to reduced sperm quality in both aged men and young asthenozoospermia patients. Studies have shown that PATE1 levels decline with age, particularly in the epididymis and ejaculated sperm, which may contribute to decreased sperm motility and fertility. This decline in expression is thought to be regulated by epididymal factors and is associated with poor sperm quality in these groups (Liu2015Aged).

The PATE1 protein's role in sperm motility and its potential as a biomarker for diagnosing male infertility highlight its clinical significance in reproductive health (Liu2015Aged).

## Interactions
PATE1 is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its role in reproductive processes. It is primarily expressed in the male genital tract, including the prostate and testis, and is associated with sperm function. PATE1 is localized in the equatorial segment of sperm cells, where it plays a role in sperm-oocyte interaction, particularly in sperm-oolemma fusion and penetration steps of fertilization (Margalit2012Involvement). Antibodies against PATE1 have been shown to reduce sperm penetration of the oolemma, indicating its involvement in these processes (Margalit2012Involvement).

PATE1 may also interact with other proteins in the seminal fluid or with itself, forming aggregates, as suggested by the presence of protein bands greater than the expected molecular weight of PATE1 in Western blots (SolerGarcía2005The). This suggests that PATE1 might be part of multiprotein complexes or engage in transitory interactions that influence sperm motility and function. The protein's role in modulating sperm motility is further supported by studies showing that polymorphisms in the PATE1 gene are a high-risk factor for idiopathic asthenozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility (Manfrevola2021CRISP2).
