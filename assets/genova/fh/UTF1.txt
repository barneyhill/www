# UTF1

## Overview
UTF1, or undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1, is a gene that encodes a chromatin-associated protein crucial for maintaining pluripotency and regulating differentiation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryonic carcinoma cells (ECCs). The UTF1 protein functions as both a transcriptional coactivator and repressor, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression to facilitate proper cell differentiation (Kooistra2009Characterization; Raina2021An). It is characterized by a leucine zipper motif and is rich in proline and basic amino acids, contributing to its high isoelectric point (Okuda1998UTF1). UTF1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with various transcriptional complexes to modulate RNA polymerase II-specific transcription (Fukushima1998Characterization). The protein's role in maintaining a specific chromatin state is essential for pluripotency and differentiation, making it a significant factor in both developmental biology and clinical contexts, such as cancer and fertility (Wu2013Undifferentiated; Raina2021An).

## Structure
The UTF1 protein is characterized by a nucleotide sequence that encodes an open reading frame of 339 amino acids, with a conserved ATG start codon between mouse and human (Okuda1998UTF1). The protein contains a leucine zipper motif at its C terminus, which is involved in subunit oligomerization. This motif includes leucine or valine at the first position and isoleucine or leucine at the fourth position within a seven-residue repeat (Okuda1998UTF1). UTF1 is rich in proline residues and basic amino acids, particularly arginine, resulting in a high isoelectric point of 10.46 (Okuda1998UTF1).

The human UTF1 protein has two conserved domains: CD1, which is responsible for nuclear targeting, and CD2, which is involved in chromatin association and repressor activity (Kooistra2009Characterization). The CD2 domain contains a putative leucine zipper, necessary for transcriptional repression, although mutations in the leucine zipper do not affect repressor activity (Kooistra2009Characterization). UTF1 is also phosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues, including S18, T35, S42, S54, and S245, which may influence its interactions with target proteins or nucleic acids (Hong2015Identification).

## Function
UTF1, or undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1, is a chromatin-associated protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency and regulating differentiation in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryonic carcinoma cells (ECCs). It functions as both a transcriptional coactivator and repressor, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression to facilitate proper cell differentiation (Kooistra2009Characterization; Raina2021An).

UTF1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with transcriptional complexes, including the TBP-containing complex and ATF-2, to modulate RNA polymerase II-specific transcription (Fukushima1998Characterization). The protein contains two conserved domains, CD1 and CD2, which are essential for its function. CD1 is responsible for nuclear targeting, while CD2 is crucial for stable chromatin association and transcriptional repression (Thummer2010Functional; Kooistra2009Characterization).

In pluripotent cells, UTF1 helps maintain a specific chromatin state necessary for pluripotency and differentiation by preventing excessive chromatin decondensation and aberrant gene expression (Raina2021An). It also regulates the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and the establishment of the repressive epigenetic mark H3K27me3, maintaining a balance in the bivalent chromatin state of ESCs (Raina2021An).

## Clinical Significance
The UTF1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases, particularly in cancer and fertility issues. In the context of cancer, UTF1 expression varies significantly across different types. It acts as an oncogene in certain cancers, such as testicular germ cell neoplasms and endometrial cancer, where it is highly expressed. Conversely, it functions as a tumor suppressor in other cancers, such as cervical cancer, where its expression is downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, especially in HPV-positive cell lines. This downregulation is associated with cancer progression, and ectopic expression of UTF1 can inhibit cell proliferation by causing G1 cell cycle arrest through the transactivation of p27 Kip1 (Wu2013Undifferentiated; Chen2021MicroRNA‑148a‑3p).

In terms of fertility, UTF1 is crucial for spermatogenesis, playing a key role in the maintenance and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells. Loss of UTF1 function can lead to reduced sperm count and infertility (Raina2021An). The gene's expression is regulated by factors such as Pten, and alterations in this interaction can result in infertility (Raina2021An). These findings highlight UTF1's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in both cancer and fertility treatments.

## Interactions
UTF1, a transcriptional coactivator, is known for its interactions with several proteins and complexes that play crucial roles in embryonic stem cell function. UTF1 directly interacts with the transcription factor ATF-2, specifically binding to its activation domain (1-109), which is essential for UTF1-mediated transcriptional activation. This interaction is distinct from that of other proteins like E1A 13S, which binds to different domains of ATF-2 (Okuda1998UTF1). UTF1 also associates with the TFIID complex, including the TAF II 70 subunit, although this interaction is less efficient and specific to cells expressing UTF1, such as embryonic carcinoma cells (Okuda1998UTF1).

In addition to these interactions, UTF1 is involved in a regulatory complex with the transcription factors Oct-3/4 and Sox-2. This complex binds to the UTF1 regulatory element, which is crucial for its expression in embryonic stem cells (Nishimoto1999The). UTF1 also interacts with the Myc protein, specifically binding to the basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain of N-Myc, which is important for maintaining embryonic stem cell characteristics (Laskowski2013Myc).

UTF1's role in neurogenesis is modulated by sumoylation, which affects its interaction with the mRNA-decapping enzyme Dcp1a. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional control of bivalent genes during differentiation (CorreaVázquez2020Proteomic).
