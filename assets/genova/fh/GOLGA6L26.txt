# GOLGA6L26

## Overview
GOLGA6L26 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family like 26, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their coiled-coil domains and are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, playing a crucial role in maintaining its structure and function. Golgin A6 family like 26 is involved in vesicle tethering and trafficking processes within the cell, contributing to the proper sorting and modification of proteins and lipids. The specific functions and interactions of golgin A6 family like 26 remain an active area of research, with implications for understanding cellular organization and dynamics. The gene and its encoded protein are of interest due to their potential roles in various cellular pathways and their relevance to certain clinical conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
