# AQP6

## Overview
Aquaporin 6 (AQP6) is a gene that encodes the protein aquaporin 6, a member of the aquaporin family known for its role as a transmembrane channel. Unlike other aquaporins primarily facilitating water transport, aquaporin 6 functions predominantly as an anion channel, with a particular affinity for nitrate ions. It is expressed mainly in the renal collecting ducts, specifically within the acid-secreting intercalated cells, where it plays a crucial role in acid-base homeostasis and urine acidification. The protein's unique ability to conduct ions is modulated by pH levels and specific chemical activators, such as mercuric chloride, which enhance its permeability to water and ions. Structurally, aquaporin 6 forms tetramers, with each monomer comprising six transmembrane alpha-helices and two conserved NPA motifs essential for its function. The protein's interaction with calmodulin and co-localization with H+-ATPase in renal cells further underscores its involvement in renal ion transport and acid secretion (Li2022Abnormal; Kourghi2018Fundamental; Agre2002Aquaporin).

## Structure
Aquaporin 6 (AQP6) is a member of the aquaporin family, characterized by its unique structure and function as both a water and anion channel. AQP6 forms tetramers, with each monomer consisting of six transmembrane alpha-helices and five connecting loops, which create a funnel-shaped vestibule leading to a conduction pore (Kourghi2018Fundamental; Wspalz2024The). The protein contains two conserved NPA (Asn-Pro-Ala) motifs, which are crucial for its function (Kourghi2018Fundamental).

The ion channel properties of AQP6 are influenced by specific amino acid residues located in loop B, an intracellular linker between the second and third transmembrane domains. This loop is associated with the intrasubunit pore, which serves as a pathway for ion transport (Kourghi2018Fundamental; Yool2012Structure). The central pore of the tetramer is also significant for anion permeation, particularly under low pH conditions, where it becomes wetted to facilitate ion passage (Yamamoto2024Molecular).

Mutations in specific residues, such as Asn-60 to Gly, can eliminate anion permeability and enhance water flux, indicating the role of these residues in ion selectivity and permeability (Henderson2022Aquaporin). The structural dynamics of AQP6, including the protonation of histidine residues, contribute to its pH-dependent gating mechanism (Yamamoto2024Molecular).

## Function
Aquaporin 6 (AQP6) is a unique member of the aquaporin family, primarily functioning as an anion-selective channel rather than a traditional water channel. It is predominantly expressed in the renal collecting ducts, specifically in the acid-secreting intercalated cells, where it is associated with intracellular vesicles containing H+-ATPase. This localization suggests a role in acid secretion and regulation of urine acidification (Kourghi2018Fundamental; Agre2002Aquaporin).

AQP6 exhibits minimal water permeability under normal conditions but can be activated by low pH and mercuric chloride, which increases its water permeability and ion conductance. This activation mechanism indicates that AQP6 may play a role in cellular ionic regulation and acid-base balance (Kourghi2018Fundamental; Agre2003Aquaporin). The protein is relatively selective for anions, with a preference for nitrate ions, and its ion currents are activated at low pH, supporting its involvement in acid secretion (Magni2006Proteomic; Agre2002Aquaporin).

AQP6's function in healthy human cells involves facilitating the movement of anions in response to changes in pH levels, contributing to the maintenance of acid-base homeostasis in the kidney (Magni2006Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
AQP6 is primarily expressed in the renal collecting ducts and is involved in regulating acid-base balance rather than water balance. It functions as a pH-regulated anion channel and is colocalized with H+-ATPase in acid-secreting intercalated cells, suggesting a role in promoting urinary acid secretion (Li2022Abnormal; Agre2002Aquaporin). Alterations in AQP6 expression have been observed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where both mRNA and protein levels are significantly lower compared to normal kidney tissues. Despite these changes, there is no significant relationship between AQP6 expression and overall survival or disease-free survival in ccRCC patients, which may be due to its specific histological localization (Li2022Abnormal).

AQP6 expression is also correlated with tumor stages in ccRCC, with levels increasing as the tumor progresses, indicating a potential role in tumor development (Li2022Abnormal). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from AQP6 gene mutations or expression alterations are not detailed in the available literature, and its clinical significance remains under investigation (Kortenoeven2014Renal; Agre2003Aquaporin).

## Interactions
Aquaporin 6 (AQP6) is known to interact with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction involves a canonical CaM-binding motif located at the N-terminus of AQP6, which is crucial for its trafficking to intracellular vesicles. The binding affinities for this interaction are 0.79 ± 0.08 µM for mouse AQP6 and 1.78 ± 0.13 µM for human AQP6 N-terminal peptides. Mutational studies have confirmed the involvement of this motif in the interaction (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight; Roche2017Aquaporin). The interaction with calmodulin may influence the localization and physiological function of AQP6, although the exact role of CaM in AQP6 function is not fully understood (Su2020Aquaporins).

AQP6 is also co-localized with H+-ATPase in intracellular vesicles of acid-secreting intercalated cells in the renal collecting duct. This co-localization suggests a potential role in urinary acid secretion, as AQP6's anion conductance is activated at low pH levels, complementing the function of H+-ATPase (Henderson2022Aquaporin; Kourghi2018Fundamental). These interactions highlight the role of AQP6 in renal ion transport and acid-base regulation.
