# CXCR6

## Overview
The CXCR6 gene encodes the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6, a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various immunological processes. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, which facilitate its role in cell signaling and interaction with its specific ligand, CXCL16. CXCR6 is primarily expressed on immune cells, such as T cells and natural killer cells, where it plays a pivotal role in their migration and adhesion to sites of inflammation or injury. The receptor's interaction with CXCL16 is crucial for immune cell trafficking and has implications in chronic inflammation, atherogenesis, and the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, CXCR6 is associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Mabrouk2022CXCR6; Kim2001BonzoCXCR6; Jin2017CXCR6).

## Structure
The CXCR6 protein is a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by seven transmembrane helices, a common feature of GPCRs (Salve2024Evolutionary). The primary structure of CXCR6 includes a sequence of approximately 342 amino acids, with specific motifs such as DRF, TxP, and NPxxY(x) that are essential for receptor activation (Salve2024Evolutionary). The DRF motif, located in the cytoplasmic region of the third transmembrane helix (H3C), is unique to CXCR6 among chemokine receptors, differing from the more common DRY motif found in other receptors (Koenen2017The; Salve2024Evolutionary).

The secondary structure likely involves alpha-helices that span the cell membrane, typical of transmembrane proteins (Xu2018Genetic). The tertiary structure of CXCR6 involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation that facilitates interaction with G-proteins and other molecules (He2020Evolutionary). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but as a receptor, CXCR6 may form complexes with other proteins or receptors (Xu2018Genetic).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's function and localization, although specific details are not provided in the context (Xu2018Genetic).

## Function
CXCR6, a chemokine receptor, plays a crucial role in the migration and adhesion of immune cells, particularly T cells and natural killer cells. It binds to its ligand CXCL16, facilitating the movement of these cells to sites of inflammation or injury. This interaction is significant in the context of immune responses, as CXCR6 is involved in the recruitment and localization of lymphocytes to target tissues, such as inflamed joints and livers, where it contributes to type 1 inflammation (Kim2001BonzoCXCR6).

CXCR6 is expressed on human plasma cells and is involved in their adhesion to tissues through CXCL16, a transmembrane-type chemokine. This process is unique as it does not require G protein signaling or divalent cations, indicating a distinct mechanism of action (Nakayama2003Cutting). The receptor is also expressed in human gingival fibroblasts, where it plays a role in cell proliferation through the activation of ERK and AKT signaling pathways (Hosokawa2009Human).

In addition to its role in immune cell trafficking, CXCR6 is implicated in atherogenesis, where it mediates the adhesion of cells to atherosclerotic plaques, although its precise role in coronary heart disease remains debated (Petit2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCR6 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In gastric cancer (GC), CXCR6 expression is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to peritumoral tissues. This high expression is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) times. CXCR6 is correlated with lymph node and distant metastasis, larger tumor size, poor differentiation status, and advanced clinical stages (Jin2017CXCR6). The gene promotes tumor metastasis through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to tumor progression (Jin2017CXCR6).

In melanoma, CXCR6 serves as a biomarker for aggressive cancer stem cells. Its expression is linked to a more aggressive subpopulation of melanoma cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are capable of forming tumors more rapidly. CXCR6+ cells result in larger tumor masses in a shorter time, indicating their role in tumor growth and aggressiveness (Taghizadeh2010CXCR6).

The CXCR6 gene is also involved in the persistence of Equine arteritis virus (EAV) in stallions, where the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis is implicated in the pathogenesis of persistent EAV infection, suggesting a role in modulating local immune responses (Carossino2019Equine).

## Interactions
CXCR6, a chemokine receptor, primarily interacts with its ligand CXCL16. This interaction is highly specific, as CXCL16 binds robustly to CXCR6 and not to other chemokine receptors. The binding of CXCL16 to CXCR6 has been confirmed through radiolabeled assays, demonstrating high-affinity binding with an IC50 of 1 nM and approximately 4000 binding sites per transfectant (Wilbanks2001Expression). CXCR6 is involved in mediating cell-cell interactions, particularly in chronic inflammation, by interacting with CXCL16 on activated T cell subsets. This interaction facilitates the migration of effector T cells, such as CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and NK cells in response to CXCL16 (Wilbanks2001Expression).

The CXCR6-CXCL16 axis also plays a role in the tumor microenvironment, where CXCR6 interacts with CXCL16 expressed on dendritic cells, aiding in the positioning and survival of CD8+ T cells and natural killer T cells. This interaction is crucial for the control of tumor proliferation and the differentiation of resident memory T cells (Mabrouk2022CXCR6). Additionally, CXCR6 is involved in the pathogenesis of T-cell alveolitis in sarcoidosis, where it mediates the migration of Th1 and Tc1 cells to sites of inflammation through its interaction with CXCL16 (Agostini2005Role).
