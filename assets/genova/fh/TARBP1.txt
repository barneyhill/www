# TARBP1

## Overview
TARBP1, or TAR (HIV-1) RNA binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in RNA processing and regulation. The protein encoded by TARBP1 is a member of the SPOUT methyltransferase superfamily, characterized by its unique co-factor binding mode and distinct structural fold. It plays a crucial role in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) as a cofactor for Dicer, facilitating the maturation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and contributing to post-transcriptional gene regulation (Ye2018Expression; Sand2011Expression). Additionally, TARBP1 exhibits 2'-O-methyltransferase activity, which is significant in modulating immune responses by inhibiting innate immune activation (Freund20192′Omethylation). The protein's interactions with RNA and other proteins underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in various diseases, including cancer and ADHD (Shi2023The; Weiß2021DNA).

## Structure
The TARBP1 protein, involved in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression, is composed of 1621 amino acids and features a methyltransferase domain at its C-terminus. This domain is part of the SPOUT methyltransferase superfamily, which is known for its unique co-factor binding mode and distinct fold compared to classical AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (Wu2008Crystal). The crystal structure of this domain has been resolved at a high resolution of 1.6 Å, revealing its interaction with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) (Wu2008Crystal).

The primary structure of TARBP1 is defined by its amino acid sequence, which facilitates its role in RNA binding. While specific details on the secondary and tertiary structures are not provided, the presence of the methyltransferase domain suggests a complex three-dimensional conformation necessary for its enzymatic activity. The protein's function can be modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interaction with RNA molecules. Splice variant isoforms of TARBP1 may exist, potentially altering its structural and functional properties, although specific variants are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
TARBP1 (TAR (HIV-1) RNA binding protein 1) is involved in several molecular processes within healthy human cells, primarily related to RNA processing and regulation. It functions as a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where it serves as a cofactor for Dicer, an enzyme crucial for the maturation of microRNAs (miRNAs) from precursor molecules. This role is essential for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, as miRNAs are key regulators of mRNA stability and translation (Ye2018Expression; Sand2011Expression).

TARBP1 is also implicated in the methylation of tRNA, specifically through its 2'-O-methyltransferase activity, which modulates immune responses by inhibiting innate immune activation via endosomal Toll-like receptors. This activity suggests a role in distinguishing self from foreign RNA, contributing to immune tolerance (Freund20192′Omethylation).

In terms of cellular localization, TARBP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins and RNA molecules to influence their stability and translation. Its involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stress (Ye2018Expression).

## Clinical Significance
TARBP1 has been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TARBP1 is overexpressed and functions as a novel oncogene. It plays a critical role in glutamine metabolism by stabilizing specific tRNAs, which supports the translation of the ASCT2 transporter, enhancing glutamine uptake and promoting tumorigenesis. High levels of TARBP1 expression are associated with poor patient prognosis, including worse overall survival and higher recurrence rates post-surgery (Shi2023The).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TARBP1 is also overexpressed and serves as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Its expression correlates with histological grade, clinical stage, and pathological type, suggesting its potential as a molecular biomarker for tumorigenesis (Ye2018Expression).

TARBP1 has been identified as a candidate gene in the study of persistent ADHD in adults. DNA methylation changes in TARBP1 are associated with ADHD symptoms, particularly inattention, and may be influenced by environmental factors such as maternal smoking during pregnancy (Weiß2021DNA).

## Interactions
TARBP1, or TAR (HIV-1) RNA binding protein 1, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in RNA processing and gene expression. TARBP1 is known to bind to the TAR RNA, a regulatory element in the HIV-1 genome, where it competes with RNA polymerase II. This interaction suggests that TARBP1 may play a role in disengaging RNA polymerase II from TAR during transcriptional elongation, which is important for the regulation of HIV replication (Wu2008Crystal).

TARBP1 is also a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where it participates in the loading of short RNAs into the complex and enhances the stability of Dicer-substrate complexes. This role is significant in the microRNA (miRNA) pathway, where TARBP1, along with other proteins such as argonaute-1 (AGO1), argonaute-2 (AGO2), and PACT, contributes to the targeting of specific mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression (Sand2011Expression). The expression levels of TARBP1 have been found to be significantly higher in certain skin cancer samples, indicating its involvement in the dysregulation of the miRNA pathway in cancer (Sand2011Expression).
