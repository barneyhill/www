# BBS12

## Overview
BBS12 is a gene that encodes the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 12 protein, which is a chaperonin-like protein involved in the assembly of the BBSome complex. The BBSome is a multiprotein complex essential for ciliary function, particularly in vesicle trafficking to the ciliary membrane and maintaining ciliary structure. BBS12, along with other chaperonin-like proteins such as BBS6 and BBS10, forms a complex with CCT/TRiC family chaperonins, facilitating the proper assembly of the BBSome. Although BBS12 is not a direct component of the BBSome, it plays a crucial role in mediating interactions within the complex, thereby influencing its stability and function. Mutations in the BBS12 gene are linked to Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by a range of symptoms due to ciliary dysfunction (Seo2010BBS6; ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl).

## Function
BBS12 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the assembly of the BBSome, a complex crucial for ciliary function. BBS12, along with BBS6 and BBS10, forms a complex with CCT/TRiC family chaperonins, which are essential for the proper assembly of the BBSome. This assembly is vital for vesicle trafficking to the ciliary membrane, maintaining ciliary structure and function, and facilitating the transduction of extracellular signals (Seo2010BBS6).

BBS12 interacts with several BBSome subunits, including BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS7, and BBS9, indicating its role in mediating interactions within the BBSome. This interaction is crucial for the stability and association of these subunits, as demonstrated by disrupted BBSome assembly in Bbs6 null mouse tissues (Seo2010BBS6). Although BBS12 is not a component of the BBSome itself, it has a chaperone-like function, potentially regulating protein folding in an ATP-dependent manner (Seo2010BBS6).

The BBSome is involved in ciliogenesis and intracellular transport, and mutations in BBS12 disrupt its interactions, affecting the assembly and function of the BBSome, which is vital for normal cellular processes (Seo2010BBS6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BBS12 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of symptoms due to the dysfunction of primary cilia. BBS12 mutations can lead to retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, cognitive impairment, renal anomalies, and urogenital malformations (Focșa2021A; Simičić2023BardetBiedl). The renal phenotype in BBS is notably variable, with some patients experiencing severe kidney disease, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and structural anomalies like polycystic kidney disease and hydronephrosis (Simičić2023BardetBiedl).

BBS12 is part of a chaperonin-like complex crucial for the assembly of the BBSome, a multiprotein complex essential for ciliary function. Disruption of this complex due to BBS12 mutations can lead to the degradation of BBSome subunits, resulting in the clinical manifestations of BBS (Focșa2021A; ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl). Patients with BBS12 mutations often present with more severe phenotypes and earlier onset of symptoms compared to mutations in other BBS genes (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl). The genetic complexity of BBS, including potential triallelic inheritance and modifier genes, contributes to the variability in clinical presentation (Focșa2021A).

## Interactions
BBS12 is a chaperonin-like protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of the BBSome complex, which is essential for ciliary function. BBS12 interacts with other chaperonin-like proteins, specifically BBS6 and BBS10, to form a multisubunit complex with CCT/TRiC family chaperonins. This complex is vital for the proper assembly of the BBSome, a multiprotein complex involved in vesicle trafficking to the ciliary membrane (Seo2010BBS6).

BBS12 also interacts with several BBSome subunits, including BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS7, and BBS9, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Seo2010BBS6). These interactions are crucial for the stability and assembly of the BBSome complex. Mutations in BBS12 can significantly reduce its interaction with BBS6 and BBS7, although the interaction with BBS10 remains unaffected (Seo2010BBS6).

The chaperonin-like BBS proteins, including BBS12, do not perform direct protein folding but act as intermediates for the binding of the CCT complex to its substrates. BBS12, along with BBS6, is released after the formation of the BBSome core complex (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl).
