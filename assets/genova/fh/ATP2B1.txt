# ATP2B1

## Overview
ATP2B1 is a gene that encodes the protein ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+ transporting 1, commonly referred to as PMCA1. PMCA1 is a transmembrane enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining calcium homeostasis by actively transporting calcium ions out of cells, a process essential for various cellular functions such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and cell signaling (Strehler2001Role; Tempel2007The). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular physiology (Strehler2001Role). PMCA1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple transmembrane domains and regulatory regions that allow for interaction with other proteins and modulation of its activity (Olson1991Localization). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms that adapt to the specific physiological needs of different tissues (Strehler2015The). ATP2B1 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including hypertension and a novel neurodevelopmental malformation syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health (Yap2023Biallelic; Hirawa2013ATP2B1).

## Structure
The ATP2B1 gene encodes the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 1 (PMCA1), a crucial protein for maintaining calcium homeostasis. PMCA1 is a large, complex enzyme with a single polypeptide chain of approximately 135 kDa, consisting of multiple transmembrane domains that form a channel for Ca2+ transport (Olson1991Localization). The protein includes several specific domains: a catalytic domain, an ATP binding site, an aspartyl phosphorylation site, and a unique carboxyterminal regulatory domain. This regulatory domain contains a calmodulin-binding site and sites for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C (Olson1991Localization).

Alternative splicing of ATP2B1 transcripts results in various isoforms, which can lead to significant differences in the regulatory regions of the proteins (Olson1991Localization). These splice variants affect two major regions: the first intracellular loop and the C-terminal tail, influencing the protein's functional properties and interactions with other proteins (Strehler2015The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in modulating PMCA1 activity, although specific effects depend on the isoform and splice variant (Strehler2015The). The diversity of PMCA isoforms is crucial for their tissue-specific expression and regulation (Strehler2015The).

## Function
ATP2B1 encodes the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 1 (PMCA1), a critical enzyme for maintaining calcium homeostasis in human cells. PMCA1 functions by actively transporting calcium ions (Ca2+) out of the cell, utilizing ATP hydrolysis to power this process. This activity is essential for regulating intracellular calcium levels, which is crucial for various cellular functions such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and cell signaling (Strehler2001Role; Tempel2007The).

PMCA1 is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues, indicating its fundamental role in general cellular function. It is considered a 'house-keeping' isoform, necessary for maintaining calcium balance in diverse cell types (Strehler2001Role). The protein is predominantly active in the plasma membrane, where it contributes to both global calcium regulation and localized calcium signaling, particularly in non-excitable cells (Strehler2004Calcium).

The regulation of PMCA1 involves alternative splicing, which generates isoform diversity and allows the protein to adapt to the specific physiological needs of different tissues. This splicing affects key regulatory domains, influencing the protein's interaction with calmodulin and its activation properties (Strehler2001Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATP2B1 gene, which encodes the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 1 (PMCA1), have been linked to several clinical conditions. ATP2B1 is significantly associated with hypertension, as demonstrated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across various populations, including European, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean groups. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATP2B1 correlate with increased blood pressure, and knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of ATP2B1 in vascular smooth muscle cells leads to elevated blood pressure, indicating its role in blood pressure regulation (Hirawa2013ATP2B1).

In addition to hypertension, biallelic variants in ATP2B1 have been implicated in a novel neurodevelopmental malformation syndrome characterized by primary hypoparathyroidism, distinctive craniofacial features, and persistent hypocalcemia. These variants result in decreased cellular calcium extrusion and reduced ATP2B1 protein levels, leading to dysregulated calcium homeostasis and signaling (Yap2023Biallelic).

Research also suggests a potential link between ATP2B1 and coronary artery disease in Chinese populations, although it is unclear if this association is direct or mediated through hypertension (Hirawa2013ATP2B1). Despite these findings, the role of ATP2B1 in hypertension among African Americans and other populations remains to be fully elucidated (Jamshidi2018ATP2B1).

## Interactions
ATP2B1, also known as PMCA1, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its activity and localization. PMCA1 interacts with proteins containing PDZ domains, which are crucial for clustering proteins and targeting them to specific signaling pathways. The b splice variants of PMCAs, including PMCA1b, have a consensus sequence at their C-terminus for recognition by PDZ domains, allowing them to bind with numerous PDZ proteins such as PSD95, PSD93, SAP97, SAP102, and CASK (Strehler2015Plasma). These interactions enable PMCAs to be incorporated into signaling complexes with cell-type specific functions. For instance, PMCA1b interacts with NHERF2 in response to muscarinic G-protein coupled receptor activation (Strehler2015Plasma).

PMCA1 also interacts with other proteins like RASSF1, 14-3-3ε, calcineurin A, syntaxin, and Homer 2, which help fine-tune its activity and integration into signaling complexes (Strehler2015Plasma). The interaction with protein 14-3-3 is particularly notable, as it inhibits certain PMCA isoforms, highlighting isoform-specific interactions (Lopreiato2014The). These interactions suggest a complex regulatory network that modulates PMCA1's activity in response to various cellular signals.
