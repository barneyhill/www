# UQCRH

## Overview
The UQCRH gene encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein, a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, specifically within Complex III. This protein plays a pivotal role in facilitating electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, a process essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. As a mitochondrial protein, UQCRH is integral to maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and overall cellular energy metabolism. It is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart and muscles. The gene's expression and function are crucial for mitochondrial fitness and cardiac health, with its dysregulation implicated in various pathologies, including cancer and cardiac dysfunction (Modena2003UQCRH; Luo2020UQCRH; Spielmann2022Knockout).

## Structure
The UQCRH gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is a component of the cytochrome bc1 complex, also known as Complex III, in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The UQCRH protein is composed of 91 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 10,657.75 Da (Ye2012Molecular; Modena2003UQCRH). Its primary structure includes a poly(Glu) stretch, which is subject to a single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in a Glu20Gly substitution (Modena2003UQCRH).

The secondary structure of UQCRH consists of two α helices connected by two disulfide bridges, contributing to its stability and function within the complex (Park2017The). The protein's isoelectric point is 4.45, indicating its acidic nature (Ye2012Molecular). 

UQCRH is involved in the quaternary structure of Complex III, facilitating the formation of a complex between cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c (Modena2003UQCRH). It is incorporated early in the assembly of Complex III, interacting with other subunits to ensure proper electron transfer (Protasoni2021Mitochondrial). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with higher expression in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart and muscle (Modena2003UQCRH).

## Function
The UQCRH gene encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein, a crucial component of Complex III in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). This protein facilitates the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, a key step in the electron transport cascade that is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in cells (Zhao2020Sphingosine; Spielmann2022Knockout). UQCRH is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential by shunting electrons and pumping protons across the membrane (Luo2020UQCRH).

In healthy human cells, UQCRH is broadly expressed and is particularly important in organs with high-energy demands, such as the heart. Its proper functioning is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial fitness and cardiac contractility (Spielmann2022Knockout). The protein's activity is vital for efficient mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, contributing to processes such as fatty acid, heme, and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, ion homeostasis, and thermogenesis (Spielmann2022Knockout). The absence or impairment of UQCRH can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated blood glucose levels, and cardiac contractile dysfunction, underscoring its essential role in energy metabolism and cardiac health (Spielmann2022Knockout).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the UQCRH gene, which encodes a mitochondrial hinge protein, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma, overexpression of UQCRH is associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, promoting oncogene expression and tumor development. This overexpression is suggested as a potential diagnostic biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma due to its higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional markers like CEA (Gao2016Identification).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), UQCRH downregulation is linked to DNA hypermethylation, which correlates with worse overall survival. This downregulation is associated with the Warburg effect, a metabolic shift that is a hallmark of ccRCC, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for UQCRH (Luo2020UQCRH). The gene's expression is also epigenetically inactivated in some ovarian and breast cancer cell lines, often due to promoter methylation (Modena2003UQCRH).

In a mouse model, knockout of the Uqcrh gene leads to bioenergetic impairment and cardiac contractile dysfunction, highlighting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cardiac health. This model exhibits symptoms such as hyperglycemia and developmental arrest, indicating the gene's importance in energy metabolism (Spielmann2022Knockout).

## Interactions
UQCRH, or ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein, is a component of mitochondrial complex III, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. UQCRH is involved in forming a complex between cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c, facilitating electron transfer within the mitochondria (Modena2003UQCRH). It is part of a module that combines with other protein modules during the assembly of complex III, although specific interactions with other proteins in this context are not detailed (Tucker2013Mutations).

The UQCRH gene is also implicated in cancer, where its expression is often reduced due to promoter methylation, leading to its silencing in certain cancer cell lines, such as ovarian and breast carcinoma lines (Modena2003UQCRH). This epigenetic inactivation suggests that UQCRH may interact with other cellular components involved in tumor suppression and apoptosis regulation. In renal cancer, particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), UQCRH is identified as a tumor suppressor gene, and its expression can be restored with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, enhancing the sensitivity of cancer cells to mTOR inhibitors (Miyakuni2021Genome‐wide). This indicates potential interactions with pathways involved in apoptosis and drug resistance.
