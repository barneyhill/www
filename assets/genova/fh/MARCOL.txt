# MARCOL

## Overview
The MARCOL gene encodes the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure-like protein, commonly referred to as MARCO-like. This protein is a member of the scavenger receptor family, which is characterized by its ability to bind and internalize a wide range of ligands, including modified lipoproteins and pathogens. MARCO-like is a transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed in macrophages, where it plays a crucial role in innate immunity by mediating the phagocytosis of bacteria and other particulate matter. The structural features of MARCO-like, including its collagenous domain, facilitate its function in pathogen recognition and clearance, contributing to the host's defense mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
