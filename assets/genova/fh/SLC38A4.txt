# SLC38A4

## Overview
SLC38A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 38 member 4 (SNAT4), which is a member of the system N/A amino acid transporter family. SNAT4 is a transmembrane protein characterized by ten transmembrane helices and is primarily expressed in the liver and placenta, where it plays a critical role in the transport of neutral amino acids across cell membranes. This transport is essential for maintaining amino acid homeostasis and supporting metabolic processes necessary for growth and development. In the placenta, SNAT4 is involved in the transfer of amino acids from the maternal circulation to the fetus, influencing fetal growth and development. In the liver, it contributes to various metabolic pathways by regulating amino acid levels. The protein's interactions with cellular signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin/MYC axis, highlight its role in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer biology and fetal development (Li2021SLC38A4; Matoba2019Paternal).

## Structure
The SLC38A4 gene encodes the SNAT4 protein, a member of the system N/A amino acid transporter family. SNAT4 is characterized by ten transmembrane helices with both the N and C termini facing the extracellular side, as determined through biochemical and computational methods (Shi2011Membrane). The protein includes a large extracellular loop domain, which contains two N-glycosylation sites at Asn-260 and Asn-264, confirmed by mutagenesis and Western blotting (Shi2011Membrane).

A critical structural feature of SNAT4 is a disulfide bond between cysteine residues Cys-249 and Cys-321, located on the third extracellular loop. This bond is essential for the transport function of SNAT4, although it does not affect the protein's cell surface expression (Padmanabhan2013Identification). The disulfide bond is not at the substrate binding site but may stabilize the protein's three-dimensional structure (Padmanabhan2013Identification).

SNAT4 shares structural homology with the major facilitator superfamily, specifically the APC family, as suggested by molecular modeling using the bacterial AdiC transporter as a template (Shi2011Membrane). This modeling predicts a similar structure with 10 transmembrane helices and consistent membrane orientations of the N and C termini (Shi2011Membrane).

## Function
SLC38A4, also known as SNAT4, is a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter that plays a crucial role in the transport of amino acids across cell membranes. In healthy human cells, SLC38A4 is primarily active in the liver and placenta, where it contributes to amino acid homeostasis and metabolic processes essential for growth and development (Li2021SLC38A4). The protein is involved in the uptake of neutral amino acids, which are vital for cellular proliferation and differentiation, particularly in tissues with high metabolic demands (LI2011Association).

In the placenta, SLC38A4 is part of the system A amino acid transporters, which include SNAT1 and SNAT2. These transporters are responsible for the transfer of neutral, short-side-chain amino acids from the maternal circulation to the fetus, supporting fetal growth and development (Matoba2019Paternal). The expression of SLC38A4 in the placenta is associated with the regulation of fetal birth weight, as it influences the availability of amino acids necessary for fetal development (LI2011Association).

In the liver, SLC38A4 is involved in maintaining amino acid levels, which are crucial for various metabolic pathways. Its expression is developmentally regulated, being more active in adult liver tissues compared to fetal liver tissues (Li2021SLC38A4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC38A4 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In mice, paternal knockout of the Slc38a4 gene leads to placental hypoplasia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), due to impaired amino acid transport and reduced proliferation of chorionic trophoblast cells. This suggests that similar mutations in humans could potentially result in placental dysfunction and fetal growth issues (Matoba2019Paternal).

In humans, polymorphisms in the SLC38A4 gene, such as SNP 292 C > T, have been linked to elevated glucose levels in newborns, indicating a potential role in glucose metabolism. This polymorphism is associated with higher glucose levels in normal weight full-term healthy newborns, suggesting a link to glucose imbalance and possibly predisposing individuals to metabolic conditions later in life (GalavizHernández2021Placental).

Additionally, increased expression of SLC38A4 has been observed in placentas from pregnancies with fetal macrosomia, indicating its role in abnormal fetal growth and development. This suggests that SLC38A4 may influence fetal birth weight and could be implicated in conditions related to abnormal fetal growth (LI2011Association).

## Interactions
SLC38A4, also known as SNAT4, is involved in several interactions that influence its function as an amino acid transporter and its role in cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SLC38A4 interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin/MYC axis, where it plays a tumor suppressive role by modulating this signaling pathway. It upregulates AXIN1, a component of the β-catenin degradation complex, thereby repressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This interaction leads to increased expression of HMGCS2, a mitochondrial ketogenic enzyme with tumor suppressive functions in HCC (Li2021SLC38A4).

In the context of placental development, SLC38A4 is crucial for the transport of amino acids across the placenta, facilitating their transfer to the fetus. It is expressed in trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblast layer II at the maternal-fetal interface, where it supports amino acid transfer to fetal circulation. The absence of SLC38A4 results in reduced amino acid concentrations in fetal blood plasma, highlighting its role in amino acid transport (Matoba2019Paternal). These interactions underscore the importance of SLC38A4 in both cancer biology and fetal development.
