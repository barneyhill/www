# ADAMTS17

## Overview
ADAMTS17 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 17, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family of secreted metalloproteases. This protein is characterized by a complex multi-domain structure, including a catalytic metalloproteinase domain and a disintegrin-like domain, which are crucial for its function in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Kelwick2015The; Karoulias2020The). ADAMTS17 plays a significant role in the assembly and regulation of microfibrils, particularly those containing fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the ECM (Hubmacher2017Unusual). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as O-fucosylation and N-glycosylation, which are vital for its secretion and function (Karoulias2020The; Hubmacher2017Unusual). Mutations in the ADAMTS17 gene are linked to several genetic disorders, including Weill-Marchesani syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Karoulias2020The; Hubmacher2017Unusual).

## Structure
ADAMTS17 is a secreted metalloprotease that is part of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a multi-domain structure. The protein includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, a catalytic metalloproteinase domain, and a disintegrin-like domain, followed by a C-terminal ancillary domain. The ancillary domain contains thrombospondin type 1 sequence repeats (TSRs), a cysteine-rich domain, and a spacer region (Kelwick2015The; Karoulias2020The).

The protein's structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, with ADAMTS17 containing eight cysteine residues in its catalytic and disintegrin-like domains, forming four disulfide bonds. The propeptide has three cysteine residues, with one unpaired cysteine available for intermolecular disulfide-bond formation (Hubmacher2017Unusual). ADAMTS17 can form multimers through these disulfide bonds, contributing to its quaternary structure (Hubmacher2017Unusual).

Post-translational modifications are crucial for ADAMTS17's function. The protein undergoes O-fucosylation and N-glycosylation, which are essential for its secretion. O-fucosylation occurs on the TSRs, and the absence of this modification impairs secretion (Hubmacher2017Unusual). ADAMTS17 also has seven predicted N-glycosylation sites, with five located in the ancillary domain (Hubmacher2017Unusual). These modifications influence the protein's secretion, localization, and function (Karoulias2020The).

## Function
ADAMTS17 is a secreted metalloprotease involved in the assembly and regulation of microfibrils, particularly those containing fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, which are crucial components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Karoulias2020The; Hubmacher2017Unusual). It does not cleave fibrillin isoforms but binds to fibrillin microfibrils, influencing their assembly and function (Hubmacher2017Unusual). ADAMTS17 undergoes autoproteolysis and requires O-fucosylation for its secretion, with its propeptide acting as an intramolecular chaperone (Karoulias2020The; Hubmacher2017Unusual).

In healthy human cells, ADAMTS17 is expressed in various tissues, including the eye, skeleton, lung, skin, and blood vessels, suggesting its role in tissue development and homeostasis (Karoulias2020The; Hubmacher2017Unusual). It is involved in regulating the incorporation of fibrillin-2 into microfibrils, which affects the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, crucial for skeletal growth and development (Oichi2019Adamts17). ADAMTS17's activity in the ECM may also involve interactions with other proteins, contributing to the maturation and biogenesis of the ECM network (Karoulias2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADAMTS17 gene are associated with several genetic conditions, most notably Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) and Weill-Marchesani-like syndrome. In humans, recessive mutations in ADAMTS17 cause a form of WMS characterized by short stature, lens dislocation, myopia, and glaucoma, but typically without joint stiffness, brachydactyly, or cardiac valve disease, which are seen in WMS caused by mutations in ADAMTS10 or FBN1 (Karoulias2020The; Hubmacher2017Unusual). A specific missense variant, p.C1023Y, has been identified as impairing the secretion of ADAMTS17, contributing to the WMS phenotype (Evans2020A).

In dogs, ADAMTS17 mutations lead to primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and isolated ectopia lentis, without skeletal or cardiac anomalies (Oliver2015Two; Hubmacher2017Unusual). The gene is also implicated in primary lens luxation in dogs, highlighting its role in ocular conditions (Oliver2015Two).

ADAMTS17 has been identified as a susceptibility locus for carpal tunnel syndrome and influences body fat distribution, although its individual contributions to these traits are considered small (Karoulias2020The). A common SNP variant, rs2054564, in ADAMTS17 is associated with susceptibility to lumbar spondylosis, suggesting a role in skeletal development (Taniguchi2023A).

## Interactions
ADAMTS17 interacts with fibrillin microfibrils, specifically binding to fibrillin-1 microfibrils and recombinant fibrillin-2, although it does not cleave these fibrillin isotypes in vitro (Karoulias2020The). This interaction suggests a potential role in the maturation or biogenesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) networks, possibly acting as a chaperone to facilitate fibrillin-1 secretion and other ECM proteins (Karoulias2020The). In primary skin fibroblasts from patients with Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) due to ADAMTS17 mutations, there is a reduction in fibronectin and fibrillin-1 secretion and deposition in the ECM, indicating that ADAMTS17 or its autoproteolytic peptides might be involved in ECM network formation (Karoulias2020The).

ADAMTS17 undergoes extensive autoproteolysis at the cell surface or in the ECM, releasing multiple peptides, although the specific role of these peptides in vivo remains to be fully determined (Karoulias2020The). The protein's propeptide may act as a chaperone to facilitate secretion, and its processing by furin is crucial for secretion, although not required for activation (Karoulias2020The). The absence of O-fucosylation on certain thrombospondin type 1 repeat domains results in a lack of secretion of recombinant ADAMTS17, highlighting the importance of posttranslational modifications in its function and secretion (Karoulias2020The).
