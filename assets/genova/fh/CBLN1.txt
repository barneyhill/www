# CBLN1

## Overview
CBLN1 is a gene that encodes the cerebellin 1 precursor protein, a member of the C1q and TNF superfamily, primarily expressed in the brain. The cerebellin 1 precursor is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in synapse formation and maintenance, particularly within the cerebellum. It functions as a synaptic organizer by forming complexes with presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluD2), facilitating synaptic connections crucial for motor coordination and learning (ItoIshida2014The; Matsuda2010Cbln1). The protein's structure includes a C-terminal C1q domain, which forms a trimeric globular domain, and an N-terminal domain that facilitates interactions between trimers, allowing it to form homohexameric or heterohexameric complexes (Zhong2017Cbln1). Beyond its role in the cerebellum, CBLN1 is expressed in other brain regions, suggesting broader functions in the central nervous system (wei2012cbln). Alterations in CBLN1 expression have been linked to neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Krishnan2017Autism; Otsuka2016Roles).

## Structure
The CBLN1 protein, encoded by the CBLN1 gene, is part of the C1q and TNF superfamily and is primarily expressed in the brain. It features a C-terminal C1q domain, which forms a trimeric globular domain, and an N-terminal domain that facilitates interactions between trimers (Zhong2017Cbln1). The crystal structure of CBLN1 has been determined at a resolution of 2.2 Å, revealing a trimeric structure with a 10-stranded jelly-roll fold and an additional alpha helix, which is unique to the Cbln family (Zhong2017Cbln1).

CBLN1 can form homohexameric or heterohexameric complexes, indicating its quaternary structure (Zhong2017Cbln1). The protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be reduced by glycosidase treatment or mutation of specific asparagine residues (Zhong2017Cbln1). The presence of sulfate ions has been shown to significantly increase the thermal stability of CBLN1, suggesting that its stability can be modulated by specific buffer conditions (Zhong2017Cbln1).

The CBLN1 protein also exhibits structural diversity through alternative splicing, resulting in different transcript variants that primarily differ in their 3'-untranslated regions (Kavety1998Characterization).

## Function
Cerebellin 1 precursor (CBLN1) is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a critical role in synapse formation and maintenance, particularly in the cerebellum. It acts as a synaptic organizer by forming tripartite complexes with presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluD2), facilitating the connection between parallel fiber terminals and Purkinje cell spines (ItoIshida2014The; Matsuda2010Cbln1). CBLN1 is predominantly expressed in cerebellar granule cells and is crucial for the integrity of synapses between these cells and Purkinje cells, which are essential for motor coordination and learning (ItoIshida2008Cbln1; Miura2009Cbln1).

CBLN1 is involved in synaptic plasticity by clustering GluD2 at synaptic junctions, which may regulate synaptic plasticity through interactions with intracellular proteins (Matsuda2010Cbln1). It also has a suppressive role in inhibitory synapse formation between Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons, helping to maintain the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs on Purkinje cells (ItoIshida2014The). CBLN1's function extends beyond the cerebellum, as it is expressed in other brain regions, suggesting potential interactions with other receptors and roles in broader central nervous system functions (wei2012cbln).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CBLN1 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders. CBLN1 is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as genome-wide association studies have linked the CBLN1 gene to an increased risk of ASD. Copy number variations in the GRID2 gene, which encodes the CBLN1 receptor GluD2, have also been reported in ASD patients (Otsuka2016Roles). Increased expression of the UBE3A gene, which represses CBLN1, has been shown to impair sociability in mouse models, suggesting a role for CBLN1 in social behavior deficits associated with autism. This repression is particularly significant in patients with comorbid seizures, where restoring CBLN1 expression can improve sociability (Krishnan2017Autism).

In addition to its role in autism, CBLN1 is involved in cognitive functions such as fear conditioning and memory. Mice lacking CBLN1 exhibit impairments in fear memory acquisition and retention, indicating its importance in cognitive processes beyond motor coordination (Otsuka2016Roles). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CBLN1 in both motor and non-motor functions, with potential implications for understanding and treating related neurological disorders.

## Interactions
CBLN1 interacts with several proteins to form complexes crucial for synaptic organization. It binds to neurexins (Nrxns) and the orphan glutamate receptor GluD2, forming a tripartite complex that acts as a synaptic organizer. This complex is essential for synapse formation and maintenance, particularly in the cerebellum, and does not require extracellular calcium for binding (Yuzaki2011Cbln1). CBLN1 specifically interacts with certain isoforms of Nrxns that contain the S4 insert, such as NRX1b(S4+), NRX2b(S4+), and NRX3b(S4+) (Yuzaki2011Cbln1).

CBLN1 forms hexameric complexes composed of a dimer of trimers, with the C1q domain mediating trimer assembly. These hexamers act as bivalent ligands in a trans-synaptic complex, bridging presynaptic Nrxns in granule neurons to postsynaptic Grid2 in Purkinje neurons (Rong2018Glycosylation). The N-terminal region of CBLN1 is involved in Nrxn binding, while Grid2 binding is largely mediated by the C1q domain (Rong2018Glycosylation).

CBLN1 can also form heteromeric complexes with CBLN4, which bind to both Nrxn3β and DCC, although these interactions are weaker than those of the respective homomeric complexes (wei2012cbln). The subunit composition of these complexes influences their binding specificity to receptors in distinct signaling pathways (wei2012cbln).
