# SOAT1

## Overview
Sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme sterol O-acyltransferase 1, a critical component in cholesterol metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a multitransmembrane protein and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum. SOAT1 catalyzes the conversion of free cholesterol and fatty acyl-CoA into cholesteryl esters, facilitating cholesterol storage and maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Hai2021AcylCoenzyme; Chang2009Acylcoenzyme). The enzyme's activity is essential for the formation of lipid droplets and the assembly of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), impacting lipid metabolism at both cellular and systemic levels (Chang2009Acylcoenzyme). SOAT1's function and interactions are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cardiovascular health, cancer progression, and ocular conditions (Zhu2021SOAT1; Butovich2021Depletion; Abuzhalihan2019SOAT1).

## Structure
The human sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) protein is a multitransmembrane enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum, playing a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism. The primary structure of SOAT1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form nine transmembrane domains (TMDs), with the active site His 460 located at the luminal half of the M7 domain (Guan2020Structural). The secondary structure includes alpha helices, such as the amphipathic αA helix and cytosolic helices αC, αD, and αE, which cap the transmembrane helices (Guan2020Structural).

The tertiary structure of SOAT1 features a funnel-shaped central cavity formed by six transmembrane helices, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Guan2020Inhibition). The quaternary structure of SOAT1 is a tetramer composed of a dimer of dimers, with a molecular weight of approximately 260 kDa. The N-terminal domain is responsible for tetramerization, and its deletion results in a predominantly dimeric form (Guan2020Structural; Guan2020Inhibition).

SOAT1 contains an intra-membrane tunnel between transmembrane domains M4 and M5, which may serve as a pathway for hydrophobic molecules (Guan2020Structural). The enzyme's structure is significant for understanding its catalytic mechanism and for designing inhibitors targeting human diseases (Guan2020Structural).

## Function
Sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in cholesterol metabolism by catalyzing the formation of cholesteryl esters from free cholesterol and fatty acyl-CoA. This enzymatic activity is essential for cholesterol storage and regulation within cells, contributing to the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis (Hai2021AcylCoenzyme; Chang2009Acylcoenzyme). SOAT1 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is embedded in the membrane and characterized by multiple transmembrane domains (Hai2021AcylCoenzyme; Chang2009Acylcoenzyme).

In healthy human cells, SOAT1 facilitates the conversion of free cholesterol into cholesteryl esters, which are then stored in lipid droplets. This process is crucial for the formation of lipid droplets and the assembly of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), impacting cellular lipid metabolism and overall organismal lipid balance (Chang2009Acylcoenzyme). The enzyme's activity is influenced by the binding of free cholesterol, which acts as a potent substrate and activator, and it is expressed in various tissues, including the adrenal glands and macrophages (Hai2021AcylCoenzyme; Chang2009Acylcoenzyme).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SOAT1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In coronary heart disease (CHD), lower methylation levels of the SOAT1 gene are associated with an increased risk, suggesting that epigenetic changes in SOAT1 may influence cardiovascular health (Abuzhalihan2019SOAT1). In Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1), the SOAT1 rs1044925 polymorphism is associated with a more severe phenotype, characterized by earlier neurological onset and increased severity of symptoms such as liver disease and seizures (Farhat2024Sterol).

In gastric cancer, SOAT1 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues and is linked to poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and lymph node metastasis. Inhibition of SOAT1 can suppress cancer cell proliferation and lymphangiogenesis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2021SOAT1). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), certain SOAT1 genetic variants are associated with reduced risk, while high SOAT1 expression correlates with more aggressive tumor characteristics and shorter survival in specific populations (Chen2021Impacts).

In ocular health, alterations in the SOAT1 gene can lead to Meibomian gland dysfunction-like symptoms, affecting lipid homeostasis in the eye and potentially contributing to conditions such as dry eye and blepharitis (Butovich2021Depletion).

## Interactions
Sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cholesterol metabolism. SOAT1 functions as a dimer, with its activity significantly dependent on the dimeric structure. Mutations at the dimer interface, such as T140R and A147F, disrupt dimer formation and reduce enzyme activity, highlighting the importance of these interactions for SOAT1's function (Guan2020Structural).

In glioma, SOAT1 is part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes 50 binding proteins identified through the STRING database. Co-expression analysis in glioma revealed that SOAT1 expression is positively correlated with genes such as MOB1A, CMTM6, MFSD1, LHFPL2, and LIMS1, and negatively correlated with genes like MT-RNR1, MT-RNR2, MT-CO2, ARHGDIG, and RUNDC3A. These interactions suggest a role for SOAT1 in the regulatory mechanisms of glioma (Guo2022Comprehensive).

SOAT1 also interacts with proteins involved in lipid metabolism, such as SREBP2 and LDLR, which are related to cholesterol regulation and tumor metastasis. These interactions are significant in the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma, where SOAT1 influences the expression of various EMT markers (Fu2024SOAT1).
