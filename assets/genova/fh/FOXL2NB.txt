# FOXL2NB

## Overview
FOXL2NB is a gene that encodes the FOXL2 neighbor protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. The FOXL2 neighbor protein is categorized as a nuclear protein and is implicated in the regulation of gene expression. It is located in close proximity to the FOXL2 gene on the chromosome, which suggests potential regulatory interactions or shared pathways between these genes. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of action of the FOXL2 neighbor protein remain under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in cellular differentiation and development. Mutations or dysregulation of FOXL2NB may have clinical significance, particularly in relation to disorders associated with the FOXL2 gene (Qiu2020aarFDC).
