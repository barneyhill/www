# SLC5A11

## Overview
SLC5A11 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 5 member 11, a sodium-dependent transporter primarily involved in the cotransport of Na+ and myo-inositol across cell membranes. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family, specifically functioning as a transmembrane transporter. It plays a critical role in maintaining inositol homeostasis, which is essential for cellular signaling and osmotic balance. SLC5A11 is expressed in various human tissues and has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including immune system regulation and neurological health. Alterations in its expression have been associated with conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, systemic lupus erythematosus, and diabetic neuropathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Wright2013Glucose; Tsai2007The; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

## Function
SLC5A11, also known as SMIT2, is a member of the sodium-dependent glucose transporter family, primarily functioning as a Na+/myo-inositol cotransporter. It is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues and is involved in the transport of inositols, but not glucose, across cell membranes (Wright2013Glucose; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). This transporter plays a crucial role in maintaining inositol homeostasis, which is important for cellular signaling and osmotic balance in healthy human cells (Wright2013Glucose).

SLC5A11 is suggested to interact with immune-related genes, potentially functioning as an autoimmune modifier gene, indicating a role in immune system regulation (Wright2013Glucose; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). Its expression has been linked to psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, suggesting that alterations in its expression in specific brain regions may contribute to the symptoms of these diseases (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

In experimental models, changes in the expression pattern of SLC5A11 have been observed in the sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC5A11 gene, also known as SMIT2, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role as a sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter. Alterations in the expression of SLC5A11 have been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where it acts as an autoimmune modifier gene. Specific polymorphisms in SLC5A11 have been linked to SLE symptoms such as serositis, low C4 levels, and alopecia, suggesting its involvement in modifying immune responses and potentially inducing apoptosis through pathways involving TNF-a and PDCD1 (Tsai2007The).

In the context of hyperglycemia, SLC5A11 expression is downregulated, which may contribute to aggravated brain injury following cardiac arrest. This downregulation suggests a role in neuroprotection, as the gene is involved in maintaining intracellular glycemic levels (Lindblom2018Hyperglycemia). Additionally, SLC5A11 has been linked to metabolic acidosis, where its expression decreases, indicating a potential role in renal adaptation to acidotic conditions (Nowik2008Genomewide).

SLC5A11 is also associated with neurological conditions such as the syndrome of infantile convulsions and paroxysmal dyskinesia (ICCA syndrome) and benign familial infantile convulsions, highlighting its significance in neurological health (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).
