# EFEMP2

## Overview
EFEMP2, also known as the gene encoding EGF containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 2, is a critical component in the structural and functional integrity of the extracellular matrix. The protein product, fibulin-4, is a calcium-binding glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in elastogenesis and the formation of elastic fibers, essential for the proper function of connective tissues (Sasaki2016Functional; Tsuda2018Extracellular). Fibulin-4 is characterized by its tandem array of calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules and a fibulin-type C-terminal domain, which facilitate its interactions with other matrix components such as elastin, fibrillin-1, and collagen IV (Sasaki2016Functional). These interactions are crucial for maintaining tissue elasticity and integrity, and disruptions in EFEMP2 can lead to connective tissue disorders and influence cancer progression (Shen2023EFEMP2; Huang2020EFEMP2). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 1B and its potential role as a biomarker in various cancers (Yao2012Identification; Thomas2021Case).

## Structure
EFEMP2, also known as fibulin-4, is a 60 kDa calcium-binding glycoprotein involved in the development and integrity of extracellular matrices. It is characterized by a tandem array of calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules and a fibulin-type C-terminal domain (Sasaki2016Functional; Tsuda2018Extracellular). The protein interacts with elastin, fibrillin-1, collagen IV, and lysyl oxidases, playing a role in elastogenesis and cross-link formation (Sasaki2016Functional).

Fibulin-4 has two potential N-glycosylation sites at positions 198 and 394, with the A397T mutation introducing additional O-glycosylation (Sasaki2016Functional). The glycosylation sites carry mostly complex-type glycans with truncated antennae (Sasaki2016Functional). The protein's structure is maintained by calcium-binding sites and cysteine residues, which are crucial for its stability and function (Sasaki2016Functional).

Mutations in EFEMP2 can lead to structural instability and enhanced protease susceptibility, affecting its function in the extracellular matrix (Sasaki2016Functional). These mutations can impact the protein's secretion, stability, and assembly into extracellular fibers, influencing its interactions with other matrix components (Sasaki2016Functional).

## Function
EFEMP2, also known as fibulin-4, is a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and elasticity of the extracellular matrix. It is involved in the formation and maintenance of elastic fibers, which are crucial for the proper function of connective tissues. EFEMP2 is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to processes such as tissue repair and vascular development (Huang2020EFEMP2; Yao2012Identification).

The protein contains four EGF2 domains and six calcium-binding EGF2 domains, which are important for its interactions with cellular membrane receptors. These interactions allow EFEMP2 to mediate signaling pathways that regulate cell behaviors, including morphology, growth, adhesion, and motility (Huang2020EFEMP2). By influencing these cellular processes, EFEMP2 plays a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and remodeling, as well as in embryonic development and organogenesis (Yao2012Identification).

In healthy human cells, EFEMP2's function is critical for the maintenance of tissue structure and function, contributing to processes like cell adhesion and motility. Its dysfunction can lead to connective tissue disorders, highlighting its importance in normal physiological conditions (Yao2012Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EFEMP2 gene, also known as fibulin-4, are associated with autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 1B (ARCL 1B), a rare genetic disorder characterized by loose skin and severe vascular abnormalities, including thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and vascular tortuosity. These mutations lead to deficiencies in fibulin-4, affecting elastic fiber assembly and smooth muscle cell differentiation, which are crucial for maintaining vascular integrity and elasticity. The condition often results in early childhood mortality due to severe aortopathy (Thomas2021Case).

Alterations in EFEMP2 expression levels have been implicated in various cancers. In glioma, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), EFEMP2 is overexpressed and correlates with more malignant phenotypes and poor patient outcomes. It is associated with classical genetic alterations in glioma and influences the tumor immune microenvironment by affecting macrophage behavior (Huang2020EFEMP2). In ovarian cancer, EFEMP2 upregulates PD-L1 expression via the EGFR/ERK1/2/c-Jun signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Its expression is linked to low differentiation and advanced clinical stages (Shen2023EFEMP2). EFEMP2 is also considered a potential biomarker for colorectal cancer, with significant expression differences observed between cancerous and normal tissues (Yao2012Identification).

## Interactions
EFEMP2, also known as fibulin-4, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its role in cancer progression. EFEMP2 has been shown to physically interact with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, demonstrating that EFEMP2 can bind to EGFR. The binding of EFEMP2 to EGFR activates the ERK1/2/c-Jun signaling pathway, which regulates the expression of PD-L1, a protein involved in immune escape by cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for promoting the invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells (Shen2023EFEMP2).

The study by Shen et al. highlights that EFEMP2's interaction with EGFR is a key mechanism in ovarian cancer progression, as it leads to the upregulation of PD-L1 expression. This interaction is significant because it influences the invasion and migration of ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that targeting EFEMP2 could be a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit the invasion and metastasis of these cells (Shen2023EFEMP2). The interaction between EFEMP2 and PD-L1 is emphasized as a key factor in the progression of ovarian cancer, with PD-L1 being essential for EFEMP2 to promote cancer cell invasion both in vitro and in vivo (Shen2023EFEMP2).
