# BRINP1

## Overview
BRINP1, or Bone Morphogenetic Protein/Retinoic Acid Inducible Neural Specific 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed in the nervous system and is involved in neural differentiation and development. The BRINP1 protein is characterized by a MACPF domain, a putative Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding domain, and a cysteine-rich region, suggesting its role as a soluble secretory protein involved in protein-protein interactions (Kawano2004Identification; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). Functionally, BRINP1 is crucial for regulating cell cycle progression in post-mitotic neuronal cells, thereby maintaining proper neuronal function and development (Toshiyuki2004Molecular; Kawano2004Identification). Its expression is tightly regulated and is implicated in synaptic plasticity, potentially influencing learning and memory (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental; Berkowicz2016Brinp1). Alterations in the BRINP1 gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in brain development and function (PolFuster2021The).

## Structure
The BRINP1 protein is part of the BRINP family, which includes BRINP2 and BRINP3. These proteins are characterized by a cleavable signal sequence followed by a MACPF domain, which spans approximately one-third of the protein (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). The MACPF domain is similar to those found in complement and immune system proteins, although its specific function in BRINP1 is unknown (Kawano2004Identification). Following the MACPF domain, BRINP1 contains a putative Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding domain, and the remainder of the protein is cysteine-rich with no obvious domain structure (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental).

BRINP1 lacks a transmembrane domain, suggesting it is a soluble secretory protein (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). It also contains a predicted coiled-coil domain, which may facilitate protein-protein interactions and potential dimerization (Kawano2004Identification). The protein is subject to N-glycosylation, as indicated by the presence of several potential N-glycosylation sites conserved among BRINP family members (Kawano2004Identification). Despite these insights, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of BRINP1, as well as information on splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
BRINP1, a member of the Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) protein superfamily, is primarily expressed in the nervous system and plays a significant role in neural differentiation and development. It is involved in regulating cell cycle progression, particularly by suppressing the transition from the G1 to S phase in post-mitotic neuronal cells, which is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal function and development (Toshiyuki2004Molecular; Kawano2004Identification). BRINP1 is expressed in various brain regions, including the neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum, from mid-embryonic development through adulthood, indicating its involvement in neurogenesis and neuronal maturation (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental; Berkowicz2016Brinp1).

The protein is suggested to function in the secretory/endolysosomal system, potentially being released from cells, and is implicated in synaptic plasticity, which may influence learning and memory (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental; Berkowicz2016Brinp1). BRINP1's expression is regulated by neural activity and is upregulated during processes such as song learning in birds, highlighting its role in activity-dependent neural plasticity (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). The gene's expression is tightly controlled by transcriptional mechanisms, including DNA methylation and neuron-restrictive silencing elements, ensuring its neural-specific expression (Toshiyuki2004Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BRINP1 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. BRINP1 is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as evidenced by BRINP1 knock-out mice exhibiting autism-like behaviors, hyperactivity, and increased density of parvalbumin-positive cortical interneurons (Berkowicz2016Brinp1). These findings suggest that BRINP1 plays a crucial role in normal brain development and function, and its dysfunction may contribute to the pathology of these disorders.

BRINP1 has also been implicated in major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Genome-wide association studies have linked variations in BRINP1, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs), to these conditions (PolFuster2021The). The gene's involvement in neurogenesis and cell cycle regulation may underlie its association with these disorders, as BRINP1 knock-out mice show altered hippocampal neurogenesis and behaviors that model major mental disorders (PolFuster2021The).

Additionally, BRINP1 is located at chromosome locus 9q33.1, a region associated with psychiatric disorders, suggesting its potential role in the genetic architecture of these conditions (PolFuster2021The).
