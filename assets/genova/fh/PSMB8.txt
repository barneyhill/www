# PSMB8

## Overview
The PSMB8 gene encodes the proteasome 20S subunit beta 8 (β5i), a critical component of the immunoproteasome, which is a specialized form of the proteasome complex. This protein is categorized as a protease, specifically involved in the proteolytic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating immune responses. The β5i subunit is inducible by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and plays a pivotal role in antigen processing for presentation by MHC class I molecules, thereby contributing to immune surveillance (Liu2012Mutations; Agarwal2010PSMB8). Mutations in PSMB8 are associated with several autoinflammatory disorders, underscoring its importance in immune regulation and cellular stress responses (Brehm2015Additive; Arimochi2016Dysfunctional).

## Structure
The PSMB8 gene encodes the β5i subunit of the immunoproteasome, which is a component of the 20S proteasome complex. The primary structure of PSMB8 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the β5i subunit, which is crucial for the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity (Agarwal2010PSMB8). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the subunit's stability and function within the proteasome complex (Nandi1997Intermediates).

The tertiary structure of PSMB8 is characterized by a compact, three-dimensional shape that is essential for its proteolytic function. A mutation at position 75, from threonine to methionine (p.Thr75Met), disrupts the tertiary structure, affecting the distance between catalytic residues and reducing proteasomal activity (Agarwal2010PSMB8). This mutation highlights the importance of the conserved threonine residue in maintaining the structural integrity of the β5i subunit.

In terms of quaternary structure, PSMB8 is incorporated into the 20S proteasome, which consists of four axially stacked heptameric rings. The β5i subunit, along with other inducible subunits, replaces standard subunits in the immunoproteasome, enhancing its ability to process antigens for MHC class I presentation (Nandi1997Intermediates; Agarwal2010PSMB8).

## Function
The PSMB8 gene encodes the β5i subunit of the immunoproteasome, a specialized form of the proteasome complex involved in protein degradation and antigen processing. In healthy human cells, the immunoproteasome plays a critical role in the proteolytic processing of proteins to generate peptides that are presented by MHC class I molecules, which is essential for immune surveillance and the regulation of immune responses (Liu2012Mutations; Agarwal2010PSMB8). The β5i subunit, encoded by PSMB8, is inducible by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells, although it can be induced in other cell types under inflammatory conditions (Kitamura2011A; Agarwal2010PSMB8).

The immunoproteasome, including the β5i subunit, is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by degrading ubiquitinated proteins, thus preventing the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins that could lead to cellular stress (Liu2012Mutations; Kitamura2011A). This process is crucial for the regulation of inflammatory responses and the modulation of cytokine production, as the immunoproteasome influences the activity of signaling pathways such as NF-κB (krishnan2021Proteasome). The β5i subunit's activity is vital for the efficient production of antigenic peptides, which are necessary for the immune system to recognize and respond to pathogens (Arima2011Proteasome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PSMB8 gene, which encodes the β5i subunit of the immunoproteasome, are linked to several autoinflammatory disorders. These include Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome (NNS), chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) syndrome, and joint contractures, muscle atrophy, microcytic anemia, and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy (JMP) syndrome (Brehm2015Additive; Arimochi2016Dysfunctional). 

In CANDLE syndrome, mutations in PSMB8 lead to proteasome dysfunction, resulting in increased production of type I interferons (IFNs) and chronic inflammation (Brehm2015Additive; Liu2012Mutations). This condition is characterized by symptoms such as recurrent fever, skin rashes, and lipodystrophy (Liu2012Mutations). 

NNS is caused by mutations that disrupt the β-sheet structure of the β5i subunit, leading to reduced proteasome activity and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, which trigger inflammatory responses (Arima2011Proteasome). Symptoms include periodic fever, skin rash, and joint contractures (Jia2020A). 

JMP syndrome is associated with a homozygous missense mutation in PSMB8, resulting in reduced chymotrypsin-like proteasomal activity and symptoms such as joint contractures and muscle atrophy (Agarwal2010PSMB8). These conditions highlight the critical role of PSMB8 in maintaining immune homeostasis and its impact when mutated.

## Interactions
PSMB8, also known as the proteasome 20S subunit beta 8, is a component of the immunoproteasome and participates in several protein interactions. It is involved in the formation of the 20S core complex of the proteasome, interacting with other proteasome subunits to facilitate protein degradation and antigen processing. PSMB8 has been shown to interact with the dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a key regulator of mitochondrial fission. This interaction enhances the degradation of Drp1, thereby reducing mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, which is particularly relevant in the context of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (Li2024Psmb8).

In the context of viral infections, PSMB8 interacts with the capsid protein of the nervous necrosis virus (NNV) in the sevenband grouper. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunocolocalization techniques, indicating a role in modulating immune responses during viral infection by interfering with NF-κB signaling (krishnan2021Proteasome). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PSMB8 in both cellular stress responses and immune regulation.
