# CTSD

## Overview
The CTSD gene encodes cathepsin D, a lysosomal aspartic protease that plays a pivotal role in cellular protein degradation and homeostasis. As a protease, cathepsin D is involved in the breakdown of proteins within the lysosome, contributing to processes such as autophagy and apoptosis. The enzyme is synthesized as an inactive precursor, pro-cathepsin D, which undergoes proteolytic cleavage to become active. Cathepsin D is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with significant functions in the brain, where it is crucial for the degradation of neuronal proteins. Dysregulation or mutations in the CTSD gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Mijanovic2021Cathepsin; Vidoni2016The).

## Structure
Cathepsin D (CTSD) is a lysosomal aspartic protease characterized by a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure is composed of a single polypeptide chain that undergoes post-translational modifications, notably glycosylation, which is crucial for its stability and function. The secondary structure of CTSD includes both alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function.

In terms of tertiary structure, CTSD adopts a bilobed shape with a deep active site cleft, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This cleft allows the enzyme to interact with and degrade substrate proteins effectively. The quaternary structure of CTSD is that of a homodimer, meaning it functions as a pair of identical subunits. This dimerization is important for its biological activity.

CTSD also contains a propeptide domain, which is cleaved to activate the enzyme. This cleavage is a critical step in the maturation and activation of the enzyme, allowing it to perform its role in protein degradation within the lysosome. The structural features of CTSD, including its post-translational modifications and domain organization, are integral to its function as a protease.

## Function
Cathepsin D (CTSD) is a lysosomal aspartic protease that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in protein degradation. In healthy human cells, CTSD is synthesized as an inactive precursor, pro-cathepsin D, which is processed into its active form within the lysosome. This active form is essential for the digestion of protein aggregates and the turnover of organelles, contributing to cellular proteostasis (Mijanovic2021Cathepsin).

CTSD is involved in several cellular processes, including apoptosis, where it can cleave and activate pro-apoptotic molecules, leading to the release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases (Di2020Autophagy). It also plays a role in autophagy by facilitating the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes, which is crucial for the degradation of damaged proteins and organelles (Mijanovic2021Cathepsin).

CTSD is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and is particularly important in the brain, where it is involved in the proteolysis of altered neuronal proteins. Its deficiency can lead to neurodegenerative disorders due to the accumulation of undigested substrates and protein aggregates (Mijanovic2021Cathepsin; Hossain2020Restoration).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTSD gene, which encodes the lysosomal protease cathepsin D, are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, mutations in CTSD are linked to Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis type 10 (NCL10), a severe lysosomal storage disorder characterized by early onset and rapid progression, leading to symptoms such as epileptic seizures and early death. These mutations result in decreased proteolytic activity and reduced enzyme levels, causing severe neurodegeneration, including microcephaly and neuronal loss (Vidoni2016The; Ketterer2017Inherited). 

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), CTSD is implicated in the processing of amyloid precursor protein and tau protein. Elevated levels of cathepsin D have been observed in AD patients, particularly in the hippocampus, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Vidoni2016The). The A38V polymorphism in CTSD has been studied for its potential link to sporadic AD, with mixed results regarding its impact on amyloid-beta and tau protein levels (Vidoni2016The).

Alterations in CTSD expression or function can also affect lysosomal homeostasis and protein degradation, contributing to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions (Bunk2021Cathepsin; Marques2019Enzyme).

## Interactions
Cathepsin D (CTSD) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes such as apoptosis and autophagy. CTSD interacts with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bid, facilitating its cleavage and activation. This interaction is crucial for the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as it leads to the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, which are key components of the apoptosis signaling cascade (Heinrich2004Cathepsin). CTSD's interaction with Bid occurs in endosomal compartments, where CTSD translocates to the cytosol to exert its proteolytic activity (Heinrich2004Cathepsin).

CTSD also interacts with proteins involved in the mTORC1 signaling pathway. In CTSD-deficient cells, the localization of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface is impaired, affecting cellular growth and autophagy processes (Ketterer2020Cathepsin). Additionally, CTSD is linked to the regulation of cytoskeletal proteins and signaling pathways in the brain, such as MAPK and integrin signaling, through interactions with proteins like MAP2, MAPT, and the 14-3-3 complex (Koch2013Cathepsin). These interactions highlight CTSD's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential impact on disease processes.
