# ARL4D

## Overview
ARL4D is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor-like GTPase 4D, which is a member of the ARF family of small GTPases. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and microtubule dynamics. ARL4D plays a critical role in cell migration and motility by recruiting cytohesin-2/ARNO to the plasma membrane, which subsequently activates ARF6, leading to actin stress fiber disassembly (Li2007ARL4D). Additionally, ARL4D interacts with the microtubule plus-end tracking protein EB1, facilitating microtubule nucleation and stabilization at the centrosome (Lin2020Arl4DEB1). The protein's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as N-terminal myristoylation, which aids in its membrane localization (Li2007ARL4D). ARL4D also has implications in immune responses, as it negatively regulates Akt phosphorylation in T lymphocytes, affecting IL-2 production and T cell activation (Tolksdorf2018The).

## Structure
ARL4D is a member of the ARF-like (ARL) family of small GTP-binding proteins, characterized by a GTPase domain crucial for its function. The primary structure of ARL4D consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the ARL4D gene, with specific motifs and domains that facilitate its interactions with other proteins. Notably, ARL4D contains an SxLP motif, which is essential for its interaction with the EB1 protein, a microtubule plus-end tracking protein (Lin2020Arl4DEB1).

The secondary structure of ARL4D includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of GTPase proteins, although specific details on these elements are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is characterized by the presence of a GTPase domain, which is involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, facilitating the protein's role in intracellular trafficking and signaling (Li2007ARL4D).

Post-translational modifications of ARL4D include N-terminal myristoylation, which aids in its membrane association and localization at the plasma membrane (Li2007ARL4D). The protein may also have splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context provided. The quaternary structure of ARL4D is not described in the available information.

## Function
ARL4D is a member of the ARF family of small GTPases, playing a significant role in various cellular processes, including actin remodeling and microtubule dynamics. In healthy human cells, ARL4D is involved in the modulation of actin cytoskeleton organization by recruiting cytohesin-2/ARNO to the plasma membrane, which activates ARF6. This activation leads to the disassembly of actin stress fibers, facilitating cell migration and motility (Li2007ARL4D). ARL4D's interaction with cytohesin-2/ARNO is GTP-dependent and crucial for its localization at the plasma membrane (Li2007ARL4D).

ARL4D also plays a role in microtubule regrowth and centrosomal function by interacting with EB1, a microtubule plus-end binding protein. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of EB1 to the centrosome, promoting microtubule nucleation and stabilization (Lin2020Arl4DEB1). The absence of ARL4D results in reduced centrosomal recruitment of EB1 and decreased microtubule nucleation, indicating its importance in maintaining proper microtubule dynamics (Lin2020Arl4DEB1).

In T lymphocytes, ARL4D negatively regulates Akt phosphorylation, affecting IL-2 production and T cell activation. ARL4D deficiency leads to increased IL-2 secretion and enhanced effector T cell responses during viral infections (Tolksdorf2018The).

## Interactions
ARL4D interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the microtubule plus-end tracking protein EB1 in a GTP-dependent manner, which is crucial for the recruitment of EB1 to the centrosome and the regulation of microtubule nucleation. This interaction is dependent on the C-terminal EBH region of EB1 and partially on an SxLP motif of ARL4D. Disruption of the ARL4D-EB1 interaction leads to defects in microtubule regrowth and reduced centrosomal localization of EB1 (Lin2020Arl4DEB1).

ARL4D also interacts with cytohesin-2/ARNO, a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for ARF6, in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction involves the C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) and polybasic C domains of ARNO. ARL4D recruits ARNO to the plasma membrane, where ARNO activates ARF6, leading to actin cytoskeleton reorganization and enhanced cell migration. This interaction is crucial for ARL4D's role in modulating actin remodeling (Li2007ARL4D).

These interactions highlight ARL4D's role in microtubule dynamics and actin cytoskeleton organization, influencing cellular morphology and motility.
