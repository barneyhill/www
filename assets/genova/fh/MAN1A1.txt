# MAN1A1

## Overview
The MAN1A1 gene encodes the enzyme mannosidase alpha class 1A member 1, which is a crucial component of the glycosylation pathway, specifically involved in the processing of N-linked glycans. This enzyme is categorized as a glycosidase and operates within the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the trimming of mannose residues from glycoproteins. This enzymatic activity is essential for the maturation of N-glycans, which in turn is critical for proper protein folding and quality control within the cell (Phoomak2018OGlcNAcylation). The protein's function is integral to various cellular processes, including cell-cell communication, protein stability, and immune response, by ensuring that glycoproteins achieve their correct conformation and function. Alterations in the expression of MAN1A1 have been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Hamester2019Prognostic; Legler2018Reduced).

## Structure


## Function
MAN1A1 encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the N-glycosylation pathway, specifically in the processing of N-linked glycans. This enzyme functions in the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in the trimming of mannose residues from glycoproteins. This trimming is a crucial step in the maturation of N-glycans, which is essential for proper protein folding and quality control within the cell (Phoomak2018OGlcNAcylation). The activity of MAN1A1 affects various cellular processes, including cell-cell communication, protein stability, and immune response, by ensuring that glycoproteins achieve their correct conformation and function (Phoomak2018OGlcNAcylation).

In healthy human cells, the proper functioning of MAN1A1 is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating normal physiological processes. The enzyme's role in glycan processing is integral to the regulation of cell adhesion and signaling pathways, which are important for tissue development and immune system function (Phoomak2018OGlcNAcylation). While the specific function of MAN1A1 in healthy cells is not extensively detailed in the provided context, its involvement in glycosylation underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Phoomak2018OGlcNAcylation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAN1A1 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, high expression of MAN1A1 is associated with shorter recurrence-free survival, advanced cancer stages, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis, indicating an unfavorable prognostic role. This is potentially due to its impact on tumor cell aggregation and the glycosylation of adhesion molecules like ALCAM, which are crucial for cancer progression (Hamester2019Prognostic).

In contrast, in breast cancer, reduced expression of MAN1A1 correlates with poor prognosis, including shorter disease-free intervals and associations with nodal status, grading, and brain metastasis. MAN1A1 is suggested to have a tumor-suppressor function in breast cancer, as high expression is linked to longer recurrence-free and overall survival. The gene's role in glycosylation affects the prognostic relevance of adhesion molecules such as ALCAM and CD24, influencing tumor cell adhesion and metastasis (Legler2018Reduced).

Additionally, reduced expression of MAN1A1 is associated with an oligomannose-rich glycophenotype in certain cancers, such as non-melanoma basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and colorectal cancer, promoting a pro-tumorigenic environment (Chatterjee2021Oligomannosylation).
