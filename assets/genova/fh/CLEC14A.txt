# CLEC14A

## Overview
CLEC14A is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain containing 14A protein, a type I transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in endothelial cells. This protein is a member of the C-type lectin domain superfamily and plays a significant role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, processes critical for vascular development and maintenance. The protein's structure includes a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), which is essential for its function in cell adhesion and interaction with other proteins such as Multimerin-2 (MMRN2) and heparan sulfate. CLEC14A is involved in modulating signaling pathways through its interactions with vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, particularly VEGFR-3, thereby influencing vascular stability and integrity. Its expression and interactions are implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Khan2017Multimerin2; Rho2011Clec14a; Lee2016Carbohydratebinding).

## Structure
CLEC14A is a type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the C-type lectin domain superfamily. It features an extracellular domain that includes a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), a series of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and a sushi-like domain (Rho2011Clec14a; Ki2013Human). The CTLD is crucial for its function in cell adhesion and angiogenesis, and it is involved in binding interactions with Multimerin-2 (MMRN2) and heparan sulfate (Khan2017Multimerin2; Sandoval2020Proteomicsbased).

The molecular structure of CLEC14A includes a 'loop in a loop' configuration within the CTLD, which contains a hydrophobic core and six canonical cysteine residues that likely form disulfide bonds, typical of CTLDs (Khan2017Multimerin2). Two non-canonical cysteines, C103 and C138, are essential for MMRN2 binding (Khan2017Multimerin2). CLEC14A can form dimers or trimers, with molecular masses of 35.4 kDa and 87.1 kDa for its isoforms CLEC14A-290 and CLEC14A-325, respectively (Sandoval2020Proteomicsbased).

CLEC14A also has a heparin-binding site, characterized by a positively charged surface patch in the CTLD, with key residues such as R141, K158, R161, and R165 (Sandoval2020Proteomicsbased). This site is important for its interaction with heparan sulfate, which stabilizes the protein against denaturation (Sandoval2020Proteomicsbased).

## Function
CLEC14A is a type I transmembrane protein specifically expressed in endothelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. It is involved in cell-to-cell adhesion, primarily through its C-type lectin domain, which is essential for its localization at cell junctions and for mediating cell aggregation (Rho2011Clec14a). CLEC14A interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor receptors VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, modulating their signaling pathways, which are vital for vascular development and stability (Lee2016Carbohydratebinding). The protein's interaction with VEGFR-3, but not VEGFR-2, is mediated through its cytosolic domain, indicating a specific regulatory role in maintaining vascular integrity (Lee2016Carbohydratebinding).

CLEC14A is also a heparin-binding protein, with its lectin domain accommodating heparin oligosaccharides, which enhances its thermal stability and suggests a role in cellular processes involving heparan sulfate interactions (Sandoval2020Proteomicsbased). The protein is localized at the vascular intercellular boundary, contributing to the formation of a well-organized vascular network, essential for healthy vascular function (Lee2016Carbohydratebinding). Its expression is upregulated during endothelial progenitor cell differentiation, highlighting its importance in endothelial cell development and function (Lee2016Carbohydratebinding).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC14A is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), hypermethylation of the CLEC14A promoter leads to its downregulation, which is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as reduced apoptosis. This suggests that CLEC14A acts as an antitumor agent, and targeting its methylation could be a potential therapeutic strategy (Su2018Methylation).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CLEC14A is upregulated, correlating with tumor size and differentiation, indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker. Knockdown of CLEC14A in HCC cells results in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in tumor growth (Yan2022CLEC14A).

CLEC14A is also involved in angiogenesis, with its expression being higher in tumor vasculature compared to normal tissue. It interacts with multimerin-2 (MMRN2), and disrupting this interaction can retard angiogenesis and tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a target for anti-angiogenic therapies (Khan2017Multimerin2). Additionally, CLEC14A is regulated by ACVRL1, and its expression is crucial for endothelial cell fate and tumor angiogenesis, making it a potential biomarker for ALK1-driven tumor angiogenesis (Bocci2018Activin).

## Interactions
CLEC14A, a member of the C-type lectin domain family, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in angiogenesis and endothelial cell function. It interacts with Multimerin-2 (MMRN2) through its C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), specifically binding to the region 530-624 of MMRN2. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of angiogenesis and is dependent on specific cysteine residues within the CTLD of CLEC14A (Khan2017Multimerin2). 

CLEC14A also forms a complex with VEGFR-3, influencing VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 signaling pathways during angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. This interaction occurs through the cytosolic domain of CLEC14A and is essential for maintaining vascular homeostasis (Lee2016Carbohydratebinding). 

In addition to MMRN2 and VEGFR-3, CLEC14A interacts with CD93, another protein with a CTLD, sharing a similar binding region on MMRN2. These interactions suggest a complex network at the endothelial-pericyte interface, with CLEC14A, CD93, and CD248 binding to distinct but overlapping regions of MMRN2 (Khan2017Multimerin2). 

These interactions highlight CLEC14A's role in modulating angiogenic processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in angiogenesis-related disorders.
