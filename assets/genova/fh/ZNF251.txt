# ZNF251

## Overview
ZNF251 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 251, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein functions by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby modulating the expression of target genes. ZNF251 is located on human chromosome 8q24.3 and is highly conserved across several mammalian species, underscoring its essential role in cellular processes (Lorenz2010The). The protein is characterized by a KRAB domain, which facilitates transcriptional repression through interactions with TRIM28, leading to a repressive chromatin state (Lorenz2010The). ZNF251 is notably expressed in the fetal brain and testis, suggesting significant roles in neurogenesis and spermatogenesis (Lorenz2010The). Additionally, ZNF251 is implicated in the homologous recombination repair pathway, influencing RAD51 activity, which is crucial for DNA double-strand break repair (Li2022ZNF251haploinsufficiency). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes and its expression profile highlight its potential significance in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Structure


## Function
ZNF251 is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. These proteins typically function by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby modulating the expression of target genes. ZNF251 is part of a gene cluster located on human chromosome 8q24.3, which is highly conserved across several mammalian species, indicating essential functions in cellular processes (Lorenz2010The).

The expression of ZNF251 is notably strong in the fetal brain and testis, suggesting important roles in these tissues, potentially influencing morphogenetic processes such as neurogenesis and spermatogenesis (Lorenz2010The). The gene is grouped into the 'cerebellum group' based on its expression profile, indicating a potentially prominent role in the cerebellum (Lorenz2010The).

ZNF251 contains a KRAB domain, which is known to mediate transcriptional repression by interacting with TRIM28, leading to a repressive chromatin state. This repression is sequence-specific, although the exact number of target genes regulated by ZNF251 remains unresolved (Lorenz2010The). The protein's DNA-binding domain is highly conserved, suggesting a role in specific nucleic acid interactions in human cells (Lorenz2010The).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF251 has been implicated in several cancers due to its role in activating the ERK signaling pathway. In lung cancer, particularly non-small-cell lung cancer, ZNF251 expression is elevated in cancerous tissues compared to noncancerous ones. This overexpression is associated with the progression of the disease, as it promotes cell growth and colony formation, especially in cells with mutant Kras. The gene's involvement in ERK signaling suggests it could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in lung cancer (Zhong2020ZNF251).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF251 is highly expressed and linked to poor prognosis. It promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment that facilitates tumor progression. High ZNF251 expression correlates with regulatory T cell infiltration and the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines, which may lead to CD8+ T cell exhaustion. These findings suggest ZNF251 as a novel prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in HCC (Zhang2023ZNF251).

ZNF251 haploinsufficiency has been associated with resistance to PARP inhibitors in BRCA1-mutated breast and ovarian cancer cells. This resistance is linked to enhanced homologous recombination repair, highlighting the gene's role in influencing treatment outcomes (Li2022ZNF251haploinsufficiency).

## Interactions
ZNF251 is involved in transcriptional regulation through its interactions with nucleic acids and other proteins. It is part of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is known for its role in transcriptional repression. ZNF251 interacts with TRIM28, a corepressor that recruits chromatin-modifying complexes to establish a repressive chromatin state, suggesting that ZNF251 may contribute to transcriptional regulation by binding to specific DNA sequences (Lorenz2010The). 

The protein is also implicated in the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway, particularly influencing RAD51 activity, which is crucial for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This interaction is significant in the context of BRCA1-mutated cancer cells, where ZNF251 haploinsufficiency leads to resistance to PARP inhibitors by activating HR repair through RAD51-mediated mechanisms (Li2022ZNF251haploinsufficiency). 

While specific interactions of ZNF251 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, its role in transcriptional repression and DNA repair pathways highlights its importance in cellular processes related to gene expression and genomic stability (Lorenz2010The; Li2022ZNF251haploinsufficiency).
