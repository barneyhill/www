# SLC29A2

## Overview
The SLC29A2 gene encodes the protein known as equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2), which is a member of the solute carrier family. ENT2 is a transmembrane protein that facilitates the bidirectional transport of nucleosides and nucleobases across cell membranes, playing a critical role in maintaining nucleoside homeostasis and regulating intracellular nucleotide pools. This transporter is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, and is particularly important in tissues with high nucleoside demands, such as the brain and bone marrow (Naes2020Equilibrative). ENT2 is involved in the uptake of nucleoside analogues used in antiviral and anticancer therapies, influencing drug disposition and resistance (Naes2020Equilibrative). The protein's structure includes 11 transmembrane domains and is subject to post-translational modifications that affect its function and stability (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters). SLC29A2 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Chen2010Overlapping).

## Structure
The SLC29A2 gene encodes the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2), which is involved in the facilitative diffusion of nucleosides across cell membranes. ENT2 is composed of 456 amino acid residues and shares 46% sequence identity with ENT1 (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters). The protein structure includes 11 transmembrane domains (TMDs), with an intracellular amino terminus and an extracellular carboxyl terminus, which are characteristic of its secondary and tertiary structures (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters). 

ENT2 has two N-glycosylation sites at Asn48 and Asn57, which are crucial for its targeting to the plasma membrane, indicating post-translational modifications that influence its function and stability (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters). The region between TMD3 and TMD6 is responsible for sensitivity to inhibitors such as NBTI, dipyridamole, and dilazep, while TMDs 1 and 6 are involved in deoxynucleoside recognition, and TMDs 5 and 6 determine nucleobase recognition (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters). 

Splice variants of ENT2 have been identified, including non-functional proteins hHNP36 and hENT2A, which may result in different functional properties (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters). These structural features are essential for the protein's role in nucleoside transport and its pharmacological interactions.

## Function
The SLC29A2 gene encodes the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2), a bidirectional transporter involved in the transport of nucleosides and nucleobases across cell membranes. ENT2 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and digestive system, and is primarily localized at the basolateral side of polarized epithelial cells (PastorAnglada2015Nucleoside; Naes2020Equilibrative). It plays a crucial role in maintaining nucleoside homeostasis by facilitating the uptake of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleobases, such as hypoxanthine, cytosine, adenine, uracil, guanine, and thymine (Naes2020Equilibrative).

ENT2 is involved in the regulation of intracellular nucleotide pools, which are essential for DNA replication and cellular metabolism (Naes2020Equilibrative). It also plays a significant role in the uptake of nucleoside analogues used in antiviral and anticancer therapies, influencing drug disposition and resistance (Naes2020Equilibrative). ENT2's activity is particularly important in tissues with high demands for nucleosides, such as the brain and bone marrow, where it supports nucleotide synthesis through the salvage pathway (Naes2020Equilibrative). The transporter also regulates adenosine levels, affecting cellular signaling and physiological processes like muscle exercise and inflammation (Naes2020Equilibrative).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC29A2 gene, also known as ENT2, has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SLC29A2 is aberrantly up-regulated in a subset of tumors, which is associated with vascular invasion, a key predictor of tumor recurrence and poor outcomes. This up-regulation may contribute to cancer genome instability by altering cellular nucleotide synthesis and nucleotide pool balance, providing growth advantages to tumors (Chen2010Overlapping). The gene is located at the 11q13.2 amplicon and is identified as a candidate cancer gene due to its high amplification signals in multiple HCC cell lines. Overexpression of SLC29A2 is linked to advanced stages, metastasis, and poor survival in HCC patients. Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing SLC29A2 expression decreases cell proliferation and colony-forming capability, indicating its role in tumorigenesis (Chen2010Overlapping).

SLC29A2 has also been identified as an optimized survival predictor for mantle cell lymphoma, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker in other cancers as well (Chen2010Overlapping). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC29A2 in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
SLC29A2, also known as equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2), is involved in the transport of nucleosides across cell membranes. It has been shown to interact with adenosine kinase (ADK), a key enzyme in the phosphorylation of thiopurine metabolites. This interaction is significant as both ENT2 and ADK are involved in regulating adenosine levels, which are crucial for immunoregulatory processes (Haglund2017Combination).

In network analyses, SLC29A2 has been identified to interact with genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility loci. These interactions are linked to biological processes such as B-cell proliferation and purine nucleotide biosynthesis (Haglund2017Combination). The STRING tool analysis in another study identified SLC29A2 as having the highest interaction score with SLC29A3 among the first shell interactors, suggesting a strong interaction between these two proteins (Rezaie2024A).

While SLC29A2 mRNA levels were found to increase in response to TLR7/8 activation, this did not significantly alter the accumulation of certain antiviral drugs, indicating that other factors may influence its transport activity (Pfeifer2018Regulation).
