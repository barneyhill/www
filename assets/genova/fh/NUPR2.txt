# NUPR2

## Overview
NUPR2 is a gene that encodes the nuclear protein 2, a transcriptional regulator involved in various cellular processes. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a critical role in regulating gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors and DNA elements. As a transcriptional regulator, nuclear protein 2 is implicated in the modulation of cellular responses to stress and may influence cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The precise mechanisms by which NUPR2 exerts its regulatory functions are still under investigation, but its involvement in critical cellular pathways suggests it may have significant implications in both normal physiology and disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
