# IL6R

## Overview
The IL6R gene encodes the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the effects of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6R is integral to the regulation of immune responses, inflammation, and hematopoiesis. The receptor exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the latter facilitating IL-6 signaling in cells that do not express the membrane-bound receptor, a process known as trans-signaling (RoseJohn2020Interleukin6). The IL-6R forms a complex with IL-6 and the signal-transducing component gp130, which is essential for activating intracellular signaling pathways such as the JAK/STAT pathway (Wolf2014Interleukin6). Variants and mutations in the IL6R gene have been implicated in various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in inflammatory and cardiovascular conditions (Ferreira2013Functional).

## Structure
The IL-6 receptor (IL6R) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune response by binding to the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). The human IL6R is encoded by a cDNA that translates into a protein of 468 amino acids, which includes a signal peptide, an extracellular region, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain (Varghese2002Structure). The mature form of IL6R is an 80-kDa glycosylated protein derived from a 50-kDa precursor (Varghese2002Structure).

The extracellular region of IL6R is modular, consisting of three domains: D1, D2, and D3. The D1 domain is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, while D2 and D3 are homologous to cytokine-binding domains, featuring fibronectin type III domains (Varghese2002Structure). The D3 domain is particularly important for IL-6 binding, contributing significantly to the binding energy (Hecht2006The). The WSXWS sequence motif, a signature of cytokine binding modules, is located in the D3 domain (Hecht2006The).

The IL6R can exist in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the soluble form enhancing IL-6 activity (Varghese2002Structure). The receptor forms a complex with IL-6 and the signal-transducing component gp130, which is essential for signal transduction (Scheller2006Interleukin6). The structure of the IL6R has been solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, providing insights into its biochemistry and biology (Hecht2006The).

## Function
The interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) is a critical component in the signaling pathway of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), which plays a significant role in immune response, inflammation, and hematopoiesis. IL-6R is expressed on a limited number of cell types, including hepatocytes and certain leukocytes such as monocytes, macrophages, B cells, and subtypes of T cells (Wolf2014Interleukin6). The receptor functions by binding IL-6, forming a complex that associates with the signal-transducing molecule gp130, which is ubiquitously expressed on all cells. This interaction initiates intracellular signaling pathways, primarily the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, among others (RoseJohn2020Interleukin6).

IL-6R can exist in a membrane-bound form or as a soluble form (sIL-6R), which allows IL-6 to signal in cells lacking the membrane-bound receptor through a process known as trans-signaling. This mechanism enables IL-6 to exert its effects on a wide range of cells, given the universal expression of gp130 (RoseJohn2020Interleukin6). The classic signaling pathway, mediated by membrane-bound IL-6R, is associated with anti-inflammatory and regenerative roles, such as liver regeneration and bone metabolism (RoseJohn2020Interleukin6). In contrast, trans-signaling is often linked to pro-inflammatory responses and is implicated in various pathological conditions (Wolf2014Interleukin6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL6R gene are associated with a range of diseases and conditions, primarily due to its role in inflammatory and immune responses. Variants in the IL6R gene, such as rs2228145 (Asp358Ala), have been linked to both protective and risk effects in various diseases. The 358Ala allele is associated with protection against coronary heart disease (CHD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atrial fibrillation (AF), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), but increases susceptibility to asthma (Ferreira2013Functional). This variant affects IL-6 signaling by increasing soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) levels, which can impair classical IL-6 receptor signaling (Ferreira2013Functional).

Loss-of-function mutations in IL6R can lead to immunodeficiency, atopy, and abnormal inflammatory responses. Patients with such mutations may experience recurrent infections, elevated IgE levels, and atopic dermatitis, indicating a novel primary immunodeficiency (Spencer2019Loss). These mutations disrupt normal IL-6 signaling, affecting immune cell function and leading to conditions such as eczema and eosinophilia (Chen2021Inborn). The IL6R gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its clinical significance in both inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
The interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) is involved in several critical interactions essential for its function in immune response and inflammation. IL-6R initially binds to interleukin-6 (IL-6) to form a low-affinity complex, which subsequently associates with the signal-transducing component gp130 to create a high-affinity, functional hexameric receptor complex. This complex consists of two IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130 hetero-trimers, which are crucial for signal transduction and activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Horsten1997Molecular; Varghese2002Structure).

The extracellular region of IL-6R is modular, comprising three domains: D1, D2, and D3. The D2 and D3 domains are homologous to cytokine-binding domains and are involved in the binding of IL-6, with the potential binding site located at the junction of these domains (Varghese2002Structure). Specific residues in these domains are critical for IL-6 binding and subsequent signaling through gp130 (Varghese2002Structure).

Soluble forms of IL-6R (sIL-6R) can also interact with IL-6, forming a complex that associates with soluble gp130 (sgp130) to facilitate IL-6 activity, unlike other soluble cytokine receptors that typically inhibit activity (Varghese2002Structure). These interactions highlight the versatile role of IL-6R in modulating immune responses.
