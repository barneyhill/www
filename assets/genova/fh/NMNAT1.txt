# NMNAT1

## Overview
NMNAT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a crucial coenzyme in cellular metabolism. This enzyme is primarily localized in the nucleus and is involved in various nuclear processes, including DNA repair and gene expression regulation. NMNAT1 is characterized as a transferase, specifically catalyzing the conversion of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and ATP to NAD+ and pyrophosphate. The protein's structure includes a classical α/β-dinucleotide binding domain and a Rossmann fold, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. NMNAT1 is also implicated in neuroprotection, as it can delay neuronal degeneration and inhibit protein aggregation. Mutations in the NMNAT1 gene are linked to several clinical conditions, including Leber congenital amaurosis and SHILCA syndrome, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular and retinal health (Greenwald2021Mutant; Berger2005Subcellular; Song2013The).

## Structure
The NMNAT1 protein is a crucial enzyme in NAD+ biosynthesis, characterized by a well-defined molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of 279 amino acids, encoded by the NMNAT1 gene, with a molecular mass of approximately 31,900 Da (Magni2004Structure). The secondary structure of NMNAT1 includes six β-strands and nine α-helices, forming a classical α/β-dinucleotide binding domain. This domain features a strongly twisted six-stranded parallel open β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Magni2004Structure).

The tertiary structure of NMNAT1 is globular, with a Rossmann fold that is crucial for binding NAD+ (Lau2010Isoformspecific). The quaternary structure of NMNAT1 is described as a hexameric assembly, which can be viewed as a 'trimer-of-dimers' (Magni2004Structure). There is evidence of a hexamer-dimer equilibrium in solution, with some data suggesting a tetrameric organization (Magni2004Structure).

NMNAT1 contains conserved ATP-recognition motifs and a nuclear localization signal, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation (Magni2004Structure; Lau2010Isoformspecific). The enzyme also has a potential Asn-linked glycosylation site (Magni2004Structure). These structural features are instrumental in its function and regulation within the cell.

## Function
NMNAT1 (nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1) is a crucial enzyme in the NAD+ biosynthetic pathway, primarily active in the nucleus of human cells. It catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and ATP to NAD+ and pyrophosphate, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular NAD+ levels, which are essential for various nuclear processes, including DNA repair and gene expression regulation (Berger2005Subcellular; Cambronne2020Location).

In healthy human cells, NMNAT1 is involved in regulating ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription by interacting with nucleomethylin (NML) and being recruited into a complex with the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SirT1. This interaction stimulates SirT1's deacetylase function, which is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to DNA damage (Song2013The). NMNAT1 also plays a protective role in neuronal cells by delaying degeneration and inhibiting protein aggregation, independent of its role in NAD+ synthesis (Song2013The).

The enzyme's activity is linked to the regulation of critical cellular events through NAD-dependent protein modifications, such as mono-ADP-ribosylation, poly-ADP-ribosylation, and protein deacetylation, which are vital for processes like replication, telomere maintenance, and apoptosis (Berger2005Subcellular). NMNAT1's function is essential for maintaining NAD+ homeostasis and protecting against axonal damage, as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit axon degeneration via blockade of SARM1-mediated NAD+ depletion (Sasaki2016NMNAT1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NMNAT1 gene are associated with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a severe retinal dystrophy characterized by early-onset vision loss. NMNAT1 mutations lead to impaired NAD+ biosynthesis, which is crucial for maintaining retinal cell function. Specific mutations, such as p.Val9Met, p.Arg66Trp, and p.Arg237Cys, have been identified as reducing NMNAT1's enzymatic activity, contributing to the retinal degeneration observed in LCA patients (Greenwald2021Mutant; Falk2012NMNAT1).

In addition to LCA, NMNAT1 mutations are implicated in SHILCA syndrome, a condition that includes symptoms such as spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia, sensorineural hearing loss, intellectual disability, and retinal degeneration. This syndrome is linked to structural variants in NMNAT1, such as tandem duplications, which lead to aberrant mRNA production and reduced enzymatic activity (Bedoni2020An; AbadMorales2021New).

The retinal-specific pathology of NMNAT1-related conditions may be due to the unique metabolic demands and susceptibility to oxidative stress of photoreceptor cells. Despite the widespread expression of NMNAT1, its mutations predominantly affect the retina, possibly due to the retina's high metabolic activity and specific NAD+ metabolism requirements (Greenwald2021Mutant; Sasaki2015Characterization).

## Interactions
NMNAT1 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It is known to co-purify with nucleomethylin (NML), a nucleolar protein that inhibits ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription by recruiting SirT1 to rDNA repeats. This interaction is part of the energy-dependent nucleolar silencing complex (eNoSC), which regulates rRNA transcription, particularly under glucose deprivation conditions (Song2013The). NMNAT1 also interacts with SirT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, enhancing its function by locally producing NAD+ and stimulating SirT1-mediated deacetylation reactions, which are crucial for regulating p53 acetylation (Song2013The).

NMNAT1 has been shown to interact with PARP1, a protein involved in DNA repair processes. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation within NMNAT1's isoform-specific targeting and interaction domain (ISTID) region, which includes a nuclear localization signal (Lau2010Isoformspecific). NMNAT1 also participates in protein-protein interactions with RNA-binding proteins and ribosomal components, such as RPL30, RPL11, and RPL22, which are important for ribosome assembly and protein translation (OrtizJoya2019Proteinprotein). These interactions highlight NMNAT1's role in cellular stress responses and its potential involvement in neuroprotection.
