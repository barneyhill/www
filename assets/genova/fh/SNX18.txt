# SNX18

## Overview
SNX18, or sorting nexin 18, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including endocytosis, autophagy, and macropinocytosis. The protein, characterized by its PX-BAR domain, functions as a membrane tubulator, facilitating membrane curvature and remodeling. It is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and associated with endosomal membranes, where it plays a critical role in vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. SNX18's interactions with proteins such as Dynamin-2 and N-WASP are essential for its function in cellular processes like autophagosome biogenesis and the internalization of pathogens like Salmonella Typhimurium (Liebl2017SopBMediated; Håberg2008SNX18; Søreng2018SNX).

## Structure
SNX18 is a protein characterized by the presence of a PX-BAR superdomain, which plays a crucial role in its function as a membrane tubulator in endosomal trafficking. The PX domain of SNX18 binds preferentially to phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), which aids in targeting the protein to specific membrane regions (Håberg2008SNX18; van2010SNX–BAR). The BAR domain, a dimerization motif, forms a rigid, banana-shaped structure that interacts with the phospholipid bilayer, facilitating membrane curvature and deformation (Hanley2020Sorting; van2010SNX–BAR).

SNX18 also contains an SH3 domain at its N-terminus, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, notably binding to the proline-rich domain of dynamin 2 (Håberg2008SNX18; van2010SNX–BAR). This interaction is essential for SNX18's role in membrane remodeling and scission (Håberg2008SNX18).

The protein does not form intrafamily heterodimers with other SNX9-family members, indicating distinct functional roles (Håberg2008SNX18). SNX18 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has splice variant isoforms that may influence its function.

## Function
SNX18 (sorting nexin 18) is a protein involved in several key cellular processes, including autophagy, endocytosis, and macropinocytosis. In autophagy, SNX18 plays a crucial role by regulating the trafficking of ATG9A from recycling endosomes, which is essential for autophagosome biogenesis. It recruits Dynamin-2 to facilitate the formation of autophagosome precursor membranes, thereby promoting the delivery of proteins and membranes necessary for phagophore expansion (Søreng2018SNX).

SNX18 is also involved in macropinocytosis, where it acts as a scaffold protein. It coordinates the recruitment of proteins such as N-WASP and Dynamin, which are critical for the formation of macropinosomes. This process is important for nutrient uptake and cellular signaling (Qi2024The).

In terms of cellular localization, SNX18 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and associated with endosomal membranes. It is involved in membrane remodeling and tubulation through its PX-BAR domain, which allows it to bind phosphoinositides and interact with other proteins involved in vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal organization (Teasdale2011Insights). These functions highlight SNX18's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes.

## Interactions
SNX18 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the internalization of Salmonella Typhimurium by host cells, where it acts as a scaffold for recruiting Dynamin-2 and N-WASP. These interactions are essential for the formation and scission of the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) from the plasma membrane. The recruitment of SNX18 to the site of bacterial invasion is dependent on the phosphatase activity of the SopB effector, which modifies phosphoinositides to facilitate SNX18's membrane association (Liebl2017SopBMediated).

SNX18 also plays a significant role in autophagy by regulating the trafficking of ATG9A from recycling endosomes. It recruits Dynamin-2 to facilitate the formation of vesicles containing ATG9A and ATG16L1, which are crucial for autophagosome biogenesis. The interaction between SNX18 and Dynamin-2 is mediated through SNX18's SH3 domain, which binds to the proline-rich regions of Dynamin-2. This interaction is necessary for the proper trafficking of ATG9A, and its disruption leads to the accumulation of ATG9A in recycling endosomes, inhibiting autophagy (Søreng2018SNX).
