# BORCS8

## Overview
BORCS8 is a gene that encodes the protein BLOC-1 related complex subunit 8, which is a critical component of the BORC (BLOC-one-related complex) involved in lysosomal positioning and movement within cells. The BORC complex, including BORCS8, plays a significant role in the regulation of lysosomal transport along microtubules, facilitating processes such as autophagy, nutrient sensing, and cell signaling. BORCS8 is particularly associated with lysosomal membranes in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the kinesin-dependent movement of lysosomes towards the cell periphery, promoting their fusion with autophagosomes. This function is essential for maintaining autophagic flux and cellular homeostasis. Additionally, BORCS8 is involved in recruiting the HOPS complex to lysosomes, which is necessary for the assembly of the trans-SNARE complex, further facilitating autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Pu2015BORC; Jia2017BORC).

## Function
BORCS8, a component of the BORC complex, plays a crucial role in lysosome positioning and movement within cells. It is involved in the regulation of lysosomal transport along microtubules, which is essential for various cellular processes such as autophagy, nutrient sensing, and cell signaling. BORCS8 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with lysosomal membranes (Pu2015BORC; Jia2017BORC).

The BORC complex, including BORCS8, facilitates the kinesin-dependent movement of lysosomes towards the cell periphery, promoting their encounter and fusion with autophagosomes. This process is critical for maintaining autophagic flux and cellular homeostasis (Jia2017BORC). In BORC knockout cells, lysosomes cluster near the nucleus, leading to impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion and reduced lysosomal degradation, which highlights the importance of BORCS8 in autophagy regulation (Jia2017BORC).

BORCS8 also contributes to the recruitment of the HOPS complex to lysosomes, which is necessary for the assembly of the STX17-VAMP8-SNAP29 trans-SNARE complex, facilitating autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Jia2017BORC). Through these functions, BORCS8 plays a vital role in cellular processes that are crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Interactions
BORCS8 is a component of the BORC complex, which plays a crucial role in lysosome positioning and movement within cells. BORCS8 is part of a multiprotein complex that includes other subunits such as BORCS5, BORCS6, and BORCS7. This complex is involved in the recruitment of kinesin-1, a motor protein that facilitates the movement of lysosomes along microtubules towards the cell periphery (Tunganuntarat2023BORC; Farías2017BORCkinesin1). 

BORCS8, as part of the BORC complex, interacts with the small GTPase Arl8b and its effector SKIP, which are essential for the coupling of lysosomes to kinesin-1. This interaction chain is critical for the transport of lysosomes, particularly in neurons where it supports axonal growth and autophagosome clearance (Farías2017BORCkinesin1). 

While specific physical interactions of BORCS8 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its role within the BORC complex suggests it participates in the broader network of protein interactions that regulate lysosome dynamics and autophagy processes (Tunganuntarat2023BORC; Jia2017BORC). The BORC complex's involvement in autophagy evasion by Mycobacterium tuberculosis further underscores the functional significance of BORCS8 in cellular processes (Tunganuntarat2023BORC).
