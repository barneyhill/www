# NUDT4

## Overview
NUDT4 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 4, which belongs to the nudix hydrolase family. This protein functions primarily as an enzyme involved in cellular metabolism, specifically in the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, which is essential for maintaining nucleotide pool balance. Nudix hydrolase 4 is active in the cytoplasm and plays a critical role in processes such as mRNA decapping and cellular stress responses. It also acts as a phosphatase, interacting with proteins like histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) to regulate apoptosis and gene expression through nucleocytoplasmic translocation and chromatin maintenance (Yuan2024Role). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of histone acetylation, impacting transcription factors such as RUNX2, and is implicated in various biological contexts, including cancer progression (Yuan2024Role).

## Function
NUDT4, or nudix hydrolase 4, is an enzyme that plays a significant role in cellular metabolism by hydrolyzing nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, which is crucial for maintaining nucleotide pool balance. This enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in processes such as mRNA decapping and cellular stress responses. In healthy human cells, NUDT4 functions as a phosphatase, interacting with proteins like histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) to mediate its dephosphorylation at specific residues. This interaction is important for the regulation of apoptosis and gene expression, as it affects the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of HDAC4, which in turn influences chromatin maintenance and function (Yuan2024Role).

NUDT4's activity is also linked to the regulation of histone acetylation, impacting transcription factors such as RUNX2. By promoting the deacetylation and degradation of RUNX2, NUDT4 indirectly influences gene expression and cellular processes like apoptosis. These molecular activities highlight NUDT4's role in modulating cellular physiology and its potential implications in various biological contexts, including cancer progression (Yuan2024Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NUDT4 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), low expression of NUDT4 is significantly associated with a worse prognosis, suggesting that its downregulation may contribute to poorer outcomes in these cancers (He2022Integrative). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), NUDT4 is identified as a potential biomarker for cancer cell proliferation. Its expression is higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and it promotes tumor cell proliferation, although it does not affect cell migration (Liu2023m7Grelated).

In pancreatic cancer, NUDT4 interacts with the circular RNA circCGNL1, influencing cancer progression through a pathway involving HDAC4 and RUNX2. This interaction promotes apoptosis and affects cell proliferation, indicating that NUDT4 may act as an oncogene in this context (Yuan2024Role). The study of NUDT4 in these cancers highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and a prognostic biomarker, emphasizing the importance of understanding its role in cancer biology.

## Interactions
NUDT4, a member of the nudix hydrolase family, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. One of the key interactions of NUDT4 is with histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). NUDT4 acts as a phosphatase, mediating the dephosphorylation of HDAC4 at serine residue S632. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of pancreatic cancer progression, as it facilitates the nuclear translocation of HDAC4, which subsequently affects the acetylation and degradation of the transcription factor RUNX2 (Yuan2024Role).

The interaction between NUDT4 and HDAC4 is enhanced by the circular RNA circCGNL1, which promotes the binding of NUDT4 to HDAC4, leading to reduced phosphorylation levels of HDAC4 without affecting its total expression (Yuan2024Role). This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and GST pulldown assays, demonstrating that NUDT4 directly binds to HDAC4 (Yuan2024Role).

In addition to its interaction with HDAC4, NUDT4 has been identified as a potential target of circCGNL1, with both proteins colocalizing in the cytoplasm of pancreatic cancer cells (Yuan2024Role).
