# ORC6

## Overview
The ORC6 gene encodes the origin recognition complex subunit 6, a protein integral to the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. As a component of the origin recognition complex (ORC), ORC6 plays a pivotal role in the formation of the pre-replicative complex by facilitating the recruitment of essential replication factors to replication origins. Structurally, the ORC6 protein is characterized by three independent domains, each contributing to its function in DNA binding and interaction with other ORC subunits. Beyond its primary role in DNA replication, ORC6 is also involved in cytokinesis and chromosome segregation, highlighting its multifaceted role in cell division processes (Xu2020Structural; Liu2011Structural). Mutations in the ORC6 gene have been linked to Meier-Gorlin syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance in human development and disease (Bleichert2013A; Nazarenko2022Meier–Gorlin).

## Structure
The human ORC6 protein is a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC) and plays a crucial role in DNA replication. Structurally, ORC6 is composed of three independent domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1-94), the middle domain (residues 95-187), and the C-terminal domain (residues 188-252) (Xu2020Structural; You2024Structural). The middle domain of ORC6 shares structural similarity with the helical domain of the transcription factor TFIIB, suggesting a potential role in DNA binding (Xu2020Structural; Liu2011Structural). 

The C-terminal domain adopts an amphipathic α-helical conformation and contains a specific region (Arg198-Lys199-Arg200-Lys201) crucial for DNA binding (Xu2020Structural; You2024Structural). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by these domains functioning as independent structural modules with no strong inter-domain interactions (You2024Structural). 

ORC6 is involved in forming phase-separated droplets in the presence of DNA, a property essential for DNA replication (You2024Structural). The protein's ability to bind DNA is influenced by specific amino acids, with mutations in these residues affecting DNA binding and replication (Xu2020Structural). ORC6's role extends beyond DNA replication, as it is also involved in cytokinesis and chromosome segregation (Liu2011Structural).

## Function
The ORC6 protein is a crucial component of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. In human cells, ORC6 plays a significant role in the formation of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) by facilitating the recruitment and assembly of essential replication factors at replication origins. Although ORC6 is not required for the DNA binding of the ORC, it is vital for the proper assembly of pre-RCs, as its depletion impairs the association of Cdc6 and Mcm7 with DNA (Thomae2011Different).

ORC6 is involved in targeting and positioning the ORC to the origins of DNA replication, particularly associating with AT-rich regions. It binds DNA directly, showing affinity for structural features rather than specific sequences (Liu2011Structural). The protein also interacts with chromatin factors like HMGA1a, which may help specify replication origins in HMGA1a-rich chromatin regions (Thomae2011Different).

Beyond its role in DNA replication, ORC6 is implicated in coordinating cytokinesis and chromosome segregation. It localizes to kinetochores and the midbody during mitosis, suggesting a role in coordinating chromosome duplication, segregation, and cytokinesis (Prasanth2002Orc6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ORC6 gene are associated with Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth retardation, microtia (small ears), and patellar abnormalities. These mutations often occur in the conserved C-terminal region of the Orc6 protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other subunits of the origin recognition complex (ORC) necessary for DNA replication initiation (Bleichert2013A). Specific mutations, such as Y232S in humans, disrupt the formation of the ORC by impairing the binding of Orc6 to other ORC components, leading to defects in DNA replication and chromosome abnormalities (Bleichert2013A; Balasov2020Humanized).

The ORC6 gene is located in chromosomal region 16q11.2, and various genetic variants, including missense and intronic mutations, have been identified. These mutations can lead to a range of phenotypes, including growth retardation, microtia, patellar malformations, and micrognathia (Nazarenko2022Meier–Gorlin). Despite the severe phenotypes associated with these mutations, MGS patients do not show an increased predisposition to cancer, suggesting that chromosome stability might not be significantly compromised (Bleichert2013A).

## Interactions
The human ORC6 protein is a crucial component of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which plays a significant role in DNA replication initiation. ORC6 interacts with other ORC subunits, particularly ORC3 and ORC5, to form a stable hexameric initiator complex. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of the MCM2-7 helicase to replication origins, a critical step in pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) assembly (Chen2007Orc6; Bleichert2013A).

ORC6 also directly binds to the replication initiation factor Cdt1, facilitating its recruitment to the origin and stabilizing its association, which is necessary for repeated MCM2-7 loading (Chen2007Orc6). In addition, ORC6 interacts with the chaperone protein HMGA1a, which aids in directing the ORC to AT-rich heterochromatic regions, supporting pre-RC formation (Thomae2011Different).

The C-terminal domain of ORC6 is particularly important for its interactions with other ORC subunits and is conserved across species. Mutations in this region, such as those associated with Meier-Gorlin Syndrome, can disrupt ORC formation and impair DNA replication initiation (Bleichert2013A). ORC6 also exhibits a preference for binding to poly-AT rich DNA sequences, with specific regions of the protein, including the α8, α9, and α10 helices, showing significant interaction with DNA (Xu2020Structural).
