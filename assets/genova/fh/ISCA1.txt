# ISCA1

## Overview
ISCA1 is a gene that encodes the iron-sulfur cluster assembly 1 protein, which is integral to the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters within mitochondria. These clusters are essential cofactors for a variety of mitochondrial enzymes, playing a pivotal role in cellular energy production and metabolic processes. The ISCA1 protein is categorized as a mitochondrial assembly factor and is specifically involved in the maturation of [4Fe-4S] proteins, which are crucial for the function of enzymes such as aconitase and components of the respiratory chain (Beilschmidt2017ISCA1; Sheftel2012The). ISCA1 operates within the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery, interacting with other proteins like ISCA2 and NFU1 to facilitate the proper assembly and transfer of Fe-S clusters (Suraci2021ISCA1). Mutations in the ISCA1 gene have been linked to mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Torraco2018ISCA1).

## Function
The ISCA1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are essential cofactors for various mitochondrial enzymes. In healthy human cells, ISCA1 is primarily involved in the maturation of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins, which are crucial for the proper functioning of several mitochondrial enzymes, including aconitase, respiratory complex I, and lipoic acid synthase (Torraco2018ISCA1; Sheftel2012The). ISCA1 operates as part of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery, where it interacts with other proteins such as ISCA2, IBA57, and NFU1, suggesting its role as an Fe-S carrier (Beilschmidt2017ISCA1).

ISCA1 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and structure, as its depletion leads to significant mitochondrial abnormalities, including swollen and enlarged mitochondria lacking cristae membranes (Sheftel2012The). The protein is also involved in the formation of Fe4S4 clusters, which are vital for mitochondrial respiration and energy production (Beilschmidt2017ISCA1). ISCA1's role is specific to mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] protein maturation, as it does not significantly impact the maturation of cytosolic Fe-S proteins or heme biosynthesis (Torraco2018ISCA1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ISCA1 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, notably Multiple Mitochondrial Dysfunction Syndrome 5 (MMDS5) and infantile-onset leukodystrophy. The p.V10G mutation in ISCA1 leads to reduced mitochondrial import efficiency and protein stability, resulting in defects in mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins. These defects impair the function of respiratory chain complexes I and II, contributing to clinical features such as severe spastic ataxia, lactic acidosis, and early-onset leukodystrophy (Torraco2018ISCA1). 

Another mutation, the homozygous p.(Glu87Lys) variant, is linked to a type of multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome characterized by early neurological deterioration, seizures, and lactic acidosis. This variant affects protein stability and function, leading to a phenotype similar to other MMDS types (Shukla2017Homozygous; Shukla2016Homozygous).

Alterations in ISCA1 expression levels have also been implicated in cancer. In bladder cancer, ISCA1 is identified as a prognostic biomarker, with high expression levels associated with poor prognosis and increased immune infiltration. This suggests a potential role for ISCA1 in tumor progression and immune response modulation (Zhou2022Identification).

## Interactions
ISCA1 interacts with several proteins involved in the maturation of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] clusters. It forms a heterodimeric complex with ISCA2, which is essential for binding a [4Fe-4S] cluster. This complex, known as [4Fe-4S] ISCA1-ISCA2, exhibits specific spectroscopic features and interacts with NFU1, particularly through the C-domain of NFU1, forming a ternary complex. This interaction is mediated by ISCA1 and suggests that the [4Fe-4S] cluster may be shared between ISCA1 and NFU1 in this complex (Suraci2021ISCA1).

ISCA1 also interacts directly with NFU1, as shown by immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is specific to ISCA1, as NFU1 does not co-immunoprecipitate with ISCA2 or IBA57. The interaction is crucial for the maturation of mitochondrial Fe4S4 clusters, as ISCA1 knockdown leads to a decrease in these clusters in proteins such as aconitase and complex II (Beilschmidt2017ISCA1).

ISCA1's role extends to forming a transient ternary complex with ISCA2 and NFU1, facilitating the transfer of [4Fe-4S] clusters from the ISCA1-ISCA2 complex to NFU1. This process is vital for the maturation of mitochondrial proteins that require NFU1, such as respiratory complexes I and II (Suraci2021ISCA1).
