# ANXA7

## Overview
The ANXA7 gene encodes annexin A7, a member of the annexin family of proteins, which are characterized by their ability to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. Annexin A7 is a multifunctional protein that acts as a calcium-dependent GTPase, playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes such as membrane fusion, autophagy, and calcium homeostasis (Caohuy1996Membrane; Liu2016Potential). The protein is involved in the regulation and stabilization of membrane domains, particularly in red blood cells and platelets, where it influences membrane organization and vesiculation (Herr2003Function). ANXA7 is also implicated in cancer biology, where alterations in its expression are associated with tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic interventions (Leighton2016ANXA7GTPase; Srivastava2001ANX7).

## Structure
Annexin A7 (ANXA7) is a member of the annexin family, characterized by its ability to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. The protein has a bipartite structure, consisting of a variable N-terminal domain and a conserved C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is responsible for binding to calcium and phospholipids, while the N-terminal domain provides functional diversity and specificity (Sønder2019Annexin; Herr2003Function).

ANXA7 exists in two isoforms, 47 kDa and 51 kDa, resulting from alternative splicing. The difference between these isoforms is due to the inclusion of an additional cassette exon in the N-terminal domain, which is prevalent in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle tissues (Jin2013Annexin; Magendzo1991Alternative). The N-terminal domain of ANXA7 is notably long and hydrophobic, containing more than 100 amino acids, which contributes to its unique functional properties (Herr2003Function).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating ANXA7's function. Specifically, phosphorylation at threonine residues, such as Thr 275 and Thr 286, can be modulated by small molecules like ABO, affecting ANXA7's interactions and cellular roles (Li2013Identification). ANXA7's structure allows it to participate in various cellular processes, including membrane repair and autophagy, through interactions with other proteins (Sønder2019Annexin; Li2013Identification).

## Function
Annexin A7 (ANXA7) is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including membrane fusion, autophagy, and calcium homeostasis. It functions as a Ca2+-dependent GTPase, playing a crucial role in exocytotic membrane fusion and secretion by acting as a Ca2+/GTP sensor (Caohuy1996Membrane). ANXA7 is implicated in the regulation and stabilization of membrane domains, particularly in red blood cells and platelets, where it influences membrane organization and vesiculation (Herr2003Function). In red blood cells, ANXA7 is associated with lipid raft domains, contributing to membrane flexibility and shape, which are essential for maintaining the typical biconcave shape and osmotic resistance (Herr2003Function).

ANXA7 also plays a role in autophagy, where its GTPase activity is crucial for controlling this process. Reduced GTPase activity of ANXA7 promotes autophagy, highlighting its regulatory function in cellular homeostasis (Liu2016Potential). Additionally, ANXA7 is involved in calcium signaling pathways, which are vital for various cellular functions, including implantation events in endometrial cells (Alauddin2020Annexin). The protein's activity is modulated by its interactions with other proteins and its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP in the presence of calcium (Caohuy1996Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ANXA7 gene, also known as annexin A7, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In prostate cancer, ANXA7 is considered a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is often reduced in metastatic and hormone-insensitive prostate tumors, correlating with late-stage cancer and increased tumor cell proliferation (Srivastava2001ANX7). The loss of ANXA7 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential in several cancers, including prostate, breast, and gastric cancers (Srivastava2007ANXA7; Hsu2008The).

In breast cancer, ANXA7 expression is linked to metastatic disease and decreased survival, particularly in HER2-negative patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Leighton2016ANXA7GTPase). In thyroid cancer, ANXA7 may help overcome drug resistance, especially in cases with the BRAF V600E mutation, by modulating the mTOR/Akt/PI3K pathway (Bera2024Role).

ANXA7's role in calcium-mediated apoptosis and its interactions with other signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT pathway, highlight its importance in tumor suppression and cancer progression (Leighton2016ANXA7GTPase). These findings underscore the potential of ANXA7 as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Annexin A7 (ANXA7) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its cellular functions. ANXA7 interacts with ALG-2, a calcium-binding protein, in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of ALG-2 and ALIX to damaged plasma membranes, facilitating the assembly of the ESCRT III complex necessary for membrane repair (Sønder2019Annexin; Satoh2002The). ANXA7 also forms complexes with ALG-2 and ALIX, which are critical for plasma membrane repair processes, particularly in invasive breast cancer cells (Sønder2019Annexin).

ANXA7 interacts with HSP70, influencing apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells. This interaction is modulated by ANXA7's GTPase activity, which can be inhibited by small molecules like ABO, enhancing the interaction between HSP70 and TTC4, thereby inhibiting apoptosis (He2020Promoting). ANXA7 also interacts with TIA1, a protein involved in autophagy regulation. This interaction is enhanced by ABO treatment, which decreases TIA1 phosphorylation and affects autophagy markers (Huang2014TIA1).

In the context of mitophagy, ANXA7 interacts with BASP1, playing a pivotal role in Parkin-dependent mitophagy by translocating to impaired mitochondria upon CCCP treatment (Meng2020Quantitative). These interactions highlight ANXA7's role in various cellular processes, including membrane repair, apoptosis, and autophagy.
