# NRXN1

## Overview
The NRXN1 gene encodes the neurexin 1 protein, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule that plays a pivotal role in synaptic organization and function. Neurexin 1 is a type-1 transmembrane protein characterized by a long extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short intracellular tail. It is involved in forming trans-synaptic complexes with postsynaptic ligands, such as neuroligins, which are essential for synaptic connectivity and communication (Südhof2008Neuroligins; Südhof2017Synaptic). The gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that influence its binding properties and synaptic organization (Chen2011The). Neurexin 1's interactions with various synaptic proteins are crucial for synapse formation, maintenance, and plasticity, impacting learning and memory (Hu2019Genetic). Mutations and deletions in NRXN1 are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Curran2013NRXN1; Lowther2017Molecular).

## Structure
The NRXN1 gene encodes the neurexin 1 protein, which is a type-1 membrane protein involved in synaptic adhesion. The primary structure of neurexin 1 includes a long extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short intracellular tail (Südhof2017Synaptic). The extracellular domain is composed of six laminin-neurexin-sex hormone-binding globulin (LNS) domains interspersed with three epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (Miller2011The; Südhof2017Synaptic). These domains form a characteristic L-shaped tertiary structure, with a long arm composed of LNS2-LNS5 and a short arm formed by EGF3-LNS6 (Miller2011The; Südhof2017Synaptic).

The LNS domains exhibit a jelly roll fold, similar to lectins, and include splice insert sites that define a 'hyper-variable surface' for protein partner binding (Rudenko2019Neurexins). The structure also features a central calcium-binding site, with its affinity modulated by splice inserts (Rudenko2019Neurexins). Neurexin 1 undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that influence its binding properties and synaptic organization (Zambonino2019The; Chen2011The). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are present at specific sites, contributing to the protein's structural stability and function (Miller2011The).

## Function
The NRXN1 gene encodes neurexin-1, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and function. Neurexin-1 is involved in forming trans-synaptic complexes with postsynaptic ligands, such as neuroligins, which are essential for synaptic connectivity and communication (Südhof2008Neuroligins). These complexes are critical for synaptic signaling and the structural integrity of synapses, influencing synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release (Hu2019Genetic).

Neurexin-1 is expressed in neurons and undergoes extensive alternative splicing, generating numerous isoforms that contribute to its diverse functions in synaptic properties (Südhof2008Neuroligins). It forms discrete nanoclusters at excitatory synapses, which are dynamically regulated by ectodomain cleavage, particularly by the protease ADAM10. This cleavage affects the synaptic content and organization of neurexin-1, playing a role in synapse specification and function (Trotter2019Synaptic).

Neurexin-1 also interacts with other postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules, such as dystroglycan and LRRTMs, supporting synapse development in various brain regions (Hu2019Genetic). Its interactions with presynaptic proteins influence the architecture of active zones and are essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Hu2019Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deletions in the NRXN1 gene are associated with a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. These include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, intellectual disability, developmental delay, speech and language delay, and epilepsy (Curran2013NRXN1; Hu2019Genetic; Lowther2017Molecular). NRXN1 deletions, particularly those affecting exonic regions, are significantly more prevalent in individuals with these conditions compared to controls, indicating a strong genetic link (Lowther2017Molecular). 

The gene's role in synaptic organization and neurotransmission is crucial, and disruptions can lead to functional aberrations in synaptic connectivity, contributing to the pathophysiology of these disorders (Hu2019Genetic; Cooper2024Landscape). NRXN1 deletions have been linked to behavioral problems such as aggression and tantrums, as well as motor skill deficits (Cooper2024Landscape). 

The presence of NRXN1 deletions in healthy individuals suggests reduced penetrance and the influence of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (Castronovo2019Phenotypic). The gene's variations have also been associated with different responses to antipsychotic and antidepressant treatments, highlighting its potential role in therapeutic strategies (Hu2019Genetic).

## Interactions
The NRXN1 gene encodes neurexin 1, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule that participates in various protein interactions crucial for synaptic function. Neurexin 1 interacts with neuroligins to form trans-synaptic complexes, which are essential for synaptic signaling and the coordination of pre- and postsynaptic specializations (Hu2019Genetic; Südhof2008Neuroligins). These interactions are regulated by alternative splicing, affecting binding affinity and synaptic properties (Boucard2005A; Bang2013A).

Neurexin 1 also binds to other synaptic proteins, including dystroglycan, neurexophilin, leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins (LRRTMs), and cerebellin, which are involved in synapse formation and maintenance (Hu2019Genetic; Bang2013A). The interaction with LRRTMs is similar in affinity to that with neuroligins, highlighting its role in synaptogenic activity and postsynaptic differentiation (Bang2013A).

Intracellularly, neurexin 1 interacts with proteins such as CASK, Mints, and synaptotagmin, which are involved in synaptic vesicle release and endocannabinoid signaling (Hu2019Genetic; Südhof2008Neuroligins). These interactions are crucial for modulating neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity, impacting learning and memory (Hu2019Genetic).
