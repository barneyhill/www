# ACSM6

## Overview
ACSM6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 6, which plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a synthetase and is involved in the activation of medium-chain fatty acids by converting them into acyl-CoA thioesters, facilitating their degradation through β-oxidation in mitochondria. This process is crucial for energy production and maintaining lipid homeostasis within cells (Jiang2023Editorial:; Ren2018Bioinformatics). The expression of ACSM6 varies across different tissues, with notable implications in pathological conditions such as bladder cancer, where its expression levels are linked to tumor microenvironment characteristics and treatment responses (Li2023ACSM6).

## Function
ACSM6 (acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 6) is an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the activation of medium-chain fatty acids. It catalyzes the conversion of these fatty acids into acyl-CoA thioesters, a crucial step for their subsequent degradation via β-oxidation in mitochondria. This process is essential for energy production and maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis (Jiang2023Editorial:; Ren2018Bioinformatics).

In the context of sepsis, ACSM6 has been observed to correlate inversely with certain fatty acid substrates, suggesting a role in fatty acid metabolism during the host response to sepsis (Langley2013An). Although specific details about its function in healthy human cells are not provided, its involvement in fatty acid metabolism indicates its importance in energy regulation and metabolic processes.

ACSM6 expression has been noted in various tissues, albeit at low levels in the pancreas (van2018Analyses). While its precise cellular localization and activity in healthy cells remain less defined, its enzymatic role in fatty acid activation suggests it plays a significant part in cellular energy dynamics and lipid processing.

## Clinical Significance
ACSM6 has been implicated in bladder cancer (BLCA), where its expression levels are associated with the tumor microenvironment (TME) and treatment responses. Overexpression of ACSM6 is linked to a non-inflammatory TME, characterized by reduced levels of immunomodulatory factors, immune cells, and immune checkpoints, such as CTLA-4, PD-L1, PD-1, and LAG-3. This non-inflammatory environment is often associated with the luminal subtype of BLCA, which tends to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Li2023ACSM6). High ACSM6 expression is also correlated with responsiveness to anti-angiogenesis therapy, while low expression is linked to higher sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy (Li2023ACSM6).

ACSM6 expression levels can predict molecular subtypes of BLCA, with low expression associated with the basal subtype and high expression with the luminal subtype. This suggests that ACSM6 could serve as a biomarker for predicting treatment response and molecular subtypes in bladder cancer (Li2023ACSM6). The potential of ACSM6 as a target for immunotherapy in BLCA has also been suggested, as patients with low ACSM6 expression are more likely to respond positively to various therapies, including adjuvant therapy and ERBB treatment (Jiang2023Editorial:).
