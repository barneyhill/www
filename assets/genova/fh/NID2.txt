# NID2

## Overview
NID2 is a gene that encodes the protein nidogen-2, a glycoprotein integral to the structure and function of basement membranes. Nidogen-2 is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein and is characterized by its three globular domains and a rod-like domain, which facilitate interactions with other basement membrane components such as laminins, collagen IV, and perlecan. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and stability of the basement membrane, as well as for mediating cell adhesion and signaling processes (Schymeinsky2002Gene; Salmivirta2002Binding). Nidogen-2 is expressed in various tissues and plays roles in embryogenesis, blood vessel formation, and neuromuscular junction maintenance (Fox2008A; Salmivirta2002Binding). The NID2 gene has clinical significance in oncology, where its expression and methylation status are associated with cancer progression and prognosis, making it a potential biomarker for cancer detection and a target for therapeutic interventions (Yegin2013Hypermethylation; Chai2016MetastasissuppressingNID2).

## Structure
Nidogen-2 (NID2) is a glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the structure of basement membranes. The protein is composed of three globular domains: G1, G2, and G3, which are connected by a flexible link and a rigid rod-like domain (Schymeinsky2002Gene; Töpfer2024Nidogen). The G1 domain contains a NIDO domain, the G2 domain is characterized by a beta-barrel structure, and the G3 domain includes low-density lipoprotein receptor repeats (LDL) (Töpfer2024Nidogen). The rod domain of nidogen-2 contains four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules and two thyroglobulin (TY)-like modules (Zhou2022Nidogen:).

Nidogen-2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is common for proteins involved in extracellular matrix interactions (Fox1991Recombinant). The protein shares 46% sequence identity with nidogen-1, indicating a strong structural conservation despite low sequence homology (Miosge2000Ultrastructural; Töpfer2024Nidogen). Nidogen-2 is known to form complexes with other basement membrane components, such as laminin and collagen IV, through its G3 domain, which is crucial for these protein-protein interactions (Fox1991Recombinant; Töpfer2024Nidogen). The presence of splice variant isoforms of nidogen-2 has also been noted, contributing to its functional diversity (Fox1991Recombinant).

## Function
Nidogen-2, encoded by the NID2 gene, is a crucial component of the basement membrane, contributing to its structural integrity and function. It interacts with key basement membrane components such as collagen IV, perlecan, fibulin-2, and laminin-1 fragments, facilitating the assembly and stability of the basement membrane (Salmivirta2002Binding). Nidogen-2 is involved in cell adhesion processes, mediated by integrins, and is more adhesive than nidogen-1 for certain cell lines, indicating its significant role in cell adhesion (Salmivirta2002Binding).

In terms of molecular structure, nidogen-2 contains three globular domains and a cell-adhesive RGD site, which are important for its interactions with other matrix components (Salmivirta2002Binding). The protein is expressed in various tissues, particularly during embryogenesis, and is regulated by factors such as epidermal growth factor (Salmivirta2002Binding). Although nidogen-2 is not essential for basement membrane formation, as evidenced by studies in mice, it may have specific roles in blood vessel formation and homeostasis (Schymeinsky2002Gene). Its interactions with endostatin and tropoelastin suggest potential roles in modulating the endostatin reservoir in vessel walls and organizing elastic fibers (Schymeinsky2002Gene).

## Clinical Significance
The NID2 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and methylation status. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), NID2 is frequently down-regulated due to promoter hypermethylation. This down-regulation is associated with increased metastatic potential, as re-expression of NID2 in these cancers suppresses clonogenic survival and migration abilities, indicating its role as a metastasis suppressor gene (Chai2016MetastasissuppressingNID2). In gastric cancer (GC), however, NID2 is over-expressed and correlates with lymphatic metastasis and advanced TNM stages. Higher NID2 expression in GC is linked to shorter overall survival, suggesting its role in promoting cancer progression (Yu2019NID2).

In bladder cancer, NID2 is hypermethylated in both tumor tissues and urine samples, making it a potential biomarker for noninvasive cancer detection. The high sensitivity and specificity of NID2 methylation analysis in urine samples highlight its diagnostic value (Yegin2013Hypermethylation). Additionally, in neuroblastoma, NID2 is part of a gene network associated with poor prognosis in patients with short survival, indicating its involvement in aggressive disease phenotypes (Esposito2018Somatic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NID2 in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Interactions
NID2 (nidogen 2) is a key component of the basement membrane, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining structural integrity through its interactions with other extracellular matrix proteins. NID2 binds to laminins, collagen IV, and perlecan, acting as a connecting element that integrates these components into a stable matrix. This interaction is essential for the assembly and function of the basement membrane, contributing to tissue integrity and cellular signaling (Bader2005Compound).

In the context of cancer, NID2 has been shown to interact with collagen family genes, such as COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A2, and COL6A3, which are highly expressed in various tumors. These interactions may facilitate cancer progression by influencing pathways like protein digestion, absorption, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (Yu2019NID2).

At the neuromuscular junction, NID2 is concentrated at synaptic sites and is involved in the maturation and maintenance of these structures. Although it does not affect the synaptic localization of other basal lamina components like laminins and collagens IV, its presence is crucial for the proper structural organization of the neuromuscular junction (Fox2008A).
