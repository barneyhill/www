# KCNH4

## Overview
The KCNH4 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 4, a protein that is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. These channels are integral membrane proteins that facilitate the selective flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane, a process essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and modulating electrical excitability in cells, particularly neurons. The KCNH4 protein is characterized by its six transmembrane segments and a pore loop that forms the ion-conducting pore, typical of this channel family. It also contains regulatory domains such as the PAS domain and the cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain, which are involved in channel gating and regulation. The gene's expression and alternative splicing can influence neuronal excitability and signal transmission, underscoring its significance in neural physiology (McKee2007Exon; YelinBekerman2015Hypocretin; Barros2020The).

## Structure
The KCNH4 protein is a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically the subfamily H. It is characterized by its six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), with a pore loop between the S5 and S6 segments forming the ion-conducting pore. This structure is typical of potassium voltage-gated ion channels, where the S1-S4 segments form the voltage-sensing domain, and the S5-S6 segments create the selectivity filter for ion passage (YelinBekerman2015Hypocretin). 

The protein is likely to have a tetrameric quaternary structure, with each subunit contributing to the central pore, a common feature among voltage-gated potassium channels (Barros2020The). The KCNH4 protein also includes specific domains such as the PAS domain and the cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD), which are involved in channel regulation and gating (Barros2020The). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of the KCNH4 channel, although specific modifications for this protein are not detailed in the available context (Barros2020The). The structural organization and domain interactions are crucial for the channel's function and gating properties (Barros2020The).

## Function
The KCNH4 gene encodes a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily H, which is involved in controlling the resting potential of cell membranes by regulating the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the electrical excitability of cells, particularly in the nervous system, where KCNH4 contributes to neuronal excitability and signal transmission (McKee2007Exon).

Alternative splicing of KCNH4 can result in different transcript variants, some of which may include a premature stop codon, potentially leading to non-sense mediated decay or the production of a truncated protein. This truncated protein retains the membrane-spanning segment but lacks much of the cytoplasmic region necessary for intracellular protein-protein interactions. These interactions are essential for the channel's assembly, gating, and conduction properties, suggesting that alterations in the carboxyl-terminal region could impact protein function and influence ion homeostasis (McKee2007Exon).

In neural cells, the KCNH4 gene plays a role in maintaining ion balance, which is critical for proper cellular function and response to stimuli. This highlights the importance of KCNH4 in neural cell function and physiology (McKee2007Exon).
