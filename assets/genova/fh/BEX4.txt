# BEX4

## Overview
BEX4, or brain expressed X-linked 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to cancer development. The BEX4 protein is known for its interactions with key cellular components, such as α-tubulin and sirtuin 2, which influence microtubule dynamics and stability, crucial for cell division and structural integrity (Lee2016Oncogenic). Additionally, BEX4 interacts with Polo-like kinase 1, playing a role in mitotic processes and contributing to aneuploidy, a condition often associated with cancer progression (Lee2018Oncogenic). The expression of the BEX4 gene varies across different cancer types, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts, such as oral squamous cell carcinoma, and as an oncogene in others, like lung cancer (Gao2016Decreased; Lee2016Oncogenic). This dual role underscores the gene's complex involvement in oncogenesis and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BEX4 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), BEX4 expression is significantly reduced compared to normal tissues, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Low BEX4 expression in OSCC is associated with poor cancer-free survival and advanced tumor stages. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, are thought to suppress BEX4 expression in OSCC, and treatments that reverse these modifications can increase BEX4 expression, potentially offering a therapeutic strategy (Gao2016Decreased).

In contrast, BEX4 is overexpressed in several other cancers, including lung cancer, where it contributes to oncogenic transformation by promoting microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to apoptotic cell death. This overexpression is linked to increased tumor growth and chromosomal instability, suggesting an oncogenic role for BEX4 in these contexts (Lee2016Oncogenic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), BEX4 expression shows sex-specific differences, being upregulated in female patients and downregulated in males. This differential expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and may influence the efficacy of certain cancer therapies (Liu2022Sex). These findings highlight the complex role of BEX4 in cancer, acting as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the context.

## Interactions
BEX4 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to cancer development. It specifically binds to α-tubulin (α-TUB) and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), forming a complex that regulates microtubule acetylation. BEX4 inhibits the deacetylation activity of SIRT2, leading to hyperacetylation of α-TUB, which is crucial for microtubule stability and polymerization (Lee2016Oncogenic). This interaction is significant as it contributes to oncogenic processes by promoting microtubule stability and resistance to depolymerization, often observed in cancer cells (Lee2016Oncogenic).

BEX4 also interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), particularly during mitosis. PLK1 phosphorylates BEX4, which is essential for its stability and proper localization at centrosomes, spindle poles, and midbodies. This phosphorylation event is crucial for BEX4-induced aneuploidy, a condition associated with cancer progression (Lee2018Oncogenic). The interaction between BEX4 and PLK1 is further supported by immunoprecipitation and kinase assays, indicating a direct interaction (Lee2018Oncogenic).

These interactions highlight BEX4's role in modulating microtubule dynamics and its potential involvement in cancer development through its interactions with α-TUB, SIRT2, and PLK1.
