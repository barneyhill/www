# RHOBTB1

## Overview
RHOBTB1 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho-related BTB domain containing 1, which is a member of the Rho GTPase family. This protein is characterized by its unique domain architecture, including a nonfunctional GTPase domain, proline-rich regions, and BTB domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and the formation of cullin3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complexes (Mukohda2019RhoBTB1; BERTHOLD2008Rho). RHOBTB1 plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis, vascular health, and tumor suppression. It regulates phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) activity, thereby influencing cyclic GMP levels and vasodilation, which are crucial for maintaining normal blood pressure (Mukohda2019RhoBTB1). Additionally, RHOBTB1 is involved in maintaining Golgi apparatus integrity, with implications in cancer progression when its expression is altered (McKinnon2017The). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various cancers and cardiovascular diseases, making it a potential therapeutic target (Fang2020PPARγ; Ji2016Atypical).

## Structure
The RHOBTB1 protein is characterized by a unique domain architecture that includes a GTPase domain, a proline-rich region, two BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domains, and a conserved C-terminal region (Beder2005Identification; BERTHOLD2008Rho). The GTPase domain is atypical and nonfunctional due to deviations from the typical GTPase consensus, such as insertions, deletions, and substitutions (Mukohda2019RhoBTB1; BERTHOLD2008Rho). The proline-rich region is involved in protein-protein interactions and may serve as a binding site for SH3 domains (BERTHOLD2008Rho).

The BTB domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and are components of cullin3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complexes, which play a role in protein degradation (Mukohda2019RhoBTB1; BERTHOLD2008Rho). The first BTB domain is bipartite and interrupted by an extension of unknown function, rich in charged residues (BERTHOLD2008Rho). The C-terminal region is conserved and may form a novel domain consisting of approximately 80 amino acids that fold into four consecutive α-helices (BERTHOLD2008Rho).

RHOBTB1 can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and has splice variant isoforms (Sorokina2005RhoGTPases:). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Nguyen2020RhoBTB).

## Function
The RHOBTB1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular health by modulating phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) activity. In healthy human cells, RHOBTB1 acts as a substrate adaptor for the Cullin-3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of PDE5. This regulation is essential for controlling cyclic GMP levels, which promote vasodilation and help maintain normal blood pressure (Mukohda2019RhoBTB1). 

RHOBTB1 is also involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for proper protein processing and trafficking. Loss of RHOBTB1 expression can lead to Golgi fragmentation, affecting cell polarity and potentially increasing cell invasion and metastasis in cancer contexts (McKinnon2017The). 

The protein is part of the Rho GTPase family, characterized by a unique domain architecture that includes a GTPase domain and BTB domains. These domains are involved in forming complexes with Cullin-3, which are important for targeting specific proteins for degradation, thus playing a role in cellular homeostasis and potentially tumor suppression (Ji2016Atypical; BERTHOLD2008Rho).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RHOBTB1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, RHOBTB1 is downregulated, leading to Golgi fragmentation and increased cell invasion, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor by maintaining Golgi integrity and normal cell polarity (McKinnon2017The). RHOBTB1 expression is also decreased in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), colon cancer, and other epithelial cancers, often due to loss of heterozygosity or microRNA-mediated silencing (Ji2016Atypical; BERTHOLD2008Rho). In colon cancer, miR-31 targets RHOBTB1, leading to its decreased expression, which is associated with increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (XU2012The).

In addition to its role in cancer, RHOBTB1 is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and vascular homeostasis. Alterations in its expression are linked to hypertension, particularly when caused by PPARγ dysfunction in smooth muscle cells. Restoring RHOBTB1 expression or inhibiting phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) can reverse hypertension and arterial stiffness, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases (Fang2020PPARγ; Mukohda2019RhoBTB1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RHOBTB1 in both cancer and cardiovascular conditions.

## Interactions
RHOBTB1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It acts as a substrate adaptor for the Cullin-3 E3 RING ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins such as phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5). This interaction is crucial for maintaining cGMP levels and regulating vasodilation, which is important for protecting against hypertension and arterial stiffness (Mukohda2019RhoBTB1). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that RHOBTB1 can directly interact with PDE5 and Cullin-3, indicating its role in the CRL3 complex (Mukohda2019RhoBTB1).

RHOBTB1 also interacts with METTL7B, a Golgi-associated methyltransferase, to maintain Golgi integrity. This interaction is significant in the context of breast cancer, where RHOBTB1 expression is often downregulated, leading to Golgi fragmentation and increased cell invasiveness. Restoring RHOBTB1 expression can rescue Golgi morphology and inhibit cancer cell invasion (McKinnon2017The). The BTB domain of RHOBTB1, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, allows it to form dimers and participate in cullin3-dependent complexes, functioning as both linker and adaptor proteins (BERTHOLD2008Rho).
