# INSL5

## Overview
Insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5) is a gene that encodes a peptide hormone belonging to the insulin superfamily, characterized by its structural similarity to insulin and relaxin. The INSL5 gene is primarily expressed in the enteroendocrine L-cells of the colon and rectum, where it plays a crucial role in regulating physiological processes such as food intake and glucose homeostasis (Halls2015International; Hu2017Interaction). The protein product of INSL5, also known as insulin-like peptide 5, functions as a ligand for the relaxin family peptide receptor 4 (RXFP4), a G-protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in complex intracellular signaling pathways that influence cellular growth, survival, and metabolism (Ang2016Signal). INSL5's role as an orexigenic hormone, with its levels fluctuating in response to feeding and fasting, underscores its importance in energy balance and metabolic regulation (Halls2015International). Additionally, alterations in INSL5 expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including metabolic disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases, and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (BurnickaTurek2012INSL5Deficient; THANASUPAWAT2012INSL5; Skok2021Expression).

## Structure
The human insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5) is a member of the insulin superfamily, characterized by a two-chain structure (A and B chains) linked by three disulfide bonds (Akhter2008Synthesis). The primary structure of INSL5 consists of 21 residues in the A chain and 24 residues in the B chain (Akhter2008Synthesis). The secondary structure of INSL5 includes three helical segments and two short extended regions, forming a relaxin-like fold (HaugaardJönsson2009Structure). The A chain contains two α-helices, while the B chain has one longer helical segment (HaugaardJönsson2009Structure).

The tertiary structure of INSL5 is defined by its insulin/relaxin fold, with a hydrophobic core stabilized by disulfide bonds (HaugaardJönsson2009Structure). The B-chain helix extends to the C-terminal Trp B24, which is crucial for receptor activation (HaugaardJönsson2009Structure). The quaternary structure involves interactions with the RXFP4 receptor, where INSL5 acts as an endogenous ligand (Akhter2008Synthesis).

INSL5's structure is further characterized by conserved hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, particularly involving acidic residues that stabilize the relaxin fold (HaugaardJönsson2009Structure). These structural features are essential for its biological function and receptor binding.

## Function
INSL5 is a peptide hormone that plays a significant role in regulating various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in enteroendocrine L-cells of the colon and rectum, where it functions as a ligand for the relaxin family peptide receptor 4 (RXFP4) (Halls2015International; Hu2017Interaction). Upon binding to RXFP4, INSL5 activates complex intracellular signaling pathways, including the inhibition of cAMP accumulation and the activation of ERK1/2 and MAPK pathways (Hu2017Interaction; Ang2016Signal). These pathways are involved in cellular growth, survival, and metabolism (Ang2016Signal).

INSL5 is implicated in the regulation of food intake and glucose homeostasis. It acts as an orexigenic hormone, with plasma levels increasing during fasting and decreasing with feeding, suggesting a role in energy balance (Halls2015International). INSL5 also influences glucose metabolism, as knockout mice exhibit impaired glucose homeostasis and reduced insulin levels (Halls2015International). The peptide's activity in the gastrointestinal tract suggests it may have autocrine or paracrine functions, contributing to gut motility and nutrient absorption (THANASUPAWAT2012INSL5).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the INSL5 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, INSL5 expression is differentially regulated in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). It is upregulated in UC and downregulated in CD, suggesting its potential as a biomarker to distinguish between these conditions (Hechter2022Reviewing; Skok2021Expression). 

INSL5 has also been implicated in metabolic disorders. Insl5-deficient mice exhibit impaired glucose homeostasis, characterized by elevated serum glucose levels and reduced insulin secretion, indicating a role in glucose regulation (BurnickaTurek2012INSL5Deficient). These mice also show impaired fertility, with reduced sperm motility and irregular estrous cycles, suggesting that INSL5 may influence reproductive health (BurnickaTurek2012INSL5Deficient).

In the context of cancer, INSL5 is expressed in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the colon, and its interaction with the RXFP4 receptor may play a role in tumor growth and metastasis (Mashima2013INSL5; THANASUPAWAT2012INSL5). The potential involvement of INSL5 in these conditions highlights its clinical significance, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
Insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5) interacts primarily with the relaxin family peptide receptor 4 (RXFP4), a G-protein-coupled receptor. This interaction is characterized by high affinity binding, similar to that of H3 relaxin, but INSL5 does not activate RXFP3, although it can act as a weak antagonist (Akhter2008Synthesis). The binding and activation of RXFP4 by INSL5 involve specific residues in the B-chain of INSL5, such as B16Ile, B23Arg, and B24Trp, which are crucial for forming hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with the receptor (Hu2017Interaction). The C-terminal acid form of INSL5 is particularly important for optimal receptor binding and activation, showing a 25-fold greater affinity for RXFP4 compared to the amide form (Belgi2011Structure).

Upon binding to RXFP4, INSL5 activates several intracellular signaling pathways, including the inhibition of cAMP accumulation and the activation of ERK1/2, Akt, p38MAPK, and S6RP. These pathways are mediated through Gα i/o proteins and involve interactions with proteins such as GRK2 and β-arrestins, leading to receptor internalization and translocation to early endosome compartments (Ang2016Signal). These interactions suggest a role for INSL5 in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and calcium mobilization in specific cell types (Ang2016Signal).
