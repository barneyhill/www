# DCLRE1A

## Overview
The DCLRE1A gene encodes the DNA cross-link repair 1A protein, commonly referred to as SNM1A, which is a member of the metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) fold DNA nucleases family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the repair of complex DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks (DSBs) and interstrand cross-links (ICLs), which are critical for maintaining genomic stability. SNM1A is characterized by its β-CASP domain and MBL domain, which together form the active site necessary for its exonuclease activity. The protein's function is facilitated by its interaction with various DNA repair proteins and structures, including poly-ADP-ribose chains, PCNA, and ubiquitinated PCNA, through its PBZ, UBZ, and PIP box domains. These interactions are essential for its recruitment to DNA damage sites, where it processes chemically modified nucleotides. Disruption of SNM1A function can lead to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and defects in DNA repair, highlighting its importance in genomic integrity and its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Swift2022SNM1A; Baddock2020The; McHugh2023SNM1A).

## Structure
The DCLRE1A gene encodes the SNM1A protein, a member of the metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) fold DNA nucleases family. The protein is 1040 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of 116.2 kDa (Baddock2020The). SNM1A features a β-CASP domain, which, along with the MBL domain, forms the nuclease active site. The MBL domain is characterized by an α/β/β/α fold, crucial for coordinating metal ions necessary for catalysis (Swift2024SNM1A; Baddock2020The).

The active site of SNM1A coordinates two Zn2+ ions, although the binding of the second metal ion may be less tight compared to RNA-processing β-CASP MBLs. This di-metal form is hypothesized to be more catalytically active, facilitating phosphodiester hydrolysis (Baddock2020The). The protein's electrostatic surface charge distribution is highly positive, attributed to lysine and arginine residues, which likely interact with the negatively charged DNA backbone (Baddock2020The).

SNM1A contains a PIP (PCNA interacting protein) box and a UBZ (ubiquitin binding zinc finger) within its primary sequence, facilitating interactions with PCNA, especially when ubiquitinated in response to DNA damage (Baddock2020The). The protein does not have any identified splice variants (Baddock2020The).

## Function
The DCLRE1A gene encodes the SNM1A protein, a 5ʹ-3ʹ exonuclease crucial for the repair of complex DNA breaks in human cells. SNM1A is particularly important for processing double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are induced by ionizing radiation and radiomimetic agents, which cause oxidative chemical modifications at the break termini (Swift2024SNM1A; McHugh2023SNM1A). The protein is recruited to sites of DNA damage through interactions with poly-ADP-ribose chains, PCNA, and ubiquitinated PCNA, facilitated by its PBZ, UBZ, and PIP box domains (Swift2022SNM1A). These interactions are essential for SNM1A's recruitment and retention at damage sites, allowing it to effectively process chemically modified nucleotides and facilitate proper DNA repair (Swift2022SNM1A).

SNM1A's role extends to DNA interstrand crosslink repair, where it interacts with PCNA in a replication-coupled pathway (McHugh2023SNM1A). The protein's activity is linked to its metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) and β-CASP motifs, which form the enzymatic active site necessary for its exonuclease function (Swift2024SNM1A). Disruption of SNM1A results in increased sensitivity to radiation and defects in DSB repair, underscoring its essential role in maintaining genomic stability (Swift2022SNM1A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the DCLRE1A gene, which encodes the SNM1A protein, can lead to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs. This sensitivity is due to the gene's crucial role in repairing complex DNA breaks, particularly those with oxidative modifications at the termini (Swift2022SNM1A; McHugh2023SNM1A). Disruption of SNM1A function can result in defects in DNA double-strand break repair, contributing to genomic instability and potentially increasing susceptibility to cancer (Swift2022SNM1A; Baddock2020The).

The gene's involvement in DNA interstrand cross-link repair suggests that its dysfunction could lead to hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents like mitomycin C and cisplatin, further implicating it in cancer pathogenesis (Baddock2020The). Although specific diseases directly linked to DCLRE1A mutations are not detailed, the gene's role in maintaining genomic integrity implies that its alterations could contribute to conditions associated with impaired DNA repair mechanisms, such as cancer or radiation sensitivity syndromes (Hansen2017Use; McHugh2023SNM1A). The potential for SNM1A as a therapeutic target in enhancing radiotherapy underscores its clinical significance in oncology (Swift2022SNM1A).

## Interactions
The DCLRE1A protein, also known as SNM1A, is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate its role in DNA repair. SNM1A contains several motifs, including a poly-ADP-ribose (PAR)-binding zinc finger (PBZ), a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ), and a PCNA interacting peptide (PIP) box, which are essential for its recruitment to DNA damage sites. The PBZ motif binds to PAR chains, the UBZ motif interacts with ubiquitinated PCNA, and the PIP box binds to both PCNA and ubiquitinated PCNA (Swift2022SNM1A; McHugh2023SNM1A).

SNM1A also interacts with PIAS1, a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, which is crucial for forming nuclear foci necessary for interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair. Mutations in SNM1A that disrupt its interaction with PIAS1 impair its ability to form these foci and perform ICL repair (Ishiai2004DNA).

Additionally, SNM1A collaborates with the XPF-ERCC1 complex in ICL repair. This interaction is vital for processing ICLs and preventing the accumulation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Wang2011Human). SNM1A also forms a complex with the Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) protein, which modulates its exonuclease activity and is important for ICL repair (Iyama2014CSB).
