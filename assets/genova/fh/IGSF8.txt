# IGSF8

## Overview
The IGSF8 gene encodes the protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 8, which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling processes, playing a crucial role in cellular communication and interaction. IGSF8 interacts with tetraspanin molecules, such as CD81 and CD9, forming part of the tetraspanin web that influences cell morphology, motility, and synaptic organization (Inoue2012Tetraspanininteracting; Murdoch2003Genomic). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the nervous system, and is implicated in processes such as organogenesis, tissue development, and neural development (Murdoch2003Genomic). Additionally, IGSF8 is associated with several human disorders, including cancer and metabolic diseases, due to its role in cell adhesion and immune response (LaPierre2022MicroRNA7; Murdoch2003Genomic).

## Function
The IGSF8 gene encodes a protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling processes. IGSF8 interacts with tetraspanin molecules, specifically CD81 and CD9, on the cell surface, facilitating cell-cell communication and potentially influencing cell migration and differentiation (Inoue2012Tetraspanininteracting; Murdoch2003Genomic). The protein contains four Ig-like domains and a single transmembrane domain, which allow it to form and stabilize multimolecular complexes involved in signal transduction (Murdoch2003Genomic).

IGSF8 is expressed in various tissues during embryonic development, including the nervous system and organ epithelia, suggesting a role in organogenesis and tissue development (Murdoch2003Genomic). It is implicated in cellular functions such as proliferation, adhesion, motility, and differentiation, potentially through its interactions with other proteins (Murdoch2003Genomic). In the nervous system, IGSF8 is expressed in proliferating cells and early postmitotic neurons, indicating a role in neural development (Murdoch2003Genomic).

IGSF8 is also considered a candidate for involvement in human disorders localized to the 1q22-q23 region of the chromosome, which is associated with various diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and familial hemiplegic migraine (Murdoch2003Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
The IGSF8 gene, also known as CD316, is implicated in several human diseases due to its role in cell adhesion and immune response. Alterations in IGSF8 expression have been associated with cancer progression and metastasis. The gene is located in the 1q22-q23 chromosomal region, which is often duplicated in tumor cell lines, suggesting a role in cellular dysregulation and invasiveness (Murdoch2003Genomic). IGSF8 interacts with proteins like CD9, which negatively regulates tumor metastasis, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Murdoch2003Genomic).

In metabolic disorders, IGSF8 has been linked to obesity and endocrine function. Overexpression of IGSF8 in Sim1 neurons exacerbates high-fat diet-induced obesity and increases plasma insulin and IGF-1 levels, highlighting its role in body weight regulation (LaPierre2022MicroRNA7).

IGSF8 is also considered a candidate gene for familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM2), associated with the same chromosomal region as type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in populations like the Pima Indians (Murdoch2003Genomic). These associations underscore the gene's clinical significance in various human disorders.

## Interactions
IGSF8, also known as EWI-2, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in various protein interactions. It is known to associate with tetraspanins such as CD9 and CD81, forming part of the tetraspanin web, which influences cell morphology and motility (Glazar2009Immunoglobulin; SalaValdés2006EWI2). In the context of fertilization, IGSF8 interacts with CD9 on the surface of mouse eggs, playing a role in sperm-egg interactions. This interaction is crucial for the localization of tetraspanin proteins to filopodia, which are important for cell aggregation and motility (Glazar2009Immunoglobulin; Inoue2012Tetraspanininteracting).

In the hippocampal CA3 microcircuit, IGSF8 interacts with the extracellular matrix protein Tenascin-R (TenR). This interaction is significant for the organization of the MF-CA3 synapse, affecting synaptic architecture and function (Apóstolo2019Synapse). The interaction between IGSF8 and TenR was confirmed through various assays, including cell-surface binding and pulldown assays (Apóstolo2019Synapse). These interactions suggest that IGSF8 plays a role in synaptic organization and cell signaling processes.
