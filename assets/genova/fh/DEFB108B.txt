# DEFB108B

## Overview
DEFB108B is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 108B, a member of the β-defensin family, which is integral to the innate immune system. This family of proteins is characterized by small cationic peptides that exhibit antimicrobial properties through interactions with anionic membrane lipids. Defensin beta 108B is distinguished by its unique amino acid composition, which includes a higher proportion of anionic residues compared to other β-defensins, suggesting specialized functional roles. The gene is primarily expressed in the testis, with lower expression levels in the liver, indicating a potential role in the innate defense mechanisms of the male reproductive tract. Additionally, DEFB108B is part of a defensin gene cluster located on chromosome 8p23.1, a region known for its genetic variability, which has implications for various clinical conditions, including lung cancer and 8p23.1 duplication syndrome (Barber20108p23.1; Ramroach2020Lung; Semple2003Duplication).

## Function
DEFB108B, a member of the β-defensin family, plays a role in the innate immune system by contributing to antimicrobial defense mechanisms. These defensins are small cationic peptides that interact with anionic membrane lipids, which is crucial for their antimicrobial activity. The unique amino acid composition of DEFB108B, with a higher proportion of anionic residues compared to other β-defensins, suggests it may have distinct functional roles (Semple2003Duplication).

The expression of DEFB108B is primarily detected in the testis, with lower levels in the liver, indicating a potential role in the male reproductive tract's innate defense mechanism (Semple2003Duplication). This expression pattern suggests that DEFB108B may be involved in protecting reproductive tissues from microbial infections, thereby contributing to overall reproductive health.

DEFB108B, like other β-defensins, may also play a role in linking innate and adaptive immune responses. β-defensins are known to be chemotactic for immune cells and can act on dendritic cells to trigger adaptive immune responses, although specific activities of DEFB108B in this regard have not been detailed (Semple2003Duplication).

## Clinical Significance
DEFB108B, a member of the defensin family, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In the context of lung cancer, DEFB108B has been identified as a differentiator gene with significant implications for patient outcomes. Alterations in DEFB108B expression are associated with a lower survival rate and reduced disease-free progression in lung cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a drug target (Ramroach2020Lung). The study by Ramroach et al. highlights the gene's role in accurately classifying lung cancer subtypes, which is crucial for improving patient survival rates (Ramroach2020Lung).

In addition to its role in cancer, DEFB108B is part of the defensin gene cluster located on chromosome 8p23.1, a region known for its copy number variability. This variability can lead to conditions such as 8p23.1 duplication syndrome, which is associated with developmental delays, heart defects, and other phenotypic abnormalities. Although the specific role of DEFB108B in these conditions is not detailed, its inclusion in the defensin cluster suggests it may contribute to the syndrome's clinical manifestations (Barber20108p23.1).
