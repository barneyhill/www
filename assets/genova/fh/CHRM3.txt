# CHRM3

## Overview
The CHRM3 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven-pass transmembrane structure. This receptor plays a pivotal role in mediating cholinergic signals across various physiological systems, including the autonomic nervous system, where it influences smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretion, and neurotransmitter modulation (Abrams2006Muscarinic; Kruse2014Muscarinic). The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 is integral to processes such as urinary bladder function, gastrointestinal motility, and ocular physiology, among others (Abrams2006Muscarinic). Beyond its physiological roles, CHRM3 is implicated in pathological conditions, including colon cancer progression and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cheng2019A; Cheng2023Muscarinic).

## Structure
The CHRM3 gene encodes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by a seven-pass transmembrane topology, typical of GPCRs, which includes seven alpha helices spanning the cell membrane (Kruse2014Muscarinic). The ligand-binding pocket of the M3 receptor is deeply embedded within the membrane, similar to other biogenic amine receptors, and is involved in extensive hydrophobic contacts and some polar interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and charge-charge interactions (Kruse2014Muscarinic).

The M3 receptor's structure includes an extracellular vestibule, which is a solvent-accessible cavity involved in the binding of allosteric modulators. This vestibule is divided by a tyrosine 'lid' and features conserved backbone structures with divergent amino acid side chains compared to other receptor subtypes (Kruse2014Muscarinic). The receptor's tertiary structure forms a transmembrane domain, but there is no evidence of a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer.

Post-translational modifications of the CHRM3 protein may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence receptor function and signaling (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). However, specific details on splice variant isoforms of CHRM3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CHRM3 gene encodes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3, a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. This receptor is predominantly involved in mediating cholinergic signals, which are essential for smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretion, and modulation of neurotransmitter release. In the bladder, M3 receptors are primarily responsible for detrusor muscle contraction, which is vital for normal urinary function (Matsui2000Multiple; Abrams2006Muscarinic). In the gastrointestinal tract, the M3 receptor facilitates cholinergic stimulation of gastrointestinal motility, influencing digestive processes (Abrams2006Muscarinic).

In the eye, M3 receptors are involved in controlling iris sphincter contraction, contributing to pupillary constriction (Abrams2006Muscarinic). The receptor is also active in the salivary glands, where it regulates salivation by controlling both the volume and viscosity of saliva (Abrams2006Muscarinic). The M3 receptor's role extends to the cardiovascular system, where it may mediate acetylcholine-induced dilatation of coronary arteries, although its physiological significance in humans remains less clear (Abrams2006Muscarinic). Overall, the M3 receptor is integral to the function of various autonomic systems, impacting processes such as digestion, vision, and urinary function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHRM3 gene, which encodes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3, are associated with several clinical conditions. A deficiency in the M3 receptor can lead to a clinical syndrome characterized by bladder dysfunction, mydriasis, and reduced sweating, as observed in a patient with symptoms similar to male M3 knockout mice (Pomper2011A). Mutations in CHRM3, such as a homozygous frameshift mutation, have been linked to urinary bladder malformations and prune-belly-like syndrome, which includes symptoms like megacystis, disorganized detrusor muscle, and cryptorchidism (Weber2011Muscarinic). A homozygous missense variant in CHRM3 is also associated with familial urinary bladder disease, characterized by hypocontractile bladders and mydriasis (Beaman2019A).

Alterations in CHRM3 expression have been implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions. A regulatory variant, rs115455482, is associated with cannabis-induced hallucinations in European Americans, linked to lower CHRM3 expression in the thalamus and putamen (Cheng2019A). This variant may contribute to an excitatory-to-inhibitory imbalance, predisposing individuals to cannabis-induced psychosis or schizophrenia (Cheng2019A). Additionally, CHRM3 is involved in colon tumorigenesis, with its ablation leading to reduced tumor cell proliferation and altered expression of genes involved in cancer pathways (Cheng2014Divergent).

## Interactions
CHRM3, or cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3, is involved in several interactions that play a significant role in colon cancer progression. It is known to interact with βPix, a Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor encoded by the ARHGEF7 gene. This interaction is facilitated by the activation of CHRM3, which promotes the binding of βPix to β-catenin, a key player in cell proliferation and transcriptional activity in colon cancer cells (Cheng2023Muscarinic). The binding of βPix to β-catenin is enhanced by muscarinic receptor agonists such as acetylcholine and carbamylcholine, and this process is blocked by atropine, indicating the involvement of muscarinic receptor pathways (Cheng2023Muscarinic).

The interaction between CHRM3 and βPix is mediated through kinase-dependent mechanisms, particularly involving protein kinase C (PKC) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which are crucial for the binding process (Cheng2023Muscarinic). This interaction is significant as it influences the transcriptional activity of β-catenin and affects gene expression related to cancer progression, such as PTGS2, which encodes cyclooxygenase-2 (Cheng2023Muscarinic). These interactions highlight the potential of CHRM3 as a therapeutic target in colon cancer.
