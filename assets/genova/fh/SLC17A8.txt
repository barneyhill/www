# SLC17A8

## Overview
The SLC17A8 gene encodes the protein known as vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3), which is a member of the solute carrier family and functions as a transmembrane transporter. VGLUT3 is primarily involved in the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles, a critical step in glutamatergic neurotransmission. This protein is predominantly expressed in the inner hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea, where it plays an essential role in auditory processing by facilitating the release of glutamate onto auditory-nerve terminals. The proper functioning of VGLUT3 is crucial for normal hearing, and its absence or dysfunction can lead to significant auditory impairments, as evidenced by studies on knockout mice and human genetic mutations (Ruel2008Impairment; Seal2008Sensorineural).

## Function
The SLC17A8 gene encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3), which is crucial for the proper functioning of inner hair cells (IHCs) in the cochlea. VGLUT3 is responsible for the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles, a process essential for glutamatergic neurotransmission. In healthy human cells, this transporter accumulates glutamate in the synaptic vesicles of sensory IHCs, facilitating its release onto receptors of auditory-nerve terminals. This release is vital for auditory coding at the IHC synapse, playing a significant role in normal hearing function (Ruel2008Impairment).

VGLUT3 is strongly and selectively expressed in cochlear IHCs, underscoring its importance in auditory function. The absence of VGLUT3, as observed in Slc17a8 knockout mice, results in profound hearing loss due to the lack of synaptic transmitter release from the IHCs at the first synapse of the auditory pathway. Despite normal synaptic-vesicle turnover, the absence of glutamate loading and release leads to hearing impairment, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining auditory nerve responses and overall hearing function (Ruel2008Impairment).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC17A8 gene, which encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3), are associated with various forms of hearing loss. One notable condition linked to mutations in this gene is DFNA25, an autosomal-dominant form of progressive, high-frequency nonsyndromic deafness. A specific heterozygous missense mutation, c.632C/T (p.A211V), has been identified in affected individuals, leading to a phenotype similar to presbycusis, a common age-related hearing loss (Ruel2008Impairment). This mutation is not found in control populations, indicating its potential pathogenic role (Ruel2008Impairment).

In addition to missense mutations, a novel splicing mutation, c.763+1G>T, has been identified in a Korean family with hereditary hearing loss. This mutation disrupts normal splicing, resulting in exon skipping and is associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (Ryu2017Identification).

The absence of VGLUT3 in knockout mice leads to sensorineural deafness, highlighting its critical role in auditory neurotransmission. These mice also exhibit seizures, suggesting that VGLUT3 may play a role in cortical excitability and neurological function (Seal2008Sensorineural).
