# C19orf38

## Overview
C19orf38, also known as FAM120A, is a gene located on chromosome 19 that encodes a protein involved in RNA processing and regulation. The protein, referred to as chromosome 19 open reading frame 38, is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a crucial role in mRNA stabilization and translation, which are essential for proper gene expression and cellular function. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell survival and stress responses, by influencing mRNA dynamics. C19orf38 has been associated with immune responses and inflammation, particularly in the context of coronary artery disease and CD56-negative natural killer cells, indicating its potential role in immune regulation (Depuydt2020Microanatomy; Cocker2022CD56negative). Additionally, its expression patterns in diseases such as uterine leiomyomas and adrenocortical carcinoma suggest its involvement in transcriptional heterogeneity and complex interaction networks, highlighting its clinical significance (Mehine2016Integrated; Situ2023Systematic).

## Function
C19orf38, also known as FAM120A, is a gene located on chromosome 19 that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in RNA processing and regulation. This protein plays a significant role in mRNA stabilization and translation, which are crucial for maintaining proper gene expression and cellular function. The protein encoded by C19orf38 is active in the cytoplasm, where it may influence cell survival and stress responses by participating in the regulation of mRNA dynamics.

In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), C19orf38 has been identified as one of the genes with differential expression in macrophage populations, suggesting its involvement in immune responses and inflammation, which are key processes in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (Depuydt2020Microanatomy). Additionally, in the study of CD56-negative natural killer (NK) cells, C19orf38 is among the genes with higher expression in a subset of these cells, which are associated with cell activation and innate immune responses, indicating its potential role in immune regulation (Cocker2022CD56negative).

While the specific molecular activities of C19orf38 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in RNA processing and immune response pathways highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological stressors.

## Clinical Significance
C19orf38 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In coronary artery disease (CAD), C19orf38 is part of a group of genes that show significant overlap with CAD-associated genes, particularly in macrophage populations. This suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, as it is differentially expressed in carotid plaques (Depuydt2020Microanatomy).

In uterine leiomyomas, C19orf38 is uniquely expressed in the HMGA2 subtype, with a significant fold change, indicating its involvement in the transcriptional heterogeneity of these tumors (Mehine2016Integrated). This expression pattern suggests that C19orf38 may be part of distinct driver pathways in leiomyomas.

In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), C19orf38 is frequently altered as a neighboring gene of BRD4, with a high alteration frequency. This association with BRD4 suggests that C19orf38 may play a role in the complex interaction networks involved in ACC, potentially affecting prognosis and disease progression (Situ2023Systematic).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of C19orf38 in various conditions, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in these diseases.
