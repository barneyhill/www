# KRCC1

## Overview
KRCC1, or lysine rich coiled-coil 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle regulation. The KRCC1 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil structure, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and 14-3-3 proteins, playing a pivotal role in the CHK1-mediated checkpoint pathway. This protein is essential for maintaining genomic stability by promoting homologous recombination repair (HRR) through RAD51 foci formation. KRCC1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of mitotic entry and replication fork management. Its dysregulation is associated with various malignancies, including ovarian cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1).

## Function
The KRCC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle regulation in healthy human cells. KRCC1 is involved in the CHK1-mediated checkpoint, where it associates with CHK1 and 14-3-3 proteins in response to DNA damage. This interaction is influenced by ATR-mediated phosphorylation of CHK1, facilitating CHK1 autophosphorylation at S296, which is essential for the degradation of CDC25A, a key process in cell cycle regulation (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1). KRCC1 also impacts homologous recombination repair (HRR), a critical DNA repair mechanism, by promoting RAD51 foci formation, which is essential for efficient DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1).

In addition to its role in DDR, KRCC1 is implicated in facilitating proper mitotic entry. Silencing KRCC1 leads to premature mitotic entry and increased G1 53BP1 nuclear bodies, indicating under-replicated DNA, suggesting KRCC1's involvement in replication fork management and the replication machinery (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1). KRCC1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell cycle regulation and the maintenance of cellular integrity (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1).

## Clinical Significance
KRCC1 (lysine rich coiled-coil 1) is implicated in various malignancies, including ovarian cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor overall survival (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1). Alterations in KRCC1 expression can impact DNA repair mechanisms, particularly homologous recombination repair (HRR), which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Silencing KRCC1 leads to a significant decrease in HRR efficiency, as evidenced by reduced RAD51 foci formation, suggesting that KRCC1 is important for efficient DNA repair processes (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1).

KRCC1's role in the DNA damage response (DDR) is critical, as it regulates the CHK1-mediated checkpoint. Silencing KRCC1 results in increased replication stress and defective checkpoint responses, which can lead to increased DNA damage and premature mitotic entry (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1). This defective checkpoint function is further evidenced by the stabilization of CDC25A and increased CDK1 activity, which are not solely due to CHK1 inhibition (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1).

The clinical significance of KRCC1 is underscored by its potential as a therapeutic target. Targeting KRCC1 increases apoptosis and reduces clonal and tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that KRCC1 inhibition could be a viable strategy in cancer treatment (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1).

## Interactions
KRCC1 is involved in several critical interactions within the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. It physically interacts with checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), a key player in DDR, particularly when DNA damage is present. This interaction is dependent on ATR-mediated phosphorylation of CHK1, which is crucial for CHK1 activation and efficient checkpoint function (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1). KRCC1 also associates with 14-3-3 proteins, which are known to interact with CHK1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This interaction is important for the phosphorylation and degradation of CDC25A, a process essential for cell cycle regulation (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1).

KRCC1 impacts homologous recombination repair (HRR) by facilitating RAD51 recombinase foci formation, which is essential for DNA repair. Silencing KRCC1 leads to a decrease in RAD51 foci formation, indicating a regulatory role in HRR (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1). KRCC1 is also involved in the replication machinery, as it can be cross-linked to newly synthesized DNA, suggesting its localization to replication forks and potential interactions with nascent DNA (NeizerAshun2022KRCC1). These interactions highlight KRCC1's role in modulating the DDR and HRR pathways, as well as its involvement in cell cycle regulation.
