# PIK3IP1

## Overview
PIK3IP1, or phosphoinositide-3-kinase interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the negative regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. This protein, also known as TrIP, plays a crucial role in modulating cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and survival by interacting with the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, thereby inhibiting its activity. The structural features of PIK3IP1, including an extracellular kringle domain and an intracellular p85-like domain, facilitate its function as a regulatory protein. PIK3IP1 is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune regulation, with significant roles in T and B cell function. Its dysregulation is associated with various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Uche2018PIK3IP1TrIP; Zhu2007PI3K; He2008PIK3IP1).

## Structure
PIK3IP1, also known as TrIP, is a transmembrane protein that plays a role in inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The protein is characterized by several distinct structural domains. It contains an extracellular kringle domain, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions and is suggested to facilitate oligomerization. This domain is crucial for the protein's inhibitory function on the PI3K pathway (Uche2018PIK3IP1TrIP; Zhu2007PI3K).

The intracellular portion of PIK3IP1 includes a domain homologous to the inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, referred to as the p85-like domain. This domain is essential for binding to the p110 subunit of PI3K, thereby inhibiting its activity (Uche2018PIK3IP1TrIP; Zhu2007PI3K). The protein also features a transmembrane domain, which anchors it within the cell membrane (Zhu2007PI3K).

PIK3IP1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including potential glycosylation, which may influence its function and stability. The protein's structure allows it to interact with PI3K subunits, modulating signaling pathways involved in cell growth and survival (Uche2018PIK3IP1TrIP; Zhu2007PI3K).

## Function
PIK3IP1, also known as phosphoinositide-3-kinase interacting protein 1, functions as a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway, which is crucial for cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and survival. It achieves this by binding to the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, thereby reducing its activity and modulating PI3K signaling pathways (Zhu2007PI3K; He2008PIK3IP1). This interaction is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive cell proliferation, which can lead to cancer (He2008PIK3IP1).

In T cells, PIK3IP1 inhibits the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is important for regulating T cell activation. The protein's expression is down-regulated upon T cell activation, correlating with increased PI3K signaling, suggesting a role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Uche2018PIK3IP1TrIP). PIK3IP1 is also involved in B cell function, where it limits PI3K signaling during B-T cell interactions, promoting extrafollicular class switching in T-dependent immune responses (Ottens2020PIK3IP1).

PIK3IP1 is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with PI3K to modulate its activity, playing a critical role in controlling cell growth and preventing tumorigenesis (He2008PIK3IP1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PIK3IP1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PIK3IP1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its overexpression in a mouse model significantly reduced liver tumor incidence, while its expression was found to be reduced in human HCC samples, correlating with increased PI3K activity and higher proliferation indices in tumors (He2008PIK3IP1). The suppression of PIK3IP1 by microRNA-19a-3p in HCC is associated with larger tumor size and poor survival outcomes, suggesting that the miR-19a-3p-PIK3IP1-AKT pathway could be a potential therapeutic target (Sun2020MicroRNA19a3p).

In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), PIK3IP1 expression is downregulated in proliferating cells. Its upregulation through CDK4/CDK6 inhibition sensitizes MCL cells to apoptosis induced by PI3Kδ inhibitors, indicating its role in mediating sensitivity to these treatments (Chiron2013Induction). In the context of immune regulation, PIK3IP1 acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Its deficiency enhances antitumor T-cell responses, suggesting that modulating its expression could have therapeutic potential in cancer immunotherapy (Chen2019Pik3ip1). These findings highlight the importance of PIK3IP1 in various cancer types and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
PIK3IP1 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase interacting protein 1) is known to interact with the PI3K pathway by binding to the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, thereby negatively regulating its activity. This interaction is facilitated through a domain in PIK3IP1 that is homologous to the iSH2 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, allowing PIK3IP1 to bind to p110 independently of p85 (Zhu2007PI3K). PIK3IP1 can form a complex with p110 and p85, but it does not prevent the interaction between p85 and p110, indicating that these proteins can coexist in a ternary complex (Zhu2007PI3K).

In T cells, PIK3IP1 interacts with proximal signaling adaptors LAT and SLP76, affecting downstream TCR signaling pathways, including ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. This interaction suggests that PIK3IP1 may mediate the degradation of SLP76 through a proteasome-dependent pathway (Chen2019Pik3ip1). PIK3IP1 also interacts with the PI3Kγ-Akt axis, particularly in the context of myocardial ischemia, where it binds to PI3Kγ and regulates programmed cell death (Park2022AntiIschemic). These interactions highlight PIK3IP1's role as a critical regulator of PI3K signaling in various cellular contexts.
