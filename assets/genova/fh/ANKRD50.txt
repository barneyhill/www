# ANKRD50

## Overview
ANKRD50 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 50, which is integral to the recycling of nutrient transporters within human cells. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, including multiple ankyrin repeats and distinct domains that facilitate its interactions with the SNX27-retromer-WASH complex. ANKRD50 plays a pivotal role in the endocytic recycling of transmembrane proteins, such as glucose and amino acid transporters, by ensuring their proper localization to the cell surface and preventing their mis-sorting into lysosomal compartments (Kvainickas2017Retromer). The protein's interactions with components of the retromer complex, including SNX27 and VPS35, are crucial for its function in cellular trafficking processes (Kvainickas2017Retromer). While ANKRD50 has been implicated in various diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and certain cancers, its precise clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated (DelgadoVega2018Whole; suresh2012resistance).

## Structure
The ANKRD50 protein is characterized by a complex structure comprising several distinct domains. Its open reading frame reveals a highly folded, globular N-terminal domain (D1) consisting of 476 amino acids, followed by 19 ankyrin repeats forming a large U-shaped domain (D2) of 631 amino acids. The structure concludes with two extended helical domains (D3 and D4) of 179 and 136 amino acids, respectively, which are often considered a single C-terminal domain due to their small size and structural similarity (Kvainickas2017Retromer).

The N-terminal domain is crucial for binding to the WASH-complex, specifically interacting with the FAM21 subunit. The C-terminal domains, particularly D4, are important for interactions with the retromer complex and SNX27, with the PDZ domain playing a significant role in these interactions (Kvainickas2017Retromer). A specific binding motif between amino acids 1295 and 1320, including key residues Y1299, E1300, M1301, and F1304, is essential for binding to the VPS35 subunit of the retromer (Kvainickas2017Retromer).

The ankyrin repeats in the middle region are vital for the protein's function, as their deletion disrupts the recycling of certain nutrient transporters (Kvainickas2017Retromer). The protein's localization to retromer-decorated endosomes through its C-terminal domains is crucial for its role in recycling specific cargo (Kvainickas2017Retromer).

## Function
ANKRD50 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the recycling of nutrient transporters in human cells, particularly through its interactions with the SNX27-retromer-WASH complex. This protein is essential for the endocytic recycling of various transmembrane proteins, including the glucose transporter GLUT1 and amino acid transporters of the SLC1A family, such as SLC1A4 (Kvainickas2017Retromer). ANKRD50 localizes to perinuclear endosomal vesicles and is involved in maintaining the proper localization of these transporters to the cell surface, preventing their mis-sorting into lysosomal compartments (Kvainickas2017Retromer; McGough2014Identification).

The protein interacts with multiple components of the SNX27/retromer/WASH machinery, with its N-terminal domain binding to the FAM21 head region within the WASH complex, and its C-terminal PDZ ligand engaging SNX27. ANKRD50 also interacts with the retromer subunit VPS29 via a C-terminal motif (Kvainickas2017Retromer). These interactions facilitate the trafficking of PDZ ligand-bearing transmembrane proteins and several integrins from endosomes to the plasma membrane (Kvainickas2017Retromer). The protein's role in recycling is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function, and its loss or dysfunction can lead to sorting defects, potentially contributing to disease processes (Kvainickas2017Retromer).

## Clinical Significance
The ANKRD50 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or interactions. In the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ANKRD50 is mentioned as having a possibly deleterious variant, although its specific clinical significance in SLE or related autoimmune diseases is not detailed (DelgadoVega2018Whole). In the study of eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa, a notable variant associated with ANKRD50 was identified, but it did not reach genome-wide significance, leaving its clinical impact uncertain (Himmerich2019Genetic).

In Parkinson's disease research, ANKRD50 is categorized as a 'peripheral' gene, indicating it has no known interactions in the ResNet 5.0 database, suggesting it may not be central to known PD pathways but could still play a role in the disease (Moran2008Towards). In the context of tongue cancer, ANKRD50 is noted for its upregulation in epidermal stem cells and its association with treatment-resistant tumors, supporting the concept of field cancerization, which may contribute to therapy ineffectiveness and recurrence (suresh2012resistance). Despite these associations, the specific clinical significance of ANKRD50 mutations remains largely unexplored.

## Interactions
ANKRD50 is involved in a complex network of interactions with components of the SNX27-retromer-WASH machinery, crucial for the recycling of nutrient transporters. It directly interacts with SNX27, VPS35, and the FAM21 head region within the WASH-complex. The C-terminal PDZ ligand of ANKRD50 engages SNX27, while the C-terminal D4 binds to VPS35, and the N-terminal D1 engages the FAM21 head region (Kvainickas2017Retromer). These interactions are essential for ANKRD50's function in recycling nutrient transporters like SLC1A4 (Kvainickas2017Retromer).

ANKRD50's interaction with the retromer complex is primarily through the VPS35 subunit, with specific amino acids Y1299, E1300, M1301, and F1304 being crucial for binding (Kvainickas2017Retromer). The protein also interacts with the gamma-tubulin ring complex and FKBP15, which may have functional relevance in retromer and WASH-complex mediated sorting (Kvainickas2017Retromer).

The interactions of ANKRD50 are cooperative, as mutations in one binding site can affect the binding of others, indicating a high degree of interdependence among its interactions with the retromer, SNX27, and the WASH-complex (Kvainickas2017Retromer).
