# MBOAT2

## Overview
MBOAT2, or membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism, specifically functioning as an enzyme that catalyzes the acylation of lysophospholipids. This protein is categorized as a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase and plays a critical role in the remodeling of phospholipids, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and fluidity of cellular membranes. The enzymatic activity of MBOAT2 is crucial for various physiological processes, including energy homeostasis and protection against ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death. MBOAT2 is expressed in several human tissues, such as the brain and reproductive organs, indicating its involvement in diverse biological functions. Additionally, the gene's circular RNA form, circMBOAT2, has been implicated in cancer biology, influencing lipid metabolism and tumor progression through interactions with proteins like PTBP1 and FASN (Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Pierce2023A; Yu2023CircRNA).

## Function
MBOAT2 is an enzyme involved in the acylation of lysophospholipids, a critical process for maintaining the composition and function of cell membranes. It specifically catalyzes reactions with lyso-PC, lyso-PE, and lyso-PS, using oleoyl-CoA as its preferred acyl donor (Pierce2023A). This activity is essential for lipid remodeling, which impacts membrane integrity and fluidity, crucial for various cellular processes. MBOAT2 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Pierce2023A).

In healthy human cells, MBOAT2 is expressed in tissues such as the brain, testis, epididymis, and ovary, indicating its role in diverse physiological processes, including chondrogenic differentiation in skeletal development (Pierce2023A). The enzyme's activity in modifying the fatty acid composition of phospholipids provides some protection against ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death associated with lipid peroxidation (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). This protective role highlights its importance in maintaining cellular health and preventing oxidative damage. Overall, MBOAT2's function in lipid acylation and remodeling is vital for cellular membrane dynamics and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
MBOAT2 is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels influencing disease progression and prognosis. In pancreatic cancer, MBOAT2 expression is upregulated, correlating with increased cancer cell proliferation and a worse prognosis (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). Similarly, in invasive breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma, MBOAT2 expression is elevated, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). Conversely, MBOAT2 is downregulated in renal cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and cutaneous melanoma, indicating a complex role in cancer biology that may vary depending on the cancer type (Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

The circular RNA form of MBOAT2, circMBOAT2, is also significant in cancer. In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), circMBOAT2 is frequently downregulated and is associated with tumor size. It promotes ICC progression by stabilizing PTBP1, which facilitates the cytoplasmic export and translation of FASN mRNA, a key enzyme in lipid metabolism (Yu2023CircRNA). In pancreatic cancer, circMBOAT2 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-433-3p, influencing glutamine metabolism and tumor progression (Zhou2021CircMBOAT2). These findings suggest that both MBOAT2 and its circular RNA form play crucial roles in cancer progression and may serve as potential therapeutic targets.

## Interactions
MBOAT2, a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase, is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the acylation of lysophospholipids. In the context of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), circMBOAT2, a circular RNA derived from the MBOAT2 gene, has been shown to interact with polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1). This interaction is crucial as circMBOAT2 stabilizes PTBP1, preventing its ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation. PTBP1, in turn, facilitates the cytoplasmic export of fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA, enhancing its translation into protein, which is essential for lipid metabolism reprogramming in ICC cells (Yu2023CircRNA).

CircMBOAT2 does not function as a miRNA sponge or translate into a protein but instead interacts with proteins like PTBP1 and FASN. These interactions have been confirmed through various assays, including RNA pull-down and western blot analyses, which demonstrated the binding of PTBP1 and FASN to circMBOAT2 (Yu2023CircRNA). The interaction between circMBOAT2 and PTBP1 is significant for ICC progression, as it influences lipid metabolism and redox homeostasis, suggesting that targeting the circMBOAT2/PTBP1/FASN pathway could be a potential therapeutic strategy (Yu2023CircRNA).
