# WDR75

## Overview
WDR75 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 75 protein, which is integral to ribosome biogenesis in human cells. The protein is characterized by the presence of 13 WD40 repeats, which form β-propeller domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, making WDR75 a crucial component in multiprotein complexes. Predominantly localized in the nucleolus, the WD repeat domain 75 protein plays a significant role in pre-rRNA transcription and the maintenance of RPA194, a subunit of RNA polymerase I, thereby influencing p53 regulation and cellular homeostasis. The absence or dysfunction of WDR75 can lead to nucleolar disintegration, triggering ribosomal biogenesis stress and activating pathways that stabilize p53, resulting in cellular senescence. This highlights the gene's protective role against cellular stress and its potential implications in conditions characterized by disrupted cellular proliferation, such as cancer (Moudry2021RNA-interference).

## Structure
WDR75 is a human protein characterized by the presence of 13 WD40 repeats, which are short structural domains of approximately 40 amino acids. These repeats form β-propeller domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and serve as scaffolds in multiprotein complexes (Moudry2021RNA-interference). The WD40 repeats contribute to the tertiary structure of WDR75, facilitating its role in ribosome biogenesis and p53 regulation. WDR75 is the human homologue of the yeast U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 17 (Utp17), sharing 16% sequence identity, although it contains more WD40 repeats than Utp17 (Moudry2021RNA-interference).

WDR75 is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, where it plays a significant role in pre-rRNA transcription and maintaining physiological levels of RPA194, a subunit of RNA polymerase I (Moudry2021RNA-interference). The absence of WDR75 leads to nucleolar disintegration and triggers a sequence of molecular events resulting in p53-dependent cell proliferation blockade and cellular senescence (Moudry2021RNA-interference). While specific post-translational modifications or splice variants of WDR75 are not detailed in the available context, its structural features and nucleolar localization underscore its importance in cellular processes related to ribosome biogenesis.

## Function
WDR75 is a crucial gene involved in ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental process for protein synthesis in human cells. The WDR75 protein is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, where it plays a significant role in the assembly and maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal subunits. It is identified as a ribosome biogenesis factor (RBF) and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the levels of RPA194, a subunit of RNA polymerase I, which is critical for p53 homeostasis (Moudry2021RNA-interference).

The absence of WDR75 leads to nucleolar disintegration, triggering ribosomal biogenesis stress and activating the IRBC pathway. This results in the stabilization of p53 and the induction of cellular senescence, highlighting WDR75's protective role against cellular stress (Moudry2021RNA-interference). WDR75 knockdown in human cells results in the stabilization of p53 and induction of the CDK inhibitor p21, leading to reduced cell proliferation and altered cell cycle progression (Moudry2021RNA-interference).

WDR75 is structurally similar to the yeast U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 17 (Utp17) and contains 13 WD40 repeats, which facilitate protein interactions in multiprotein complexes, underscoring its role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular stress responses (Moudry2021RNA-interference).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the WDR75 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of ribosome biogenesis and p53 regulation. WDR75 is crucial for pre-rRNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis, and its deficiency can lead to ribosome biogenesis stress, resulting in the stabilization of the p53 protein. This stabilization occurs through the RPL5/RPL11/5S rRNA pathway, which inhibits HDM2-mediated p53 turnover, leading to cellular senescence and impaired cell proliferation (Moudry2021RNA-interference). 

The depletion of WDR75 triggers a molecular response that includes the redistribution of nucleolar markers and the formation of nucleolar caps, indicating ribosomal stress (Moudry2021RNA-interference). This stress response is associated with the activation of p53 and its transcriptional target, p21, which blocks cell proliferation and induces cellular senescence (Moudry2021RNA-interference). 

While the study does not directly address specific diseases associated with WDR75 mutations, the gene's role in ribosome biogenesis and p53 regulation suggests potential links to conditions characterized by disrupted cellular growth and proliferation, such as cancer (Moudry2021RNA-interference).

## Interactions
WDR75 is a nucleolar protein that plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is a structural and functional homologue of the yeast U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 17 (Utp17) and contains 13 WD40 repeats, which serve as protein interaction scaffolds (Moudry2021RNA-interference). WDR75 predominantly localizes in the nucleolus and is involved in pre-rRNA synthesis and early nucleolar pre-rRNA processing (Moudry2021RNA-interference).

WDR75 interacts with the RPL5/RPL11/5S rRNA complex, which is crucial for the stabilization of the p53 protein. This interaction is part of the ribosome biogenesis stress-response pathway, where WDR75 knockdown leads to the association of RPL5 with HDM2, resulting in p53 stabilization and activation (Moudry2021RNA-interference). The absence of WDR75 causes nucleolar disintegration and triggers cellular senescence (Moudry2021RNA-interference).

WDR75 is also involved in the regulation of the p53-p21 axis, affecting cell cycle progression and ribosome biogenesis. Its depletion impacts nascent RNA production and destabilizes RPA194, a subunit of RNA Pol I, indicating its crucial role in rRNA transcription (Moudry2021RNA-interference).
