# MYO7B

## Overview
MYO7B is a gene that encodes the unconventional motor protein myosin VIIb, which is primarily expressed in the microvilli of transporting epithelial cells, such as those found in the kidney and intestine. Myosin VIIb is a member of the myosin superfamily, characterized by its unique structural features, including a conserved myosin head domain, multiple IQ domains, and a tail region containing MyTH4 and FERM domains. These structural elements enable myosin VIIb to function as a motor protein with a high duty ratio, allowing it to remain bound to actin filaments and maintain tension within cells. This property is crucial for its role in organizing and stabilizing microvilli, as well as facilitating the transport of components within the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) to the tips of microvilli. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as USH1C and ANKS4B, are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of microvilli and stereocilia. Mutations in MYO7B can lead to disrupted microvillar organization and are implicated in various diseases, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (He2019Myosin; Chen2001MyosinVIIb; Weck2016Myosin7b).

## Structure
The MYO7B gene encodes the myosin-VIIb protein, an unconventional myosin with a distinct molecular structure. The protein features a conserved myosin head domain, which includes a unique 19 amino acid insert forming a variable loop at the '50-20' junction (Chen2001MyosinVIIb). The neck region contains five IQ domains, spanning amino acids 761-877, which likely bind regulatory light chains such as calmodulin (Chen2001MyosinVIIb). Unlike myosin-VIIa, MYO7B lacks a coiled-coil domain following the IQ domains (Chen2001MyosinVIIb).

The tail of MYO7B includes two MyTH4 domains, each approximately 150 amino acids long, and two FERM domains. These MyTH4 domains are largely alpha-helical and contain conserved regions such as MGD, LRDE, RGW, and ELEA, with the LRDE sequence forming an amphipathic helix (Chen2001MyosinVIIb). The FERM domains are involved in linking cell-surface proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and are similar to those found in talin, ezrin, radixin, and moesin (Chen2001MyosinVIIb). Additionally, MYO7B contains a predicted SH3 domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich motifs (Chen2001MyosinVIIb).

The MYO7B protein is primarily expressed in the microvilli of transporting epithelial cells in the kidney and intestine (Chen2001MyosinVIIb).

## Function
MYO7B encodes myosin VIIb, a motor protein that plays a crucial role in the organization and function of microvilli in epithelial cells, particularly in the intestine and kidney. Myosin VIIb is a component of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), which is essential for the proper localization of IMAC components at the distal tips of microvilli. This localization is critical for normal microvillar organization and brush border assembly in enterocytes (Weck2016Myosin7b).

Myosin VIIb is characterized by a high duty ratio, allowing it to remain strongly bound to actin filaments, which is important for generating and maintaining tension within the cell. This property suggests that myosin VIIb functions as a tether or anchor, stabilizing the structure of microvilli and facilitating the transport of IMAC components to microvillar tips (Henn2005Vertebrate; Houdusse2021The).

The protein's motor domain is necessary for its function, and mutations affecting its motor activity can impair the targeting of adhesion factors to microvillar tips, leading to disrupted microvillar organization (Weck2016Myosin7b). Myosin VIIb's activity is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the brush border, allowing it to withstand mechanical stresses (Houdusse2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MYO7B gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. MYO7B is crucial for the proper organization of microvilli in epithelial cells, and its dysfunction can lead to disrupted microvillar clustering and brush border assembly, which are associated with intestinal diseases such as microvillus inclusion disease (Weck2016Myosin7b). 

The gene also plays a role in the endocytosis of α-synuclein preformed fibrils (α-Syn PFFs), a process linked to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. MYO7B's involvement in this pathway suggests its potential relevance in developing therapies targeting α-Syn endocytosis (Zhang2020A).

Additionally, MYO7B mutations that disrupt its interaction with the USH1C PDZ3 domain can impair the formation of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), leading to a loss of microvillar clustering. This interaction is critical for maintaining microvillar structure, and its disruption may contribute to conditions affecting epithelial cell function (Li2017Structure). 

While MYO7B's role in specific diseases is still being explored, its involvement in these cellular processes highlights its clinical significance.

## Interactions
MYO7B interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its cellular functions. It is involved in the localization of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) to the distal tips of microvilli by interacting with components such as CDHR2, CDHR5, and USH1C. Knockdown of MYO7B results in a significant loss of these components at the microvillar tips, indicating its role in microvillar organization (Weck2016Myosin7b).

MYO7B also forms a tripartite complex with USH1C and ANKS4B through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This complex is essential for the structural integrity of microvilli and stereocilia, as it forms condensed molecular assemblies that provide stable anchorage for other proteins. Mutations that disrupt these interactions can impair the formation of these assemblies, potentially leading to hearing and vision impairments (He2019Myosin).

The interaction between MYO7B and USH1C involves the binding of MYO7B's C-terminal MyTH4-FERM domain to the PDZ3 domain of USH1C. This interaction is characterized by a unique binding mode, which is also observed in similar protein complexes in hair cell stereocilia (Li2017Structure).
