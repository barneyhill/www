# GPC4

## Overview
GPC4, or glypican 4, is a gene that encodes the glypican-4 protein, a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These proteins are characterized by their attachment to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, classifying them as membrane-associated proteoglycans (Filmus2001Glypicans; Fransson2004Novel). Glypican-4 plays a crucial role in modulating cell signaling pathways, particularly the Wnt signaling pathways, which are vital for various cellular processes including development, differentiation, and proliferation (Sakane2012Localization). The protein is involved in synaptic function and neural differentiation, as well as maintaining endothelial barrier function, highlighting its importance in both neural and vascular systems (Urschel2023The; Oikari2020HSPGs). Alterations in GPC4 expression have been linked to several clinical conditions, including Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome and certain cancers, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Furini2021Expression; DiMaio2017Familial).

## Structure
Glypican-4 (GPC4) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The primary structure of GPC4 consists of a 556-amino-acid core protein, which includes three heparan sulfate (HS) chains attached at specific serine residues: S494, S498, and S500 (Li2020The). The core protein is characterized by 14 conserved cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming disulfide linkages, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Filmus2001Glypicans; Fransson2004Novel). 

GPC4 features an N-terminal secretory signal sequence and a hydrophobic C-terminal region for GPI anchor attachment, facilitating its membrane localization (Kaur2019Role). The heparan sulfate chains are attached near the juxtamembrane region, which is typical for glypicans (Kaur2019Role). GPC4 does not exhibit a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. 

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is essential for its function in cell signaling pathways, such as Wnt signaling (Sakane2012Localization). GPC4 can exist in a membrane-anchored form or as a soluble ectodomain, the latter being released by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Sakane2012Localization).

## Function
Glypican-4 (GPC4) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a significant role in modulating Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, GPC4 is involved in both the β-catenin-dependent and -independent Wnt signaling pathways. It localizes to different membrane microdomains, such as lipid rafts and non-lipid rafts, which influences its regulatory functions. When localized to lipid rafts, GPC4 enhances the Wnt3a-β-catenin pathway by facilitating the phosphorylation and internalization of LRP6, a key step in activating the pathway (Sakane2012Localization). In non-lipid raft microdomains, GPC4 enhances the Wnt5a-β-catenin-independent pathway by promoting the internalization of receptors like Fz2 and Ror2, which activates Rac, a small GTPase involved in cell signaling (Sakane2012Localization).

GPC4 is also expressed in endothelial cells, where it contributes to maintaining endothelial barrier function and modulates leukocyte adhesion, suggesting a role in vascular homeostasis and atheroprotection (Urschel2023The). Additionally, GPC4 is involved in synaptic function and neural differentiation, as evidenced by its role in synapse formation and interaction with presynaptic proteins (Oikari2020HSPGs).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPC4 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. GPC4, located in the Xq26.2 region, is associated with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS), a disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal overgrowth. Deletions involving GPC4, often in conjunction with the GPC3 gene, have been linked to this syndrome, leading to features such as macroglossia, macrosomia, and various congenital anomalies (DiMaio2017Familial). However, duplications in the GPC4 region can result in contrasting phenotypes, such as microcephaly and undergrowth, suggesting complex interactions with other genetic regions like Xq26.3 (Karna2019Xq26).

In cancer, GPC4 expression is notably upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues, where it contributes to chemoresistance and the stem cell-like properties of cancer cells. Knockdown of GPC4 has been shown to reduce the invasive capacity of these cells, indicating its role as an upstream regulator of cancer stemness (Furini2021Expression). Despite its overexpression in pancreatic cancer, GPC4 does not significantly affect survival outcomes in early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Liu2020Prognostic). In hepatocellular carcinoma, GPC4 expression does not significantly differ between tumor and normal tissues, nor does it have a consistent impact on overall survival (Wang2021Distinct).

## Interactions
Glypican 4 (GPC4) is involved in various protein interactions that influence signaling pathways and synapse formation. GPC4 interacts with presynaptic receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (RPTPd), which is crucial for the release of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1) from presynaptic terminals. This interaction is necessary for the recruitment of AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 to synapses, facilitating synapse formation in the central nervous system (FarhyTselnicker2017AstrocyteSecreted). GPC4 also interacts with neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1) and GluA1 AMPA receptors, where the interaction between NP1 and GluA1 is essential for GPC4-induced synaptogenesis (FarhyTselnicker2017AstrocyteSecreted).

In the context of Wnt signaling, GPC4 interacts with Wnt3a and Wnt5a, enhancing both β-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways. GPC4 localizes to lipid raft microdomains to promote the formation of complexes between Wnt3a and its receptors, facilitating pathway activation. It also enhances Wnt5a signaling by promoting receptor-mediated endocytosis and Rac activation (Sakane2012Localization). GPC4 can form complexes with Wnt and its receptor, Frizzled, acting as a nonsignaling coreceptor to stimulate Wnt signaling by presenting the ligand to the receptor (Filmus20123.7).
