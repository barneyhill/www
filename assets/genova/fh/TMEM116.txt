# TMEM116

## Overview
TMEM116, or transmembrane protein 116, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including membrane association and intracellular signaling. The protein exists in three isoforms—TMEM116_ORF1, TMEM116_ORF2, and TMEM116_ORF3—resulting from alternative splicing events, each with distinct subcellular localizations and functions. TMEM116_ORF1 and ORF2 are primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, while ORF3 is localized to mitochondria, suggesting diverse roles in cellular homeostasis and function (Wesoly2024Structural). The protein is implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and developmental processes, and it interacts with key signaling pathways such as the PDK1-AKT-FOXO3A pathway, influencing cell proliferation and migration (Wesoly2024Structural). TMEM116's expression and activity have clinical significance, particularly in cancer and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Majarian2021Multiomics; van2021Membrane).

## Structure
TMEM116, or transmembrane protein 116, is characterized by its transmembrane domains, which facilitate its integration into cellular membranes. The protein has three isoforms: TMEM116_ORF1, TMEM116_ORF2, and TMEM116_ORF3, each resulting from alternative splicing events. TMEM116_ORF1 is the longest isoform, consisting of 337 amino acids, while TMEM116_ORF2 and TMEM116_ORF3 are shorter, with 245 and 151 amino acids, respectively (Wesoly2024Structural).

The subcellular localization of these isoforms varies, with TMEM116_ORF1 and TMEM116_ORF2 primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and TMEM116_ORF3 found in mitochondria, likely due to a mitochondrial localization signal on its N-terminus (Wesoly2024Structural). The orientation of TMEM116 within cellular membranes has been studied, revealing that the C-termini of ORF1 and ORF2 face the cytoplasm, while their N-termini are within the ER lumen. TMEM116_ORF3 has an internalized N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus (Wesoly2024Structural).

The protein's structure and function are influenced by these isoforms and their specific localization signals, which may include signal peptides directing them to the ER or other organelles (Wesoly2024Structural).

## Function
TMEM116 is a transmembrane protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in human cells. It exists in three isoforms: TMEM116_ORF1, TMEM116_ORF2, and TMEM116_ORF3. TMEM116_ORF1 and ORF2 are associated with the ER, while TMEM116_ORF3 is found in mitochondria, likely due to a mitochondrial localization signal on its N-terminus (Wesoly2024Structural). The protein's localization suggests it may play roles in membrane association and intracellular signaling or transport processes.

In terms of cellular function, TMEM116 is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, as its overexpression is linked to the deregulation of genes such as ISM1, THBS4, and TNMD, which are associated with this process (Wesoly2024Structural). TMEM116 also influences pathways related to cell adhesion, cell projection processes, and developmental processes, indicating its potential role in maintaining cellular structure and communication (Wesoly2024Structural). Although the specific functions of TMEM116 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in these pathways suggests it plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM116 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), TMEM116 expression is significantly down-regulated, correlating with tumor grade, metastasis, and overall survival. This suggests a potential role in ccRCC pathology, possibly through alternative splicing events and overexpression associated with cell proliferation and protein modification processes (Wesoly2024Structural). 

In melanoma, TMEM116 has been identified as a gene that, when upregulated, enhances the metastatic potential of melanoma cells to the lungs, indicating its role in cancer metastasis (van2021Membrane). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TMEM116 is highly expressed, and its inactivation has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression (Wesoly2024Structural).

TMEM116 is also associated with cardiovascular conditions, as variants at this locus have been linked to mean arterial pressure changes in the context of smoking, indicating a gene-lifestyle interaction (Majarian2021Multiomics). Additionally, TMEM116 has a significant cis-eQTL association with atrial fibrillation, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Sinner2014Integrating).

## Interactions
TMEM116 is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. It is confirmed to be membrane-bound and localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, with its C-terminus directed toward the cytoplasm (Wesoly2024Structural). TMEM116 has been linked to the regulation of the PDK1-AKT-FOXO3A signaling pathway, where its inactivation inhibits this pathway, affecting cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness in human cancer cells (Wesoly2024Structural). 

In the context of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TMEM116 is highly expressed, and its overexpression is associated with the deregulation of genes involved in nervous system development and the negative regulation of angiogenesis (Wesoly2024Structural). Specific genes such as ISM1, THBS4, and TNMD are highlighted in relation to angiogenesis, while ERG, RUNX3, and TNK1 are implicated in tumorigenesis (Wesoly2024Structural).

TMEM116 also shows significant down-regulation at the mRNA level in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumors, with specific exon exclusions observed in ccRCC tissues (Wesoly2024Structural). This suggests a potential role in the etiology of ccRCC, possibly through its involvement in cellular protein modification, glycosylation, and regulation of epithelial cell proliferation (Wesoly2024Structural).
