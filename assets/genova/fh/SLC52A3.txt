# SLC52A3

## Overview
The SLC52A3 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 52 member 3, also known as riboflavin transporter 3 (RFVT3), which is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of riboflavin (vitamin B2) across cell membranes. This protein is crucial for maintaining riboflavin homeostasis, particularly in the intestines, kidneys, and placenta, where it facilitates the absorption of riboflavin from dietary sources (Yoshimatsu2016Disruption; Jin2020Effect). RFVT3 is characterized by its 11 transmembrane domains, which enable its integration into cell membranes and its function in riboflavin uptake (Long2021Promotion; O’Callaghan2019An). Mutations in the SLC52A3 gene can lead to disorders such as Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Gayathri2021Brown−Vialetto−Van). The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as NF-κB, which underscores its role in cellular metabolic processes and its potential impact on disease states (Long2018SLC52A3).

## Structure
The SLC52A3 gene encodes the riboflavin transporter 3 (RFVT3), a protein involved in the transport of riboflavin across cell membranes. The RFVT3 protein is predicted to have 11 transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function in riboflavin uptake (Long2021Promotion; O’Callaghan2019An). These transmembrane domains are integral to the protein's ability to embed in the cell membrane and facilitate the transport process.

The protein is predominantly expressed on the apical side of epithelial cells in the intestine, where it plays a significant role in riboflavin absorption (Gayathri2021Brown−Vialetto−Van). The SLC52A3 protein is a 469-amino acid protein, and its structure includes specific domains that are evolutionarily conserved, indicating their importance in maintaining the protein's function (Khani2021BVVL; Long2021Promotion).

Mutations in the SLC52A3 gene, such as the c.710C>T (p.Ala237Val) mutation, can lead to structural changes that affect the protein's function, potentially causing diseases like Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (Gayathri2021Brown−Vialetto−Van). These mutations often occur in the transmembrane domains, impacting the protein's ability to transport riboflavin effectively (Gayathri2021Brown−Vialetto−Van).

## Function
The SLC52A3 gene encodes the riboflavin transporter 3 (RFVT3), which is crucial for the transport of riboflavin (vitamin B2) across cell membranes, particularly in the intestines, kidneys, and placenta (Yoshimatsu2016Disruption; Jin2020Effect). Riboflavin is essential for cellular growth and function as it is converted into the active coenzyme forms flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are involved in metabolic oxidation-reduction reactions (Yoshimatsu2016Disruption). RFVT3 facilitates the absorption of riboflavin from dietary sources, maintaining riboflavin homeostasis in the body, which is vital for energy production and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids (Haack2012Impaired; O’Callaghan2019An).

In healthy human cells, RFVT3 is primarily active in the cell membranes of intestinal epithelial cells, where it plays a significant role in riboflavin uptake, impacting overall energy homeostasis and metabolic processes (Tan2016Single). The protein's function is critical for normal cellular processes, including mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis, which are essential for maintaining cellular energy levels and metabolic balance (O’Callaghan2019An). Disruption of SLC52A3 can lead to riboflavin deficiency, resulting in metabolic disorders and clinical abnormalities (Yoshimatsu2016Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC52A3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Notably, mutations in SLC52A3 are linked to Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS) and Fazio-Londe syndrome (FLD), rare neurological disorders characterized by symptoms such as pontobulbar palsy, muscle weakness, and sensorineural deafness. A novel mutation, c.710C>T (p.Ala237Val), has been identified in patients with BVVLS, which impairs riboflavin transport and is suggested to be deleterious (Gayathri2021Brown−Vialetto−Van). Another mutation, c.62A>G (p.Asn21Ser), is common in both BVVLS and FLD, indicating shared genetic causes for these conditions (Gayathri2021Brown−Vialetto−Van).

In the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), SLC52A3 expression is upregulated, with distinct expression patterns observed during disease progression. High nuclear expression of the SLC52A3a isoform correlates with poor prognosis, while higher cytoplasmic expression of the SLC52A3b isoform is associated with a favorable prognosis (Long2018SLC52A3). The SLC52A3 gene is also implicated in riboflavin transporter deficiency type 3 (RTD3), where mutations lead to reduced riboflavin transport, affecting energy-demanding tissues like the nervous system (O’Callaghan2019An). These findings underscore the gene's significance in both cancer prognosis and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
The SLC52A3 gene, encoding the riboflavin transporter 3, is primarily involved in the transport of riboflavin across cell membranes. Its expression is regulated by the transcription factors NF-κB p65 and Rel-B, which bind to a specific NF-κB-binding site within the TBS3 element of the SLC52A3 5′-flanking region. This binding is crucial for the activation of SLC52A3 transcription, particularly in response to TNFα stimulation, which activates the NF-κB signaling pathway (Long2018SLC52A3). The study demonstrated that the use of NF-κB inhibitors like QNZ or JSH-23 decreases SLC52A3 expression, indicating the dependency of SLC52A3 transcription on NF-κB activity (Long2018SLC52A3).

While the context does not provide specific information on direct physical interactions of the SLC52A3 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its regulation by NF-κB p65/Rel-B, it highlights the importance of these transcription factors in modulating SLC52A3 expression. The study utilized various methods, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), to confirm the binding of NF-κB p65 and Rel-B to the SLC52A3 promoter region (Long2018SLC52A3).
