# C16orf82

## Overview
C16orf82 is a gene located on chromosome 16 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 16 open reading frame 82. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, as its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes remain largely undefined. Despite the limited understanding of its precise function, studies have suggested potential involvement in various cellular pathways, although further research is necessary to elucidate its exact mechanisms and interactions. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research due to their potential implications in human health and disease, particularly in the context of genetic studies and molecular biology (Qiu2020aarFDC).
