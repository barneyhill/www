# CPSF6

## Overview
CPSF6, or cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 6, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mRNA processing, specifically in the cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA. The CPSF6 protein is a key component of the cleavage factor I mammalian (CFIm) complex, which plays a crucial role in alternative polyadenylation (APA), a process that generates diverse mRNA isoforms from a single gene, thereby enhancing the functional complexity of the genome. Structurally, CPSF6 is characterized by an RNA recognition motif (RRM), a proline-rich domain (PRD), and an arginine/serine-rich-like domain (RSLD), which is essential for its nuclear import and interaction with transportin 3 (TNPO3) (Jang2019Differential). The protein's phosphorylation state influences its function in APA and its subcellular localization. CPSF6 also interacts with the HIV-1 capsid, playing a role in viral replication and nuclear import, which underscores its significance in both cellular processes and viral pathogenesis (Bhattacharya2014Structural; Price2012CPSF6).

## Structure
CPSF6 is a protein involved in mRNA processing, characterized by its distinct domain structure. It contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), a Pro-rich domain (PRD), and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich-like domain (RSLD) enriched in Arg-Asp/Glu repeats (Jang2019Differential). The RSLD is crucial for nuclear import, interacting with the nuclear transport factor transportin 3 (TNPO3) (Jang2019Differential). The crystal structure of the RSLD-TNPO3 complex has been resolved, highlighting specific residues important for this interaction (Jang2019Differential).

CPSF6 exists in two major isoforms: a larger one with 588 residues and a smaller, predominant splice variant with 551 residues (Jang2019Differential; Li2020CPSF6Dependent). The smaller isoform, CPSF6[551], is primarily expressed in cells (Jang2019Differential). Phosphorylation of the RSLD enhances its interaction with TNPO3, although it is not essential for nuclear import (Jang2019Differential). The protein's phosphorylation status affects its function in alternative polyadenylation (APA) and nuclear localization (Jang2019Differential). CPSF6 also interacts with the HIV-1 capsid, with specific residues facilitating this binding (Bhattacharya2014Structural).

## Function
CPSF6 (cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 6) is a crucial component of the cleavage factor I mammalian (CFIm) complex, which plays a significant role in the regulation of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in human cells. This process is essential for generating multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene, thereby increasing the coding capacity of the genome. CPSF6 is involved in the selection of polyadenylation sites on pre-mRNA, influencing the length of the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. The proper function of CPSF6 ensures the use of distal polyadenylation sites, contributing to the stability, localization, and translation efficiency of mRNAs (Jang2019Differential).

CPSF6 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it also plays a role in nuclear import. Its RS-like domain (RSLD) is critical for binding to the nuclear transport factor transportin 3 (TNPO3), facilitating its translocation into the nucleus. The phosphorylation state of CPSF6 influences its function; hypophosphorylated CPSF6 supports normal polyadenylation site usage, while hyperphosphorylated CPSF6 fails to bind TNPO3 and is mislocalized to the cytoplasm (Jang2019Differential). This dual role in APA regulation and nuclear import highlights the importance of CPSF6 in maintaining normal cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CPSF6 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of viral infections and cancer. During viral infections, CPSF6 downregulation leads to global mRNA 3' UTR shortening, which enhances antiviral immune responses by promoting the protein output of immune-related transcripts. This process is associated with increased activation of type I interferon signaling and inhibition of viral replication, suggesting a role for CPSF6 in fine-tuning antiviral responses (Ge2024Downregulation).

In cancer, CPSF6 is often overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. High levels of CPSF6 are associated with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival in cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma, CPSF6 overexpression correlates with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, implicating it as an oncoprotein involved in cancer progression through pathways like PI3K/AKT (Tan2021CPSF6; Zu2022The).

CPSF6 also plays a role in HIV-1 replication by interacting with the viral capsid protein, facilitating nuclear import. Mutations affecting this interaction can alter the virus's replication efficiency, highlighting CPSF6's significance in the HIV-1 life cycle (Price2012CPSF6).

## Interactions
CPSF6 is a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor I (CFI m) complex, where it interacts with other subunits such as CPSF5 and CPSF7. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the CFI m tetramer, as demonstrated by co-precipitation and sedimentation analyses (Rasheedi2016The). CPSF6 also interacts with the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA), specifically binding to a conserved interface on the capsid. This interaction is significant for HIV-1 replication and is conserved across various lentiviruses (Price2012CPSF6; Bhattacharya2014Structural). The CPSF6 peptide, particularly residues 313-327, binds to the capsid at a groove formed by the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the capsid protein (Bhattacharya2014Structural). 

CPSF6's interaction with the HIV-1 capsid is involved in modulating viral replication and nuclear import, with mutations in the capsid affecting this interaction and the virus's infectivity (Price2012CPSF6). The truncated form of CPSF6, CPSF6-358, can bind and disrupt HIV-1 capsid tubes, suggesting a role in capsid pattern sensing and uncoating (Ning2018Truncated). These interactions highlight CPSF6's role in both cellular processes and viral pathogenesis.
