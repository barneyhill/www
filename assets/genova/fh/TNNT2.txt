# TNNT2

## Overview
The TNNT2 gene encodes the cardiac troponin T protein (cTnT), a critical component of the troponin complex that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. As a structural protein, cTnT anchors the troponin complex to the thin filament of the sarcomere, facilitating the calcium-mediated interaction between actin and myosin, which is essential for muscle contraction and relaxation (Parmacek2004Biology; Marston2019Troponin). The TNNT2 gene is specifically expressed in cardiac muscle, and its protein product is vital for the assembly and function of sarcomeres, the fundamental contractile units of cardiac muscle (Sehnert2002Cardiac). Mutations in TNNT2 are associated with various cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathies, highlighting its significance in cardiac health and disease (Luedde2010Severe; Wei2016TNNT1).

## Structure
The TNNT2 gene encodes cardiac troponin T (cTnT), a crucial component of the troponin complex involved in cardiac muscle contraction. The mature form of cardiac TnT is a 288-residue protein with a molecular weight of approximately 36 kDa (Marston2019Troponin). The primary structure of cTnT includes three domains: the N-terminal domain (TnT1), a linking domain, and the C-terminal domain (TnT2). The TnT1 domain binds to tropomyosin, enhancing the cooperativity of the calcium switch, while the TnT2 domain forms an antiparallel coiled-coil with troponin I (TnI) and interacts with troponin C (TnC) (Marston2019Troponin).

The TNNT2 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including TnT1, TnT2, TnT3, and TnT4, which are expressed at different developmental stages (Parmacek2004Biology). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating cTnT function. Phosphorylation sites like Thr 197, Ser 201, Thr 206, and Thr 287 are crucial for altering calcium sensitivity and force development in cardiac muscle (Wei2011Troponin).

The quaternary structure of cTnT involves its interaction with other troponin components, anchoring the troponin complex to the actin-tropomyosin thin filament, which is essential for muscle contraction regulation (Wei2016TNNT1). The structure-function relationship of cTnT is critical for understanding its role in cardiac muscle function and its involvement in cardiomyopathies (Wei2016TNNT1).

## Function
The TNNT2 gene encodes cardiac troponin T (cTnT), a critical component of the troponin complex involved in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. In healthy human cells, cTnT plays a structural role by anchoring the troponin complex to the thin filament of the sarcomere, specifically binding to tropomyosin and positioning the complex on the actin filament. This positioning is essential for the calcium-mediated regulation of muscle contraction, as it facilitates the interaction between actin and myosin, the proteins responsible for muscle contraction (Parmacek2004Biology; Marston2019Troponin).

The troponin complex, which includes troponin C (TnC), troponin I (TnI), and troponin T (TnT), undergoes conformational changes in response to calcium binding. These changes allow for the regulation of muscle contraction and relaxation, crucial for maintaining proper cardiac function and rhythm (Parmacek2004Biology). The TNNT2 gene is specifically expressed in cardiac muscle, and its protein product is vital for the assembly and function of sarcomeres, the fundamental contractile units of cardiac muscle (Sehnert2002Cardiac). Mutations in TNNT2 can lead to cardiomyopathies, underscoring its importance in cardiac health (Wei2016TNNT1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNNT2 gene, which encodes cardiac troponin T, are associated with several cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), and left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) cardiomyopathy. These mutations can lead to severe clinical outcomes, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (Luedde2010Severe; Watkins1995Mutations; Pham2023Tale).

In HCM, TNNT2 mutations are linked to variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, meaning not all carriers exhibit symptoms. Some individuals may experience minor or subclinical left ventricular hypertrophy but have a high risk of arrhythmia (Pham2023Tale). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg92Gln, are associated with significant phenotypic heterogeneity and a high incidence of sudden cardiac death, even in the absence of significant hypertrophy (Thierfelder1994α-tropomyosin; Moolman1997Sudden).

In DCM, TNNT2 mutations can lead to heart muscle dilation and impaired contraction, often resulting in heart failure. The clinical presentation of TNNT2-related cardiomyopathies can vary significantly, complicating diagnosis and treatment (Shakur2021Prognostic). Genetic testing is recommended for individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for these conditions to identify at-risk individuals and guide management (Pham2023Tale).

## Interactions
The TNNT2 gene encodes cardiac troponin T, a key component of the troponin complex involved in cardiac muscle contraction. TNNT2 interacts with several proteins, including cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin C (cTnC), forming a complex that regulates the interaction between actin and myosin in cardiac muscle fibers. This complex is crucial for calcium-mediated regulation of muscle contraction and relaxation (Lynn2023The).

Mutations in TNNT2 can alter these interactions, leading to various cardiomyopathies. For instance, the R94C variant affects the regulation of the thin filament by destabilizing the blocked state of tropomyosin, which increases the equilibrium constant for myosin weak binding to the thin filament. This results in hypercontractility and myocardial stiffness, contributing to diastolic dysfunction (Ezekian2020Variant). The R92L mutation in TNNT2 disrupts the cTnC-cTnI interface, reducing the accessibility of protein kinase A (PKA) to its phosphorylation sites on cTnI, which impairs myofilament relaxation and contributes to early-onset diastolic dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Lynn2023The).

The TNNT2(R141W) mutation affects interactions with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), leading to epigenetic changes and altered cardiac gene expression, which are implicated in left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (Li2024Targeting).
