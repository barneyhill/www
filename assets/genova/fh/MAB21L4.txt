# MAB21L4

## Overview
MAB21L4 is a gene that encodes the protein mab-21 like 4, which functions as an adaptor protein involved in the regulation of epidermal differentiation and tumor suppression. The protein plays a critical role in the ubiquitination and degradation of the proto-oncogene RET by facilitating its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, specifically through its association with CacyBP. This interaction is essential for maintaining normal skin development and preventing the progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) by suppressing neoplastic invasion. Alterations in the expression of MAB21L4 have been linked to various cancers, including cervical and lung squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its significance in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target (Srivastava2022RET).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The MAB21L4 gene has been implicated in the development and progression of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), particularly cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Alterations in MAB21L4 expression are associated with early stages of cSCC development, where its downregulation is observed in both cSCC and its precursors (Srivastava2022RET). The gene is believed to function as a tumor suppressor, as its loss enhances neoplastic invasion, while overexpression suppresses it (Srivastava2022RET). MAB21L4 interacts with CacyBP to regulate the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, which is involved in tumorigenesis. Loss of MAB21L4 leads to increased RET expression, promoting cancer progression (Srivastava2022RET).

MAB21L4 is also subject to somatic copy number alterations in various cancers, including cervical and lung SCC, suggesting its broader role in cancer biology (Srivastava2022RET). The gene's interaction with CacyBP is crucial for RET ubiquitylation and degradation, and its disruption can lead to increased RET activity, contributing to carcinogenesis (Srivastava2022RET). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of MAB21L4 mutations or downregulation in cancer, particularly in epithelial tissues.

## Interactions
MAB21L4, a protein encoded by the human gene C2ORF54, is known to interact with CacyBP, a protein involved in epidermal differentiation and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) regulation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of RET, a proto-oncogene, by facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation through the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involving Siah1. MAB21L4 acts as an adaptor protein, bringing CacyBP in proximity to RET, which is necessary for RET's ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Srivastava2022RET).

The interaction between MAB21L4 and CacyBP has been confirmed through various experimental techniques, including co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays (PLA), which demonstrate their physical proximity in human skin tissue (Srivastava2022RET). The disruption of MAB21L4 or CacyBP in human skin organoids leads to the downregulation of genes related to keratinization and skin development, highlighting their essential role in epidermal differentiation (Srivastava2022RET).

In the context of cancer, particularly cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), the loss of MAB21L4 enhances neoplastic invasion, while its enforced expression suppresses it. This tumor-suppressive role is dependent on its interaction with CacyBP (Srivastava2022RET).
