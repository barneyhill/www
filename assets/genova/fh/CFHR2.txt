# CFHR2

## Overview
The CFHR2 gene encodes the protein complement factor H-related 2, which is a member of the complement factor H-related protein family. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of the complement system, an integral component of the immune response. CFHR2 is characterized by its four short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, which facilitate its function in modulating complement activation. The protein is known for its ability to form homo-dimers and heterodimers with other CFHR proteins, such as CFHR1, through its dimerization domain. This dimerization enhances its binding affinity for complement fragments, thereby influencing complement activity (Skerka2013Complement; Goicoechea2013Dimerization). CFHR2 is primarily found in the extracellular space, where it contributes to immune homeostasis by inhibiting the C3 convertase activity and preventing excessive inflammation (Cserhalmi2019Regulation). The protein's interactions with other complement factors and its involvement in immune evasion by pathogens underscore its regulatory function within the complement system (Siegel2010Complement). Alterations in the CFHR2 gene have been linked to various renal and systemic diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Xiao2016Familial).

## Structure
The CFHR2 protein is composed of four short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, which are approximately 60 amino acids long and primarily consist of beta-sheet structures stabilized by two conserved disulfide bridges (Siegel2010Complement). The N-terminal SCR domains (SCR1 and SCR2) are highly conserved and are involved in dimerization, allowing CFHR2 to form homo-dimers and heterodimers with other CFHR proteins, such as CFHR1 (Skerka2013Complement; Goicoechea2013Dimerization). The C-terminal SCR domains of CFHR2 show a high level of amino acid sequence identity to the C-terminal recognition region of factor H, which is involved in binding to C3b and C3d (Skerka2013Complement).

CFHR2 exists in plasma in two glycosylated forms: a single glycosylated form (24 kDa) and a double glycosylated form (28 kDa) (Skerka2013Complement). The protein is part of high-density lipoprotein particles and has a plasma concentration of about 1/10 that of factor H (Skerka2013Complement). The dimerization of CFHR2 enhances its avidity for tissue-bound complement fragments, enabling it to modulate complement activation in vivo (Goicoechea2013Dimerization).

## Function
CFHR2, or complement factor H-related 2, is a protein involved in the regulation of the complement system, an essential part of the immune response. It is composed of four short consensus repeat (SCR) domains and is part of the group I CFHR proteins. CFHR2 forms dimers via the dimerization domain in SCR1 and can also form heterodimers with CFHR1 (Skerka2013Complement; Cserhalmi2019Regulation). In plasma, CFHR2 is present at a concentration of about 1/10th that of factor H and is associated with high-density lipoprotein particles (Skerka2013Complement).

Functionally, CFHR2 displays complement regulatory activities by inhibiting the C3 convertase activity, thereby inhibiting the amplification loop of the alternative pathway. However, it does not compete with factor H for binding to C3b at physiological concentrations (Skerka2013Complement). CFHR2 is primarily active in the extracellular space, contributing to immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation. It plays a role in modulating complement activation on cell surfaces, protecting host tissues from damage (Cserhalmi2019Regulation). The protein's ability to form dimers and interact with other complement factors suggests a regulatory function in the complement system, although its precise role in healthy human cells is not fully detailed (Cserhalmi2019Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CFHR2 gene are associated with several renal and systemic diseases due to their impact on the complement system. One significant condition linked to CFHR2 alterations is C3 glomerulopathy, including C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) and dense deposit disease (DDD). These conditions are characterized by complement dysregulation, often resulting from genetic rearrangements such as the CFHR5-CFHR2 fusion gene. This fusion leads to the production of a hybrid protein that competes with complement factor H, reducing complement control and contributing to disease pathogenesis (Chen2013Complement; Xiao2016Familial).

In dense deposit disease, a chromosomal deletion involving CFHR2 results in a CFHR2-CFHR5 hybrid protein that stabilizes the C3 convertase, enhancing complement activation and leading to glomerular damage (Chen2013Complement). Additionally, CFHR2 gene rearrangements are implicated in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a condition marked by defective complement regulation. Genetic anomalies such as CFHR3-1-4-2 gene duplication, which includes CFHR2, have been identified in families with aHUS, highlighting the gene's role in this thrombotic microangiopathy (Tasaki2024Case). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CFHR2 in complement-mediated diseases.

## Interactions
CFHR2 interacts with several proteins, primarily within the context of the complement system and immune evasion by pathogens. It forms dimers through its dimerization domain in SCR1 and can create heterodimers with CFHR1, but not with CFHR5 (Skerka2013Complement). CFHR2 binds to CRASP-3 and CRASP-5 proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi, which are involved in the bacterium's immune evasion strategies. This binding is likely located in the C-terminus of CFHR2, as SCR4 of CFHR2 shows a high level of sequence identity to SCR19 of CFH (Siegel2010Complement). The interaction with CRASP proteins suggests that CFHR2 may compete with complement factor H (CFH) for binding sites on the borrelial surface, potentially affecting CFH's complement regulatory activity (Siegel2010Complement). Despite these interactions, CFHR2 alone does not confer resistance to complement-mediated killing of Borrelia, as complement activation products still accumulate on the bacterial surface (Siegel2010Complement). CFHR2 also binds to C3b and C3d, similar to factor H, and is involved in inhibiting the C3 convertase activity, thus regulating the complement system (Skerka2013Complement).
