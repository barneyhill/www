# VDR

## Overview
The VDR gene encodes the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear receptor protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression in response to vitamin D. As a receptor, it is categorized under nuclear receptors, which are a class of proteins involved in sensing steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules. The vitamin D receptor is integral to various physiological processes, including calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone health, and immune function. Upon activation by its ligand, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the receptor forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to specific DNA sequences known as vitamin D response elements (VDREs), thereby modulating the transcription of target genes. The VDR gene is located on chromosome 12 and is subject to genetic variations that can influence susceptibility to a range of diseases, including neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders (Du2024Associations; Carlberg2013Vitamin).

## Structure
The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a nuclear receptor protein that plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of vitamin D. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form distinct domains, including a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Rochel2022Vitamin). The DBD contains two zinc finger motifs, which are essential for binding to vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in DNA (MolnÃ¡r2014Structural). 

The secondary structure of VDR includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the LBD characterized by an antiparallel α-helical triple sandwich topology consisting of 12 α-helices linked by short loops (Norman1999Threedimensional). The tertiary structure of the LBD forms a hydrophobic cleft essential for ligand binding and coactivator interaction, stabilized by a salt bridge between conserved residues (Norman1999Threedimensional).

In its quaternary structure, VDR can form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), which is crucial for its function in gene transcription regulation (Rochel2022Vitamin). The VDR also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and regulation (Rochel2022Vitamin). Splice variant isoforms of VDR exist, which may influence its functional diversity (Rochel2022Vitamin).

## Function
The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) is a nuclear receptor that functions as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3). VDR is involved in both genomic and non-genomic actions. Genomically, VDR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in the promoter regions of target genes, influencing their transcription. This regulation affects genes involved in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone formation, and immune function (Issa1998Molecular; Carlberg2013Vitamin; Haussler1995New).

VDR is expressed in various tissues, including the kidneys, bone, and intestine, where it is essential for maintaining normal bone structure and serum calcium levels. It also regulates parathyroid hormone secretion and calcium absorption (Issa1998Molecular; Carlberg2013Vitamin). VDR's role extends to immune regulation, where it influences monocyte differentiation and cytokine secretion, impacting immune responses (Carlberg2013Vitamin). The receptor's activity is modulated by its interaction with coactivators and corepressors, which alter chromatin structure and gene transcription (Issa1998Molecular; Haussler1995New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the VDR gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. The VDR gene, located on chromosome 12, encodes the vitamin D receptor, which is crucial for mediating the effects of vitamin D by regulating gene expression. Alterations in VDR expression or function can lead to increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Specific polymorphisms like ApaI are associated with a decreased risk of AD, while TaqI is linked to increased PD susceptibility, particularly among Asians (Du2024Associations).

In metabolic diseases, VDR polymorphisms have been studied for their association with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The FokI polymorphism, in particular, has shown associations with T2D in several studies, suggesting it may play a role in the disease among Asians and Caucasians (Alathari2020Vitamin). Additionally, VDR polymorphisms such as FokI and TaqI have been linked to thyroid cancer risk, with the FokI Ff genotype associated with more aggressive cancer forms (COCOLOS2022Vitamin).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of VDR gene variations in influencing disease risk and progression.

## Interactions
The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. VDR forms heterodimers with the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) to bind to Vitamin D Response Elements (VDREs) on DNA, typically organized as direct repeat 3 (DR3) elements. This interaction is essential for transcriptional regulation, as the RXR/VDR heterodimer complex binds asymmetrically to DR3 target DNA, with ligand-binding domains (LBDs) and DNA-binding domains (DBDs) organized in parallel (Orlov2011Structure).

VDR also forms homodimers on DR3 elements, which can compete with RXR for binding, suggesting a preference for homodimer formation in certain contexts (Shaffer2002Structural). Mutations in the VDR DBD can destabilize its homodimeric interface, allowing for potential heterodimer formation with RXR DBDs (Shaffer2004Vitamin).

The VDR's interaction with coactivators like SRC-1 and TRAP-1 can stabilize VDR homodimers on DR3 elements, facilitating transcription in a ligand-dependent manner (Shaffer2002Structural). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving VDR, RXR, and other co-regulatory proteins in modulating gene expression.
