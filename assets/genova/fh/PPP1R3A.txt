# PPP1R3A

## Overview
The PPP1R3A gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3A, a crucial component in the regulation of glycogen metabolism. This protein acts as a regulatory subunit for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), specifically targeting it to glycogen particles in muscle and cardiac tissues. By facilitating the dephosphorylation of key enzymes such as glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, the protein encoded by PPP1R3A plays a vital role in promoting glycogen synthesis and storage. Additionally, in cardiac cells, it is involved in calcium cycling by interacting with proteins like the type-2 ryanodine receptor and phospholamban, which are essential for normal cardiac function. Mutations in PPP1R3A have been associated with metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, underscoring its significance in energy balance and metabolic health (Doney2003Male; Alsina2019Loss; Savage2008A).

## Structure
The PPP1R3A gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), specifically involved in glycogen metabolism. The protein product, known as RGL, contains several important domains, including a glycogen-binding domain and a PP1-binding domain located within the N-terminal 240 residues (Savage2008A). These domains are crucial for localizing the catalytic subunit of PP1 to glycogen, facilitating the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, which promotes glycogen synthesis (Savage2008A).

The RGL protein is characterized by a truncated form due to a frameshift mutation, which results in the loss of the C-terminal tail. This truncation affects the protein's ability to associate with the sarcoplasmic reticulum and decreases its glycogen-binding affinity, likely due to alterations in the overall protein conformation (Savage2008A). Despite retaining its glycogen-binding domain, the truncated protein exhibits decreased glycogen-binding affinity, possibly impacting its tertiary structure and interaction with other cellular components (Savage2008A).

The protein's quaternary structure involves its interaction with PP1, targeting the phosphatase to glycogen for the dephosphorylation of key enzymes in glycogen metabolism (Savage2008A). The specific post-translational modifications of PPP1R3A are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The PPP1R3A gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which plays a crucial role in glycogen metabolism in muscle cells. This subunit, known as RGL or GM, targets PP1 to glycogen, facilitating the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase (GS) and the inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), thereby promoting glycogen synthesis and storage in muscle tissue (Savage2008A). In healthy human cells, PPP1R3A is essential for maintaining normal glycogen levels, which are critical for energy supply during muscle contraction, especially in high-intensity exercise (Savage2008A).

In cardiac cells, PPP1R3A is part of a macromolecular complex that includes the type-2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and phospholamban (PLN), which are vital for normal calcium cycling in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). PPP1R3A targets PP1 to these proteins, limiting their phosphorylation and ensuring proper calcium release and reuptake, which is crucial for maintaining normal cardiac function and preventing arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (Alsina2019Loss). The gene's role in both glycogen metabolism and calcium handling highlights its importance in energy balance and cardiac health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP1R3A gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders, particularly affecting glycogen metabolism and insulin sensitivity. A prevalent frameshift mutation in PPP1R3A results in a truncated protein that impairs glycogen synthesis and reduces muscle glycogen content in both humans and mice. This mutation is associated with decreased glycogen synthase activity and increased glycogen phosphorylase activity, potentially contributing to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (Savage2008A).

The ARE insertion/deletion polymorphism in PPP1R3A, specifically the ARE2 allele, has been associated with type 2 diabetes. In males, this allele is linked to an earlier age of diagnosis, while in females, it appears to delay the onset of diabetes. This suggests a gender-dependent effect on diabetes susceptibility (Doney2003Male).

Disruption of PPP1R3A in mice leads to significant metabolic changes, including increased weight gain, fat deposition, and insulin resistance. These mice exhibit drastically reduced glycogen levels in skeletal muscle, highlighting the gene's role in glycogen metabolism and its potential contribution to obesity and type 2 diabetes (Delibegovic2003Disruption).

## Interactions
PPP1R3A, also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3A, plays a significant role in glycogen metabolism by interacting with various proteins. It serves as a muscle-specific regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), directing its activity towards glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP). This interaction is crucial for the dephosphorylation of glycogen-bound GS and GP, facilitating glycogen synthesis and breakdown (Savage2008A).

The PPP1R3A FS variant results in a truncated R GL protein that fails to colocalize with glycogen synthase, leading to decreased GS activity. This variant impairs the ability of PPP1R3A to direct PP1c phosphatase activity to GS, which is essential for proper glycogen synthesis (Savage2008A). The truncated protein is mistargeted within the cell, which affects its interaction with glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, resulting in reduced muscle glycogen content (Savage2008A).

In the context of heart failure, PPP1R3A has been identified as a central coordinator in gene coexpression networks, showing increased connectivity with pathways related to metabolism and muscle contraction. This suggests its involvement in the regulation of cardiac metabolism and contractile function (Cordero2019Pathologic).
