# FBXO6

## Overview
FBXO6 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 6, a member of the F-box protein family characterized by an F-box motif. This protein is a crucial component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. F-box protein 6 is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it plays a significant role in the recognition and ubiquitination of unfolded glycoproteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis (Liu2012Proteomic). Additionally, FBXO6 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the DNA damage response and protein glycosylation, and has been associated with several pathological conditions such as intervertebral disc degeneration, osteoarthritis, and ovarian cancer (Du2021Role; Ji2021FBXO6mediated; Wang2020TGFβ).

## Structure


## Function
FBXO6 (F-box protein 6) is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This complex is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where FBXO6 mediates the ubiquitination of glycoproteins. It specifically recognizes unfolded N-glycoproteins by interacting with chitobiose, directing them towards E2 for ubiquitination, which is essential for the degradation of improperly folded proteins and maintaining protein homeostasis (Liu2012Proteomic).

FBXO6 is also implicated in the regulation of the DNA damage response by modulating the stability of Chk1 during DNA damage checkpoint recovery (Liu2012Proteomic). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, indicating a broad role in cellular processes, including protein metabolism and modification (Liu2012Proteomic). It interacts with a variety of glycoproteins, many of which are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and are involved in protein glycosylation, suggesting a role in regulating global glycosylation and ER redox homeostasis (Liu2012Proteomic). These interactions highlight FBXO6's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FBXO6 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), FBXO6 expression is reduced in degenerated tissues. This reduction is associated with increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation of nucleus pulposus cells, contributing to the progression of IVDD. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β negatively correlates with FBXO6 expression, exacerbating the condition (Du2021Role).

In osteoarthritis (OA), FBXO6 plays a protective role by regulating the degradation of matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14). Reduced expression of FBXO6 in OA leads to increased MMP14 activity, which contributes to cartilage degradation. The TGFβ-SMAD2/3 signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of FBXO6, suggesting that its downregulation may accelerate OA progression (Wang2020TGFβ).

In ovarian cancer, FBXO6 is overexpressed and is associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cancer progression by mediating the degradation of RNASET2, a tumor suppressor protein. This interaction facilitates cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting FBXO6 as a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer (Ji2021FBXO6mediated).

## Interactions
FBXO6, a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly with glycoproteins. It interacts with known SCF complex components such as Cullin1 and Skp1, which are essential for its function in protein ubiquitination (Liu2012Proteomic). FBXO6 primarily recognizes glycoproteins, with its FBA domain being crucial for this recognition. This interaction is N-glycan-dependent, as demonstrated by its binding to Ero1L, a thiol oxidase, which is abolished upon the removal of N-glycans (Liu2012Proteomic).

FBXO6 also interacts with MMP14, a matrix metalloproteinase, in a manner that regulates MMP14 ubiquitination and degradation, impacting cartilage degradation processes in osteoarthritis (Wang2020TGFβ). In ovarian cancer, FBXO6 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of RNASET2, influencing cancer cell proliferation and migration (Ji2021FBXO6mediated). Additionally, FBXO6 interacts with spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2 and BubR1, affecting mitotic processes and potentially contributing to genome instability (Xu2018Overexpression). These interactions highlight FBXO6's role in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and disease progression.
