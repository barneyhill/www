# BOK

## Overview
BOK, or BCL2-related ovarian killer, is a gene that encodes the BCL2 family apoptosis regulator BOK, a pro-apoptotic protein involved in the regulation of programmed cell death. As a member of the BCL-2 family, BOK shares structural similarities with other pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, characterized by a BCL-2 fold and several BCL-2 homology (BH) motifs that are essential for its function in apoptosis (Shalaby2020The). BOK primarily localizes to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in modulating ER stress responses and the unfolded protein response (Naim2020The). It is involved in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to the activation of the caspase cascade and cell death (Echeverry2013Intracellular). BOK's interactions with other proteins, such as MCL-1 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, underscore its multifaceted roles in apoptosis regulation, autophagy, and uridine metabolism (Shalaby2020The; Naim2020The). The gene's expression and regulation have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where it is often deleted or downregulated, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor (Llambi2016BOK; EinseleScholz2016Bok).

## Structure
The BOK protein, a member of the BCL-2 family, exhibits a structure typical of this group, characterized by a globular form with two central hydrophobic α-helices surrounded by six amphipathic α-helices (Shalaby2020The). The primary structure of BOK includes several BCL-2 homology (BH) motifs, which are crucial for its pro-apoptotic function (Shalaby2020The). The tertiary structure of BOK reveals a BCL-2 fold similar to other family members like BAK and BAX, with a hydrophobic groove formed by helices α2-α5, essential for protein-protein interactions (Shalaby2020The).

The crystal structure of BOK shows two molecules with differences in the loop between helices α2-α3 and the structure of helix α3, leading to variations in the hydrophobic groove architecture. This groove is mostly composed of loop structures and is likely to undergo conformational exchange, with helix α3 occluding access to critical hydrophobic pockets (Shalaby2020The). A glycine residue at position 35 (G35) in the α1 helix acts as a helix breaker, reducing stability and favoring spontaneous conformational changes. A mutant version, BOK G35A, demonstrated higher stability (Shalaby2020The). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other BCL-2 family proteins, although BOK's exact positioning within the network is still under investigation (EinseleScholz2016Bok).

## Function
The BOK protein, a member of the BCL-2 family, is primarily involved in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly through the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. It shares structural and functional similarities with other pro-apoptotic proteins like BAX and BAK, and is known to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), leading to the activation of the caspase cascade and cell death (Echeverry2013Intracellular; Carpio2015BCL2). BOK is predominantly localized to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in modulating ER stress responses and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Shalaby2020The; Naim2020The).

In healthy cells, BOK interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) at the ER, which may help regulate calcium signaling and protect IP3Rs from degradation (Shalaby2020The; Naim2020The). BOK also influences mitochondrial dynamics, including bioenergetics and morphology, and is involved in uridine metabolism, affecting cellular proliferation (Naim2020The). Despite its pro-apoptotic role, BOK's function in normal physiology may overlap with other BCL-2 family members, as its loss in mice shows minimal impact, suggesting redundancy in its apoptotic functions (Ke2012BCL2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BOK gene, a member of the BCL-2 family, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. BOK is frequently deleted in various human cancers, including ovarian and breast carcinomas, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Llambi2016BOK; EinseleScholz2016Bok). In colorectal cancer, decreased BOK protein levels in tumors compared to normal tissue have been observed. Interestingly, higher BOK protein levels in tumors are associated with earlier disease recurrence and reduced overall survival, indicating its role as a prognostic marker (Carberry2018The).

BOK's involvement in apoptosis is particularly relevant in the context of chemotherapy. In ovarian cancer and neuroblastoma cells, knockdown of BOK reduces sensitivity to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs, highlighting its role in drug response (EinseleScholz2016Bok). Additionally, BOK's interaction with proteins such as Mcl-1 influences its ability to induce apoptosis, and small-molecule drugs targeting these interactions are promising for treating cancers with overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins (EinseleScholz2016Bok).

BOK's regulation by proteasomal degradation also plays a role in cancer cell survival, particularly in response to proteasome inhibitors, which stabilize BOK and induce apoptosis (Llambi2016BOK). These findings suggest that BOK is a critical factor in apoptosis regulation and cancer therapy.

## Interactions
BOK, a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, interacts with several proteins, primarily within its own family. It has been shown to interact with anti-apoptotic proteins such as MCL-1 and BFL-1/BCL-2A1, but not with BCL-2, BCL-XL, or BCL-W (Shalaby2020The; Naim2020The). BOK's interaction with MCL-1 is significant as it promotes autophagy by freeing MCL-1-bound Beclin-1, which initiates the autophagy machinery (Naim2020The). This interaction is mediated by both the transmembrane (TM) domain and the BH3 domain of BOK, with the TM domain playing a crucial role in its interaction with MCL-1 (Stehle2018Contribution).

BOK also interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R1 and IP3R2) at the endoplasmic reticulum via its BH4 domain, protecting these receptors from caspase-3-mediated degradation during apoptosis (Shalaby2020The; Naim2020The). Additionally, BOK has been found to increase the activity of uridine monophosphate synthetase (UMPS) by binding to its orotidine decarboxylase (ODCase) domain, which affects uridine metabolism and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis (Naim2020The). These interactions highlight BOK's multifaceted roles in apoptosis regulation, autophagy, and uridine metabolism.
