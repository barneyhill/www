# DZIP1L

## Overview
DZIP1L is a gene that encodes the DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1-like, a protein integral to the function and structure of primary cilia in human cells. This protein is categorized as a ciliary transition zone protein and is primarily localized at the basal body of the primary cilium. It plays a crucial role in the trafficking of proteins such as polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, which are essential for kidney function. Mutations in DZIP1L are associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), although they are a less common cause compared to mutations in the PKHD1 gene. The protein's proper localization and function are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological processes, and its study is significant in the context of genetic testing for cystic kidney diseases (Bergmann2018Genetics; Hertz2022Detection; Satariano2024The).

## Function
The DZIP1L gene encodes the DAZ interacting protein 1-like protein, which plays a critical role in the proper functioning of primary cilia in human cells. DZIP1L is located at the basal body of the primary cilium and is essential for the trafficking of proteins crucial for kidney function, such as polycystin-1 and polycystin-2. Impaired function of DZIP1L is associated with defects in ciliary trafficking, which can lead to conditions like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (Hertz2022Detection).

In healthy human cells, DZIP1L is involved in the regulation of ciliary length and structure, contributing to cellular homeostasis and normal physiological processes. The protein's activity is primarily localized to the basal body and centrosome regions of the cell, where it plays a role in the assembly and function of primary cilia (Hertz2022Detection). The proper localization and interaction of DZIP1L are crucial for its function, as mutations can lead to mislocalization and associated cellular defects (Hertz2022Detection). The study of DZIP1L highlights its importance in genetic testing panels for cystic kidney diseases, despite being a rare cause of such conditions (Hertz2022Detection).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DZIP1L gene are associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), a condition characterized by cystic dilatation of kidney collecting ducts and congenital hepatic fibrosis. While ARPKD is most commonly caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene, DZIP1L mutations represent a rarer cause. These mutations can lead to a moderate clinical course of ARPKD, with manifestations detected prenatally or in early childhood, but typically without perinatal demise (Bergmann2018Genetics; Hertz2022Detection). The DZIP1L gene encodes a ciliary transition zone protein that interacts with septin2, and mutations can disrupt the ciliary membrane translocation of polycystin-1 and -2, affecting the integrity of the transition zone (Bergmann2018Genetics; Satariano2024The).

DZIP1L mutations are less common than PKHD1 mutations but should be considered in genetic testing panels for cystic kidney diseases due to their potential interactions with other polycystic kidney disease or ciliopathy loci (Satariano2024The; Hertz2022Detection). The clinical presentation of DZIP1L-related ARPKD may not always involve liver abnormalities, as observed in some patients (Hertz2022Detection).
