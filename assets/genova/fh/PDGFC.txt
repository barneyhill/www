# PDGFC

## Overview
PDGFC is a gene that encodes the protein platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), which is a member of the PDGF/VEGF family of growth factors. This protein is characterized by its unique two-domain structure, consisting of an N-terminal CUB domain and a C-terminal growth factor domain, and is primarily involved in cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis (Reigstad2005Structural; Li2000PDGF-C). PDGF-C functions as a ligand for the PDGF α-receptor (PDGFR-α), playing a significant role in tissue repair and vascular development, particularly within the extracellular matrix (Li2000PDGF-C). The protein is known for its potent angiogenic properties, promoting the formation and maturation of blood vessels, and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including wound healing, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer (Reigstad2005Structural; Folestad2018PDGFC).

## Structure
PDGF-C is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family and exhibits a unique two-domain structure. The protein consists of an N-terminal CUB domain and a C-terminal growth factor domain, separated by a hinge region (Reigstad2005Structural). The CUB domain, spanning approximately 110 residues, is involved in protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions and may require extracellular cleavage to activate the growth factor domain (Reigstad2005Structural). The growth factor domain contains a cystine knot motif, characterized by three intrachain disulfide bonds and interchain disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's structural stability (Reigstad2005Structural).

The secondary structure of PDGF-C is predominantly β-sheet, with a high degree of structural similarity to vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) (Reigstad2003Plateletderived). The protein forms a stable dimeric structure, with a hydrophobic core formed by residues from both monomers (Reigstad2005Structural). PDGF-C undergoes post-translational modifications, including proteolytic cleavage by plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which activate the growth factor domain by removing the CUB domain (Reigstad2005Structural).

PDGF-C does not require a propeptide for expression of its growth factor domain, distinguishing it from other PDGFs (Chen2013Plateletderived). The protein's structure is further stabilized by its ability to form homodimers, which is a part of its quaternary structure (Reigstad2003Plateletderived).

## Function
PDGFC (platelet derived growth factor C) is a gene encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular and physiological processes. It is a member of the PDGF/VEGF family of growth factors and acts as a ligand for the PDGF α-receptor (PDGFR-α), which is involved in cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis (Li2000PDGF-C). PDGFC is expressed in multiple tissues, including the heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, and ovary, and is particularly active in the extracellular matrix where it influences tissue repair and vascular development (Li2000PDGF-C).

In healthy human cells, PDGFC is involved in wound healing, where it participates in all phases, including inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. It is secreted from platelets and plays a role in the inflammatory phase by promoting the revascularization of ischemic tissues, similar to VEGF (Reigstad2005Structural). PDGFC also mediates increased levels of metalloproteinase-1 and its inhibitor, which are crucial for tissue remodeling (Reigstad2005Structural).

PDGFC is a potent angiogenic factor, promoting the formation of new blood vessels and enhancing vessel maturation by inducing the differentiation of bone marrow cells into smooth muscle cells. It affects endothelial cells by mobilizing progenitor cells and promoting their differentiation into mature endothelial cells, as well as stimulating chemotaxis of mature endothelial cells in ischemic tissues (Reigstad2005Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PDGFC gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In ocular diseases, PDGF-C is involved in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and ischemia-induced retinopathy, such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Targeting PDGF-C in these conditions has shown potential in reducing retinal vascular tuft formation and altering gene expression related to angiogenesis and apoptosis, offering alternative therapeutic strategies distinct from VEGF inhibition (Kumar2018PDGFC).

In developmental disorders, PDGF-C is crucial for palate formation. Its absence leads to cleft palate and other congenital anomalies, such as spina bifida and skeletal abnormalities, as observed in Pdgfc knockout mice (Ding2004A). PDGF-C also plays a role in CNS development, with deficiencies leading to cerebral ventricular defects and spina bifida occulta (Andrae2016A; Fredriksson2012PlateletDerived).

In cardiovascular diseases, PDGF-C is associated with cardiac fibrosis and vascular remodeling. Overexpression can lead to cardiac fibrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy, while its role in angiogenesis is significant in ischemic cardiovascular diseases (Folestad2018PDGFC). PDGF-C is also implicated in cancer pathology, particularly in promoting tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness (Folestad2018PDGFC).

## Interactions
PDGF-C interacts primarily with PDGF receptors, particularly PDGFR-αα and PDGFR-αβ dimers, to activate signaling pathways such as MAP kinase, PI3K-Akt, and PLCγ, which are crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation (Papadopoulos2018The). The core domain of PDGF-C competes with PDGF-BB for binding to PDGFR-α, but not PDGFR-β, indicating specific interactions with PDGFR-α (Li2000PDGF-C). The interaction requires proteolytic activation, as the N-terminal CUB domain of PDGF-C must be cleaved to allow receptor binding (Li2000PDGF-C).

PDGF-C also interacts with neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a co-receptor that may influence other signaling pathways, such as VEGF-A-VEGFR-2, which are important in vascular development and maintenance (Folestad2018PDGFC). This interaction is implicated in promoting melanoma aggressiveness, suggesting a role in cancer pathology (Folestad2018PDGFC).

PDGF-C forms disulfide-bonded dimers, similar to other PDGF family members, and these dimers are essential for its biological activity (Li2000PDGF-C). The protein's interactions are regulated by specific proteases, such as plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which cleave the CUB domain to activate the growth factor domain (Reigstad2005Structural).
