# SEMA6D

## Overview
SEMA6D is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 6D, a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in axonal guidance and cell signaling. Semaphorin 6D is a transmembrane protein characterized by a semaphorin domain, which facilitates its interaction with plexin receptors, particularly Plexin-A1. This interaction is crucial for various biological processes, including cardiac development, immune response modulation, and neural circuit formation. In the cardiovascular system, semaphorin 6D influences cell migration and differentiation, while in the immune system, it plays a role in T-cell activation and cytokine production. Additionally, semaphorin 6D is involved in axon guidance within the nervous system, ensuring proper neural connectivity. The protein's involvement in these diverse pathways underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Prieur2023Semaphorin6D; Fard2021Semaphorins; Wagner2023Semaphorin).

## Structure
SEMA6D, a member of the semaphorin family, is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in cell signaling and axonal guidance. The primary structure of SEMA6D includes a semaphorin domain, which is crucial for its interaction with plexin receptors, forming a complex seven-bladed β-propeller-fold configuration (Purpurowicz2024The; Wagner2023Semaphorin). This domain is rich in cysteine residues, which are important for maintaining its structural integrity (Hota2012Plexin).

The secondary structure of SEMA6D involves beta-sheets and alpha-helices, typical of semaphorin proteins, contributing to the formation of its tertiary structure. The tertiary structure is defined by the folding of these domains, allowing SEMA6D to engage in specific interactions with its receptors (Hota2012Plexin).

In terms of quaternary structure, SEMA6D can form homodimers, which are essential for its signaling functions (Sun2018Role). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, influencing the protein's stability and interactions (Hota2012Plexin).

SEMA6D also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may result in different functional properties, although specific details on these isoforms are not extensively covered in the available literature (Hota2012Plexin).

## Function
SEMA6D (semaphorin 6D) is a member of the semaphorin family involved in various cellular and developmental processes. In cardiac development, SEMA6D plays a dual role by promoting endocardial cell migration in the cardiac outflow tract while inhibiting migration in the ventricular region. This is achieved through its interaction with different receptor complexes, particularly PlexinA1, which mediates signaling pathways crucial for myocardial layer differentiation and heart chamber development (Fard2021Semaphorins). 

In the immune system, SEMA6D is upregulated in CD4+ T-cells following TCR engagement, playing a significant role in the late phase of T-cell activation. It interacts with dendritic cells through the PlexinA1 receptor, enhancing IL-12 production, which is vital for Th1 response development and antigen-specific T-cell differentiation (Fard2021Semaphorins).

SEMA6D is also essential in the nervous system, particularly in axon guidance. It forms a ligand-receptor pair with Plexin-A1, crucial for the proper positioning and targeting of retinal ganglion cell axons in the visual system. This interaction is necessary for axon-axon interactions and proper fasciculation, ensuring accurate neural circuit formation (Prieur2023Semaphorin6D).

## Clinical Significance
SEMA6D has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell signaling and immune response modulation. In head and neck cancer, SEMA6D expression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) inhibits CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation, contributing to immune evasion by tumors. This suggests that SEMA6D may be a potential therapeutic target to enhance immune responses and improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (Hirai2024Sema6D). In osteosarcoma, SEMA6D acts as a proto-oncogene, with its overexpression linked to enhanced signaling pathways and increased chemoresistance (Dong2020CircUBAP2; Wagner2023Semaphorin). In breast cancer, SEMA6D expression affects chemoresponse, with high levels correlating with improved survival in certain subtypes, while low expression is associated with early recurrence and poor outcomes (Baxter2021MiR195). SEMA6D also plays a role in gastric cancer, where it is associated with increased invasion and metastasis, and in malignant pleural mesothelioma, where it aids in cell survival (Wagner2023Semaphorin). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SEMA6D in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
SEMA6D interacts with several proteins, primarily through its receptor Plexin-A1. This interaction is crucial for various cellular processes, including cardiac morphogenesis and axon guidance. In cardiac development, SEMA6D forms complexes with Plexin-A1 and other receptors such as Off-track (OTK) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2). These complexes mediate region-specific effects on cell migration, with SEMA6D inhibiting migration in the ventricle through the Plexin-A1-OTK complex and promoting migration in the conotruncal segment via Plexin-A1-VEGFR2 (Toyofuku2004Dual).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, SEMA6D interacts with TREM2, a receptor on microglia, influencing microglial activation and function. This interaction is mediated by Plexin-A1 and is significant in neuron-microglia crosstalk, affecting pathways related to immune activation and neuronal stress (Albanus2022Systematic).

SEMA6D also plays a role in cancer, where it interacts with Plexin-A1 and Plexin-A4, influencing immune responses and cancer cell behavior. These interactions are involved in processes such as macrophage polarization and the modulation of signaling pathways like PI3K-AKT-mTOR and MAPK, which are critical in cancer progression (Wagner2023Semaphorin).
