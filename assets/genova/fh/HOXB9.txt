# HOXB9

## Overview
The HOXB9 gene encodes the homeobox B9 protein, a transcription factor that is part of the homeobox gene family, which plays a pivotal role in regulating developmental processes. Homeobox B9 is primarily involved in the patterning of the anterior-to-posterior axis during embryogenesis and is crucial for the development of the axial skeleton and thoracic region (Sha2014HOXB9; Sha2013Decreased). As a transcription factor, homeobox B9 binds to specific DNA sequences to control the expression of genes that govern cell proliferation and differentiation (Sha2013Decreased). While its expression is typically low or absent in adult tissues, it is highly expressed during embryonic development, and its dysregulation is associated with various cancers, including breast and lung cancer (Svingen2003Altered; Xu2020Silencing). The protein's activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins, such as PCAF and SIRT1, which influence its role in gene regulation and cancer progression (Wan2016PCAF-mediated).

## Structure


## Function
HOXB9 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in embryonic development, particularly in the patterning of the anterior-to-posterior axis and the development of the axial skeleton and thoracic region (Sha2014HOXB9; Sha2013Decreased). It is involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, influencing the spatial and temporal expression of target genes (Sha2013Decreased). In healthy adult tissues, HOXB9 is typically absent or expressed at low levels, contrasting with its high expression in embryonic tissues (Xu2020Silencing).

HOXB9 is a direct transcriptional target of the WNT/TCF4 pathway, which is crucial for embryonic segmentation and limb patterning (Sha2013Decreased). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate the transcription of genes essential for proper development and cellular function (Sha2013Decreased). In the context of normal mammary gland development, HOXB9, along with other HOX genes, is expressed and plays a role in maintaining normal phenotypes (Hayashida2009HOXB9). The gene's expression is tightly regulated, and its dysregulation is often associated with oncogenic transformations (Svingen2003Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HOXB9 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, prostate, cervical, uterine, and lung cancers. In breast cancer, HOXB9 is overexpressed in approximately 42% of tumors and is associated with tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, particularly to the lungs (Hayashida2009HOXB9; Deb2016Endocrine). This overexpression is linked to the induction of angiogenic factors such as VEGF, bFGF, and TGF-β, which contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Hayashida2009HOXB9).

HOXB9 expression is also influenced by endocrine-disrupting chemicals like bisphenol-A (BPA), which can induce its expression in breast cancer cells, potentially contributing to cancer development (Deb2016Endocrine). The gene is transcriptionally regulated by estradiol and is overexpressed in ER-positive breast cancer cells, suggesting a role in hormone-responsive cancers (Deb2016Endocrine).

In addition to its role in cancer, mutations in the HOXB9 gene have been associated with skeletal abnormalities, such as defects in rib development and acetabular over-coverage, which is related to pincer-type femoroacetabular impingement (Chen1997Targeted; Sekimoto2015Possible). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HOXB9 in both oncological and developmental contexts.

## Interactions
HOXB9 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation and cancer progression. One of the key interactions is with the acetyltransferase PCAF, which acetylates HOXB9 at lysine 27 (K27). This acetylation is crucial for modulating HOXB9's function, particularly in suppressing lung adenocarcinoma progression by targeting the oncogenic protein JMJD6. The interaction between HOXB9 and PCAF has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, demonstrating a physical interaction in both in vivo and in vitro settings (Wan2016PCAF-mediated).

HOXB9 is also deacetylated by SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin family of deacetylases. This interaction is significant as it regulates the acetylation status of HOXB9, influencing its role in cancer cell migration and tumor growth. The interaction between HOXB9 and SIRT1 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, and they colocalize in the nucleus, indicating a direct physical interaction (Wan2016PCAF-mediated).

In addition to protein interactions, HOXB9 binds to the promoter of the JMJD6 gene, affecting its transcription. The acetylation-deficient mutant HOXB9-K27R shows enhanced binding to the JMJD6 promoter, suggesting that acetylation status affects its DNA-binding ability (Wan2016PCAF-mediated).
