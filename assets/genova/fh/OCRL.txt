# OCRL

## Overview
The OCRL gene encodes the OCRL inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase, a crucial enzyme involved in phosphoinositide metabolism. This protein is categorized as an inositol 5-phosphatase and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as endocytic trafficking, actin cytoskeleton organization, and membrane dynamics. The OCRL protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, which includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an inositol 5-phosphatase domain, an ASPM-SPD-2-Hydin (ASH) domain, and a RhoGAP-like domain. These domains facilitate its interactions with various proteins and cellular compartments, including the plasma membrane, endosomes, and the Golgi complex (Hou2011A; Mao2009A). Mutations in the OCRL gene are linked to Lowe syndrome and Dent disease, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper signaling pathways (Pirruccello2012Inositol; De2017The).

## Structure
The OCRL protein is a multi-domain protein with a complex molecular structure. It contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central inositol 5-phosphatase domain, an ASPM-SPD-2-Hydin (ASH) domain, and a C-terminal RhoGAP-like domain (Hou2011A; Mao2009A). The PH domain is characterized by a clathrin-binding motif, which is crucial for its role in clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking (Mao2009A). The inositol 5-phosphatase domain is responsible for hydrolyzing phosphoinositides, with a preference for PI(4,5)P2 (Lowe2005Structure).

The ASH domain of OCRL forms a two-layered β-sheet fold, similar to immunoglobulin-like β-sandwiches, and is involved in binding Rab proteins (Hou2011A). The RhoGAP-like domain, although homologous to GTPase-activating proteins, has low GAP activity due to a critical arginine being replaced by glutamine (Lowe2005Structure).

OCRL exists in two isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, which may influence its function and localization (Lowe2005Structure). The protein is associated with Lowe syndrome and Dent disease, with mutations in its Rab-binding domain affecting its interactions and subcellular localization (Hou2011A).

## Function
The OCRL gene encodes a protein that functions as an inositol 5-phosphatase, primarily targeting phosphoinositides such as PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. This enzymatic activity is crucial for regulating phosphoinositide levels within cellular membranes, which is essential for various cellular processes, including endocytic trafficking, actin cytoskeleton organization, and membrane dynamics (Pirruccello2012Inositol; De2017The). OCRL is localized to several cellular compartments, including the plasma membrane, endosomes, and the Golgi complex, where it interacts with clathrin and clathrin adaptors, as well as small GTPases like Rab5, Rac, and Cdc42 (Pirruccello2012Inositol; Erdmann2007A).

In the endocytic pathway, OCRL is involved in the early steps, where it helps dephosphorylate PI(4,5)P2, preventing its ectopic accumulation and ensuring proper receptor trafficking and recycling (Erdmann2007A; Vicinanza2011OCRL). This function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper signaling, particularly in the brain and kidneys, where OCRL's interactions with proteins like APPL1 are crucial for receptor sorting and signaling pathways (De2017The; Erdmann2007A). Mutations in OCRL can disrupt these processes, leading to diseases such as Lowe syndrome and Dent disease (Pirruccello2012Inositol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OCRL gene are associated with two primary conditions: Lowe syndrome and Dent disease 2. Lowe syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, intellectual disability, and renal Fanconi syndrome, which involves proximal tubular dysfunction leading to the loss of low molecular weight proteins and solutes in the urine (De2017The; Nakano2020Incomplete). This condition is caused by mutations primarily located in exons 8-23 of the OCRL gene, affecting the phosphatase domain and other functional domains (Recker2014Characterization; Nakano2020Incomplete).

Dent disease 2, a milder condition compared to Lowe syndrome, is characterized by renal Fanconi syndrome without extrarenal symptoms. Mutations associated with Dent disease 2 are typically found in exons 1-7, which encompass the PH domain (Gianesello2020Genetics; De2017The). The clinical severity of these conditions can vary significantly, even among patients with the same mutation, suggesting that genetic background and modifier genes may influence disease expression (De2017The; Nakano2020Incomplete).

Alterations in OCRL expression levels, such as those caused by intronic mutations affecting splicing, can lead to a spectrum of phenotypes, from classical Lowe syndrome to Dent disease 2, depending on the amount of functional OCRL protein produced (Nakano2020Incomplete).

## Interactions
The OCRL protein, encoded by the OCRL gene, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in cellular processes. OCRL interacts directly with clathrin and the clathrin adaptor protein AP-2, which are essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This interaction is facilitated by an FxDxF AP-2 binding motif in OCRL, which is critical for its binding to the AP-2α subunit (Ungewickell2004The). OCRL also associates with clathrin-coated vesicles and endosomes, where it plays a role in endosomal trafficking (Ungewickell2004The).

OCRL forms a complex with the F-BAR protein pacsin 2 and IPIP27A, which is important for the biogenesis of membrane-trafficking intermediates. This complex enhances OCRL's 5-phosphatase activity, particularly in regions of high membrane curvature, such as the necks of budding vesicles (Billcliff2016OCRL1). The interaction with IPIP27A is crucial for linking OCRL to pacsin 2, facilitating the formation of trafficking intermediates containing the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) (Billcliff2016OCRL1).

OCRL also interacts with SNX9, a protein involved in late-stage clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This interaction is mediated by a PxxP motif in OCRL, which binds to the SH3 domain of SNX9, indicating a specific role in endocytosis (Nández2014A).
