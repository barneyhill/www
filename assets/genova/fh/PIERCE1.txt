# PIERCE1

## Overview
PIERCE1 is a gene that encodes the protein piercer of microtubule wall 1, which plays a significant role in the formation and function of motile cilia. This protein is categorized as a cytoplasmic protein involved in ciliogenesis, particularly in the pre-assembly of dynein arms, which are essential for cilia motility (Anujan2018Functional). PIERCE1 is expressed in various human tissues that contain motile cilia, such as the nasal septum, trachea, and lungs, and is regulated by the transcription factor FOXJ1, a key player in cilia formation (Anujan2018Functional). Beyond its role in ciliogenesis, PIERCE1 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, where it interacts with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, influencing tumor growth and progression (Roh2020Impaired). Additionally, PIERCE1 is involved in developmental processes, such as the specification of left-right asymmetry, highlighting its diverse biological functions and potential as a therapeutic target (Sung2016PIERCE1).

## Function
PIERCE1 is a gene involved in motile ciliogenesis, playing a crucial role in the function of motile cilia, which are essential for fluid movement and cellular locomotion. The PIERCE1 protein is expressed in ciliated cells and is necessary for normal cilia motility, being localized in the cytoplasm of these cells (Anujan2018Functional). It is hypothesized to be involved in the pre-assembly of dynein arms, which are critical for cilia motility, potentially through interactions with PIAS2, an E3-type SUMO ligase (Anujan2018Functional).

In humans, PIERCE1 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, such as the nasal septum, main olfactory epithelium, trachea, lung, and testis, suggesting a conserved role in motile ciliogenesis (Anujan2018Functional). The protein is a downstream target of FOXJ1, a master regulator of motile ciliogenesis, indicating its involvement in the transcriptional control of cilia formation (Anujan2018Functional). Despite its significant role in ciliogenesis, the specific molecular functions and interactions of PIERCE1 in human cells remain to be fully elucidated, highlighting the need for further research to understand its precise role in ciliary function and related cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
PIERCE1 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and developmental disorders. In KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PIERCE1 is associated with tumor growth and progression. Its depletion has been shown to suppress lung tumorigenesis and improve survival rates in mouse models, suggesting that PIERCE1 could be a potential therapeutic target for this type of cancer (Roh2020Impaired). The gene is involved in activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, a key signaling pathway in tumorigenesis, and its inhibition may offer a novel approach to cancer therapy with minimal side effects (Roh2020Impaired).

PIERCE1 also plays a critical role in the specification of left-right asymmetry in mice. Deficiency in PIERCE1 leads to severe laterality defects, such as situs inversus and heterotaxy, due to the randomized expression of asymmetric genes like Nodal and Pitx2. These defects are similar to those seen in conditions with impaired ciliogenesis or ciliary motility, indicating PIERCE1's involvement in generating the symmetry-breaking signal crucial for proper organ positioning (Sung2016PIERCE1).

## Interactions
PIERCE1 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified PIAS2, an E3-type small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) ligase, as a high-confidence interacting partner of PIERCE1. This interaction suggests that PIERCE1 may be involved in the sumoylation process, potentially regulating the activities of proteins involved in dynein arm assembly, which is essential for cilia motility (Anujan2018Functional).

In the context of KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, PIERCE1 interacts with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. It modulates AKT phosphorylation, and its depletion leads to decreased AKT phosphorylation, which suppresses tumor growth. This regulation is mediated through the TRIB3-AKT axis, indicating that PIERCE1's role in tumorigenesis is dependent on oncogenic RAS and TRIB3 (Roh2020Impaired). PIERCE1 also influences ER stress-responsive genes, which negatively regulate AKT phosphorylation, contributing to cell death and reduced proliferation (Roh2020Impaired).

These interactions highlight PIERCE1's involvement in both ciliogenesis and cancer-related pathways, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in specific contexts.
