# ASB13

## Overview
ASB13 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 13, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box (ASB) protein family. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process that marks proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein levels and interactions within the cell (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB13 is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a SOCS box domain, which is involved in forming complexes necessary for ubiquitination (Anasa2018Multifaceted). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and is localized in the nucleus and Golgi apparatus (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB13 has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis, where it targets the transcription factor SNAI2 for degradation, influencing cell migration and metastasis (Fan2020ASB13). Despite its recognized role in cancer, the full spectrum of ASB13's functions in normal cellular processes remains to be elucidated (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

## Structure
ASB13 is a protein that belongs to the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein family. Its primary structure is composed of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The ankyrin repeat domains are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are typically characterized by a series of alpha helices in their secondary structure. These alpha helices contribute to the stability and function of the ankyrin repeats.

The SOCS box domain of ASB13 is involved in the process of ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that tags proteins for degradation. This modification plays a significant role in regulating protein levels within the cell and is a key aspect of ASB13's function.

ASB13 may exist in different isoforms due to splice variants, which can lead to proteins with distinct functions. These isoforms result from alternative splicing events that modify the primary structure of the protein, potentially altering its interaction capabilities and functional roles.

The tertiary structure of ASB13 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is determined by the folding of its secondary structures. The quaternary structure, if applicable, would involve the formation of protein complexes, although specific details on such complexes for ASB13 are not provided in the context.

## Function
ASB13 is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box (ASB) family, which functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is involved in the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification that marks proteins for degradation by the proteasome, regulates cellular localization, and influences protein interactions (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB13 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and is localized in the nucleus and Golgi apparatus (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

The ASB13 protein contains ankyrin repeats and a SOCS box domain, which are crucial for its function. The ankyrin repeats facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing ASB13 to recruit specific substrates. The SOCS box domain is involved in forming complexes with other proteins, such as Cullin and RING finger proteins, which are essential for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

In the context of breast cancer, ASB13 has been shown to target the transcription factor SNAI2 for degradation, thereby influencing cell migration and metastasis. This activity suggests that ASB13 plays a role in regulating cellular processes that are critical for maintaining normal cell function and preventing pathological conditions (Fan2020ASB13). However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain poorly understood (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

## Clinical Significance
ASB13 has been identified as a significant player in breast cancer metastasis. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the transcription factor SNAI2 for degradation. SNAI2 is associated with promoting metastasis by inducing an invasive phenotype in cancer cells. The degradation of SNAI2 by ASB13 reduces cell migration and metastasis, particularly in breast cancer. Knockout studies of ASB13 in breast cancer cells have shown increased cell migration and decreased F-actin polymerization, while overexpression of ASB13 suppresses lung metastasis (Fan2020ASB13).

ASB13 also influences the expression of YAP, a protein that suppresses tumor progression. The regulation of YAP by ASB13 is mediated through SNAI2, which represses YAP transcription. Higher ASB13 expression correlates with improved overall survival in breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Fan2020ASB13).

In the context of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), ASB13 is overexpressed in the more aggressive activated B cell-like (ABC) group compared to the germinated center B cell-like (GCB) group. However, the specific clinical significance of ASB13 in DLBCL remains unclear (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

## Interactions
ASB13 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in breast cancer metastasis by targeting the transcription factor SNAI2 for ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial as SNAI2 promotes metastasis by inducing invasive phenotypes in cancer cells. ASB13 physically interacts with SNAI2, leading to its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation, which affects the transcriptional repression of YAP, a protein involved in cell migration and metastasis (Fan2020ASB13).

The interaction between ASB13 and SNAI2 has been validated through co-immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating that ASB13 can bind to SNAI2 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (Fan2020ASB13). The SOCS domain of ASB13 is essential for this interaction, as its deletion results in the loss of SNAI2 ubiquitination (Fan2020ASB13). ASB13's role in promoting SNAI2 degradation is further supported by experiments showing that overexpression of ASB13 leads to decreased SNAI2 protein levels, while knockdown or knockout of ASB13 stabilizes SNAI2 (Fan2020ASB13).

ASB13 also affects YAP expression, as its knockout decreases YAP levels due to increased SNAI2, which represses YAP transcription (Fan2020ASB13). This regulatory pathway, involving ASB13, SNAI2, and YAP, highlights ASB13's tumor-suppressive function in breast cancer metastasis (Fan2020ASB13).
