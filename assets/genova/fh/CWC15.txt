# CWC15

## Overview
CWC15 is a gene that encodes the CWC15 spliceosome-associated protein homolog, a critical component of the spliceosomal machinery in eukaryotic cells. This protein is primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process for gene expression regulation. CWC15 is associated with the Prp19 complex (Prp19C), also known as the NineTeen Complex (NTC), which is essential for spliceosome assembly, activation, and regulation. The protein forms a stable heterodimer with CTNNBL1, facilitating interactions with other spliceosomal components such as CDC5L and Cef1, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and function of the spliceosome (Henke-Schulz2024The; van2015CTNNBL1). Additionally, CWC15 plays a significant role in transcription elongation by interacting with RNA polymerase II and the TREX complex, highlighting its importance in both splicing and transcriptional processes (Henke-Schulz2024The).

## Function
CWC15 is a protein associated with the Prp19 complex (Prp19C), which plays a crucial role in transcription elongation and spliceosomal function in human cells. It is involved in the interaction between Prp19C and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), as well as the TREX complex, which is essential for efficient transcription elongation. The absence of CWC15 leads to reduced TREX occupancy and transcriptional activity, indicating its importance in maintaining these interactions (Henke-Schulz2024The).

CWC15 also forms a stable heterodimer with CTNNBL1, facilitating its association with CDC5L, which is necessary for maintaining the abundance of the Prp19 spliceosomal complex. This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the spliceosome, which is responsible for pre-mRNA splicing (van2015CTNNBL1). CWC15's role in stabilizing the Prp19 complex is vital for efficient splicing, particularly under conditions of increased transcriptional demand (van2015CTNNBL1).

In the nucleus, CWC15 contributes to spliceosome assembly, activation, and regulation, interacting directly with essential subunits like Cef1. Its function is critical for the stability and activity of the spliceosomal complex, impacting RNA splicing and gene expression regulation (Henke-Schulz2024The).

## Interactions
CWC15 is a protein associated with the Prp19 complex (Prp19C), also known as the NineTeen Complex (NTC), which is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, transcription elongation, and genome stability. In humans, CWC15 forms a stable heterodimer with CTNNBL1, a component absent in yeast, and is essential for viability (Henke-Schulz2024The). Structurally, CWC15 is located on the surface of Prp8, where it associates with PPIL4, facilitating its anchoring to the spliceosome (Henke-Schulz2024The). 

CWC15 interacts directly with the essential subunit Cef1 and is involved in the assembly, activation, and regulation of the spliceosome (Henke-Schulz2024The). Recent cryo-EM studies have shown that CWC15 is a core component of the spliceosomal machinery, directly contacting snRNA elements U4, U5, and U6, and interacting with multiple components and NTC-related proteins at the spliceosome's catalytic center (Henke-Schulz2024The). 

CWC15 is also necessary for the interaction between Prp19C and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) as well as the TREX complex, with its absence reducing TREX occupancy (Henke-Schulz2024The). The deletion of CWC15 affects the ubiquitylation and stability of Hpr1, a component involved in mRNA export, although it does not cause a nuclear mRNA export defect (Henke-Schulz2024The).
