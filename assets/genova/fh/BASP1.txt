# BASP1

## Overview
BASP1, or brain abundant membrane attached signal protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. The BASP1 protein is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein with a significant role in transcriptional regulation, particularly as a cosuppressor of the Wilms' tumor suppressor protein WT1 (Carpenter2004BASP1). It is involved in neuronal development, promoting neurite outgrowth and participating in synaptic function (Korshunova2008Characterization; Manganas2021BASP1). BASP1 interacts with several proteins, including prohibitin and estrogen receptor alpha, influencing transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation (Marsh2017BASP1; Toska2013Prohibitin). Clinically, BASP1 is recognized for its tumor-suppressive properties, with implications in various cancers such as thyroid, breast, and lung cancer, as well as acute myeloid leukemia (Hartl2020The; Guo2016Restoration; Zhou2018Methylationassociated). Its expression levels and interactions make it a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment response (Pan2023BASP1).

## Structure
BASP1 is a protein characterized by its N-terminal myristoylation, which facilitates membrane attachment (Mosevitsky2005Nerve; Zakharov2003Natural). The primary structure of BASP1 has been established for several species, showing high sequence similarity across bovine, human, rat, and chicken forms (Mosevitsky1997The). BASP1 contains a domain rich in basic and hydrophobic residues, which is crucial for calmodulin binding in the presence of calcium (Mosevitsky2005Nerve). This domain is also subject to phosphorylation by protein kinase C, which can disrupt calmodulin binding (Mosevitsky2005Nerve).

BASP1 is an intrinsically disordered protein, as revealed by NMR studies, which suggests a lack of stable secondary and tertiary structures (Geist20121H). The protein can form oligomers, particularly in the presence of SDS or anionic lipid membranes, indicating a quaternary structure that is influenced by environmental conditions (Zakharov2010Oligomeric). BASP1 also contains PEST sequences, which are indicative of regions susceptible to rapid degradation (Mosevitsky1997The). The protein's interaction with lipids and its ability to form oligomers are essential for its functional roles in cellular processes (Zakharov2010Oligomeric).

## Function
BASP1, also known as brain acid-soluble protein 1, is involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It functions as a transcriptional cosuppressor for the Wilms' tumor suppressor protein WT1, modulating WT1's transcriptional activity. BASP1 can enhance WT1's transcriptional repression and inhibit its activation function, particularly at WT1-responsive promoters like the amphiregulin promoter (Carpenter2004BASP1). This interaction is significant during kidney development, where BASP1 and WT1 are co-expressed, particularly in podocytes, suggesting a role in maintaining podocyte function (Carpenter2004BASP1).

BASP1 is also involved in neurite outgrowth, a process essential for neuronal development. It promotes neurite outgrowth independently of NCAM-mediated pathways and other signaling pathways such as FGFR, PKC, and Src-family kinases. Its function in neurite outgrowth is dependent on its localization to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with acidic phospholipids and actin filaments (Korshunova2008Characterization). BASP1's role in synaptic function is supported by its distribution in synaptic terminals and dendritic spines, marking it as a potential marker for neural stem cells in neurogenic niches (Manganas2021BASP1).

## Clinical Significance
The BASP1 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its tumor-suppressive properties. In thyroid cancer, BASP1 expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Guo2016Restoration). In breast cancer, BASP1 acts as a transcriptional coregulator with the estrogen receptor α (ERα), enhancing the effectiveness of tamoxifen treatment and correlating with improved survival in ER-positive patients (Marsh2017BASP1).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), BASP1 is downregulated due to promoter methylation, contributing to leukemogenesis. Its ectopic expression can induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, highlighting its tumor-suppressive role (Zhou2018Methylationassociated). In lung cancer, BASP1 is downregulated through miR-191-mediated mRNA degradation, and its interaction with EGFR signaling is associated with tumor progression (Hartl2020The; Lin2020Targeting).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high BASP1 expression is linked to poor survival but also a better response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Pan2023BASP1).

## Interactions
BASP1 (brain acid-soluble protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the Wilms' tumor suppressor protein WT1, acting as a transcriptional cosuppressor. This interaction is significant in the regulation of WT1 activity, particularly in myelogenous leukemia K562 cells, where BASP1 suppresses WT1-mediated transcriptional activation at several target genes (Goodfellow2011WT1; Carpenter2004BASP1). BASP1 also interacts with prohibitin in the nucleus, where prohibitin mediates BASP1-dependent transcriptional repression of WT1 target genes (Toska2013Prohibitin).

BASP1 competes with the v-Myc oncogene for binding to calmodulin (CaM), a calcium-binding messenger protein. This competition disrupts the v-Myc:CaM interaction, thereby impairing v-Myc-induced cell transformation (Hartl2020The). BASP1 also interacts with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), acting as a transcriptional coregulator. This interaction is enhanced by tamoxifen, a drug used in breast cancer treatment, and influences the expression of ERα target genes (Marsh2017BASP1).

BASP1 undergoes sumoylation, which affects its subnuclear localization and function, indicating its dynamic interaction with nuclear components during cellular differentiation (Green2008Dynamic).
