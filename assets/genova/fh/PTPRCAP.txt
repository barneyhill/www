# PTPRCAP

## Overview
PTPRCAP is a gene that encodes the lymphocyte phosphatase-associated phosphoprotein (LPAP), a small transmembrane protein primarily expressed in lymphocytes. LPAP is a critical component of the immune system, functioning as a molecular partner of the CD45 phosphatase, which plays a significant role in the regulation of antigen-specific activation of lymphocytes. The protein is involved in T-cell signaling, potentially acting as a co-regulator within a supramolecular complex that includes CD45, the co-receptor CD4, and the kinase Lck (Kruglova2017Constitutive). LPAP undergoes dynamic phosphorylation, which is modulated by cellular activation, indicating its involvement in various signaling pathways (Kruglova2017Constitutive). Despite its established interactions and regulatory roles, the precise functions of LPAP in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Tsoy2018Lymphocyte).

## Structure
The PTPRCAP gene encodes the lymphocyte phosphatase-associated phosphoprotein (LPAP), a small transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of 32 kDa, consisting of 206 amino acids (Kruglova2017Constitutive). LPAP is predominantly located on the plasma membrane and is part of a supramolecular complex that includes the phosphatase CD45, the co-receptor CD4, and the kinase Lck (Kruglova2017Constitutive). 

LPAP contains two putative binding domains: a WW domain and an acidic domain, which are essential for its interaction with Lck (Kruglova2017Constitutive). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, at several sites, including Ser-99, Ser-153, Ser-163, and Ser-172 (Kruglova2017Constitutive). These phosphorylation sites are associated with specific kinase motifs, such as the casein kinase I (CK1) substrate motif at Ser-99 and the SPxP motif at Ser-163, recognized by proline-directed kinases like CDKs and MAPKs (Kruglova2017Constitutive). 

The phosphorylation status of LPAP changes dynamically upon cell activation, influencing its role as a co-regulator of T-cell signaling (Kruglova2017Constitutive). The presence of tyrosine residues, Tyr-64 and Tyr-115, in the LPAP cytoplasmic tail, are predicted to be phosphorylated, although specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided (Kruglova2017Constitutive).

## Function
The PTPRCAP gene encodes the lymphocyte phosphatase-associated phosphoprotein (LPAP), a small transmembrane protein expressed exclusively in lymphocytes. LPAP is a molecular partner of the CD45 phosphatase and is involved in the regulation of antigen-specific activation of lymphocytes, although its precise functions remain unclear (Tsoy2018Lymphocyte; Kruglova2017Constitutive). LPAP is part of a supramolecular complex with CD45, the co-receptor CD4, and the kinase Lck, suggesting a role in T-cell signaling as a potential co-regulator (Kruglova2017Constitutive). 

The phosphorylation of LPAP is dynamic and influenced by cellular activation, with specific phosphorylation sites identified, such as Ser99, Ser153, Ser163, and Ser172. These sites are regulated upon cell activation, indicating LPAP's involvement in signaling pathways (Kruglova2019T; Kruglova2017Constitutive). Protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates LPAP at Ser153, potentially protecting it from degradation (Tsoy2018Lymphocyte). LPAP interacts with several proteins, including CD45, CD71, CD98, and cytoskeletal proteins, which may be relevant to its role in lymphocyte activation (Kruglova2019Identification). Despite these interactions, the exact role of LPAP in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PTPRCAP gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PTPRCAP is one of the genes found to be overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with a copy number increase observed in 40% of cases studied. However, the specific clinical implications of these alterations in ESCC remain unclear (Shi2013Identification).

In ovarian cancer, PTPRCAP expression is linked to DNA damage repair (DDR) gene mutations, which are associated with distinct immune profiles. These profiles could inform biomarker-guided immune therapies, suggesting a potential role for PTPRCAP in predicting clinical benefits from immune checkpoint inhibitors (Tian2020Association).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), PTPRCAP is expressed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and is associated with disease-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. However, its expression did not show a significant correlation with clinical outcomes such as lymph node metastases or disease recurrence, possibly due to the small sample size (Marchetti2021New).

In chordomas, PTPRCAP is characterized by high promoter methylation-expression correlation, particularly in chordoma subtype I, suggesting a role in the immune response characteristic of this subtype (Baluszek2023DNA).

## Interactions
PTPRCAP, also known as CD45-AP, is a protein that interacts with the CD45 phosphatase, a key regulator of lymphocyte activation. This interaction is crucial for modulating immune responses, as CD45 is involved in the activation and inhibition of T and B cell receptor signaling (Rossetti2007A). PTPRCAP is part of a molecular network enriched in immune response-related genes, particularly in chordoma I, where it is associated with protein-protein interactions validated by the STRING database (Baluszek2023DNA). 

In the context of inflammation, PTPRCAP is identified as a transcript dependent on PAR1 activation, suggesting its involvement in the inflammatory process in the bladder. This indicates that PTPRCAP may participate in the regulatory network of inflammation downstream of proteinase-activated receptors (Saban2007Regulatory). 

While specific protein interactions involving PTPRCAP are not detailed in all studies, its role in immune cell activation and inflammation suggests it may form part of multiprotein complexes or engage in transitory interactions that influence cellular processes such as immune cell activation and inhibition (Rossetti2007A).
