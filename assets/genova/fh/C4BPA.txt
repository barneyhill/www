# C4BPA

## Overview
### Overview
C4BPA, or complement component 4 binding protein alpha, is a crucial protein in the human immune system, primarily involved in the regulation of the complement system. It is a glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the immune response by binding to complement components, thereby inhibiting their activity and preventing excessive inflammation. C4BPA is a key player in the classical pathway of the complement system, where it acts as a regulatory protein to prevent the overactivation of the immune system, which can lead to tissue damage.

C4BPA is composed of multiple subunits, with its structure being characterized by the presence of several complement control protein (CCP) domains. These domains are essential for the protein's ability to bind to complement components and regulate immune responses. The protein is primarily found in the plasma and is known to interact with various components of the immune system, including complement proteins and antibodies.

The clinical significance of C4BPA is highlighted by its role in various diseases and conditions. Mutations in the C4BPA gene can lead to altered immune responses, contributing to the development of autoimmune diseases, infections, and other conditions. Additionally, C4BPA is involved in the regulation of the complement system, which plays a crucial role in the immune response to infections and inflammation.

Overall, C4BPA is an essential component of the immune system, playing a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation. Its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes makes it a significant target for therapeutic interventions in diseases such as autoimmune disorders, infections, and cancer. Understanding the function and regulation of C4BPA is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies to modulate immune responses and improve clinical outcomes.

## Structure
The C4BPA gene encodes the alpha polypeptide chain of the complement component C4b-binding protein, which is a key regulator of the complement system. The protein is primarily composed of eight short consensus repeats (SCRs), each approximately 60 amino acids in length, which are characteristic of the complement control protein (CCP) domains. These SCRs are encoded by individual exons, except for the second SCR, which is split across two exons (Rodriguez1991Structure). The SCRs contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, forming a beta-sheet-rich fold that is typical of CCP domains (PardoManuel1990Human).

C4BPA forms a multimeric quaternary structure, often assembling into a spider-like heptamer with a central core and radiating arms. This structure is composed of seven identical alpha chains and one beta chain, with the alpha chains playing a crucial role in the protein's regulatory functions (PardoManuel1990Human). The C-terminal region of the alpha chain contains two cysteines, which are thought to be involved in interchain disulfide linkages, contributing to the stability of the multimeric structure (PardoManuel1990Human). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function.

## Function
The C4BPA gene encodes the alpha chain of the complement component C4b-binding protein (C4BP), which plays a crucial role in regulating the complement system, a part of the innate immune response. C4BP functions primarily as a soluble inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathways of the complement system. It achieves this by binding to C4b, a component of the complement cascade, thereby preventing the formation of the C3 convertase (C4b,2a) and accelerating its decay. This action helps to regulate complement activation and prevent excessive inflammation (Rodriguez1991Structure; PardoManuel1990Human).

C4BP is an oligomeric plasma protein composed of multiple identical alpha chains and a unique beta chain. The alpha chains are primarily responsible for the complement regulatory functions, while the beta chain binds to protein S, a vitamin K-dependent protein involved in the regulation of the coagulation system (Andersson1990Genes; Hillarp1989Protein). In plasma, C4BP forms a complex with protein S, which modulates the anticoagulant activity of protein S by inhibiting its cofactor function with activated protein C, thus influencing the degradation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa (Dahlbäck1986Inhibition; Hillarp1989Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the C4BPA gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A notable non-synonymous polymorphism, p.Arg240His, in the C4BPA gene is associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). This mutation impairs the alternative pathway cofactor activity of C4BP, leading to reduced binding affinity for C3b and impaired degradation of C3b, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of aHUS (Blom2008A).

In the context of venous thrombosis (VT), alterations in C4BPA expression, particularly due to specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been linked to an increased risk of VT. These SNPs are associated with increased levels of the C4BP isoform α7β0 and increased C4BPA expression, suggesting a protein S-independent mechanism for VT susceptibility (Buil2010C4BPBC4BPA).

C4BPA expression is also relevant in cancer, particularly breast cancer, where low expression levels are associated with poor prognosis and shorter progression-free intervals. This downregulation is linked to immune cell infiltration and may influence the tumor microenvironment, suggesting C4BPA as a potential biomarker for breast cancer prognosis (Zou2024Identification).

Additionally, alterations in C4BPA have been associated with recurrent spontaneous pregnancy loss (RSPL), where mutations such as R120H, I126T, and G423T affect the expression and cofactor activity of C4BP, potentially leading to excessive complement activation at the fetomaternal interface (Mohlin2013Analysis).

## Interactions
C4BPA, or complement component 4 binding protein alpha, is involved in several key interactions within the complement system and beyond. It binds to C4b, a component of the complement system, and plays a crucial role in regulating complement activation by accelerating the decay of the classical pathway C3-convertase (C4b,2a) and acting as a cofactor in the factor I-mediated proteolytic inactivation of C4b (Andersson1990Genes; Rodriguez1991Structure).

C4BPA also interacts with the anticoagulant vitamin K-dependent protein S. This interaction occurs through the β-chain of C4BP, forming a 1:1 stoichiometric complex, with about 50% of protein S in plasma being complexed to C4BP. This binding renders protein S inactive as a cofactor to activated protein C in the inactivation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa (Andersson1990Genes; Rodriguez1991Structure).

In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), C4BPA interacts with CD40, a receptor on antigen-presenting cells and various tumors. This interaction enhances antitumor immunity by facilitating the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment, potentially increasing the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapies (Sasaki2021C4bbinding).
