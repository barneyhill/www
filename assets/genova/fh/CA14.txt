# CA14

## Overview
Carbonic anhydrase 14 (CA14) is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein carbonic anhydrase 14, which is part of the α-carbonic anhydrase class. This enzyme is involved in crucial physiological processes, including acid-base regulation and ion transport across cell membranes. The protein is characterized by its zinc-dependent catalytic activity, which facilitates the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. CA14 is predominantly expressed in the brain, liver, and kidneys, where it plays a significant role in maintaining pH balance and fluid homeostasis (Kivelä2005Carbonic; Aspatwar2022Roles). The protein's interaction with other membrane proteins, such as the anion exchanger 3 (AE3), underscores its importance in cellular functions, particularly in excitable tissues like the retina and hippocampal neurons (Casey2009Bicarbonate; Svichar2009Carbonic). Despite its established roles, the full spectrum of CA14's physiological functions in humans remains to be elucidated (Kivelä2005Carbonic).

## Structure
Carbonic anhydrase 14 (CA14) is a transmembrane protein with a primary structure consisting of 337 amino acids, resulting in a molecular weight of 37.6 kDa (Aspatwar2022Roles). The secondary structure includes a loop stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond between cysteine residues C40 and C221, which is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic mechanism (Di2020Human). This loop contains a conserved threonine residue that helps orient the zinc-bound hydroxide, essential for the enzyme's function (Di2020Human).

CA14 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation at site N213, which has been confirmed through crystal structure determination (Di2020Human). This glycosylation affects protein properties such as folding and solubility. Additionally, CA14 has been identified with nine modified residues, including phosphorylation, which is the most frequent modification and may play a role in regulating enzyme activity (Di2020Human).

The protein is part of the α-carbonic anhydrase class and is involved in various physiological processes, including acid-base regulation and retinal function (Aspatwar2022Roles; Zhang2014Regulation). The presence of zinc ions in the active site is crucial for its catalytic activity (Banerjee2016On).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase 14 (CA14) is a membrane-associated enzyme that plays a significant role in maintaining acid-base balance and facilitating ion transport in various tissues. It is tethered to the outer surface of the plasma membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol lipid anchor, similar to CA IV (AdevaAndany2015The). CA14 is primarily active in the brain, liver, and kidneys, where it contributes to pH regulation and fluid balance (Kivelä2005Carbonic).

In the liver, CA14 is expressed in hepatocytes and is involved in regulating pH and ion transport between hepatocytes, bile canaliculi, and hepatic sinusoids. It is localized in both the apical and basolateral domains of the plasma membrane, suggesting a role in maintaining acid-base homeostasis and possibly in ion transport across cell membranes (Kivelä2005Carbonic). In the kidneys, CA14 is found in the proximal tubules and thin descending limb of Henle, where it is also present in both apical and basolateral membrane domains, indicating its involvement in renal acid-base balance (Kivelä2005Carbonic).

The specific physiological roles of CA14 in humans are not fully understood, but its presence in various tissues suggests its involvement in essential physiological processes such as acid-base homeostasis (Kivelä2005Carbonic).

## Interactions
Carbonic anhydrase 14 (CA14) is known to interact with the anion exchanger 3 (AE3), a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, in the central nervous system. This interaction enhances the Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity mediated by AE3, particularly in excitable tissues such as the retina and hippocampal neurons. The physical association between CA14 and AE3 has been demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, which confirmed that CA14 can be pulled down with AE3, suggesting a structural association that facilitates bicarbonate transport (Casey2009Bicarbonate; Svichar2009Carbonic).

In hippocampal neurons, CA14, along with CA4, enhances AE3-mediated Cl−/HCO3− exchange, contributing to the regulation of intracellular pH. This facilitation is crucial for maintaining pH balance in neurons, as evidenced by experiments showing increased neuronal intracellular alkalinization when CA14 is inhibited (Svichar2009Carbonic).

The interaction between CA14 and AE3 is part of a broader network of carbonic anhydrase and bicarbonate transporter interactions, which includes other carbonic anhydrases like CAII, CAIV, and CAIX. These interactions play a significant role in maintaining acid-base balance and supporting cellular functions in tissues such as the brain and retina (Casey2009Bicarbonate).
