# DLL1

## Overview
The DLL1 gene encodes the delta-like canonical Notch ligand 1, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the Notch signaling pathway, a fundamental mechanism for cell communication that regulates cell fate decisions. The DLL1 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular domain with a C2 domain, a DSL domain, and multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, essential for its interaction with Notch receptors (Kershaw2015Notch; Bettenhausen1995Transient). This interaction is crucial for initiating signaling cascades that influence processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (RubioAliaga2009Dll1). DLL1 is involved in various physiological processes, including myogenesis and immune system regulation, and its dysfunction is associated with several clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (FischerZirnsak2019Haploinsufficiency; SalesDias2019The).

## Structure
The DLL1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. Its extracellular domain features an N-terminal C2 domain, a DSL (Delta-Serrate-Lag2) domain, and eight epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, which are crucial for its interaction with Notch receptors (Kershaw2015Notch; Bettenhausen1995Transient). The C2 domain is a membrane-recognition motif composed of two four-stranded β-sheets forming a compact β-sandwich, although it does not bind calcium due to specific amino acid substitutions (Kershaw2015Notch).

The DSL domain and the first few EGF-like repeats are essential for receptor binding, with specific regions conserved across Notch ligands, highlighting their importance in ligand-receptor recognition (Kershaw2015Notch). The structure of DLL1 is highly extended, with a linear arrangement of its domains, and features a sharp bend between EGF repeats 4 and 5 (Kershaw2015Notch).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are present, although specific sites and their functional implications are not detailed in the provided context (Tveriakhina2018The). The protein also exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and interactions (Bettenhausen1995Transient).

## Function
DLL1 (Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 1) is a critical component of the Notch signaling pathway, a highly conserved cell communication system that influences cell fate decisions. In healthy human cells, DLL1 interacts with Notch receptors on adjacent cells, initiating a cascade of proteolytic cleavages that release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). This NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of target genes involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (RubioAliaga2009Dll1).

DLL1 plays a significant role in myogenesis by regulating Notch signaling to maintain a balance between muscle stem cell quiescence and differentiation. It exerts a cis-inhibitory effect on Notch signaling within the same cell, promoting myogenic differentiation by reducing the expression of Notch target genes such as HEY1, HEYL, and HES1 (Zhang2021Feedback). This regulation is crucial for muscle development and regeneration, as DLL1 helps maintain a pool of undifferentiated myoblasts while allowing others to differentiate (Zhang2021Feedback).

In the immune system, DLL1 is essential for lymphoid cell differentiation and function. Its haploinsufficiency can lead to altered T cell development and reduced CD4+ T-cell levels, indicating its importance in immune regulation (RubioAliaga2009Dll1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DLL1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Haploinsufficiency of DLL1 can lead to conditions such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and brain malformations, including ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus (FischerZirnsak2019Haploinsufficiency). These disorders are often linked to heterozygous pathogenic variants in DLL1, which include nonsense, missense, splice site mutations, and gene deletions (FischerZirnsak2019Haploinsufficiency).

DLL1 is also implicated in the phenotypic spectrum of terminal 6q deletions, which can result in a variety of clinical features such as microcephaly, dysplastic outer ears, vision problems, and scoliosis. These deletions often lead to developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder, with DLL1 playing a significant role in these manifestations (Engwerda2023The).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, DLL1 mutations have been linked to congenital vertebral malformations. A specific mutation in DLL1 has been identified as a cause of such malformations, affecting the Notch signaling pathway and leading to skeletal abnormalities (Barhoumi2019Delta). 

DLL1 also plays a role in cancer, particularly breast cancer, where its expression is associated with increased proliferation and migration of cancer cells. High DLL1 expression correlates with poor survival in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients (SalesDias2019The).

## Interactions
DLL1 interacts with Notch receptors, playing a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathway. The extracellular domain of DLL1, which includes an N-terminal (NT) domain, a DSL domain, and a series of EGF repeats, is essential for its interaction with Notch receptors at the cell surface (Shah2012Notch). DLL1's interaction with Notch1 is characterized by a weaker binding affinity compared to DLL4, with the EGF repeats 11-14 from Notch1 showing a weak interaction with DLL1 (Andrawes2013Intrinsic). The MNNL-EGF3 region of DLL1 is necessary and sufficient for full activation of Notch signaling (Andrawes2013Intrinsic).

DLL1 also interacts with the multiple PDZ domain protein (MPDZ), which enhances Notch signaling by stabilizing DLL1 at the cell membrane and facilitating its interaction with the adherens junction protein Nectin-2 (Tetzlaff2018MPDZ). This interaction is crucial for proper Notch signaling during angiogenesis (Tetzlaff2018MPDZ).

Computational studies have shown that DLL1 can form complexes with single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) such as P10 and P12. The binding of P10 to DLL1 affects the flexibility of specific loops, particularly the b3-b4 loop, leading to increased stiffness and the formation of new hydrogen bonds (Albuquerque2021Computationally-obtained).
