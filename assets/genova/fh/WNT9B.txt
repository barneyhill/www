# WNT9B

## Overview
WNT9B is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 9B, which is part of the Wnt family of secreted signaling proteins. These proteins are integral to the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental processes, including cell fate determination, proliferation, and adhesion. Wnt family member 9B is particularly significant in kidney development, where it is secreted by the ureteric bud to induce nephron differentiation, a vital process for kidney organogenesis (Kiefer2012Conditional). Additionally, Wnt family member 9B plays a role in the formation of the pyloric sphincter and is involved in facial morphogenesis through its interactions with other signaling molecules (Jin2020Canonical). The gene's mutations have been linked to several congenital disorders, underscoring its importance in normal developmental processes (Wang2014Analysis).

## Structure


## Function
WNT9B is a crucial component of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in regulating cell fate, proliferation, and adhesion during development and adulthood. In the context of kidney development, WNT9B is secreted from the ureteric bud and signals to progenitor cells in the cap mesenchyme to induce nephron differentiation, a process essential for forming a full complement of nephrons (Kiefer2012Conditional). This signaling is vital for the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) of nephron stem cells, a critical step in kidney organogenesis (Boyle2011Notch).

WNT9B also influences the balance between progenitor self-renewal and differentiation, with its signaling pathway being crucial for differentiation (Kiefer2012Conditional). Misexpression of WNT9B can lead to kidney malformations, indicating its importance in maintaining proper kidney function (Kiefer2012Conditional). Beyond the kidney, WNT9B is involved in the formation of the pyloric sphincter at the distal end of the stomach, where its activity must be tightly regulated to prevent dysfunctions such as reflux (Kiefer2012Conditional). Overall, WNT9B's role in these processes underscores its importance in normal organ development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WNT9B gene have been implicated in several congenital and developmental disorders. In Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a condition characterized by the absence of the uterus and upper vagina, novel heterozygous mutations in the WNT9B gene have been identified. These mutations include a missense mutation in exon 1 and another in the 3'-untranslated region, suggesting a potential pathogenic role in the syndrome (Wang2014Analysis).

WNT9B is also associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP). Studies in mice have shown that mutations near the Wnt9b gene, such as the insertion of an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) transposon, can disrupt its function, leading to CLP. This disruption is thought to occur through antisense transcription from the IAP's bidirectional promoter, affecting Wnt9b expression (Juriloff2014Epigenetic; Juriloff2006Wnt9b).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), a low-frequency genetic variation in WNT9B, specifically the variant rs11871306, has been linked to an increased relapse hazard. Individuals carrying the minor allele of this variant experience more than double the relapse risk, highlighting the gene's role in MS pathology (Vandebergh2021Genetic).

## Interactions
WNT9B is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its role in signaling pathways. It cooperates with RSPO2 to activate the canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, particularly during facial morphogenesis in mice. This interaction enhances the phosphorylation of the LRP6 receptor and significantly boosts the signaling activity, as demonstrated by increased expression of WNT target genes such as Axin2 (Jin2020Canonical). 

WNT9B also interacts with Frizzled (FZD) receptors, although its binding to specific FZD CRD domains was not detected in some studies. It has been shown to signal through FZD5 in certain cell lines, such as HEK293, to activate the WNT/β-catenin pathway (Dijksterhuis2015Systematic). In nephron progenitor cells, WNT9B responsiveness is enhanced by the presence of RSPO1 and RSPO3, which stabilize the WNT-receptor complex at the cell surface, involving Frizzled receptors like FZD5 and co-receptor LRP6 (Dickinson2019Molecular).

These interactions highlight the complexity and context-dependence of WNT9B's role in various signaling pathways, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and organogenesis (Carroll2005Wnt9b; Jin2020Canonical).
