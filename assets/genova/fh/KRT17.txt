# KRT17

## Overview
KRT17 is a gene that encodes keratin 17, a type I intermediate filament protein, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells. Keratin 17 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of nuclear morphology, chromatin organization, and cell cycle progression. It is essential for the resilience of hair follicles and the mechanical stability of epithelial tissues such as nails and glands. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and signaling pathways, underscore its involvement in cell proliferation and cancer progression. Mutations in the KRT17 gene are linked to dermatological conditions like pachyonychia congenita type 2 and steatocystoma multiplex, while its altered expression is associated with several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2022The; EscobarHoyos2015Keratin17; Covello1998Keratin).

## Structure
Keratin 17 (KRT17) is a type I intermediate filament protein characterized by a triplet structure consisting of 432 amino acids. Its primary structure includes a non-helical head domain (amino acids 1-83), a central α-helical rod domain (amino acids 84-392), and a non-helical tail domain (amino acids 393-432) (Zhang2022The; Zhang2022Analysis). The α-helical rod domain is crucial for the formation of coiled-coil motifs, which are essential for the secondary structure of the protein (Ho2022Update).

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT17 assembles into intermediate filaments, which are integral to the cytoskeletal network within epithelial cells (Smith2003The). The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers with other keratins, such as KRT6 and KRT16, facilitating its role in cellular processes like hyperproliferation (Ho2022Update).

KRT17 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influences its interaction with other proteins and cellular pathways (Zhang2022The). These modifications are significant for its function in cell proliferation, growth, and apoptosis, as well as its involvement in various diseases (Jacob2018Types).

## Function
Keratin 17 (KRT17) is a type I intermediate filament protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells. In healthy human cells, KRT17 is involved in regulating nuclear morphology and chromatin organization. It localizes to the cell nucleus, where it influences nuclear dimensions and chromatin status, affecting gene expression and cell cycle progression (Jacob2020Keratin). KRT17 interacts with various nuclear proteins, including lamins and histones, and is associated with transcriptionally active euchromatin, indicating its role in epigenetic regulation (Jacob2020Keratin).

KRT17 is crucial for the structural integrity of hair follicles, contributing to the resilience and survival of hair-producing cells. Its absence leads to hair fragility and increased apoptosis in hair matrix cells, as observed in KRT17 null mice (McGowan2002Keratin). KRT17 is also expressed in other epithelial tissues, such as nails and glands, where it partners with type II keratins for polymerization, supporting the mechanical stability of these structures (McGowan2002Keratin). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining the health and function of epithelial appendages.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT17 gene are associated with several dermatological conditions, most notably pachyonychia congenita type 2 (PC-2) and steatocystoma multiplex. PC-2 is characterized by hypertrophic nail dystrophy, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, and multiple pilosebaceous cysts. It is caused by mutations in KRT17 or its expression partner KRT6b, with common mutations occurring at codons N92 and R94 (Smith2005The; Covello1998Keratin). The N92S mutation, in particular, has been frequently identified in PC-2 cases and is associated with symptoms such as thickened nails, sebaceous cysts, and hoarseness (Cogulu2008Pachyonychia; Ofaiche2014Familial).

Steatocystoma multiplex, another condition linked to KRT17 mutations, is characterized by the presence of multiple sebaceous cysts. These mutations disrupt the structural assembly of keratin 17, leading to cell fragility and hyperkeratosis in tissues expressing K17, such as the nail bed and hair follicle (Zhang2019Mutation; Covello1998Keratin).

Altered expression of KRT17 is also implicated in various cancers, including lung, pancreatic, and gastric cancers. KRT17's high expression is linked to tumor growth and metastasis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2022The).

## Interactions
Keratin 17 (KRT17) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cancer progression and cellular processes. KRT17 interacts with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 KIP1, facilitating its nuclear export and degradation. This interaction is crucial for cell cycle progression, as KRT17 promotes the nuclear export of p27 KIP1 via the CRM1 exportin pathway, leading to decreased nuclear retention of p27 KIP1 and facilitating the G1 to S phase transition (EscobarHoyos2015Keratin17).

KRT17 also interacts with proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as the Akt/mTOR pathway, which is associated with cell proliferation and migration. This interaction enhances tumor growth and metastasis in various cancers, including pancreatic and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Liu2020Keratin; Baraks2021Dissecting). Additionally, KRT17 binds to E3 ubiquitin-ligase and Trim21, driving its ubiquitination and stabilizing its expression, which activates STAT3 and promotes cell proliferation (Baraks2021Dissecting).

In the context of DNA damage response, KRT17 interacts with proteins like gH2AX, 53BP1, and DNA-PKCs, playing a role in the early double-strand break repair pathway (Baraks2021Dissecting). These interactions highlight KRT17's involvement in critical cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
