# SHQ1

## Overview
The SHQ1 gene encodes the SHQ1 protein, a critical assembly factor for H/ACA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), which are essential for the processing and modification of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and telomerase RNAs. The SHQ1 protein functions as a chaperone, particularly for the pseudouridine synthase NAP57, also known as dyskerin, facilitating its proper assembly into H/ACA RNPs by preventing premature interactions and nonspecific RNA binding (AlidouD’Anjou2023Human; Grozdanov2009SHQ1). Structurally, SHQ1 comprises an N-terminal CS domain and a C-terminal SHQ1-specific domain (SSD), which interact with core components of the H/ACA RNP complex, such as Cbf5, to stabilize the assembly process (Li2011Structure). The gene's significance extends to clinical contexts, where mutations in SHQ1 are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and its expression is implicated in various cancers, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (AlHargan2023SHQ1associated; Su2018SHQ1).

## Structure
The SHQ1 protein is essential for the assembly of H/ACA ribonucleoproteins and is composed of two main structural domains: the N-terminal CS domain and the C-terminal SHQ1-specific domain (SSD) (AlidouD’Anjou2023Human; Li2011Structure). The CS domain has a β-sandwich structure similar to Hsp20 superfamily proteins, although it does not interact with yeast Hsp90 (Li2011Structure). The SSD adopts a novel helical fold, consisting of 17 α-helices and 2 short β-strands, forming a unique globular structure (Li2011Structure). This domain interacts with the PUA domain and the C-terminal extension of Cbf5, a core protein of H/ACA RNPs, through a rigid interface characterized by charge complementarity and hydrophobic contacts (Li2011Structure).

The SHQ1 protein acts as an RNA mimic, using structural mimicry to bind the RNA-binding platform of Cbf5, thereby preventing nonspecific RNA binding before the assembly of H/ACA RNA (Walbott2011The). This interaction is crucial for the biogenesis of H/ACA particles and involves specific structural elements such as the HtH1 and HtH2 loops, which mimic the RNA phosphate backbone (Walbott2011The). The SHQ1 protein is not present in mature or pre-assembled H/ACA RNPs, as it is displaced by H/ACA RNAs due to overlapping binding sites on the PUA domain (Li2011Structure).

## Function
The SHQ1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and stability of H/ACA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), which are essential for the processing and modification of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and telomerase RNAs. In healthy human cells, SHQ1 functions as a chaperone for the pseudouridine synthase NAP57, also known as dyskerin, by binding to it in the cytoplasm and escorting it to the nucleus. This interaction is crucial for protecting dyskerin from degradation and non-specific RNA binding, ensuring its proper assembly into H/ACA RNPs (AlidouD’Anjou2023Human; Grozdanov2009SHQ1).

SHQ1 is involved in the early stages of H/ACA RNP biogenesis, binding to NAP57 before its association with other core proteins and H/ACA RNAs. This binding prevents the premature association of NAP57 with other proteins, such as NAF1, indicating a sequential role in RNP assembly (Grozdanov2009SHQ1). SHQ1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, lacking a classical nuclear localization signal, and may rely on NAP57's signals for nuclear import (Grozdanov2009SHQ1). The proper function of SHQ1 is vital for ribosome biogenesis and cellular protein synthesis, as mutations in SHQ1 can lead to defects in ribosome assembly and function, resulting in diseases known as ribosomopathies (AlidouD’Anjou2023Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SHQ1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and hematological disorders. A novel homozygous variant in SHQ1, c.833 T > C (p.I278T), has been linked to a milder form of SHQ1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by global developmental delay, seizures, and diffuse white matter hypomyelination (AlHargan2023SHQ1associated). Other variants, such as R335C and A426V, have been associated with severe neurodevelopmental deficiencies, including cerebellar degeneration, due to impaired ribosome biogenesis (AlidouD’Anjou2023Human).

In the context of cancer, SHQ1 is implicated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), where it is highly expressed and regulated by NOTCH1. SHQ1 is essential for the survival of T-ALL cells, as its depletion leads to impaired RNA splicing and downregulation of the MYC gene, crucial for leukemogenesis (Su2018SHQ1). SHQ1 expression is also altered in various cancers, including prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its reduced expression is linked to tumor progression (Liu2020SHQ1). These findings highlight the gene's role in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, emphasizing its clinical significance.

## Interactions
SHQ1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of H/ACA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) by interacting with several key proteins and nucleic acids. It specifically binds to the protein Cbf5, also known as NAP57 in humans, which is a core component of the H/ACA RNP complex. This interaction is characterized by SHQ1 binding to the PUA domain and the C-terminal extension of Cbf5, forming a stable complex that prevents nonspecific RNA binding and aggregation (Walbott2011The; Li2011Structure).

SHQ1 acts as an assembly chaperone, protecting Cbf5 from premature interactions with RNA. It competes with H/ACA RNA for binding to Cbf5, effectively serving as an RNA placeholder during the early stages of RNP assembly (Walbott2011The). SHQ1's interaction with Cbf5 is not disrupted by other H/ACA RNP proteins such as Nop10, Nhp2, and Gar1, or by the assembly factor Naf1, although H/ACA RNAs can displace SHQ1 due to overlapping binding sites (Li2011Structure).

SHQ1 also interacts with Naf1p and Nhp2p, but not with Gar1p, indicating specific protein-protein interactions that are crucial for the biogenesis of H/ACA RNPs (Yang2002The). These interactions highlight SHQ1's role in stabilizing the assembly of H/ACA RNPs and preventing unwanted RNA interactions.
