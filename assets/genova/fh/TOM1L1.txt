# TOM1L1

## Overview
TOM1L1 (Target of Myb1-like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in membrane trafficking and signal transduction, playing a critical role in endocytosis and the sorting of endosomal cargo. The protein, known as the myb1-like 1 membrane trafficking protein, is characterized by its N-terminal VHS domain, central GAT domain, and a C-terminal region that includes motifs for protein interactions. As a clathrin-binding adaptor, TOM1L1 is integral to the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling at the plasma membrane, impacting cellular communication and homeostasis (Judge2021Clathrin). The protein's interactions with clathrin, Src family kinases, and other sorting proteins like TOLLIP underscore its role in cellular processes such as invadopodia formation and extracellular matrix degradation, which are significant in cancer cell invasion (Chevalier2016TOM1L1; YanagidaIshizaki2008Recruitment). Dysregulation of TOM1L1, particularly in the context of breast cancer, highlights its clinical significance, as it is often co-amplified with ERBB2, contributing to increased invasiveness and reduced metastasis-free survival in patients (Chevalier2016TOM1L1).

## Structure
TOM1L1 is a protein involved in membrane trafficking and is part of the TOM1 family, which includes TOM1 and TOM1-like 2 (TOM1L2). The protein structure of TOM1L1 is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains an N-terminal VHS (Vps27, Hrs, and STAM) domain and a central GAT (GGA and TOM1) domain. These domains are crucial for interactions with endosomal sorting proteins like TOLLIP and ubiquitin (Roach2021Protein; YanagidaIshizaki2008Recruitment).

The C-terminal region of TOM1L1 includes several protein interaction motifs, such as a SRC-SH3-binding site, a leucine-rich motif for clathrin heavy chain binding, and three tyrosine residues that, when phosphorylated by SRC, create binding sites for SH2-containing signaling proteins (Chevalier2016TOM1L1). TOM1L1 also contains PTAP and PSAP sequences that facilitate interaction with the UEV domain of Tsg101, which is significant for multivesicular body formation and cytokinesis (YanagidaIshizaki2008Recruitment).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in TOM1L1's activity and interactions, particularly in the context of breast cancer cell invasion (Chevalier2016TOM1L1). The protein may exist in different splice variant isoforms, potentially altering its functional properties.

## Function
TOM1L1, a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and signal transduction, plays a significant role in endocytosis and the sorting of endosomal cargo. It is characterized by an N-terminal VHS domain, a central GGA and Tom (GAT) domain, and a distinct C-terminal region (Judge2021Clathrin). TOM1L1 interacts with clathrin and Src family kinases, facilitating the localization of these kinases near epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-bound signaling adaptors, which can lead to Akt phosphorylation (Judge2021Clathrin). This interaction suggests that TOM1L1 acts as a clathrin-binding adaptor, regulating EGFR signaling at the plasma membrane (Judge2021Clathrin).

TOM1L1 is also involved in the trafficking of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) to invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions involved in extracellular matrix degradation. This process is facilitated by the phosphorylation of TOM1L1 on Ser321, promoting its association with the sorting protein TOLLIP, which enables the trafficking of MT1-MMP from endocytic compartments to invadopodia (Chevalier2016TOM1L1). TOM1L1's role in these processes highlights its importance in cellular communication and homeostasis, impacting various cellular functions and potentially contributing to cancer cell invasion when dysregulated (Chevalier2016TOM1L1).

## Clinical Significance
The TOM1L1 gene is implicated in breast cancer, particularly in cases where there is overexpression of ERBB2 (HER2). It is often co-amplified with ERBB2 in HER2-positive and estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers, which are linked to early metastatic relapse. This co-amplification is associated with increased invasiveness of cancer cells, as TOM1L1 enhances the formation of invadopodia and facilitates the trafficking of the metalloprotease MT1-MMP to the plasma membrane, promoting extracellular matrix degradation and tumor cell invasion (Chevalier2016TOM1L1). 

Alterations in TOM1L1 expression, particularly its upregulation, are correlated with more aggressive breast cancer phenotypes and reduced patient survival. The gene's amplification is linked to reduced metastasis-free survival in patients with ERBB2-positive/ER-positive breast cancer (Chevalier2016TOM1L1). 

TOM1L1 also plays a role in EGFR signaling, where its interaction with clathrin is crucial for EGF-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Alterations in TOM1L1 expression or function can impact EGFR signaling pathways, which are implicated in cancer (Judge2021Clathrin). These findings suggest that targeting the TOM1L1-ERBB2 pathway could be of therapeutic value in treating certain breast cancers (Chevalier2016TOM1L1).

## Interactions
TOM1L1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking. It is part of the Vps27/Hrs/Stam (VHS) domain-containing family and interacts with clathrin, a protein crucial for endocytosis. TOM1L1 binds directly to the clathrin heavy chain (CHC) via the F 449 DPL motif, forming complexes with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Grb2, an adaptor protein involved in signal transduction (Judge2021Clathrin). This interaction is essential for the internalization of EGFR via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and regulates the partitioning and localization of Src family kinases (SFKs) at the plasma membrane (Judge2021Clathrin).

TOM1L1 also interacts with TOLLIP, a sorting protein, which is crucial for its role in the trafficking of MT1-MMP, a matrix metalloproteinase involved in extracellular matrix degradation. This interaction is mediated by the TOM1L1-GAT domain and is essential for promoting ERBB2-induced breast cancer cell invasion (Chevalier2016TOM1L1). Additionally, TOM1L1 interacts with Tsg101, a key regulator of multivesicular body (MVB) formation, through PTAP and PSAP sequences, facilitating its recruitment to endosomal structures (YanagidaIshizaki2008Recruitment). These interactions highlight TOM1L1's role in modulating various cellular processes through its interactions with multiple proteins.
