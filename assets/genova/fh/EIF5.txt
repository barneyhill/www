# EIF5

## Overview
The EIF5 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF5), a critical component in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. As a translation initiation factor, eIF5 is involved in the formation of the translation initiation complex, playing a pivotal role in the hydrolysis of GTP bound to eIF2, which is essential for the release of eIF2-GDP and eIF3 from the 40S ribosomal subunit. This process facilitates the joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S initiation complex, which is competent for elongation (Homma2005CK2). Structurally, eIF5 is characterized by its modular domains, including a GTPase activating region and a carboxyl-terminal HEAT domain, which are crucial for its interactions with other initiation factors and the assembly of the multifactor complex (Asano2000A; Luna2013The). These interactions are vital for accurate start codon recognition and efficient translation initiation. The protein's function is further regulated by phosphorylation, highlighting its role in cell cycle progression and response to growth stimuli (Homma2005CK2).

## Structure
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (EIF5) is a protein involved in the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells. EIF5 is characterized by its modular structure, which includes distinct domains that facilitate its function in translation initiation. The protein contains a GTPase activating region at the amino-terminal end (eIF5-NTD; residues 1-170) and a carboxyl-terminal domain (eIF5-CTD; residues 225-409), also known as the HEAT domain due to its structural resemblance to proteins with a series of α-helices (Luna2013The). The HEAT domain is crucial for the assembly of the multifactor complex (MFC) by interacting with other initiation factors such as eIF1, eIF2β, and eIF3, promoting start codon recognition by driving ribosomal pre-initiation complexes into a closed conformation (Asano2000A; Luna2013The).

The carboxy-terminal region of EIF5 contains bipartite sequence motifs with conserved aromatic and acidic residues, known as AA-boxes, which are essential for its interaction with eIF3-NIP1 and eIF2β (Asano2000A). These interactions are necessary for the formation of the multifactor complex, which is important for accurate AUG start codon selection (Asano2000A). The protein's interaction with nucleic acids is dependent on the presence of Zn2+ ions, suggesting a functional role for a zinc-finger structure conserved across various species (Ribera1999Structure). The presence of splice variant isoforms and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may contribute to the functional diversity of EIF5, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The human gene EIF5 encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF5), which is crucial for the initiation of protein synthesis. eIF5 plays a significant role in the formation of the translation initiation complex by mediating the hydrolysis of GTP on eIF2. This hydrolysis is essential for the release of eIF2-GDP and eIF3 from the 40S ribosomal subunit, facilitating the joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form an elongation-competent 80S initiation complex (Homma2005CK2). 

eIF5 is part of a multifactor complex that includes other initiation factors such as eIF1, eIF2, eIF3, and the initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet). This complex is critical for efficient translation initiation and accurate start codon selection (Asano2000A). The carboxyl terminus of eIF5 is important for bridging interactions between eIF2 and eIF3, which is necessary for the stability of the multifactor complex (Asano2000A).

Phosphorylation of eIF5 by CK2 kinase is crucial for its function, as it facilitates the transition from the 40S to the 80S translation initiation complex and is implicated in cell cycle progression (Homma2005CK2). In healthy cells, eIF5's function is regulated by CK2-mediated phosphorylation, which is responsive to growth stimuli and maintained during cell cycle progression (Homma2005CK2).

## Interactions
EIF5, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5, is a key player in the translation initiation process, engaging in multiple interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. EIF5 interacts with the eIF3 core complex, specifically binding to the Nip1p subunit, which helps stabilize the association between eIF3 and eIF5 (Phan1998Identification). This interaction is crucial for the formation of the 43S pre-initiation complex, as eIF5 also interacts with eIF2, facilitating GTP hydrolysis necessary for the transition to the 80S initiation complex (Asano2001Multiple; Wei2006Crystal).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of eIF5 is particularly important for its interactions. It binds to eIF4G, eIF1, and eIF2β, forming a multifactor complex (MFC) that is essential for the assembly of the pre-initiation complex (Asano2001Multiple; Luna2013The). The eIF5-CTD can simultaneously interact with eIF4G and the NIP1 subunit of eIF3, promoting mRNA binding to the ribosome (Asano2001Multiple). Additionally, eIF5 interacts with eIF1A, particularly its N-terminal tail, which is crucial for maintaining eIF1 within the scanning pre-initiation complexes (Luna2013The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of eIF5 in translation initiation.
