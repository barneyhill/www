# KIF5C

## Overview
KIF5C is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 5C, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-1 family, which plays a pivotal role in intracellular transport. This protein is primarily expressed in neurons, where it facilitates the movement of various cellular components, such as mitochondria and RNA-containing granules, along microtubules. The KIF5C protein is characterized by its motor domain, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, enabling it to transport cargo towards the plus end of microtubules (Hirokawa2011From). KIF5C's function is critical for maintaining neuronal function and synaptic plasticity, and its activity is modulated by interactions with adaptor proteins and post-translational modifications (Twelvetrees2019The; Padzik2016KIF5C). Mutations in the KIF5C gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in normal brain development and function (Michels2017Mutations; Willemsen2014Involvement).

## Structure
KIF5C is a member of the kinesin superfamily proteins, specifically part of the kinesin-1 family, which are motor proteins involved in intracellular transport along microtubules. The KIF5C protein consists of 956 amino acids and shares a high degree of similarity with other members of the KIF5 family, particularly in its motor domain and the C-terminal coiled-coil region (Kanai2000KIF5C). The motor domain, located at the N-terminus, is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, facilitating movement towards the plus end of microtubules (Hirokawa2011From).

The secondary structure of KIF5C includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of kinesin proteins, contributing to its ability to form coiled-coil regions essential for dimerization (Kanai2000KIF5C). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, with the motor domain playing a crucial role in its function (Hirokawa2008Intracellular).

KIF5C can form homo-dimers or heterodimers with other KIF5 family members, such as KIF5A and KIF5B, through its coiled-coil regions, which are critical for its quaternary structure and functional motor activity (Swarnkar2021Molecular). The protein is neuron-specific and plays a significant role in neuronal transport processes (Miki2001All).

## Function
KIF5C is a kinesin motor protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular transport, particularly in neurons. It is involved in the transport of various cellular components, including mitochondria, RNA-containing granules, and vesicular traffic, to nerve terminals. This transport occurs along microtubules at a rate of approximately 1 µm/s, which is essential for maintaining neuronal function over long distances (Padzik2016KIF5C). KIF5C shows a preference for binding to detyrosinated microtubules, which enhances its binding affinity and alters its velocity, suggesting that post-translational modifications of tubulin influence its transport efficiency (Dunn2008Differential).

In epithelial cells, KIF5C is involved in the apical trafficking of proteins such as p75 and SI after their release from the trans-Golgi network. It associates with vesicular structures near the apical cell surface, facilitating the transport of both raft-dependent and raft-independent apical cargo (Astanina2010KIF5C). In neurons, KIF5C's function is modulated by phosphorylation at the S176 site, which affects its binding to microtubules and transport efficiency. This phosphorylation, regulated by JNK activity, enhances KIF5C's motility and efficiency in transporting cellular cargo (Padzik2016KIF5C).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIF5C gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. A de novo missense mutation in KIF5C, specifically the c.11465A>C mutation predicting a p.(Glu237Lys) substitution, has been linked to severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, microcephaly, and cortical malformations. This mutation affects the motor domain of the KIF5C protein, leading to a non-functional motor domain and altered protein distribution, which disrupts synaptic function by impairing the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity (Willemsen2014Involvement).

KIF5C mutations are also implicated in a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by infantile-onset epilepsy, absent language, and distinctive malformations of cortical development. Patients with these mutations often present with cortical dysgyria and a thin corpus callosum, as well as significant developmental delays and non-verbal status (Michels2017Mutations).

Additionally, KIF5C is associated with foetal akinesia and arthrogryposis, conditions likely secondary to neurological compromise during fetal development. These conditions can be early indicators of abnormal central nervous system development (Kalantari2020‘Kinesinopathies’:).

## Interactions
KIF5C interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in intracellular transport and neuronal function. It is activated by adaptor proteins HAP1a and GRIP1, which are necessary for its full activation. HAP1a releases KIF5C from autoinhibition, allowing GRIP1 to associate with the kinesin, which cannot occur without HAP1a. This cooperative mechanism involves HAP1a binding to the KIF5C cargo-binding domain (CBD) and a novel interaction between GRIP1 and the KIF5C stalk, stabilizing the central hinge and promoting activation (Twelvetrees2019The).

KIF5C also interacts with RNA-protein complexes, facilitating the transport of RNAs crucial for local translation at synapses. It is associated with a wide range of RNAs, including those involved in synapse function and protein synthesis, highlighting its role in synaptic plasticity and memory (Swarnkar2021Molecular).

In epithelial cells, KIF5C is involved in the trafficking of apical vesicles, associating with both raft-carrying and raft-independent vesicles. It interacts with vesicular carriers through specific attachment components, playing a role in the early steps of post-Golgi trafficking of apical proteins (Astanina2010KIF5C).
