# DBNDD2

## Overview
The DBNDD2 gene encodes the protein dysbindin domain containing 2, which is a member of the dysbindin domain-containing protein family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are still being elucidated. Dysbindin domain containing 2 is implicated in intracellular signaling pathways and may play a role in neuronal function and development. The protein's structure suggests it may interact with other proteins to modulate cellular activities, although specific interaction partners and mechanisms remain under investigation. Research into DBNDD2 and its encoded protein continues to uncover its potential involvement in neurological disorders and other clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
