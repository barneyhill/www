# PLA2G2E

## Overview
The PLA2G2E gene encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group IIE, a member of the secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) family. This enzyme is characterized by its ability to hydrolyze phospholipids, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes. Structurally, the protein exhibits a fold similar to other sPLA2 enzymes, with distinct features that influence its substrate selectivity and interaction with inhibitors (Hou2017Structural). The PLA2G2E gene has been associated with various metabolic and inflammatory conditions, including obesity and ulcerative colitis, highlighting its potential impact on human health (Murakami2016The; Murakami2020Updating). While its expression and function vary between species, the enzyme's involvement in lipid metabolism and inflammation underscores its biological significance.

## Structure
The human secreted phospholipase A2 group IIE (hGIIE) protein, encoded by the PLA2G2E gene, exhibits a structural fold similar to other secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) proteins, such as human GIB, GIIA, and GX. The protein structure includes three major helices, two β-strands, and three short helices surrounding the second calcium binding site, along with seven disulfide bonds that contribute to its stability (Hou2017Structural). The active site features a conserved residue dyad of histidine and aspartic acid, and a calcium binding loop essential for its enzymatic function (Hou2017Structural).

The substrate binding pocket of hGIIE is wider compared to hGIIA, with a neutral or negatively charged α1 region, and the loop region around Lys61 is positioned differently (Hou2017Structural). The C-terminal region of hGIIE is neutral, contrasting with the basic residues found in hGIIA, and includes a unique hydrophobic region formed by residues such as Trp34 and Trp41 (Hou2017Structural). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by these distinct features, which influence its substrate selectivity and interaction with inhibitors (Hou2017Structural). The second calcium binding site is flexible and plays a crucial role in enzymatic activity, although it is less stable and not occupied in inhibitor-bound structures (Hou2017Structural).

## Clinical Significance
The PLA2G2E gene, encoding the secreted phospholipase A2 group IIE enzyme, has been implicated in several metabolic and inflammatory conditions. In mice, the absence of the Pla2g2e gene confers modest protection against diet-induced obesity, fatty liver, and hyperlipidemia, suggesting that PLA2G2E plays a role in facilitating fat accumulation and lipid delivery to adipose tissue and the liver (Murakami2016The; Murakami2014Emerging). This enzyme hydrolyzes minor lipoprotein phospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, which are crucial for lipid metabolism (Murakami2016The).

In humans, a polymorphism in the PLA2G2E gene has been associated with ulcerative colitis, indicating a potential link to inflammatory bowel diseases (Murakami2016The). However, unlike in mice, PLA2G2E is not highly expressed in human adipose tissue, where PLA2G2A might compensate for its function (Murakami2016The). The expression of PLA2G2E is upregulated in mouse adipocytes during diet-induced obesity, and its absence leads to metabolic and hair follicle abnormalities, suggesting a role in these processes (Murakami2020Updating). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in metabolic regulation and its potential impact on human health.
