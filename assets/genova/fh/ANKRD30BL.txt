# ANKRD30BL

## Overview
ANKRD30BL is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 30B-like, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ankyrin repeat domain 30B-like protein may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization. While the specific functions of ANKRD30BL and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, the presence of ankyrin repeats indicates potential involvement in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein complexes and pathways. Further research is needed to clarify the biological roles and clinical significance of this gene and its protein product.
