# GJB6

## Overview
The GJB6 gene encodes the gap junction protein beta 6, commonly known as Connexin 30 (Cx30), which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the connexin family. Connexin 30 is integral to the formation of gap junction channels that facilitate direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. This protein is predominantly expressed in the cochlea and skin, where it plays a critical role in maintaining ionic and metabolic balance, essential for auditory function and epidermal integrity (Essenfelder2005Gene; Liu2022GJB2). Mutations in the GJB6 gene are linked to various forms of hearing loss and skin disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (PallaresRuiz2002A; Rabionet2000Molecular).

## Structure
The GJB6 gene encodes the protein Connexin 30, which is a member of the connexin family involved in forming gap junction channels that facilitate intercellular communication. The protein structure of Connexin 30 includes four hydrophobic transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, one intracellular loop, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini (Kirichenko2021Structure). These structural features are typical of connexins, allowing them to oligomerize into hexameric complexes known as connexons. Connexons from adjacent cells dock to form complete gap junction channels, enabling the passage of ions and small molecules between cells (Kirichenko2021Structure).

Connexin 30 is expressed in various tissues, including the cochlea, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining auditory function by forming gap junctions in non-sensory cells (Wu2019Structure). The protein's C-terminus is variable and involved in interactions with non-connexin proteins, as well as in phosphorylation, which is a common post-translational modification that regulates connexin functions such as synthesis, transport, and channel gating (Kirichenko2021Structure). The compatibility of Connexin 30 with other connexins, such as Connexin 26, is important for its physiological roles, affecting properties like conductance and permeability (Wu2019Structure).

## Function
The GJB6 gene encodes connexin 30 (Cx30), a protein that forms gap junction channels essential for intercellular communication. These channels allow the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue function. Cx30 is predominantly expressed in the cochlea and skin, where it contributes to the regulation of ionic and metabolic balance (Essenfelder2005Gene; Liu2022GJB2).

In the cochlea, Cx30 is involved in the formation of intercellular networks that are crucial for generating the endocochlear potential, a key electrical gradient necessary for auditory sensitivity. This function is vital for maintaining the survival of auditory hair cells and ensuring proper hearing (Teubner2003Connexin30). Cx30 is expressed in various cochlear cell types, including intermediate cells of the stria vascularis, where it plays a role in potassium ion recirculation, contributing to endolymph production and fluid homeostasis (Liu2022GJB2).

In the epidermis, Cx30 is involved in keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal integrity, highlighting its importance in skin function and structure (Essenfelder2005Gene). Mutations in GJB6 can lead to conditions such as non-syndromic hearing loss and Hidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia, underscoring its critical role in both auditory and skin health (Essenfelder2005Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GJB6 gene, which encodes connexin 30, are associated with various forms of hearing loss. A specific mutation, T5M, results in a non-functional protein and is linked to dominant sensorineural deafness, particularly affecting middle/high-frequency hearing (Rabionet2000Molecular). The GJB6 gene is also implicated in non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) through a large deletion that can occur in homozygosity or in combination with mutations in the GJB2 gene, such as 35delG or E47X (Lerer2001A; PallaresRuiz2002A). This deletion is prevalent in certain populations and is considered a founder mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish community (Lerer2001A).

The GJB6 gene, along with GJB2, defines the DFNA3 locus, and mutations in these genes are involved in both hearing loss and inherited skin disorders (PallaresRuiz2002A). The co-expression of connexins 26 and 30 in the inner ear is crucial for cochlear maturation, suggesting that their interaction may form functional channels necessary for hearing (PallaresRuiz2002A). The del(GJB6-D13S1830) deletion is a significant cause of hearing loss when present in trans with a pathogenic GJB2 allele, affecting the expression of GJB2 or involving a digenic mode of inheritance (Pandya2020Analyses).

## Interactions
The GJB6 gene encodes connexin 30 (Cx30), a protein that forms gap junction channels crucial for intercellular communication. Cx30 physically interacts with connexin 26 (Cx26), encoded by the GJB2 gene, to form heteromeric gap junctions in the cochlea. These interactions have been demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, which showed that Cx26 and Cx30 can coassemble into the same gap junctions in cochlear tissues and reconstituted gap junctions in HEK-293 cells (Sun2005Cochlear). The coassembly of Cx26 and Cx30 results in faster intercellular calcium signaling compared to homomeric assemblies, highlighting the functional significance of their interaction in cochlear function (Sun2005Cochlear).

In addition to its role in the cochlea, Cx30 is expressed in various human tissues, including hair follicles, nail units, and palmoplantar epidermis, which are affected in Clouston syndrome. The expression of Cx30 in these tissues often overlaps with that of the transcription factor p63, which regulates GJB6 expression by binding to its promoter region (Fujimoto2013GJB6). This regulatory interaction suggests a broader role for Cx30 in tissue homeostasis beyond the cochlea.
