# SEC13

## Overview
SEC13 is a gene that encodes the SEC13 homolog, a protein integral to various cellular processes, including protein trafficking and nuclear pore complex assembly. The SEC13 protein is categorized as a component of the COPII coat complex, which is essential for the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, a critical step in the secretory pathway (Anglès2024COPII). Structurally, SEC13 is characterized by a beta-propeller configuration formed by WD40 repeats, facilitating its role in protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes (Devos2004Components). Beyond its role in vesicular transport, SEC13 is also involved in the nuclear pore complex, contributing to mRNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Anglès2024COPII). Its multifunctionality extends to interactions with various proteins, impacting processes such as chromatin organization and neuronal function (Anglès2024COPII). The gene's significance is underscored by its involvement in developmental processes and immune regulation, with mutations linked to various clinical conditions, including craniofacial defects and immune dysregulation (Moreira2015Sec13; Lu2020Consequences).

## Structure
The SEC13 protein is characterized by its beta-propeller structure, primarily formed by WD40 repeats. This configuration consists of a single-domain beta-propeller with six blades, placing SEC13 within the well-conserved class of tryptophan/aspartic acid (WD) repeat-containing proteins (Devos2004Components). In the context of the COPII vesicle coat, SEC13 forms a monomeric beta-propeller structure due to its seven WD40 repeats, contributing to its globular shape with a molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa and a diameter of 3.5 nm (Lederkremer2001Structure).

SEC13 is part of the SEC13/31 complex, which is a heterotetramer composed of two copies of SEC13 and two copies of SEC31. This complex is elongated and flexible, measuring about 28-30 nm in length, and consists of five linearly arranged globular domains (Lederkremer2001Structure). The SEC13 protein's WD40 propeller domain is crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions, facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes (Anglès2024COPII). SEC13 is also involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization and protein trafficking, highlighting its multifunctional nature within the cell (Anglès2024COPII).

## Function
The SEC13 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the COPII coat complex, which is essential for the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This process is crucial for proper protein trafficking, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is important for maintaining ion balance and hydration in various tissues (Anglès2024COPII). SEC13 is involved in the assembly of the COPII coat, specifically in forming a cage-like structure that facilitates the budding of vesicles from the ER (Anglès2024COPII). 

SEC13 also plays a role in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly, which is involved in the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Anglès2024COPII). It is part of the GATOR2 complex, acting as a nutrient sensor in the lysosomal pathway and interacting with proteins that regulate neuronal function (Anglès2024COPII). SEC13 is proposed to be a master regulator of endomembrane function, balancing cellular processes in response to environmental and genetic variations (Anglès2024COPII). Its activity is crucial for maintaining the composition and flow of secretory and membrane-bound cargo through the endomembrane system to the cell surface (Anglès2024COPII).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SEC13 gene have significant clinical implications. In vertebrates, SEC13 is crucial for proper development and cellular function. SEC13 knockout mice are not viable, indicating its essential role in survival (Lu2020Consequences). In zebrafish, mutations in SEC13 lead to defects in craniofacial development, malformed skeletal cartilage, and hypoplastic digestive organs due to impaired ER export and increased cellular stress (Lu2020Consequences).

In humans, SEC13 is involved in the regulation of immune responses. Reduced expression of SEC13 in mice leads to a decreased pro-inflammatory profile and altered cytokine production, which can contribute to immune dysregulation and conditions like hypergammaglobulinemia, seen in autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (Moreira2015Sec13). SEC13 also plays a role in the central nervous system, where it is essential for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Disruption of SEC13 can lead to neurological disorders characterized by demyelination, such as multiple sclerosis (Liu2022Sec13).

SEC13's involvement in protein trafficking is highlighted by its role in the stability and degradation of the CFTR protein, associated with cystic fibrosis. Silencing SEC13 can improve CFTR stability, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for cystic fibrosis (Anglès2024COPII).

## Interactions
SEC13 is a protein that participates in various interactions essential for its role in cellular processes. In Arabidopsis, SEC13A and SEC13B interact with the SUF4 protein, a member of the FRI complex, which is involved in the regulation of flowering. These interactions were confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screenings, pull-down experiments, luciferase complementary imaging assays, and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The C-terminal fragment of SUF4, containing a proline-rich domain, is sufficient for interaction with SEC13A and SEC13B, suggesting a role in flowering regulation (Yang2023Arabidopsis).

In yeast, SEC13 is part of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and interacts with Nup145C and Nup84, forming a trimeric complex that is crucial for the structural assembly of the NPC lattice. SEC13 completes the open 6-bladed β-propeller structure of Nup145C, which is essential for the formation of the NPC lattice (Brohawn2009Molecular).

SEC13 also plays a role in the COPII coat complex, where it interacts with SEC31 and SEC23. This interaction is important for the assembly of the COPII coat and the transport of proteins out of the endoplasmic reticulum. SEC13, along with SEC31, forms a cage-like structure that is crucial for vesicle formation (Bhattacharya2012The).
