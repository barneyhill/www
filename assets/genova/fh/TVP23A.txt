# TVP23A

## Overview
TVP23A is a gene that encodes the trans-golgi network vesicle protein 23 homolog A, which is involved in the trafficking and sorting of proteins within the Golgi apparatus. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the trans-Golgi network. The TVP23A protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including vesicle formation and transport, which are essential for proper cellular function and homeostasis. Mutations or dysregulation of TVP23A have been associated with certain pathological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
