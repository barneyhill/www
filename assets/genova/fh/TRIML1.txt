# TRIML1

## Overview
TRIML1, or tripartite motif family like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the TRIM family, which is characterized by a distinctive tripartite motif. This motif includes a RING finger, B-box, and coiled-coil domains, which are integral to the protein's function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The TRIML1 protein plays a pivotal role in cellular protein homeostasis by facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This process is essential for regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular equilibrium. TRIML1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and immune response modulation, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Its involvement in ubiquitylation is crucial for cellular stress responses and signaling pathway regulation, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and immune defense mechanisms (Napolitano2011TRIM; Sardiello2008Genomic).

## Function
TRIML1 is a member of the TRIM family of proteins, which are characterized by a tripartite motif consisting of a RING finger, B-box, and coiled-coil domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions and endow TRIML1 with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, allowing it to mediate the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by regulating protein degradation and turnover (Napolitano2011TRIM; Sardiello2008Genomic).

In healthy human cells, TRIML1 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription and modulation of immune responses. Its activity is observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell signaling pathways. The protein's role in ubiquitylation is essential for cellular responses to stress and the regulation of signaling pathways, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sardiello2008Genomic).

TRIML1, like other TRIM proteins, may also play a role in species-specific immune responses, potentially contributing to resistance against viral infections. This function highlights its importance in the innate immune system and its evolutionary significance in vertebrates (Sardiello2008Genomic).
