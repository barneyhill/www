# GXYLT1

## Overview
GXYLT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme glucoside xylosyltransferase 1, which is a type of glycosyltransferase. This enzyme is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through the xylosylation of O-glucose glycans on epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats. This modification is crucial for the proper functioning of the Notch signaling pathway, which regulates key cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Urata2020Xylosyl; Sethi2010Identification). The enzyme operates within the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the glycosylation pathways essential for the quality control and surface expression of Notch receptors (Urata2020Xylosyl). GXYLT1's role extends to interactions with signaling pathways, such as the MAPK pathway, influencing cancer progression and metastasis (Peng2022A). Additionally, mutations and altered expression of GXYLT1 have been linked to diseases like colorectal cancer and congenital heart defects, highlighting its clinical significance (Shi2018Nextgeneration; Peng2022A).

## Function
GXYLT1 (glucoside xylosyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of proteins, specifically through the xylosylation of O-glucose glycans on epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats. This modification is essential for the proper functioning of the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Urata2020Xylosyl; Sethi2010Identification). GXYLT1, along with GXYLT2, is responsible for adding the first xylose residue to O-glucosylated EGF repeats, forming an α1,3-linkage (Sethi2010Identification).

The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in glycosylation pathways that are vital for the quality control of Notch receptors. This includes the trafficking and secretion of their extracellular domains, which are necessary for their cell surface expression and function in signaling pathways (Urata2020Xylosyl). The xylosylation process mediated by GXYLT1 is also involved in the regulation of Notch signaling strength, potentially by modulating the surface expression of the Notch receptor (Lee2013Negative). This regulatory role is significant for maintaining normal cellular processes and tissue development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GXYLT1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably colorectal cancer (CRC). The GXYLT1 gene encodes a glucoside xylosyltransferase involved in the elongation of O-glucose glycans on Notch proteins, which is crucial for their cell surface trafficking. In CRC, GXYLT1 was found to be recurrently mutated in 40% of samples analyzed, with elevated mRNA levels observed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. These levels increased with tumor progression, and high GXYLT1 expression was associated with poorer disease-free and overall survival in CRC patients (Peng2022A). A specific stop-gain mutation, GXYLT1 S212*, was linked to increased metastatic activity in CRC, promoting metastasis via the MAPK pathway (Peng2022A). 

In addition to its role in cancer, GXYLT1 has been associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC), a rare congenital heart defect. In TAPVC patients, GXYLT1 was one of the candidate genes found to be significantly down-regulated, with rare damage-associated variants accounting for a significant portion of the genetic alterations observed (Shi2018Nextgeneration). These findings suggest that GXYLT1 plays a role in both cancer progression and congenital heart defects.

## Interactions
GXYLT1, a glucoside xylosyltransferase, is involved in the modification of O-glucosylated epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats of the Notch protein. It interacts with ERK2, a component of the MAPK pathway, which is crucial for the activation of the MAPK cascade and the promotion of colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. This interaction is significant as it enhances the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2 proteins, thereby facilitating cancer cell migration and invasion (Peng2022A).

GXYLT1 also plays a role in the xylosylation of O-Glc glycans on NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 proteins. It is responsible for the addition of the first xylose residue, which is essential for the proper trafficking of Notch proteins to the cell surface. This process is important for the regulation of Notch receptor function and is facilitated by the interaction of GXYLT1 with the O-Glc glycans on Notch proteins (Urata2020Xylosyl).

These interactions highlight the dual role of GXYLT1 in both glycosylation and signaling pathways, contributing to its involvement in cancer progression and metastasis.
