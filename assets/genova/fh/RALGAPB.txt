# RALGAPB

## Overview
RALGAPB is a gene that encodes the Ral GTPase activating protein non-catalytic subunit beta, a crucial component of the Ral GTPase-activating protein complex. This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of Ral GTPases, particularly RalA and RalB, which are involved in essential cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell proliferation. As a non-catalytic subunit, RALGAPB facilitates the inactivation of Ral proteins by promoting the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thereby maintaining RalA in its inactive form. Additionally, RALGAPB functions as a scaffold protein, interacting with various mitotic regulators and microtubules, and is dynamically localized within the cell during different stages of the cell cycle. This dynamic localization is critical for proper mitotic regulation, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and genomic stability. Dysregulation of RALGAPB has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Personnic2014A; Gao2019Ral; Wagner2020Biallelic).

## Function
RALGAPB, the non-catalytic subunit of the Ral GTPase-activating protein complex, plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of Ral GTPases, specifically RalA and RalB, which are involved in various cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell proliferation. RALGAPB facilitates the inactivation of Ral proteins by promoting the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thereby maintaining RalA in its inactive GDP-bound form (Shirakawa2015Ral; Wagner2020Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, RALGAPB is involved in mitotic regulation by localizing to the Golgi and nucleus during interphase and relocating to the mitotic spindle and cytokinetic intercellular bridge during mitosis. This dynamic localization is essential for the proper alignment of chromosomes and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and preventing premature activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (Personnic2014A).

RALGAPB also acts as a scaffold protein, interacting with spindle microtubules and other mitotic regulators, and its activity may be regulated by phosphorylation during different cell cycle stages. Its proper function is critical for maintaining genomic stability and preventing carcinogenesis (Personnic2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RALGAPB gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies have identified an excess of de novo variants in the RALGAPB gene among individuals with ASD, including frameshift and missense variants. These findings suggest that RALGAPB may be a risk gene for neurodevelopmental disorders, although the significance of these variants did not hold after genome-wide multiple testing correction (Shah2020Excess).

RALGAPB is also implicated in mitotic regulation, and its dysregulation can lead to chromosomal instability, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis. Depletion of RALGAPB results in mitotic spindle destabilization and chromosome misalignment, which are defects in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). This instability may play a role in cancer development (Personnic2014A).

In cancer, downregulation of RALGAPB has been linked to increased RalA activation, promoting migration and invasion in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. This suggests that RALGAPB acts as a negative regulator of Ral GTPases, and its reduced expression may enhance cancer progression (Gao2019Ral).

## Interactions
RALGAPB, the non-catalytic subunit of the Ral GTPase-activating protein complex, participates in several key protein interactions. It forms a complex with the catalytic subunits RalGAPa1 and RalGAPa2, which is essential for inhibiting Ral activity (Personnic2014A). RALGAPB also interacts with α-tubulin, β5-tubulin, and the chaperone protein HSP70, which is involved in organizing the mitotic spindle, suggesting its association with mitotic microtubules (Personnic2014A). These interactions indicate a role in the spatiotemporal control of mitotic steps, particularly in delaying anaphase onset and cytokinesis (Personnic2014A).

During mitosis, RALGAPB relocates to the mitotic spindle and intercellular bridge, where it may act as a scaffold protein, bridging spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) effectors and regulators (Personnic2014A). Its interaction with RalGAPa1/2 and tubulins suggests a direct involvement in spindle microtubule assembly (Personnic2014A). The phosphorylation of RALGAPB at various sites during the cell cycle may regulate its activity, further influencing its interactions and role in cell division (Personnic2014A). These interactions are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing carcinogenesis (Personnic2014A).
