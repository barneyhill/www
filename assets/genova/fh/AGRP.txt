# AGRP

## Overview
The agouti-related protein (AGRP) gene encodes the agouti-related neuropeptide, a critical component in the regulation of energy homeostasis and appetite. AGRP is primarily expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and functions as an antagonist to melanocortin receptors, particularly MC3R and MC4R, influencing feeding behavior and energy expenditure. The protein is characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich C-terminal domain, which is essential for its biological activity and structural integrity. AGRP undergoes post-translational modifications to produce its active form, which plays a significant role in modulating appetite and body weight. Variations in the AGRP gene have been associated with metabolic conditions and eating disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining energy balance (Wilczynski2005Current; Ilnytska2008The; Ollmann1997Antagonism).

## Structure
The agouti-related protein (AGRP) is a neuropeptide consisting of 132 amino acids, with its primary structure encoded by the AGRP gene located on chromosome 16q22 (Stütz2005The; Ilnytska2008The). The protein features a signal peptide sequence, an acidic middle portion, and a conserved cysteine-rich C-terminal domain (Wilczynski2005Current). This C-terminal domain is crucial for its biological activity and contains ten cysteines forming five disulfide bonds, which are essential for maintaining the protein's structure and function (Wilczynski2005Current; Västermark2012Identification).

The tertiary structure of AGRP is characterized by an inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold, which includes three loops: the N-terminal loop, a central loop, and a C-terminal loop. The central loop, particularly the Arg-Phe-Phe triplet, is critical for AGRP's antagonistic activity at melanocortin receptors (Wilczynski2005Current). The protein's structure is similar to certain toxins and channel blockers, with the disulfide bonds contributing to its stability (Västermark2012Identification).

AGRP undergoes post-translational processing, which may involve cleavage by prohormone convertases, resulting in the active form AGRP(83-132) (Pritchard2005Agoutirelated). This processing is crucial for its function as a melanocortin receptor antagonist (Pritchard2005Agoutirelated).

## Function
The Agouti-related protein (AGRP) is a neuropeptide primarily expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, where it plays a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis and appetite. AGRP functions as an antagonist to melanocortin receptors, particularly MC3R and MC4R, inhibiting their activity. This antagonism leads to increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure, contributing to the regulation of body weight and metabolism (Ilnytska2008The; Ollmann1997Antagonism).

AGRP is co-expressed with neuropeptide Y (NPY) in neurons that respond to nutrient depletion, and its expression is modulated by various hormones. Leptin and insulin decrease AGRP expression, thereby reducing appetite, while ghrelin increases its expression, stimulating feeding behavior (Stütz2005The; Ilnytska2008The). AGRP neurons are activated by energy deficit signals and inhibited by energy surplus signals, such as leptin, which indicates fat stores (Sternson2014AgoutiRelated).

In addition to its central role in the hypothalamus, AGRP is expressed in peripheral tissues like the adrenal gland, where it may influence energy balance through additional mechanisms (Stütz2005The). The protein's involvement in energy homeostasis is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in maintaining energy balance (Stütz2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AGRP gene have been implicated in several eating disorders and metabolic conditions. The Ala67Thr polymorphism in the AGRP gene is associated with anorexia nervosa (AN) and resistance to late-onset obesity, particularly in White populations. This polymorphism is linked to decreased fat intake and increased carbohydrate consumption, suggesting a role in energy balance regulation (Ilnytska2008The). The Ala67Thr variant is also associated with inherited leanness, as individuals homozygous for the 67Thr allele exhibit lower body weight, BMI, fat mass, and leptin levels (Marks2004Ala67Thr).

In the context of AN, specific AGRP gene polymorphisms have been found to increase susceptibility to the disorder. These variations may lead to defective suppression of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), resulting in decreased feeding signals and increased risk of AN (Vink2001Association). Elevated plasma AgRP levels have been observed in AN patients, correlating with cognitive impairments associated with the condition (Méquinion2020The).

AGRP gene variants generally protect against weight gain in obesigenic environments, although some mutations, like the rare +79G>A mutation, may predispose individuals to weight gain and reduced resting metabolic rate (Ilnytska2008The).

## Interactions
AGRP (agouti-related neuropeptide) primarily interacts with melanocortin receptors, specifically MC3R and MC4R, acting as an antagonist to inhibit their activity. This interaction is crucial for its role in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis. AGRP binds with higher affinity to MC4R than MC3R, with the C-terminal domain containing a critical octapeptide loop that is essential for binding affinity and antagonist activity. The RFF triplet within this loop is particularly important for receptor interaction (Tota1998Molecular).

AGRP is posttranslationally cleaved by proprotein convertase 1 (PC1/3) to produce a more potent fragment, AGRP 83-132, which is a more effective inhibitor of MC4R than the full-length protein (Creemers2006AgoutiRelated). The interaction between AGRP 83-132 and melanocortin receptors is not influenced by syndecan-3, a proteoglycan initially proposed as a coreceptor for MC4R (Creemers2006AgoutiRelated).

AGRP also interacts with leptin, a hormone involved in energy balance. Leptin regulates AGRP expression in the hypothalamus and adrenal gland, suggesting a feedback loop between these molecules (Charbonneau2004Central). These interactions highlight AGRP's role in modulating feeding behavior and energy balance through its antagonistic effects on melanocortin receptors.
