# SAXO4

## Overview
SAXO4 is a gene that encodes the protein stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 4, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella. The protein is involved in the stabilization of axonemal microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton in these organelles. As a microtubule-associated protein, stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 4 contributes to the maintenance of proper ciliary and flagellar function, which is vital for cellular processes such as motility and signal transduction. Mutations or dysregulation of SAXO4 can lead to defects in ciliary function, potentially resulting in a range of ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by dysfunctional cilia (Qiu2020aarFDC).
