# MX2

## Overview
The MX2 gene encodes the MX dynamin-like GTPase 2 protein, also known as MxB, which is a member of the interferon-inducible GTPase superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the innate immune response, where it plays a crucial role in inhibiting the replication of certain viruses, notably HIV-1. MX2 is characterized by its structural domains, including a GTPase domain and a stalk domain, which facilitate its antiviral functions through interactions with viral components and cellular factors. Unlike its closely related counterpart MX1, which targets a broader range of viruses, MX2 is specifically effective against HIV-1, acting at a late post-entry step to prevent viral replication. The expression of MX2 is upregulated by interferon-alpha, and its activity is essential for cellular defense mechanisms against viral infections (Goujon2013Human; Haller2015Mx). Additionally, MX2 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in melanoma, where its expression levels and genetic variants can influence disease susceptibility and progression (Choi2020Massively; Juraleviciute2021MX2).

## Structure
The MX2 protein, encoded by the MX2 gene, is a member of the dynamin-like GTPase family and plays a significant role in antiviral defense mechanisms. Structurally, MX2 is composed of several distinct domains: a disordered N-terminal domain (NTD), a GTPase (G) domain, and a stalk (ST) domain, which are connected by three hinge-like bundle signaling elements (BSEs) (Betancor2019The). The NTD is longer in MX2 compared to its related protein MX1 and is crucial for its interaction with the HIV-1 capsid (Kong2014Characterization). The GTPase domain contains a tripartite GTP-binding motif and a dynamin signature, which are essential for its GTPase activity (Verhelst2013Mx).

The tertiary structure of MX2 includes a four-helix bundle within the stalk domain, which is important for dimerization, a key aspect of its quaternary structure (Xu2015Structural). The MX2 protein can form dimers, which are necessary for its antiviral function, although higher-order oligomerization is not required (Betancor2019The). The G domain also provides a secondary capsid-binding site, enhancing the protein's antiviral activity (Betancor2019The). The MX2 protein's structure allows it to interact with multiple ligands, including the HIV-1 capsid and cellular factors like nucleoporins (Betancor2019The).

## Function
The MX2 gene encodes the myxovirus resistance 2 (MxB) protein, which is a member of the interferon-inducible GTPase superfamily. This protein plays a significant role in the innate immune response by inhibiting the replication of certain viruses, particularly HIV-1. MX2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear envelope, where it disrupts viral processes, contributing to cellular and organismal immunity (Goujon2013Human; Haller2015Mx).

In healthy human cells, MX2 is involved in cellular processes such as membrane remodeling, vesicular transport, and cytokinesis. It accumulates at the cytoplasmic face of nuclear pore complexes and may influence cell cycle progression (Goujon2013Human). The protein's antiviral mechanism involves inhibiting the nuclear accumulation and chromosomal integration of nascent viral cDNA, thereby blocking the replication of HIV-1 at a late post-entry step (Goujon2013Human; Haller2015Mx).

MX2 is distinct from its closely related counterpart, MX1, which inhibits a broader range of RNA and DNA viruses but not HIV-1. The expression of MX2 is inducible by interferon-alpha (IFNα), and its presence is associated with resistance to HIV-1 infection in various cell types, including monocyte-derived macrophages and primary CD4+ T cells (Goujon2013Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MX2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly melanoma. The MX2 gene is associated with melanoma susceptibility, with specific genetic variants such as rs398206 affecting its expression levels. This variant influences the binding of the transcription factor YY1, leading to increased MX2 expression, which is linked to a higher risk of melanoma (Choi2020Massively). In melanoma, MX2 is involved in cellular growth and cancer pathways, and its expression is modulated by genetic variants that may contribute to melanoma development (Choi2020Massively).

MX2 also plays a role in the interferon response and has been shown to have tumor-suppressive features in melanoma by negatively modifying AKT activity and influencing cell cycle and tumor growth. Its downregulation during melanoma progression is associated with poorer patient survival, and its overexpression can sensitize melanoma cells to targeted therapies (Juraleviciute2021MX2). Additionally, MX2 has been identified as a potential biomarker for sunitinib resistance in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, suggesting its broader implications in cancer treatment (Wei2021Identification).

## Interactions
The MX2 protein interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in antiviral defense. MX2 forms cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates that mimic nuclear pore complexes, which are crucial for its antiviral activity against viruses like HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (Moschonas2023MX2). These condensates involve interactions with FG-rich nucleoporins and granule-associated ribonucleoproteins, such as SAMD4A, TNPO1, and NUP35, which are essential for MX2's ability to restrict these viruses (Moschonas2023MX2).

MX2 also interacts with nuclear transport proteins and cytoplasmic granule-associated ribonucleoproteins involved in translation regulation and RNA catabolic processes (Moschonas2023MX2). The protein's N-terminal disordered domain and dimerization are critical for forming these condensates and for its antiviral function (Moschonas2023MX2). MX2's interaction with the HIV-1 capsid is facilitated by its GTPase domain, which enhances capsid binding and improves antiviral efficacy (Betancor2019The). This interaction is crucial during the initial phases of an interferon-induced antiviral response (Betancor2019The). MX2's ability to form these interactions and condensates is vital for its role in inhibiting viral replication.
