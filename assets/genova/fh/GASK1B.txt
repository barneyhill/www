# GASK1B

## Overview
GASK1B is a gene that encodes the protein golgi associated kinase 1B, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is categorized as a kinase, a type of enzyme that modifies other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups, a process known as phosphorylation. This modification is crucial for regulating protein activity, interactions, and localization within the cell. Golgi associated kinase 1B is implicated in the regulation of cellular pathways that are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and has been associated with pathological conditions, particularly in the context of cancer. The gene's expression levels have been linked to the prognosis of certain cancers, such as gastric cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and patient outcomes (Weinhäuser2022M2polarized; Cao2021Unsupervised).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
GASK1B has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels. In gastric cancer, high expression of GASK1B is associated with subtype C, which is linked to the highest mortality rate. This subtype is characterized by a high infiltration of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic stem cells, along with a high stromal score, all of which contribute to a poor prognosis (Cao2021Unsupervised). Similarly, in subtype 2 of gastric cancer, elevated expression of GASK1B is correlated with the worst prognosis, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression and poor outcomes (Cao2021Unsupervised).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), GASK1B is part of a gene signature used to predict overall survival. The expression of GASK1B, along with other genes, forms the M2-UMCG signature, which can independently predict overall survival and disease-free survival in AML patients. This signature is specific to M2 macrophages and has been validated in multiple cohorts, indicating its potential utility in risk stratification and treatment personalization (Weinhäuser2022M2polarized).

These findings suggest that GASK1B plays a significant role in the tumor microenvironment and may serve as a prognostic biomarker in certain cancers.
