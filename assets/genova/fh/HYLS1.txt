# HYLS1

## Overview
The HYLS1 gene encodes the HYLS1 centriolar and ciliogenesis associated protein, which plays a pivotal role in the formation and function of cilia, cellular organelles critical for motility and signaling. This protein is categorized as a centriolar scaffold protein, essential for the proper apical targeting and anchoring of centrioles at the plasma membrane, facilitating the organization of basal bodies and the initiation of ciliogenesis (Dammermann2009The). HYLS1 is integral to the early stages of ciliogenesis, particularly in the apical migration and anchoring of centrioles, which supports the elongation of the ciliary axoneme (Dammermann2009The). It interacts with several key proteins, including CEP120 and SAS-4, to maintain centriole structural integrity and function (Dammermann2009The; Curinha2024Centriole). Mutations in the HYLS1 gene are linked to Hydrolethalus Syndrome, a severe ciliopathy characterized by developmental defects, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Honkala2009Unraveling; Curinha2024Centriole).

## Function
The HYLS1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation. This protein is essential for the apical targeting and anchoring of centrioles at the plasma membrane, a necessary step for organizing basal bodies and initiating cilia formation (Dammermann2009The). HYLS1 acts as a centriolar scaffold, being stably incorporated into centrioles during their assembly, which is crucial for its function in ciliogenesis (Dammermann2009The). 

In healthy human cells, HYLS1 is involved in the early steps of ciliogenesis, particularly in the apical migration and anchoring of centrioles at the cell surface, which supports the elongation of the ciliary axoneme (Dammermann2009The). The protein interacts with the core centriolar protein SAS-4, although it is not required for centriole assembly or centrosome function during cell division (Dammermann2009The). 

HYLS1 is also implicated in the formation of the ciliary gate, specifically affecting the transition zone (TZ) integrity and function, which is essential for proper ciliary formation and function (Wei2016The). The absence of HYLS1 leads to disorganized transition fibers and compromised ciliary gating, affecting the entry of intraflagellar transport particles and the stability of axonemal microtubules (Wei2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HYLS1 gene are primarily associated with Hydrolethalus Syndrome (HLS), a severe autosomal recessive ciliopathy. This condition is characterized by developmental defects such as polydactyly, hydrocephaly, and cleft lip or palate, often leading to lethality around birth (Honkala2009Unraveling; Curinha2024Centriole). The syndrome is caused by a specific point mutation, D211G, in the HYLS1 gene, which disrupts its interaction with other centriolar proteins, such as CEP120, leading to defects in centriole structural integrity and ciliogenesis (Dammermann2009The; Curinha2024Centriole).

The mutation in HYLS1 affects the protein's role in ciliogenesis, resulting in impaired cilia formation and function. This disruption is linked to various developmental abnormalities, including central nervous system malformations, defective lung lobation, and micrognathia (Dammermann2009The; Honkala2009Unraveling). In mouse models, the D226G mutation in HYLS1 replicates key features of human HLS, such as perinatal lethality and tissue-specific defects in cilia assembly, particularly in the kidneys and epidermis (Curinha2024Centriole).

Overall, HYLS1 mutations lead to significant changes at the cellular and tissue levels, affecting normal fetal development and resulting in the severe phenotypes observed in Hydrolethalus Syndrome (Honkala2009Unraveling).

## Interactions
The HYLS1 protein is involved in several critical interactions that are essential for its role in centriole and cilia formation. HYLS1 interacts with CEP120, a protein crucial for centriole elongation. This interaction is necessary for the recruitment of HYLS1 to the centriole, which subsequently promotes the recruitment of other proteins such as Talpid3 and C2CD3, involved in centriole structural integrity and distal end assembly. The D211G mutation in HYLS1 disrupts its interaction with CEP120, leading to defects in centriole assembly (Curinha2024Centriole).

HYLS1 also interacts with the core centriolar protein SAS-4, which is essential for centriole assembly. This interaction is crucial for the stable incorporation of HYLS1 into the outer centriole wall during centriole assembly. Despite the disease-associated mutation in HYLS1, its interaction with SAS-4 remains unaffected (Dammermann2009The).

Additionally, HYLS1 interacts with the C-terminal tail of the β-tubulin isotype TUBB, which is important for the assembly of incomplete microtubules. This interaction involves the HYLS1 D211 residue and the TUBB G437 residue, playing a role in stabilizing centrioles (Takeda2024Molecular).
