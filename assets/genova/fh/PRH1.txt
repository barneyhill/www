# PRH1

## Overview
The PRH1 gene encodes the proline-rich protein HaeIII subfamily 1, a member of the acidic proline-rich proteins (aPRPs) family, which are significant components of human saliva. These proteins are characterized by their high proline content and are primarily involved in the formation of the acquired enamel pellicle, a protective layer on the tooth surface that plays a crucial role in oral health by preventing demineralization and inhibiting bacterial adhesion (Manconi2016The; Inzitari2005Different). The PRH1 gene is polymorphic, producing several protein variants, including PIF-s, Pa, and Db-s, which differ in their amino acid sequences and structural features (Manconi2016The). These proteins undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence their function and interactions within the oral cavity (Inzitari2005Different). The PRH1 gene is located on chromosome 12p13.2 and has been associated with variations in dental caries susceptibility, highlighting its clinical significance in oral health (LIPS2017Salivary; Levine2011Susceptibility).

## Structure
The PRH1 gene encodes for several variants of acidic proline-rich proteins (aPRPs) in human saliva, characterized by a high content of proline, glycine, and glutamine, which make up 70-88% of their amino acid composition (Manconi2016The). The primary structure of these proteins includes repetitive proline-rich sequences, contributing to their extended and flexible nature (Kim1993The). The acidic PRPs encoded by PRH1 are approximately 150 residues long, with the acidic portion concentrated in the first 30 residues due to the presence of aspartic and glutamic acids (Manconi2016The).

The PRH1 gene is polymorphic, producing several protein variants such as PIF-s, Pa, and Db-s, which differ in their amino acid sequences and structural features. For instance, Db-s is 171 amino acids long due to a 21 amino acid insertion, while PIF-s and Pa are 150 amino acids long (Manconi2016The). These proteins undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific serine residues, influenced by the kinase Fam20C (Manconi2016The). The PRH1 locus is responsible for coding several acidic PRPs, including Db, Pa, and PIf, which are considered alleles at this locus (Minaguchi1990New).

## Function
The PRH1 gene encodes acidic proline-rich proteins (aPRPs) that are significant components of human saliva, playing a crucial role in oral health. These proteins are involved in the modulation of calcium phosphate chemistry within the oral cavity, which is essential for the formation of the acquired enamel pellicle. This pellicle acts as a protective barrier on the tooth surface, preventing demineralization and inhibiting bacterial adhesion, thereby contributing to dental health (Manconi2016The; Inzitari2005Different).

The aPRPs encoded by PRH1 are characterized by their high proline content and are secreted by both parotid and submandibular/sublingual glands. They are absorbed onto hydroxyapatite, the mineral component of tooth enamel, which aids in the formation of the enamel pellicle (Manconi2016The). These proteins undergo various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific serine residues, which may influence their function and interaction with other molecules in the oral cavity (Inzitari2005Different).

The PRH1 gene is located on chromosome 12p13.2 and is responsible for synthesizing different isoforms of aPRPs, such as PIF-s, Pa, and Db, which exhibit distinct structural features and functional roles in saliva (Manconi2016The; Inzitari2005Different).

## Clinical Significance
The PRH1 gene, encoding acidic proline-rich proteins (PRPs), is associated with dental caries susceptibility due to its role in saliva composition and bacterial interactions on tooth surfaces. Variations in the PRH1 gene, particularly the Db allele, have been linked to differences in dental caries experience among different racial groups. African Americans, who have a higher prevalence of the Db allele, tend to experience fewer caries compared to Caucasians, suggesting a protective role of this allele (LIPS2017Salivary; Levine2011Susceptibility). The Db allele is associated with increased binding of Streptococcus mutans, a bacterium linked to caries, which may influence bacterial colonization and biofilm development on teeth (Zakhary2007Acidic).

The genetic polymorphisms in PRH1, including the Db allele, may affect the interaction of salivary proteins with oral bacteria, potentially altering the risk of caries. These polymorphisms are not only significant in understanding racial differences in caries prevalence but also highlight the complex genetic factors contributing to oral health (OPPENHEIM2007Salivary; Levine2011Susceptibility). The study of PRH1 gene variations provides insights into the genetic basis of dental caries and the potential for personalized dental care strategies.
