# ATP6V0A2

## Overview
The ATP6V0A2 gene encodes the a2 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, a critical component involved in the acidification of intracellular organelles such as vacuoles, lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. This acidification is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. The protein encoded by ATP6V0A2, known as ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a2, is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining the pH balance within these organelles, thereby ensuring proper cellular function and homeostasis. Mutations in ATP6V0A2 are linked to several congenital disorders, including autosomal recessive cutis laxa type II and wrinkly skin syndrome, which are characterized by defects in glycosylation and connective tissue abnormalities (Hucthagowder2009Lossoffunction; Indrawinata2023Structural).

## Structure
The ATP6V0A2 gene encodes the a2 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is crucial for proton translocation and cellular pH regulation. The a2 subunit is composed of a hydrophilic N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain with eight transmembrane α-helices, which are integral to its function in proton translocation (Fischer2012Further; Esmail2018Molecular). The C-terminal domain also includes a cytoplasmic tail, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Esmail2018Molecular).

The a2 subunit is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in maintaining pH for glycosylation processes (Indrawinata2023Structural). Mutations in ATP6V0A2 can lead to diseases such as autosomal recessive cutis laxa type II, affecting protein processing and secretion (Indrawinata2023Structural). Post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, are important for the protein's stability and function (Esmail2018Molecular).

The structure of the a2 subunit remains partially unresolved due to a lack of high-resolution data, but models based on yeast Vph1p suggest specific tilts in the transmembrane helices that facilitate proton translocation (Esmail2018Molecular).

## Function
The ATP6V0A2 gene encodes a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, specifically the a2 subunit, which is crucial for acidifying membrane-enclosed organelles such as vacuoles, lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. This acidification is essential for the proper functioning of these organelles, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (Hucthagowder2009Lossoffunction; Udono2015Impaired).

In healthy human cells, ATP6V0A2 plays a significant role in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, ensuring proper glycosylation and trafficking of proteins. This process is vital for maintaining normal connective tissue structure and function, as well as preventing cellular senescence by preserving Golgi structure and function (Udono2015Impaired). The gene is also involved in vesicular trafficking and the secretion of tropoelastin, which is crucial for elastic fiber assembly in the extracellular space (Hucthagowder2009Lossoffunction).

ATP6V0A2 is particularly important in spermatozoa, where it is associated with sperm motility and is highly expressed in motile spermatozoa, suggesting its role in fertility (Santos‐Pereira2021Emerging). The protein's activity in these cellular processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene are associated with autosomal recessive cutis laxa type II (ARCL II) and wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS), both of which are congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). These conditions are characterized by loose and inelastic skin, developmental delays, skeletal abnormalities, and neurological issues such as epilepsy and cognitive delays (Indrawinata2023Structural; Fischer2012Further). The ATP6V0A2 gene encodes the a2 subunit of the V-ATPase complex, which is crucial for maintaining proper pH in the Golgi apparatus. Mutations in this gene lead to impaired glycosylation, affecting protein processing and secretion (Indrawinata2023Structural).

Clinical manifestations of ATP6V0A2-related disorders include generalized skin wrinkling, delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle, downslanting palpebral fissures, and cobblestone-like brain malformations. Severe neurodegenerative phenotypes with seizures and dementia can also occur (Fischer2012Further). The mutations result in impaired vesicular trafficking, tropoelastin secretion, and increased apoptosis, contributing to the connective tissue phenotypes observed in ARCL II (Hucthagowder2009Lossoffunction). The clinical severity varies, with some patients exhibiting mild symptoms and others more severe manifestations, including skeletal and neurological abnormalities (Beyens2018ATP6V0A2‐related).

## Interactions
ATP6V0A2, a subunit of the V-ATPase complex, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. PHY34, a small molecule inhibitor, specifically binds to the ATP6V0A2 subunit, inhibiting V-ATPase activity and affecting nuclear-cytoplasmic transport by interacting with proteins such as CAS and importins KPNB1 and KPNB2 (Salvi2022PHY34). This interaction suggests a role in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport and autophagy inhibition in ovarian cancer cells (Salvi2022PHY34).

HTP-013, another compound, binds to a novel site on ATP6V0A2, distinct from other known V-ATPase inhibitors. This binding is specific, as demonstrated by resistance-conferring mutations Y830H and V823I, which do not affect the binding of other inhibitors like Bafilomycin A1 (Wang2018Previously). These mutations are located in a region corresponding to a proton translocation pocket, indicating a specific mechanism of action for HTP-013 (Wang2018Previously).

The ATP6V0A2 subunit is also involved in interactions with assembly chaperones and other V-ATPase subunits, such as VMA21 and ATP6V1B1, although specific physical interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed (Esmail2018Molecular). These interactions are crucial for the stability and function of the V-ATPase complex.
