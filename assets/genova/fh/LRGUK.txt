# LRGUK

## Overview
The LRGUK gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeats and guanylate kinase domain containing, which is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and guanylate kinase (GK) domains. This protein is primarily involved in protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in cilia and flagella biogenesis, particularly in sperm development. The LRR domain is crucial for pathogen recognition, akin to toll-like receptors, while the GK domain is implicated in signal transduction pathways, potentially interacting with components of the MAPK cascade. LRGUK is also noted for its involvement in the immune response, as evidenced by its upregulation in the brown mussel Perna perna during bacterial challenges. The gene has been associated with various health conditions, including type 2 diabetes and autism spectrum disorder, although its precise functions in these contexts require further elucidation (Zhang2024Computing; Silva2023The).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The LRGUK gene has been implicated in several health conditions through its genetic variations and expression alterations. Polymorphisms near the LRGUK gene on chromosome 7q32 have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and fasting glucose levels. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs12670589, located in an intron of LRGUK, is linked to an increased risk of diabetes when modeled recessively, with an odds ratio of 2.02 (Laramie2008Polymorphisms). The gene has also been associated with autism spectrum disorder, a condition often accompanied by insomnia, although LRGUK itself has not been directly linked to sleep-related phenotypes (Jansen2019Genomewide).

In the context of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), LRGUK was identified as one of the genes with recessive variants, although its specific function in these conditions remains unclear (Kaufman2014Whole‐Exome). Additionally, LRGUK has been mentioned in studies related to osteoporosis, with its expression noted in tissues such as the testis, bone marrow, and lungs, suggesting a potential role in ATP-binding and kinase activity (Chai2018Identification). Despite these associations, further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of LRGUK gene mutations and expression changes.

## Interactions
The LRGUK protein is involved in several interactions, primarily through its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and guanylate kinase (GK) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. In the context of cilia and flagella biogenesis, LRGUK is part of a predicted protein complex with CFAP69 and SPEF2, likely connected through an interaction with CFAP65 (Zhang2024Computing). This complex is implicated in sperm biogenesis, although specific details of the interactions are not provided.

In the brown mussel Perna perna, LRGUK is upregulated in response to bacterial challenges, suggesting a role in the immune response. Its LRR domain is associated with pathogen recognition, similar to toll-like receptors, while the GK domain is involved in signal transduction, potentially interacting with proteins in the MAPK cascade (Silva2023The). However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed.

LRGUK is also noted for its involvement in protein-protein interactions through its LRR domains in the ciliary central apparatus, particularly in the C1b/C1f region, where it is associated with structural components like Spef2A and Cfap69 (Joachimiak2021Composition).
