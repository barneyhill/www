# SLC17A6

## Overview
The SLC17A6 gene encodes the protein known as vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), which is a critical component of the solute carrier family 17. VGLUT2 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles, facilitating glutamatergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS) (Omote2016Structure; Reimer2013SLC17:). This transporter is essential for maintaining the proper function of excitatory synapses by utilizing a proton electrochemical gradient to drive the uptake of glutamate, a key neurotransmitter involved in various neural processes (Takamori2001Identification). VGLUT2 is predominantly expressed in specific brain regions, including the thalamus and brainstem, and is involved in maintaining synaptic phosphate balance, which is crucial for neuronal homeostasis (Cheret2021Vesicular; Reimer2013SLC17:). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications for neurological health, with alterations linked to conditions such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, underscoring its clinical relevance (Schweizer2016ReducedVglut2Slc17a6Gene; Shen2018Genetic).

## Structure
The SLC17A6 gene encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), a protein involved in the transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles. VGLUT2 is a member of the SLC17 family of transporters, which are characterized by having 12 transmembrane helices, similar to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (Omote2016Structure; Reimer2013SLC17:). The primary structure of VGLUT2 consists of amino acid sequences that form these transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function in neurotransmitter transport (Sreedharan2010Glutamate).

The secondary structure of VGLUT2 includes alpha-helices that span the membrane, contributing to its ability to transport glutamate in response to an electrochemical gradient (Omote2016Structure). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the membrane, although specific details about the quaternary structure are not well-defined in the available literature.

VGLUT2 is known to have a biphasic chloride dependence, which plays a regulatory role in its transport activity (Omote2016Structure). While specific post-translational modifications are not detailed in the context, such modifications may include phosphorylation, which is common in membrane transport proteins. The protein's structure and function are essential for its role in glutamatergic neurotransmission.

## Function
The SLC17A6 gene encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), which is essential for the transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles in neurons. This process is crucial for glutamatergic neurotransmission, a key component of excitatory signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) (Reimer2013SLC17:). VGLUT2 operates by utilizing a proton electrochemical gradient to drive the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles, a mechanism that is vital for the storage and subsequent release of this neurotransmitter during synaptic transmission (Takamori2001Identification; Reimer2004Organic).

VGLUT2 is predominantly expressed in various brain regions, including the thalamus, brainstem, and deep cerebellar nuclei, where it plays a significant role in glutamatergic signaling (Reimer2013SLC17:). It is also involved in maintaining synaptic phosphate (Pi) balance, as it functions as a bifunctional transporter that can transport both glutamate and Pi, contributing to neuronal Pi homeostasis (Cheret2021Vesicular).

The physiological importance of VGLUT2 is underscored by knockout studies in mice, which demonstrate that the absence of VGLUT2 results in neonatal lethality, highlighting its essential role in survival and normal physiological processes (Reimer2013SLC17:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC17A6 gene, which encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), VGLUT2 expression in dopamine (DA) neurons is considered neuroprotective. Studies have shown that genetic deletion of VGLUT2 in DA neurons increases their vulnerability to neurotoxins like MPTP, which is used to model PD in mice. This increased vulnerability is associated with reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB, suggesting that VGLUT2 plays a role in a protective signaling pathway (Shen2018Genetic).

In the subthalamic nucleus (STN), reduced expression of VGLUT2 leads to significant cell loss and structural disorganization, resulting in increased motor activity and decreased sugar consumption in mice. This suggests a link between the STN and the dopamine reinforcement system, affecting motor and reward behaviors. Dysfunctional STN activity due to aberrant VGLUT2 expression may contribute to reward dysfunctions and could be a target for deep brain stimulation in treating addiction, eating disorders, and obesity (Schweizer2016ReducedVglut2Slc17a6Gene).

Rare genetic variants of SLC17A6 have also been associated with schizophrenia and severe alcoholism, highlighting its potential clinical significance in these disorders (Schweizer2016ReducedVglut2Slc17a6Gene).

## Interactions
SLC17A6, also known as Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 (VGLUT2), is involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission and forms part of complex 234, which interacts with components of excitatory synapses. This complex includes proteins such as Vdac1 and Nlgn2, which are associated with synaptic function and neurotransmitter release (Pourhaghighi2020BraInMap). 

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, SLC17A6 is downregulated, which affects neurotransmitter availability and ion balance, potentially leading to synaptic dysfunction. This downregulation is linked to impaired calcium homeostasis, a critical factor in neurodegenerative diseases (Jia2021Proteomic). The protein is also part of a network of synaptic proteins that are significantly downregulated in the entorhinal cortex of Alzheimer's patients, highlighting its role in ion transport and synaptic function (Jia2021Proteomic).

In Parkinson's disease, SLC17A6 is implicated in sex-specific epigenetic changes. Hypomethylation within the SLC17A6 gene body in females suggests altered regulation of VGLUT2 expression, which may influence neuronal susceptibility and synaptic transmission (Kochmanski2022Parkinson’s). These interactions and regulatory changes underscore the importance of SLC17A6 in maintaining synaptic integrity and function.
