# ERCC4

## Overview
The ERCC4 gene encodes the ERCC excision repair 4, endonuclease catalytic subunit, commonly referred to as XPF, which is a pivotal component of the DNA repair machinery in human cells. This gene is integral to the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, where it plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA lesions by forming a heterodimer with the ERCC1 protein. The ERCC1-XPF complex functions as a structure-specific endonuclease, making precise incisions at the 5' side of DNA damage sites, which is essential for the excision of damaged nucleotides and the maintenance of genomic stability (Marín2019Functional; Faridounnia2018Function). Beyond NER, the complex is also involved in interstrand crosslink repair (ICLR) and the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs), highlighting its versatility in DNA repair pathways (Adamska2014Tagging). Mutations in the ERCC4 gene are linked to several genetic disorders, including xeroderma pigmentosum and Fanconi anemia, underscoring its clinical significance in human health (Bermisheva2020Analysis; Shanbhag2018Neurodegeneration).

## Structure
The ERCC4 protein, also known as XPF, is a crucial component of the nucleotide excision repair pathway. It is a 916-amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 104 kDa (Brookman1996ERCC4). The protein structure includes several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region contains a helicase-like domain, while the central region features a metal-dependent endonuclease domain known as the ERCC4 domain. This domain is structurally similar to the nuclease domain of type II restriction endonucleases, characterized by a small endonuclease subunit with a conserved structural fold composed of β-sheets flanked by α-helices (Faridounnia2018Function).

The C-terminal region of ERCC4 contains a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH)2 DNA-binding domain, which is essential for DNA binding and dimerization with ERCC1 (Faridounnia2018Function). The ERCC4 domain's active site includes conserved acidic residues that bind Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions, facilitating the endonuclease reaction (Faridounnia2018Function). The ERCC4 protein forms a heterodimer with ERCC1, which is necessary for its function in DNA repair processes (Brookman1996ERCC4). The ERCC1-XPF complex is involved in DNA damage recognition and repair, specifically promoting DNA cleavage at single-stranded/double-stranded junctions (Kohlhase2014Mutation).

## Function
The ERCC4 gene encodes the XPF protein, which is a crucial component of the DNA repair machinery in human cells. XPF forms a stable heterodimer with ERCC1, creating a structure-specific endonuclease that incises the 5' side of various DNA lesions. This heterodimer is essential for several DNA repair pathways, including nucleotide excision repair (NER) and interstrand crosslink repair (ICLR) (Marín2019Functional). In the NER pathway, the ERCC1-XPF complex is responsible for making incisions on the 5' side of DNA lesions, complementing the action of XPG, which incises at the 3' side. This activity is vital for excising a 25-30 nucleotide single-stranded fragment containing the damage, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Faridounnia2018Function).

The ERCC1-XPF complex is also involved in repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) through pathways like homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, as well as in the recombination of DNA interstrand crosslinking repair (ICL) (Adamska2014Tagging). The complex's unique catalytic incision properties allow it to function in multiple repair pathways, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic integrity (Faridounnia2018Function). Deficiencies in ERCC1-XPF can lead to severe physiological consequences, including cancer predisposition syndromes, neurological diseases, and premature aging (Faridounnia2018Function).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ERCC4 gene, also known as XPF, are associated with several autosomal recessive disorders, including xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F (XP-F), Fanconi anemia complementation group Q (FANCQ), and XFE progeroid syndrome. These conditions are characterized by defects in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, leading to increased sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light, heightened cancer risk, and symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases (Nabouli2021Case; Kulikowska2023Case; Shanbhag2018Neurodegeneration).

XP-F is marked by extreme photosensitivity, freckling, and a predisposition to skin cancers. Patients may also experience progressive neurodegeneration, including symptoms such as chorea, ataxia, and cognitive deficits (Shanbhag2018Neurodegeneration). Fanconi anemia type Q, resulting from biallelic mutations in ERCC4, involves bone marrow failure and increased cancer susceptibility (Bermisheva2020Analysis).

Alterations in ERCC4 expression or function can also impact cancer risk. Heterozygous mutations in ERCC4 have been identified in various cancers, including breast and lung cancer, although their role in cancer susceptibility remains unclear (Bermisheva2020Analysis). The ERCC4 gene's involvement in DNA repair processes underscores its critical role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing disease.

## Interactions
The ERCC4 protein, also known as XPF, forms a crucial heterodimeric complex with ERCC1, which is essential for its role in DNA repair processes. This ERCC1-XPF complex interacts directly with the XPA protein, a key component in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. The interaction is primarily mediated by ERCC1, which binds to XPA, facilitating the recruitment of the ERCC1-XPF complex to sites of DNA damage (Park1994Formation; Faridounnia2018Function).

The ERCC1-XPF complex also interacts with replication protein A (RPA), which enhances its binding to DNA, particularly at single-stranded/double-stranded junctions. This interaction is crucial for the incision step in NER, where ERCC1-XPF makes cuts at the 5' side of DNA lesions (Faridounnia2018Function).

In addition to its role in NER, ERCC4/XPF is involved in homologous recombination and interacts with hRad52. This interaction stimulates the DNA structure-specific endonuclease activity of the ERCC1-XPF complex, highlighting its role in processing recombination intermediates during DNA repair (Motycka2004Physical). The complex's interaction with hRad52 is mediated by the N-terminal domain of hRad52 and the XPF protein, forming a stable ternary complex (Motycka2004Physical).
