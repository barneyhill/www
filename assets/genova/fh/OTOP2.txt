# OTOP2

## Overview
OTOP2 is a gene that encodes the protein otopetrin 2, which functions as a proton channel. This protein is a member of the OTOP family and is characterized by its double-barrel architecture, consisting of 12 transmembrane helices that form a dimeric structure. Otopetrin 2 is primarily involved in ion transport and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular pH balance, particularly within the vestibular, gustatory, and digestive systems (Gan2024Structural; Lu2024Determination). The protein's activity is crucial for sensory functions such as taste perception and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and immune response modulation (Lu2024Determination). Additionally, OTOP2 has been associated with several clinical conditions, including colorectal cancer and vestibular dysfunction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker (Sumalde2023Rare; Lu2024Determination).

## Structure
The OTOP2 protein, encoded by the OTOP2 gene, is a proton channel that forms a dimer, with each subunit containing 12 transmembrane helices. These helices assemble into two parallel and structurally homologous helical barrels, which are crucial for its function as a proton channel (Gan2024Structural). The protein exhibits a double-barrel architecture, a characteristic feature of the OTOP family, and undergoes conformational changes related to proton conduction (Gan2024Structural).

The primary structure of OTOP2 includes conserved domains known as Otopetrin Domains (OD-I, OD-II, and OD-III), which are integral to its function and evolutionary conservation (Hughes2008Identification). The secondary structure involves the formation of alpha helices, particularly in the transmembrane regions, which are essential for the protein's insertion and orientation in the membrane (Hughes2008Identification).

In terms of tertiary structure, the protein's 3D folding is influenced by the presence of conserved glutamate and histidine residues at the inter-barrel interface, which are critical for proton transfer (Gan2024Structural). The quaternary structure involves the dimerization of the protein, which is necessary for its proton channel activity (Gan2024Structural). The structural dynamics of OTOP2 are further characterized by a helix-to-loop transition in TM6, which is vital for proton conduction (Gan2024Structural).

## Function
OTOP2 (otopetrin 2) is a gene that encodes a conserved ion channel protein involved in the regulation of proton channels, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular pH balance. This protein is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it influences ion transport and cellular signaling pathways. OTOP2 is predominantly expressed in the vestibular, gustatory, and digestive systems, indicating its involvement in sensory functions such as taste perception (Lu2024Determination).

In healthy human cells, OTOP2 is implicated in detecting pH changes within cells, which is essential for various cellular processes. The protein's activity in ion channels contributes to the regulation of cell signaling, growth, and development. OTOP2's role in these processes is critical for maintaining homeostasis and proper cellular function (Lu2024Determination).

The gene is also associated with pathways related to the immune system, including the adaptive immune response and immune receptor activity. This suggests that OTOP2 may have a broader role in modulating immune responses, although its primary function remains centered on ion channel regulation and pH balance (Lu2024Determination).

## Clinical Significance
The OTOP2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), OTOP2 is significantly downregulated, which is associated with poorer overall survival. This suggests that OTOP2 may function as a tumor suppressor, and its reduced expression could promote COAD development. High OTOP2 expression correlates with better patient outcomes and may serve as a prognostic marker and predictor of response to immunotherapy in COAD patients (Lu2024Determination).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), OTOP2 expression is also downregulated, and its overexpression has been shown to suppress tumor proliferation. The transcription of OTOP2 is regulated by wild-type p53, and alterations in this regulation may contribute to CRC tumorigenesis (Qu2018Wild‐type).

OTOP2 has also been linked to vestibular dysfunction. Rare coding variants in OTOP2 have been identified in patients with non-syndromic vestibular dysfunction and Meniere's disease, suggesting a potential role in these conditions. These variants may contribute to the genetic basis of vestibular disorders, affecting balance and hearing (Sumalde2023Rare).
