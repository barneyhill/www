# RSAD1

## Overview
RSAD1 is a gene that encodes the protein radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 1, which is involved in various biological processes. This protein is characterized by its radical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) domain, which is a key feature in a class of enzymes known for catalyzing radical-based reactions. The RSAD1 protein is implicated in several cellular functions, including potential roles in gene regulation and interaction with other proteins. Research has highlighted its involvement in disease mechanisms, particularly in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy and stroke protection in pediatric sickle cell anemia patients, suggesting its significance in medical genetics (Flanagan2013Genetic; Schellevis2019Exome).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RSAD1 gene have been implicated in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (cCSC), particularly in female patients. A study identified a significant burden of exonic variants in RSAD1, with three specific variants (p.P250L, p.V299I, p.R317Q) observed exclusively in female cCSC patients. These variants increase the risk of developing cCSC by 7.8-fold in females, suggesting a sex-specific genetic association. The study highlights the potential role of RSAD1 in the disease's etiology, possibly involving sex-biased gene expression or regulation, and interactions with sex hormone regulation (Schellevis2019Exome).

In addition to its association with cCSC, RSAD1 has been linked to stroke protection in pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia. A variant in RSAD1 was found near a SNP identified by genome-wide association studies, indicating a strong association with stroke protection, although the clinical significance of this finding requires further investigation (Flanagan2013Genetic).

These findings suggest that RSAD1 may play a role in specific diseases through genetic mutations and altered expression, with potential implications for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. However, further studies are needed to confirm these associations and elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.
