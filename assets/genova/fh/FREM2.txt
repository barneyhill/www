# FREM2

## Overview
FREM2, or FRAS1 related extracellular matrix 2, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix, particularly in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. The FREM2 protein is a component of the FREM2-FRAS1-FREM1 complex, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the basement membrane during development. This protein is characterized by chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan element repeats and Calx-beta domains, which facilitate sodium-calcium exchanger activity, crucial for calcium export from cells (Du2022Identification; Zolotovskaia2021Algorithmically). FREM2 is expressed in various tissues and plays a significant role in organogenesis, contributing to the development of organs such as the eye, limbs, and kidney (Mansfield2011Differential). Its interactions with other proteins, such as IL-1R1, highlight its involvement in both structural and signaling functions within cells, impacting processes like cancer progression and tissue integrity (Wang2019FRAS1related; Zolotovskaia2021Algorithmically).

## Function
The FREM2 gene encodes an integral membrane protein that plays a significant role in the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix, particularly in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. This protein is part of the FREM2-FRAS1-FREM1 complex, which is crucial for epidermal-dermal interactions and is active in the basement membrane (Wang2022Comprehensive; Du2022Identification). FREM2 contains chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan element repeats and Calx-beta domains, which confer sodium-calcium exchanger activity, allowing the protein to export calcium from the cell (Du2022Identification; Zolotovskaia2021Algorithmically).

FREM2 is involved in providing a substrate for cell migration and morphogenetic rearrangements during embryogenesis, and its expression is critical during organogenesis (Mansfield2011Differential). It is expressed in epithelial cells and cells from all germ layers, contributing to the development of organs such as the eye, limbs, and kidney (Mansfield2011Differential). In the adrenal gland, FREM2 expression is regulated by adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), suggesting a role in adrenal morphogenesis and function (Mansfield2011Differential). Overall, FREM2's role in calcium export and tissue interactions is significant for normal physiological processes in healthy human cells (Du2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FREM2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. FREM2 is implicated in Fraser syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, and renal anomalies. This syndrome is caused by biallelic variants in FREM2, which disrupt normal extracellular matrix interactions, leading to developmental abnormalities (Kantaputra2023Heterozygous).

FREM2 mutations are also linked to congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a serious birth defect. Studies have identified individuals with potentially harmful variants in FREM2, suggesting it may act as a susceptibility allele for CDH. In mouse models, FREM2 deficiency has been shown to cause anterior sac CDH, indicating its role in diaphragm development (Jordan2018The).

In the context of dental anomalies, heterozygous variants in FREM2 are associated with conditions such as mesiodens, supernumerary teeth, oral exostoses, and odontomas. These variants can disrupt basement membrane assembly and alter signaling pathways, contributing to these dental conditions (Kantaputra2023Heterozygous).

Additionally, FREM2 mutations have been identified as potential prognostic biomarkers in colorectal cancer. Alterations in FREM2 expression are associated with immune response functions and tumor microenvironment characteristics, influencing patient prognosis (Du2022Identification).

## Interactions
FREM2 (FRAS1 related extracellular matrix 2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. FREM2 forms a ternary complex with FRAS1 and FREM1 at the basement membrane, which is important for maintaining epithelial-mesenchymal integrity during development (Wang2022Comprehensive; Beck2013Novel). This complex is similar in function to collagen VII and is essential for the structural integrity of tissues.

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), FREM2 interacts with the IL-1R1 receptor, enhancing IL-1β signal transduction. This interaction is facilitated by FREM2 binding to and stabilizing IL-1R1, which promotes the activation of downstream NF-κB and MAPK pathways, contributing to cancer progression (Wang2019FRAS1related). Co-immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated that FREM2 forms a complex with IL-1R1, and immunofluorescence analysis shows their colocalization in ESCC cells (Wang2019FRAS1related).

In the context of gliomas, FREM2 is part of the extracellular matrix node in several signaling pathways, including Akt, ERK, ILK, MAPK, and PTEN, indicating its involvement in various cellular signaling processes (Zolotovskaia2021Algorithmically). These interactions highlight FREM2's role in both structural and signaling functions within cells.
