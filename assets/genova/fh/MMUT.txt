# MMUT

## Overview
The MMUT gene encodes the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a pivotal role in human metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a mutase and is essential for the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, a critical step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The MMUT protein functions as a homodimer and requires adenosylcobalamin, a derivative of vitamin B12, as a cofactor for its activity. Structurally, the enzyme features a TIM barrel domain and an AdoCbl-binding domain, which facilitate its catalytic function. The MMUT gene is clinically significant due to its association with methylmalonic acidemia, a metabolic disorder resulting from enzyme deficiency or dysfunction. This condition underscores the importance of MMUT in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and energy production in human cells (Froese2010Structures; Froese2019Vitamin; Costanzo2020Proteomics).

## Structure
The human methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT) protein is a mitochondrial enzyme that functions as a homodimer, with each subunit containing a cobalamin (vitamin B12) cofactor. The enzyme's structure includes a large substrate-binding TIM barrel domain and a smaller AdoCbl-binding domain, with the active site located at the interface of these domains (Froese2010Structures). The TIM barrel domain is a common fold among enzymes that produce radical intermediates, and it forms a narrow tunnel that protects the active site from side reactions (Mancia1996How).

The MMUT protein undergoes significant conformational changes upon cofactor binding, particularly in the C-domain helices, which create a pocket for AdoCbl binding. This induced-fit mechanism enables the 'base-off/His-on' cofactor configuration, crucial for catalysis (Froese2010Structures). The cobalt atom in the coenzyme B12 is coordinated by a histidine side chain from the protein, which stabilizes the reduced Co II state and facilitates the formation of the adenosyl radical (Mancia1996How).

The MMUT protein also interacts with the GTPase MMAA, forming a complex that is crucial for the assembly of the active holoenzyme. This interaction is nucleotide-dependent and significantly enhances the GTPase activity of MMAA (Froese2010Structures). The MMUT-MMAA complex exists in various oligomeric forms, predominantly as a 1:1 stoichiometry, which is affected by mutations in the MMAA protein (Mascarenhas2023Architecture).

## Function
The MMUT gene encodes the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which plays a critical role in the catabolism of certain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, a key step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle. This conversion is essential for the anaplerotic replenishment of the TCA cycle, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial energy production and metabolic homeostasis in healthy human cells (Froese2019Vitamin; Costanzo2020Proteomics).

Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase requires adenosylcobalamin, a derivative of vitamin B12, as a cofactor to function properly. The enzyme is active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids such as valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine, as well as odd-chain fatty acids and the side chain of cholesterol (TakahashiIñiguez2012Role; Froese2019Vitamin). The product of this reaction, succinyl-CoA, enters the TCA cycle, supporting energy production and cellular metabolism (Froese2019Vitamin). Deficiency in MMUT or its cofactor can lead to metabolic disorders such as methylmalonic acidemia, characterized by the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and other toxic metabolites (Costanzo2020Proteomics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MMUT gene are associated with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), a metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of methylmalonic acid. This condition can lead to a range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delay, metabolic acidosis, and neurological issues. MMA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which is encoded by the MMUT gene (Liang2021A; Forny2016Molecular).

The clinical presentation of MMA can vary significantly depending on the specific mutations in the MMUT gene. For instance, the c.1663G>A (p.A555T) mutation is associated with milder clinical and biochemical phenotypes, better vitamin B12 responsiveness, and a better prognosis. This mutation is more common in East Asian populations and is considered a hotspot in the Chinese population (Liang2021A). In contrast, other mutations, such as c.729-730insTT (p.D244Lfs*39), are associated with more severe phenotypes and are prevalent in the Chinese population (Dai2022Impaired; Han2015Clinical).

Early diagnosis and treatment, facilitated by newborn screening and genetic testing, are crucial for managing MMA effectively. These measures can help mitigate severe complications, even in cases with milder phenotypes (Liang2021A).

## Interactions
Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT) interacts with several proteins involved in vitamin B12 metabolism, including MMAA and MMAB. These interactions are crucial for the enzyme's function and stability. MMUT forms a complex with MMAA, a G-protein that stabilizes the enzyme and facilitates the proper loading and unloading of its cofactor, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). The interaction between MMUT and MMAA involves significant structural changes, including a 180° rotation of the B12 domain in MMUT, which is stabilized by MMAA wedging between the substrate and B12 domains of MMUT (Mascarenhas2023Architecture). This complex is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity and protection of radical intermediates (Mascarenhas2023Architecture).

The MMUT-MMAA interaction is nucleotide-dependent, with MMAA exhibiting enhanced GTPase activity in the presence of MMUT, particularly in its apo form (Froese2010Structures). This interaction is selective for the apoenzyme form of MMUT, suggesting a role in the physiological acquisition of AdoCbl by MMUT (Mascarenhas2023Architecture). The M2C2 complex, which includes MMUT and MMAA, undergoes conformational changes that facilitate the access of MMAB to the B12-binding site, highlighting the dynamic nature of these protein interactions (Mascarenhas2023Architecture).
