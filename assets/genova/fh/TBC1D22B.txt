# TBC1D22B

## Overview
TBC1D22B is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 22B, which is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle transport and lipid metabolism. The protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and interacts with Rab40 proteins, playing a crucial role in regulating lipid homeostasis (Duan2021Regulation). Additionally, TBC1 domain family member 22B interacts with the Golgi adaptor protein ACBD3, influencing Golgi membrane maintenance and potentially regulating PI4KB recruitment at the Golgi interface (Greninger2013ACBD3). Clinically, TBC1D22B is implicated in cancer, with its expression levels affecting prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer and melanoma (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16; Lupi2024TBC1). These interactions and clinical associations highlight the gene's significance in cellular function and disease.

## Clinical Significance
TBC1D22B has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders. In triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), TBC1D22B is overexpressed and associated with a worse prognosis. Its elevated expression levels in TNBCs correlate with increased glycolytic metabolism, suggesting a role in promoting a glycolytic phenotype in these cancer cells. This overexpression is linked to poor clinical outcomes, making TBC1D22B a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in TNBC (Lupi2024TBC1).

In melanoma, TBC1D22B shows decreased mRNA expression levels compared to normal tissues, indicating a potential role in tumor progression and clinical traits such as metastasis and cancer status (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16). 

Additionally, TBC1D22B is involved in lipid metabolism through its interaction with Rab40, a small GTPase. Alterations in this interaction can affect lipid homeostasis, as seen in studies using Drosophila models. These findings suggest that TBC1D22B may play a role in lipid-related metabolic disorders, although specific human diseases directly linked to TBC1D22B mutations or expression changes are not detailed (Duan2021Regulation).

## Interactions
TBC1D22B is known to interact with the ACBD3 protein, a Golgi adaptor protein involved in organizing cellular functions and viral replication. This interaction is significant for Golgi membrane maintenance and is mediated through a coiled-coil region of ACBD3 that overlaps with the PI4KB-interacting region. TBC1D22B competes with PI4KB for binding to ACBD3, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for PI4KB recruitment at the Golgi interface (Greninger2013ACBD3). 

The interaction between TBC1D22B and ACBD3 is mapped to a predicted alpha-helix in the N-terminal region of TBC1D22B, with a critical valine-leucine pair necessary for binding. Despite the competitive nature of the interaction with PI4KB, phosphorylation sites on TBC1D22B do not affect its binding to ACBD3 (Greninger2013ACBD3). 

TBC1D22B also interacts with Rab40 proteins, particularly Rab40A and Rab40B, acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab40. This interaction is crucial for lipid metabolism regulation, as demonstrated by co-localization studies and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Duan2021Regulation). These interactions highlight TBC1D22B's role in cellular processes such as vesicle transport and lipid homeostasis.
