# ODAM

## Overview
The ODAM gene encodes the odontogenic, ameloblast-associated protein, which is a member of the secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) family. This protein is intrinsically disordered, allowing it to form multidomain complexes essential for its function in biomineralization and epithelial attachment (Fouillen2017Interactions). ODAM is primarily expressed during tooth development by maturation-stage ameloblasts and plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of the junctional epithelium (JE), which anchors the gingiva to the tooth surface (Zhu2022The). It is involved in several signaling pathways, including WNT and BMP-2-BMPR-IB-ODAM, and interacts with proteins such as amelotin and SCPPPQ1 to form supramolecular aggregates (Fouillen2017Interactions; Lee2015Odontogenic). Beyond its role in dental health, ODAM is also expressed in other epithelial tissues, suggesting a broader protective function in epithelial cell repair (Zhu2022The). Alterations in ODAM expression have been linked to diseases such as colorectal cancer and periodontal disease, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wazen2015Inactivation; Yu2016Odontogenic).

## Structure
The ODAM protein is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, which provides structural flexibility and allows it to form multidomain complexes. This flexibility is a common trait among members of the secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) family (Fouillen2017Interactions). Circular dichroism spectroscopy reveals that recombinant human ODAM (hODAM) is largely disordered, with 47% of its structure being disordered, 35% β-sheets, and 13% turns. When hODAM is combined with amelotin (hAMTN), the degree of disorder decreases, and the amount of α-helices increases significantly to 54%, indicating conformational changes and interactions between these proteins (Fouillen2017Interactions).

ODAM forms high molecular weight aggregates, approximately 400 kDa, equivalent to 12-13 subunits, as shown by gel filtration chromatography. Structural characterization using negative staining TEM and AFM reveals that ODAM forms globular structures with diameters ranging from 24.3 to 36.9 nm, with a mean of 30.26 nm (Fouillen2017Interactions). The protein is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, including O-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation, although no N-glycosylation sites are present in its sequence (Dos2012Odontogenic). These structural features and modifications are crucial for ODAM's role in biomineralization and its interactions with other enamel matrix proteins.

## Function
The ODAM gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the junctional epithelium (JE), which is essential for attaching the gingiva to the tooth surface. ODAM is expressed during odontogenesis by maturation-stage ameloblasts and is incorporated into the enamel matrix. It mediates the adhesion of the JE to the tooth surface and is involved in extracellular signaling pathways such as WNT and ARHGEF5-RhoA, as well as intracellular signaling of BMP-2-BMPR-IB-ODAM (Zhu2022The). 

ODAM is involved in the regulation of JE attachment through the integrin-ODAM-ARHGEF5-RhoA signaling pathway. This pathway involves the activation of RhoA signaling, which leads to actin filament rearrangement, a process important for maintaining the structural integrity of the JE (Lee2015Odontogenic). ODAM interacts with Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 5 (ARHGEF5) to induce RhoA activity and the expression of downstream factors, including Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) (Lee2015Odontogenic). 

ODAM is also expressed in the salivary glands, trachea, and prostate glands, suggesting a protective role in epithelial cell repair. It interacts with bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-IB (BMPR-IB) in ameloblasts, influencing ameloblast differentiation and enamel mineralization (Zhu2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ODAM gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and periodontal health. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ODAM expression is significantly downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. This downregulation is associated with larger tumor size, higher serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis, and advanced clinical stage. Low ODAM expression correlates with decreased overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in CRC. ODAM may function as a tumor suppressor by promoting PTEN elevation and inactivating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Yu2016Odontogenic).

In periodontal health, ODAM is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the junctional epithelium (JE). Inactivation of the ODAM gene in mice leads to periodontal defects, such as weakened adhesion between the JE and tooth surfaces, increased inflammatory infiltrate, and delayed healing post-gingivectomy. These findings suggest that ODAM plays a significant role in periodontal integrity and healing processes, and its absence or reduction is associated with periodontal disease (Wazen2015Inactivation).

## Interactions
The odontogenic ameloblast-associated protein (ODAM) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in tooth development and epithelial attachment. ODAM interacts with amelotin (AMTN) and secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein proline-glutamine rich 1 (SCPPPQ1) within a specialized basal lamina (sBL) that attaches epithelial cells to tooth mineral. These interactions form supramolecular aggregates, with ODAM showing a strong affinity for both AMTN and SCPPPQ1, as confirmed by bacterial two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fouillen2017Interactions).

ODAM also plays a role in cell signaling pathways. It mediates the attachment of the junctional epithelium to teeth through a signaling pathway involving integrin, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 5 (ARHGEF5), and RhoA. This interaction is crucial for cytoskeleton reorganization and cell adhesion, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation assays and colocalization studies (Lee2015Odontogenic). ODAM's interaction with ARHGEF5 and its effect on actin filament rearrangement highlight its role in maintaining periodontal health (Lee2015Odontogenic).
