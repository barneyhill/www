# PTGER2

## Overview
PTGER2 is a gene that encodes the prostaglandin E receptor 2, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, primarily through its interaction with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). As a transmembrane receptor, prostaglandin E receptor 2 is involved in mediating inflammatory responses, immune regulation, and cellular signaling pathways, notably through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathways. The receptor's activity is crucial in diverse biological contexts, including reproductive biology, where it facilitates decidualization, and bone biology, where it influences osteoblast differentiation and bone resorption. Additionally, PTGER2 has implications in neuroprotection and neurotransmission within the central nervous system. Alterations in PTGER2 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its significance in clinical prognostics (Stadtmauer2021Singlecell; Woodward2011International; Genetos2011Prostaglandin).

## Structure


## Function
PTGER2, also known as the prostaglandin E receptor 2, is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes by mediating the effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In healthy human cells, PTGER2 is involved in the regulation of inflammation, immune responses, and cellular signaling pathways. It is primarily active in cell membranes, where it influences intracellular signaling cascades through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathways (Woodward2011International).

In the context of reproductive biology, PTGER2 is crucial for the process of decidualization in human endometrial stromal fibroblasts. This receptor is upregulated by progestin and facilitates the transition of these fibroblasts into decidual stromal cells, a process essential for successful pregnancy. PTGER2 signaling favors a PKA-dominated intracellular state, which is necessary for the decidualization process (Stadtmauer2021Singlecell).

PTGER2 also plays a role in bone biology by regulating osteoblast differentiation and bone resorption. It is involved in the suppression of Sclerostin (Sost) expression, thereby enhancing Wnt signaling, which is important for bone formation and maintenance (Genetos2011Prostaglandin). Additionally, PTGER2 contributes to neuroprotection and modulation of neurotransmission in the central nervous system (Woodward2011International).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PTGER2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In neuroblastomas (NB), PTGER2 is often epigenetically silenced through DNA methylation and histone modification, particularly in aggressive tumors. This silencing is associated with tumor progression and MYCN amplification. Restoring PTGER2 expression in NB cells has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for PTGER2 (Sugino2007Epigenetic).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PTGER2 expression is frequently lost due to aberrant methylation, which is observed in a significant proportion of NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors. This methylation is associated with a better prognosis and is more common in tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. The loss of PTGER2 expression due to methylation may serve as a prognostic marker in NSCLC (Tian2008Clinical).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), PTGER2 is also subject to epigenetic inactivation through DNA methylation. This methylation is linked to alcohol exposure and recurrence events, indicating its potential role in the prognosis and recurrence of HNSCC (Misawa2020Prostanoid).

## Interactions
PTGER2, also known as prostaglandin E receptor 2, is involved in various interactions that influence its function in cellular signaling pathways. One significant interaction is with the homeobox protein HB9, which binds to the PTGER2 promoter in leukemic cells. This binding acts as a transcriptional repressor, inhibiting the expression of PTGER2 and subsequently reducing intracellular cAMP mobilization. The interaction is dependent on the integrity of the HB9 binding site within the PTGER2 promoter, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays (Wildenhain2012Homeobox).

In neuroblastoma cells, PTGER2 expression is often silenced through epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modification. This silencing disrupts PTGER2-mediated signaling pathways, which are crucial for regulating cell growth and apoptosis. Restoration of PTGER2 expression in these cells has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for PTGER2 (Sugino2007Epigenetic).

PTGER2 also interacts with signaling molecules like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and specific agonists such as butaprost, which can modulate its activity and influence downstream signaling pathways, including those involving cAMP and protein kinase A (Wildenhain2012Homeobox; Sugino2007Epigenetic).
