# DOK3

## Overview
DOK3, or docking protein 3, is a gene that encodes an adaptor protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways, particularly within the immune system. The DOK3 protein is characterized by its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a proline-rich region, which collectively facilitate its role as a scaffold protein. This structure allows DOK3 to mediate interactions with other proteins, thereby influencing signal transduction processes. Although DOK3 lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity, it plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by interacting with signaling molecules downstream of receptors such as B cell receptors (BCR), Toll-like receptors (TLR), and C-type lectin receptors (CLR). Through these interactions, DOK3 regulates pathways that control immune cell activation, inflammation, and bone homeostasis, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune and physiological balance (Loh2023DOK3; Loh2020Emerging).

## Structure
DOK3, or docking protein 3, is a small protein composed of approximately 496 amino acids. It features a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the amino terminus, which is essential for its localization to the plasma membrane through interactions with membrane phospholipids (Loh2020Emerging). This domain is followed by a central phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain that enables binding to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs in partner proteins, allowing DOK3 to function as a scaffold protein for forming multimeric protein complexes (Loh2020Emerging). The carboxyl terminus of DOK3 contains a proline-rich region with multiple tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for SH2-containing proteins upon phosphorylation (Loh2020Emerging).

DOK3 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its function. For instance, phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues is crucial for its interaction with other proteins like Grb2, affecting signaling pathways such as calcium mobilization in B cells (Stork2007Subcellular). The protein forms homo-oligomers upon BCR activation, a process requiring the PH domain and phosphorylation at Y140, independent of Grb2 recruitment (Stork2007Subcellular). Despite these insights, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of DOK3 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
DOK3, or docking protein 3, functions as an adaptor protein involved in various signaling pathways, primarily in immune cells. It acts as a molecular scaffold, facilitating protein-protein interactions and the formation of protein complexes, which are crucial for signal transduction events. DOK3 lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity but plays a significant role in regulating signaling downstream of immune receptors, such as B cell receptors (BCR), Toll-like receptors (TLR), and C-type lectin receptors (CLR) (Loh2020Emerging).

In B cells, DOK3 negatively regulates BCR signaling by recruiting inhibitory molecules like SHIP-1 and Csk, which attenuate calcium flux and inhibit NFAT activation. This regulation limits B cell proliferation and IgM antibody production in response to T-cell-independent antigens (Loh2020Emerging). In macrophages, DOK3 modulates TLR signaling, preventing excessive inflammation by inhibiting pathways such as Ras-Erk and NF-κB (Loh2020Emerging).

DOK3 is also involved in maintaining bone homeostasis by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and promoting osteoblast differentiation, thus playing a dual role in bone remodeling (Loh2020Emerging). In T cells, DOK3 suppresses CARD11 signaling, which is crucial for controlling downstream pathways like NF-κB and JNK, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis (Loh2023DOK3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DOK3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, has been associated with DOK3. DOK3 plays a protective role by suppressing JAK2/STAT3 signaling in colonic neutrophils, which limits the production of inflammatory proteins S100a8/9. Deficiency in DOK3 leads to increased susceptibility to colitis, characterized by enhanced colonic inflammation and microbial dysbiosis (Loh2021DOK3).

In the context of atopic dermatitis (AD), DOK3 expression is significantly higher in patients compared to healthy individuals. DOK3 negatively regulates IFN-γ production by T cells, and its loss provides protection against AD-like skin inflammation in mice. This protective effect is mediated through increased IFN-γ production, which is crucial for counteracting AD pathology. Mutations in the CARD11 gene, which interacts with DOK3, can lead to impaired signaling pathways, increasing susceptibility to AD (Loh2023DOK3).

DOK3 also plays a role in preventing lung adenocarcinoma. Mice deficient in DOK3, along with other Dok family members, develop this cancer, indicating its function as a tumor suppressor (Loh2020Emerging).

## Interactions
DOK3, also known as docking protein 3, is an adaptor protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cell signaling pathways. In B cells, DOK3 interacts with SHIP1 and Grb2, forming a complex that negatively regulates calcium signaling downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR) (Stork2007Subcellular). This interaction is crucial for inhibiting BCR-induced Ca2+ mobilization, with the phosphorylation of DOK3 at Y331 creating a binding site for the Grb2 SH2 domain (Stork2007Subcellular).

In macrophages, DOK3 associates with the adaptor protein DAP12 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. This interaction is mediated by the PTB domain of DOK3 binding to the ITAM motif of DAP12, which is essential for inhibiting the Ras-ERK pathway and limiting proinflammatory cytokine production (Peng2013A). DOK3 also interacts with Grb2 and Sos1 in a DAP12-dependent manner, further inhibiting ERK activation (Peng2013A).

In neutrophils, DOK3 recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to dephosphorylate Card9, thereby suppressing Card9 activation and limiting downstream signaling to NF-κB and JNK (Loh2019Dok3–protein). These interactions highlight DOK3's role as a regulatory protein in various signaling pathways.
