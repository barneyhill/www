# NPRL2

## Overview
NPRL2 is a gene that encodes a protein known as NPR2-like, GATOR1 complex subunit, which is a critical component of the GATOR1 complex involved in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rag GTPases, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell growth, protein synthesis, and autophagy by modulating mTORC1 activity in response to amino acid availability (Kwak2016Amino). Structurally, NPRL2 contains an N-terminal Longin domain, a TINI domain, and winged helix-turn-helix domains, which facilitate its interactions within the GATOR1 complex and with other cellular components (Shen2018Architecture). NPRL2 is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and epilepsy, where its dysfunction can lead to tumorigenesis and neurological disorders (Sun2021Phenotypic; Li2004Functional).

## Structure
The NPRL2 protein is a component of the GATOR1 complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Structurally, NPRL2 contains an N-terminal Longin domain (NLD), which is involved in heterodimerization with NPRL3 (Shen2018Architecture). This domain is essential for the protein's function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rag GTPases, with Arg-78 identified as a critical catalytic residue within this domain (Shen2019Arg78). Following the NLD, NPRL2 has a TINI domain that interacts with the SABA domain of DEPDC5, another subunit of the GATOR1 complex (Shen2018Architecture).

The C-terminal region of NPRL2 includes two or more winged helix-turn-helix (HTH) domains, which facilitate interactions with DNA (Ma2017Tumor). NPRL2 is also characterized by a bipartite nuclear localization signal and a protein-binding domain known as granulin (Li2004Functional). The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with varying cellular locations (Li2004Functional). These structural features and domain interactions are crucial for NPRL2's role in the GATOR1 complex and its function as a tumor suppressor.

## Function
The NPRL2 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the GATOR1 complex, which plays a critical role in the regulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for cell growth, protein synthesis, and autophagy. In healthy human cells, NPRL2 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RagA or RagB GTPases, which are involved in the inactivation of mTORC1 activity during amino acid deficiency (Kwak2016Amino). NPRL2 interacts with Raptor to activate mTORC1 in conditions of amino acid sufficiency and with Rag GTPases, particularly RagD, to inhibit mTORC1 activity during amino acid scarcity (Kwak2016Amino). This interaction is part of a 'seesaw' model where NPRL2's binding to Raptor or Rag GTPases determines mTORC1 activation (Kwak2016Amino).

NPRL2 is also involved in the subcellular translocation of mTOR to lysosomal membranes, which is essential for mTORC1 activation (Kwak2016Amino). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating mTORC1 activity independently of growth factor or energy state signals (Kwak2016Amino). NPRL2's role in mTORC1 regulation is crucial for cellular processes such as cell growth, protein synthesis, and autophagy (Kwak2016Amino).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPRL2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and epilepsy. NPRL2 is considered a candidate tumor suppressor gene, with its inactivation or loss contributing to the development of several cancers, including lung, renal, cervical, prostate, and oral squamous carcinomas. In these cancers, NPRL2 often undergoes homozygous deletions or mutations, leading to improper splicing and loss of functional mRNA, which may result in tumorigenesis (Li2004Functional). In renal cancer, specifically clear cell renal cell carcinoma, decreased expression of NPRL2 is associated with unfavorable pathological features, such as higher histological grade and lymph node metastasis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Tang2014Decreased).

NPRL2 is also involved in epilepsy syndromes. Mutations in NPRL2, part of the GATOR1 complex, have been linked to focal epilepsies and cortical malformations. These mutations can lead to dysregulation of the mTOR pathway, resulting in conditions like familial focal epilepsy with variable foci and temporal lobe epilepsy (Sun2021Phenotypic). The phenotypic variability in these conditions may be influenced by somatic mutations or environmental factors (Iffland2019GATORopathies:).

## Interactions
NPRL2 is a component of the GATOR1 complex, which includes DEPDC5 and NPRL3. This complex acts as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for RagA and RagB, playing a crucial role in inhibiting mTORC1 signaling in response to amino acid availability (Bar-Peled2013A). NPRL2 interacts more strongly with DEPDC5 and NPRL3 than with components of the GATOR2 subcomplex, highlighting its specific role within GATOR1 (Bar-Peled2013A).

NPRL2 also interacts with Rag GTPases, particularly RagD, to regulate mTORC1 activity. This interaction is part of a 'seesaw' model where NPRL2's binding to Raptor or Rag GTPases determines mTORC1 activation or inhibition based on amino acid availability (Kwak2016Amino). NPRL2 shows a higher affinity for the dominant negative mutant heterodimer of RagA GDP/RagD GTP, which inactivates mTORC1 (Kwak2016Amino).

In prostate cancer, NPRL2 interacts with UBE2M, a protein involved in neddylation. This interaction stabilizes NPRL2 by reducing its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, impacting the sensitivity of cancer cells to the PARP inhibitor niraparib (Zhao2021NPRL2).
