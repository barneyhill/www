# OGDH

## Overview
The OGDH gene encodes the enzyme oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, a key component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc), which is integral to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This enzyme is classified as a dehydrogenase and is primarily located in the mitochondria, where it catalyzes the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO2, a critical step in cellular respiration and energy production (Koike1998Cloning; Bunik2009Metabolic). The OGDH protein is part of a multi-subunit complex that includes dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (DLST) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), with the E1o component encoded by OGDH being essential for the initial and rate-limiting step of the reaction (Zhang2024Molecular). The activity of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase is tightly regulated by various factors, including calcium ions and the NADH/NAD+ ratio, reflecting its role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis (Bunik2009Metabolic). Mutations in the OGDH gene have been associated with neurological disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Yap2020A).

## Structure
The human OGDH (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) protein is a component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc), which plays a crucial role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The primary structure of OGDH includes a 3006-bp open reading frame encoding a 40-amino acid leader peptide and a mature enzyme of 962 amino acids (Koike1998Cloning). This leader peptide is essential for mitochondrial transport and processing (Koike1998Cloning).

The secondary structure of the OGDH complex includes conserved secondary structures such as α-helices and β-sheets, particularly in the E2o core domain (Zhang2024Molecular). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional enzyme, with the E1o component adopting a transketolase fold (Zhang2024Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, the OGDHc is composed of multiple subunits, including E1o, E2o, and E3, with E1o forming homodimers (Zhang2024Molecular; Koike1998Cloning). The E2o core is cubic, consisting of 24 E2o units, and serves as the central scaffold for the assembly of the complex (Zhang2024Molecular). The interactions between these subunits are critical for the stability and function of the complex (Zhang2024Molecular). The OGDH complex lacks a PSBD for binding E1o and E3, but the DSBD in E1o can bind E2o and E3 simultaneously (Zhang2024Molecular).

## Function
The OGDH gene encodes the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme, a critical component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC) located in the mitochondria. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the citric acid cycle by catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO2, a key step in cellular respiration and energy production (Koike1998Cloning; Bunik2009Metabolic). The OGDHC is composed of multiple subunits, including the E1 component encoded by OGDH, which is essential for the initial and rate-limiting step of the reaction (Koike1992Cloning; Bunik2009Metabolic).

OGDH activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis, influencing processes such as tissue respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Bunik2009Metabolic). The enzyme's regulation involves various factors, including Ca2+, ATP/ADP, and NADH/NAD+ ratios, which modulate its activity in response to cellular energy demands (Bunik2009Metabolic). Inhibition of OGDHC can lead to metabolic shifts, affecting amino acid levels and potentially contributing to neurodegenerative conditions (Bunik2009Metabolic). The enzyme's function is vital for normal brain activity, as it influences glutamate metabolism and neuronal health (Bunik2009Metabolic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OGDH gene, which encodes the enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, have been linked to a neurological disorder with features of a mitochondrial disease. A specific homozygous missense variant, c.959A>G (p.N320S), has been identified in individuals presenting with global developmental delay, elevated lactate levels, ataxia, and seizures. This variant leads to decreased OGDH protein levels and enzyme activity, confirming its pathogenicity. The disorder is characterized by symptoms such as developmental delay, hypotonia, movement disorders, and metabolic decompensation, and is presumed to be autosomal recessive, often occurring in consanguineous families (Yap2020A).

The OGDH gene is also implicated in cancer. Abnormal activities of TCA cycle enzymes, including OGDH, are associated with cancer, with high levels linked to gastric cancers. OGDH defects can lead to the formation of L-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits enzymes required for HIF1α degradation, a key protein for cancer proliferation under hypoxic conditions (Yap2020A). In gastric cancer, OGDH expression is significantly upregulated, promoting cell growth and migration by enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics and activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Lu2019&lt; OGDH; p&gt).

## Interactions
OGDH (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) is a key component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc), which plays a crucial role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. OGDH interacts with several proteins to form this complex, including dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (DLST) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) (Zhang2024Molecular). The complex is composed of three main subunits: E1o (OGDH), E2o (DLST), and E3 (DLD), with E1o and E3 being peripheral subunits that bind flexibly to the E2o core (Zhang2024Molecular).

OGDH also interacts with SIRT5, a mitochondrial sirtuin, which regulates its activity through desuccinylation. This interaction affects the succinylation status of OGDH, influencing its activity and, consequently, mitochondrial metabolism and cancer cell behavior (Lu2019OGDH). Additionally, OGDH forms a hybrid complex with DHTKD1, another enzyme with overlapping substrate specificity, allowing for functional compensation in certain metabolic contexts (Leandro2020DHTKD1).

The assembly of lipoic acid on the OGDH complex involves interactions with proteins such as LipB and LipA, which bind to the E2 components of the complex, facilitating the assembly of essential cofactors for aerobic metabolism (Hassan2011ProteinProtein). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of OGDH in cellular metabolism and its regulation through complex protein-protein interactions.
