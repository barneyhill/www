# SNRPB

## Overview
The SNRPB gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptides B and B1, which are integral components of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. These proteins are categorized as core spliceosomal proteins and play a crucial role in the removal of introns and the joining of exons to form mature mRNA, a fundamental process in gene expression regulation and protein synthesis (Liu2019SNRPB; Gray1999Concerted). The SNRPB gene is involved in the production of different isoforms through alternative splicing, which are essential for maintaining the stoichiometric balance of spliceosomal components (Lynch2014Disrupted). Mutations in SNRPB have been associated with cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Bacrot2014Mutations; Liu2019SNRPB). The gene's function and interactions underscore its importance in cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and adaptation to environmental changes (Nguyen2013Integrative).

## Structure
The SNRPB gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptides B and B1, which are integral components of the spliceosomal complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. The primary structure of the SNRPB protein includes a conserved Sm domain, which is crucial for RNA binding and protein-protein interactions. This domain is characterized by a series of beta sheets and alpha helices, forming a stable secondary structure that facilitates its function within the spliceosome (Gray1999Concerted).

The SNRPB protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as methylation and phosphorylation, which influence its function and localization within the cell. These modifications are essential for the dynamic regulation of the spliceosomal components during the splicing process (Gray1999Concerted).

Alternative splicing of the SNRPB gene results in the production of different isoforms, including SmB and SmB', which are core components of the U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein subunits of the major spliceosome (Lynch2014Disrupted). The presence of these isoforms highlights the gene's role in maintaining the stoichiometric balance of spliceosomal components, which is crucial for proper cellular function (Gray1999Concerted).

## Function
The SNRPB gene encodes core components of the spliceosome, specifically the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptides B and B1, which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing. This process involves the removal of introns from pre-mRNA and the joining of exons to form mature mRNA, a critical step in gene expression regulation and protein synthesis (Liu2019SNRPB; Gray1999Concerted). SNRPB is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly and function of the spliceosome complex, ensuring the correct splicing of pre-mRNA and maintaining RNA stability (Correa2016Functional; Nguyen2013Integrative).

In healthy human cells, SNRPB plays a vital role in RNA processing, influencing the expression levels of many RNA processing factors and affecting alternative splicing (Nguyen2013Integrative). It is involved in the recognition of exons and introns, particularly those with weaker regulatory elements, which is crucial for maintaining proper RNA processing and ensuring the stability and localization of transcript isoforms (Correa2016Functional). The gene's function is essential for normal cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and adaptation to environmental changes (Nguyen2013Integrative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SNRPB gene are linked to cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome (CCMS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by micrognathia, posterior rib gaps, and other craniofacial defects. These mutations often occur in a highly conserved alternative exon of the SNRPB gene, which contains a premature termination codon (PTC) that triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). This results in increased inclusion of the alternative exon and decreased overall expression of SNRPB, disrupting the balance between coding full-length mRNA and alternative exon-containing transcripts, leading to the disease (Bacrot2014Mutations; Lynch2014Disrupted).

SNRPB mutations also affect the splicing machinery, as the gene encodes components of the core spliceosomal machinery, specifically the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptides B and B1. These mutations can lead to defects in splicing regulation, contributing to the developmental anomalies observed in CCMS (Bacrot2014Mutations; Beauchamp2020Spliceosomopathies).

In addition to CCMS, alterations in SNRPB expression have been implicated in various cancers, including glioblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In these contexts, SNRPB is identified as an oncogenic candidate, with its dysregulation affecting RNA processing and contributing to tumorigenesis (Correa2016Functional; Liu2019SNRPB).

## Interactions
SNRPB, a component of the spliceosomal machinery, participates in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is a core component of the U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) subunits, which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing (Lynch2014Disrupted). SNRPB interacts with the p53 protein, a key regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis, particularly in the context of cervical cancer. This interaction influences the expression of p53, affecting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis (Zhu2020SNRPB).

In glioblastoma, SNRPB is involved in the regulation of splicing machinery components, affecting the splicing of core small nuclear ribonucleic proteins (snRNPs) such as U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5. This regulation is crucial for maintaining proper RNA processing and splicing (Correa2016Functional). SNRPB also interacts with the SMN complex, which modulates snRNP production. This interaction is influenced by RNA and transcriptional activity, with SNRPB associating with 7SK complexes containing hnRNP proteins in an RNA-dependent manner (Ji2021Interaction). These interactions highlight SNRPB's role in both the assembly and function of the spliceosome and its broader impact on cellular processes related to cancer.
