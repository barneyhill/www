# SORT1

## Overview
The SORT1 gene encodes sortilin 1, a type-1 transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular protein trafficking and sorting. Sortilin 1 is characterized by its large extracellular domain, which includes a Vps10p domain essential for ligand binding, and a short cytoplasmic tail that contains sorting motifs critical for its function in Golgi-endosome transport (Ouyang2020Mechanism; Nielsen2001The). As a receptor, sortilin 1 is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and protein degradation, by mediating the internalization and trafficking of proteins such as apolipoprotein B-100 and progranulin (Hu2010SortilinMediated; Conlon2022Sortilin). The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation events, which influence its interactions with adaptor proteins and its intracellular localization (Pallesen2020PAK). Clinically, alterations in SORT1 expression and function have been linked to cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other conditions, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Kathiresan2008Six; AchaSagredo2024Novel).

## Structure
Sortilin 1 (SORT1) is a type-1 membrane protein characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain is composed of a Vps10p domain, which includes a β-propeller structure and a C-terminal segment of ten conserved cysteines (10CC) crucial for ligand binding (Ouyang2020Mechanism; Nielsen2001The). The protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor with a 44-amino-acid N-terminal propeptide that is cleaved by furin in the trans-Golgi network, activating the receptor by exposing ligand-binding sites (Petersen1999Propeptide).

The cytoplasmic tail of sortilin contains several sorting motifs, including a tyrosine-based YSVL motif and an acidic cluster dileucine DXXLL motif, which are involved in interactions with adapter proteins and are essential for Golgi-endosome transport (Ouyang2020Mechanism; Nielsen2001The). The cytoplasmic domain also includes a serine residue that can be phosphorylated by PAK kinases, affecting adaptor binding and intracellular trafficking (Pallesen2020PAK).

Sortilin can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and undergoes glycosylation as a common post-translational modification (Petersen1999Propeptide).

## Function
The SORT1 gene encodes sortilin, a protein that plays a significant role in intracellular trafficking and sorting of proteins within healthy human cells. Sortilin is predominantly located in the late Golgi apparatus, where it binds to various cargo proteins, regulating their surface location, secretion, or degradation in lysosomes (Ouyang2020Mechanism). Approximately 90% of sortilin is found in the Golgi, while the remaining 10% is present on the cell membrane, acting as an internalization receptor for recycling or lysosomal degradation of proteins (Ouyang2020Mechanism).

Sortilin is involved in the regulation of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) secretion by hepatocytes, particularly under stressed conditions such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. It mediates the degradation of misfolded apoB-100 through autophagy, serving as a quality control mechanism (Conlon2022Sortilin). Under basal conditions, sortilin does not significantly affect apoB-100 secretion, but under stress, it restricts secretion, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism and its potential protective effects against cardiovascular diseases (Conlon2022Sortilin).

Sortilin's function is also modulated by phosphorylation events, such as those mediated by PAK kinases, which affect its intracellular trafficking and interaction with adaptor proteins (Pallesen2020PAK). This regulation underscores sortilin's importance in cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and protein sorting.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SORT1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cardiovascular and cancer-related conditions. SORT1 is located at the 1p13.3 locus, a known cardiovascular risk region. Variants such as SNP rs646776 are associated with changes in SORT1 expression, influencing plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and coronary artery disease risk (Kjolby2010Sort1; Kathiresan2008Six). Overexpression of sortilin, the protein encoded by SORT1, can increase plasma LDL cholesterol levels, while sortilin deficiency is linked to reduced cholesterol and atherosclerotic lesions (Kjolby2010Sort1).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SORT1 expression is downregulated, particularly in adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, with varying prognostic implications (AchaSagredo2024Novel). The gene's expression is also affected by DNA methylation, which may alter the expression ratios of its variants, potentially impacting cancer progression and treatment responses (AchaSagredo2024Novel).

Additionally, SORT1 expression is regulated by SNPs and transcription factors, with implications for diseases like neurodegenerative disorders and diabetes, where altered sortilin levels are observed (Ouyang2020Mechanism). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SORT1 in disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Interactions
Sortilin 1 (SORT1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It interacts with p21-activated kinases (PAK1-3), which phosphorylate the serine residue in its cytoplasmic domain. This phosphorylation reduces sortilin's affinity for adaptor proteins, altering its intracellular trafficking (Pallesen2020PAK). Sortilin also interacts with the adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1), specifically the μ1A and μ1B subunits, which are involved in Golgi-endosome sorting. Phosphorylation of sortilin by PAK kinases decreases its interaction with AP-1 (Pallesen2020PAK).

Sortilin binds to progranulin (PGRN) with high affinity, mediating its endocytosis and clearance from the extracellular environment. This interaction is crucial for regulating PGRN levels, which are implicated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (Hu2010SortilinMediated). Sortilin also interacts with glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, influencing their trafficking and surface expression in prostate cancer cells (Lazniewska2023Dynamic).

Sortilin's cytoplasmic domain interacts with the GGA2 sorting protein, which is involved in Golgi-endosome/lysosome transport. This interaction is mediated by the VHS domain of GGA2, highlighting sortilin's role in protein transport (Nielsen2001The).
