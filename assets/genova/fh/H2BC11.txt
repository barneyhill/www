# H2BC11

## Overview
H2BC11 is a gene that encodes the protein H2B clustered histone 11, a member of the histone H2B family. Histones are fundamental components of chromatin, playing a critical role in the organization and regulation of DNA within the nucleus. The H2B clustered histone 11 protein is involved in the formation of nucleosomes, which are essential for DNA packaging and gene expression regulation. This protein is implicated in various biological processes, including chromatin dynamics, transcriptional regulation, and cell differentiation. H2BC11 has been associated with immune interactions and is linked to the tumor microenvironment, particularly in glioma, where it influences immune cell infiltration and immunosuppression. Its expression levels have clinical significance in several cancers, serving as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target (Shen2024Role; Jia2022H2B).

## Clinical Significance
H2BC11, a member of the histone H2B family, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation. In glioma, a type of brain tumor, high expression of H2BC11 is associated with poor prognosis and is considered a high-risk factor. It correlates with increased tumor cell purity and immune cell infiltration, contributing to an immunosuppressive environment that promotes tumor progression (Jia2022H2B). H2BC11 is also linked to immune checkpoint markers like PDCD1, which tumors use to evade immune responses (Jia2022H2B).

In cervical cancer, H2BC11 serves as an independent prognostic factor, with its expression correlating with positive clinical outcomes over one, three, and five years (Jia2022H2B). In breast cancer, H2BC11 is downregulated in lobular carcinoma, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Mohamed2021The). Additionally, H2BC11 is amplified and upregulated in brain metastasis of breast cancer, indicating its involvement in cancer metastasis (Espiritu2021Molecular). These findings highlight the clinical significance of H2BC11 in cancer prognosis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
H2BC11, a member of the H2B histone family, is involved in various interactions that influence chromatin structure and gene regulation. It is associated with immune infiltration in glioma, particularly interacting with immune cells such as macrophages, Th2 cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils, which are involved in the tumor microenvironment and immunosuppression (Jia2022H2B). H2BC11 is also linked to immune checkpoint markers like PDCD1, IL10, and CD70, which are associated with poor prognosis in glioma, suggesting its role in forming an immunosuppressive environment (Jia2022H2B).

In the context of nucleosome organization, H2BC11, also known as H2B1.1, is identified as a component of H2AK119ub nucleosomes in Xenopus laevis embryos, indicating its involvement in Polycomb gene silencing and developmental processes (Shen2024Role). Although specific protein interactions of H2BC11 are not detailed, its role in transcriptional misregulation, chromatin silencing, and cell differentiation is suggested by its association with 74 proteins identified in a protein-protein interaction network (Jia2022H2B). These interactions highlight H2BC11's potential involvement in transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics.
