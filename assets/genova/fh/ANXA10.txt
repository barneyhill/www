# ANXA10

## Overview
ANXA10 is a gene that encodes the protein annexin A10, a member of the annexin family known for their roles in phospholipid binding and involvement in various cellular processes. Unlike other annexins, annexin A10 is characterized by a unique structure that lacks typical calcium-binding sites, suggesting calcium-independent functions. This protein is primarily expressed in the gastric mucosa and other specific tissues, where it is implicated in transcription regulation and cellular signaling pathways such as Akt and ERK/MAPK. Annexin A10's involvement in RNA binding and nuclear paraspeckles highlights its role in mRNA processing and transcriptional regulation. Clinically, ANXA10 expression levels have been associated with various cancers, acting as either a tumor suppressor or oncopromoter depending on the context, thus serving as a potential prognostic marker in oncology (Sun2019Annexin10; PrietoFernández2022Pathobiological; Tsai2015Aberrant).

## Structure
Annexin A10 (ANXA10) is a member of the annexin family, characterized by its unique primary structure, which includes a distinct N-terminal region and a conserved core domain typical of annexins. The primary structure of ANXA10 is notable for the replacement of normally conserved calcium-coordinating residues in three of its four repeats, similar to annexin A9, which suggests a potential alteration in calcium-binding capacity (Morgan1999Novel). The secondary structure of annexins typically features alpha-helices, which fold into a compact, globular form in the tertiary structure. ANXA10's tertiary structure is analogous to other annexins, with four internally homologous repeats forming a putative calcium channel (Morgan1999Novel).

ANXA10 is unique among annexins as it harbors only one Ca2+-binding site, which is atypical for this protein family, suggesting that its intracellular functions may not be primarily related to membrane association (Quiskamp2013The). The protein's amino terminus is unique to its subfamily and composed of residues capable of interacting with other subcellular components (Morgan1999Novel). ANXA10 does not form quaternary structures but may interact with other proteins or membranes. The protein's low Ca2+-binding capacity implies a role in nuclear paraspeckles and transcriptional regulation rather than membrane association (Quiskamp2013The).

## Function
Annexin A10 (ANXA10) is a member of the annexin family, which are proteins known for their roles in binding phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner, influencing various cellular processes such as membrane dynamics and cellular organization. ANXA10 is distinct from other annexins due to its unique structure, which lacks type II calcium-binding sites in three of its four conserved annexin repeats, resulting in calcium-independent functions (Zhu2017Annexin; Tsai2015Aberrant).

ANXA10 is primarily expressed in the gastric mucosa, Brunner gland of the duodenum, and urothelium, suggesting a role in the development and maintenance of gastric gland structures (Tsai2015Aberrant). It functions as a transcription regulator and is involved in the regulation of the Akt and ERK/MAPK pathways, which are critical for cell proliferation and survival (PrietoFernández2022Pathobiological). ANXA10's nuclear subcellular location indicates its involvement in transcription regulation and mRNA processing (PrietoFernández2022Pathobiological).

While its specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, ANXA10's expression patterns and molecular interactions suggest it plays a role in cellular growth and differentiation, particularly in tissues where calcium sensitivity is not crucial (PrietoFernández2022Pathobiological).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ANXA10 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it can act as either an oncopromoter or a tumor suppressor, depending on the cancer type. In extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, high ANXA10 expression is associated with poor prognosis and lower overall survival rates, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Sun2019Annexin10). Similarly, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, elevated ANXA10 levels correlate with poor overall and recurrence-free survival (ishikawa2022high).

In contrast, low ANXA10 expression is linked to aggressive disease in bladder cancer, where it predicts shorter progression-free survival and is associated with metastatic disease (Munksgaard2011Low). In gastric cancer, reduced ANXA10 expression is associated with advanced disease and poor prognosis, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Kim2009Reduced).

ANXA10 also plays a role in colorectal carcinoma, particularly in the serrated neoplasia pathway, where its expression is associated with specific molecular features like BRAF mutations and microsatellite instability (Tsai2015Aberrant). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, high ANXA10 expression is linked to poor disease-free survival and promotes tumor growth through the Akt and ERK1/2 pathways (Kodaira2019ANXA10).

## Interactions
Annexin A10 (ANXA10) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, particularly in the context of RNA binding and nuclear paraspeckles. ANXA10 has been shown to bind RNA, with a specific affinity for the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of c-myc and anxA2 mRNAs. This binding is RNA-dependent, as demonstrated by the loss of interaction following RNase treatment (Patil2023RNAbinding). ANXA10 preferentially binds RNA transcripts as dimers, with its dimeric form exhibiting higher affinity for specific RNA sequences (Patil2023RNAbinding).

In the nucleus, ANXA10 is a component of paraspeckles, subnuclear structures associated with non-coding RNAs. It co-localizes with paraspeckle proteins such as SFPQ and PSPC1, indicating its role in RNA-related processes within these nuclear compartments (Quiskamp2013The). ANXA10's recruitment to paraspeckles is mediated by its core domain, and specific annexin repeats are necessary for this interaction (Quiskamp2013The). Overexpression of ANXA10 in HeLa cells has been shown to reduce the number of paraspeckles, suggesting a regulatory role in their formation or maintenance (Monastyrskaya2018Functional; Quiskamp2013The).
