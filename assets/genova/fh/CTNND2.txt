# CTNND2

## Overview
CTNND2 is a gene that encodes the protein catenin delta 2, also known as δ-catenin, which is a member of the armadillo family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling, primarily within the nervous system. δ-Catenin plays a crucial role in neuronal development and function, particularly in the formation and maintenance of dendrites and dendritic spines, which are essential for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Donta2022DeltaCatenin). It is predominantly expressed in nervous tissue and interacts with various proteins, including cadherins and Rho GTPases, to modulate cytoskeletal dynamics and synaptic structure (Yuan2017Functional; Donta2022DeltaCatenin). The gene's significance extends to its involvement in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Lu2016Genetic).

## Structure
The CTNND2 gene encodes the δ-catenin protein, which is a member of the armadillo family and contains several structural domains. The protein is characterized by ten armadillo repeating sequences, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Lu2010δ‐Catenin). These repeats are part of the β-catenin/armadillo superfamily, contributing to the protein's role in cell adhesion and signaling (Lu2010δ‐Catenin).

δ-Catenin contains a coiled-coil domain, an armadillo domain, a polyproline tract, and a PDZ domain (Adegbola2020Disruption). The coiled-coil domain is unique to the longest isoform of δ-catenin and is involved in specific structural interactions (Adegbola2020Disruption). The armadillo domain is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as Shank3, where it binds to the Ank domain of Shank3, facilitating postsynaptic localization (Hassani2020Targeting).

Post-translational modifications of δ-catenin include phosphorylation and palmitoylation. Phosphorylation by TNIK at Thr1064 and palmitoylation by DHHC5 at Cys960 and Cys961 have been identified, although these modifications do not significantly alter its interaction with Shank3 (Hassani2020Targeting). These structural features and modifications highlight δ-catenin's role in cellular signaling and synaptic function.

## Function
CTNND2, also known as delta-catenin, is a protein that plays a significant role in neuronal function and development. It is predominantly expressed in nervous tissue and is crucial for the formation and maintenance of dendrites and dendritic spines, which are essential for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Donta2022DeltaCatenin). Delta-catenin stabilizes the cadherin-catenin complex at adherens junctions by binding to the cytoplasmic region of cadherins, such as N-cadherin, thereby maintaining the adhesive and motility properties of these junctions (Donta2022DeltaCatenin).

In neurons, delta-catenin modulates the activity of small Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, which are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. This modulation is crucial for dendritic branching and spine morphology, influencing synaptic density and plasticity (Yuan2017Functional; Donta2022DeltaCatenin). Delta-catenin's interactions with proteins like Erbin, Magi1, and Pdlim5, through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, affect dendritic spine morphology and dendrite morphogenesis (Donta2022DeltaCatenin).

The protein is active in various cellular locations, including the cytoplasm, nucleus, dendrites, postsynaptic terminals, and growth cones of neurons, indicating its diverse roles in cellular processes (Donta2022DeltaCatenin). Its expression and function are critical for maintaining proper synaptic structure and function, which are essential for cognitive processes (Donta2022DeltaCatenin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CTNND2 gene, also known as catenin delta 2, have been implicated in a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs), and mutations in CTNND2 are associated with conditions including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disabilities, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (Lu2016Genetic). In particular, CTNND2 mutations and CNVs are enriched in individuals with ASD, affecting Wnt signaling pathways and correlating with other autism-related genes (Lu2016Genetic).

CTNND2 is also linked to Alzheimer's disease, where specific SNPs and rare missense mutations are associated with increased amyloid precursor protein and Aβ42 secretion (Lu2016Genetic). In Cri-du-chat syndrome, partial deletions or duplications of CTNND2 contribute to mental retardation and increased severity of the syndrome (Vaz2023Loss; Hofmeister2014CTNND2—a).

The gene's disruption is further associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and myopia, as evidenced by a study involving a family with a balanced translocation affecting CTNND2 (Adegbola2020Disruption). These findings underscore the gene's significant role in various complex human diseases and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
CTNND2, also known as catenin delta 2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neuronal function and synaptic regulation. It binds to the cytoplasmic region of classical cadherins, such as N-cadherin, stabilizing the cadherin-catenin complex and linking it to the actin cytoskeleton, which influences cell adhesion and motility (Lu2016Genetic; Donta2022DeltaCatenin). CTNND2 interacts with proteins containing PDZ domains, including Erbin, Magi1, and Pdlim5, which are important for dendritic spine morphology and dendrite morphogenesis (Donta2022DeltaCatenin).

CTNND2 also interacts with synaptic proteins such as glutamate receptors and PSD95, suggesting a role in synaptic regulation (Lu2016Genetic). It is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway and interacts with Rho GTPases, affecting dendritic and spine morphogenesis (Lu2016Genetic). CTNND2's interaction with Shank3 at postsynaptic sites is crucial for its localization, and an ASD-associated mutation in Shank3 increases this interaction (Hassani2020Targeting). Additionally, CTNND2 interacts with the SRGAP2 protein family, which influences synaptic development and maturation (Assendorp2022CTNND2). These interactions highlight CTNND2's significant role in neuronal development and function.
