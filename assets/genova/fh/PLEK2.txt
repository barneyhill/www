# PLEK2

## Overview
PLEK2 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin 2, which is a key player in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. Pleckstrin 2 is characterized by its structural domains, including two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and a disheveled-Egl-10-pleckstrin (DEP) domain, which facilitate its interaction with phosphoinositides and membrane receptors (Wang2021Emerging; Han2023Targeting). This protein is involved in various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, cell motility, and immune synapse formation, primarily through its role in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway (Wang2021Emerging; Bach2006PI3K). PLEK2 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis through interactions with key signaling molecules like Akt and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Shen2019PLEK2; Han2023Targeting). Its involvement in these pathways underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology and other fields (Zhang2023PLEK2).

## Structure
Pleckstrin-2 (PLEK2) is a protein characterized by its structural domains, including two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains located at the amino and carboxyl termini, and a central disheveled-Egl-10-pleckstrin (DEP) domain (Wang2021Emerging; Han2023Targeting). The PH domains are approximately 120 amino acids long and are involved in phospholipid binding, which is crucial for membrane association and cellular signaling (Wang2021Emerging). The DEP domain facilitates interactions with membrane receptors and phospholipids, playing a significant role in membrane anchoring and signal transduction (Wang2021Emerging).

The DEP domain is essential for PLEK2's function, particularly in activating the Akt signaling pathway, with specific residues such as lysine 156, serine 162, and arginine 194 being critical for binding (Han2023Targeting). PLEK2 is not efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) but is regulated by PI3K-phosphorylated phospholipids, distinguishing it from its paralog PLEK1 (Wang2021Emerging).

The full-length structure of PLEK2 remains largely uncharacterized due to challenges in protein production and crystallization, although solution structures of its C-terminal PH domain and DEP domain have been reported (Wang2021Emerging). The protein's primary sequence includes potential small molecule binding grooves, which may be responsible for phospholipid binding (Wang2021Emerging).

## Function
Pleckstrin-2 (PLEK2) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily related to cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling. It plays a significant role in actin rearrangement, contributing to cell shape changes and motility. PLEK2 is associated with the plasma membrane and is involved in the formation of lamellipodia and peripheral ruffles, which are crucial for cell spreading and movement (Wang2021Emerging; Hu1999Pleckstrin).

PLEK2 contains two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and a disheveled-Egl-10-pleckstrin (DEP) domain, which facilitate its recruitment to the cell membrane and interaction with phosphoinositides. These domains are essential for its role in membrane binding and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Wang2021Emerging; Bach2006PI3K). PLEK2's function is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), as it binds with high affinity to D3 phosphoinositides, products of PI3K activity, which are crucial for its membrane association and cell spreading (Bach2006PI3K).

In T-cells, PLEK2 is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, enhancing actin-dependent spreading and immune synapse formation. It acts as a signal adaptor, linking T-cell receptor signaling to actin cytoskeletal changes necessary for immune responses (Wang2021Emerging; Bach2006PI3K). PLEK2 also plays a critical role in terminal erythropoiesis, particularly in the enucleation process, by maintaining the actin cytoskeleton (Zhao2014Targeted).

## Clinical Significance
PLEK2 (pleckstrin 2) has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In gallbladder cancer (GBC), PLEK2 is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. It promotes cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by interacting with the EGFR/CCL2 pathway (Shen2019PLEK2). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PLEK2 overexpression is associated with resistance to neoadjuvant immunotherapy, contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and poor treatment outcomes (Liu2022PLEK2).

In myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) driven by the JAK2 V617F mutation, PLEK2 is a downstream target of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. Its loss ameliorates myeloproliferative phenotypes and reduces vascular occlusions, suggesting its critical role in the disease's pathogenesis (Zhao2017Loss). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PLEK2 is upregulated and linked to tumor progression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, serving as a potential prognostic biomarker (Zhang2023PLEK2).

PLEK2's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers, where its expression and interactions significantly impact disease progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
PLEK2 (pleckstrin 2) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. PLEK2 interacts with the protein kinase Akt, forming a membrane-signaling complex that recruits PI3K effector proteins and heat shock protein Hsp72. This interaction leads to the activation and stabilization of Akt, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Han2023Targeting). The interaction between PLEK2 and Akt involves the C-terminal catalytic and regulatory domains of Akt, as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays (Han2023Targeting).

In the context of gallbladder cancer, PLEK2 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), binding to its intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. This interaction inhibits EGFR ubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin ligase c-CBL, leading to enhanced EGFR signaling. This interaction promotes cancer cell migration and metastasis through downstream pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, and JAK/STAT (Shen2019PLEK2).

PLEK2 also plays a role in cytoskeletal reorganization by interacting with phosphoinositides, which are products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). This interaction is essential for PLEK2's association with the cell membrane and its role in actin-dependent spreading and immune synapse formation (Wang2021Emerging; Bach2006PI3K).
