# PGAP4

## Overview
PGAP4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme post-GPI attachment to proteins GalNAc transferase 4, a Golgi-resident glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. This enzyme plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of proteins by transferring N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the mannose of GPI anchors, contributing to the structural diversity and function of GPI-anchored proteins (Hirata2018Identification). PGAP4 is characterized by its unique structure, which includes three transmembrane domains and a split GT-A fold, and is essential for the enzyme's activity in the Golgi apparatus (Hirata2018Identification). While the absence of PGAP4 does not significantly affect the overall expression of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface, it is implicated in specific glycan modifications, indicating a specialized role in cellular communication and signaling (Liu2021A).

## Structure


## Function
PGAP4, also known as post-GPI attachment to proteins GalNAc transferase 4, is a Golgi-resident enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. It specifically transfers N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the mannose of GPI via a β1-4 linkage, a modification that contributes to the structural diversity of GPIs (Hirata2018Identification). This process is crucial for the proper functioning of GPI-anchored proteins, which play significant roles in cellular communication and signaling (Hirata2018Identification).

PGAP4 is characterized by its unique structure, containing three transmembrane domains and a split GT-A fold, which is atypical for Golgi glycosyltransferases (Hirata2018Identification). The enzyme's activity is dependent on conserved residues, such as the EDD motif, which is essential for binding donor substrates (Hirata2018Identification). PGAP4 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies GPI anchors after fatty acid remodeling, a step necessary for the post-translational modification of proteins (Hirata2018Identification).

Despite its role in glycan modification, the absence of PGAP4 does not significantly impact the overall expression of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface, suggesting its function may be related to specific glycan modifications rather than being critical for general GPI-AP expression (Liu2021A).

## Interactions
PGAP4, a Golgi-resident glycosyltransferase, is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. It has been identified as a GPI-specific GalNAc-transferase responsible for modifying the first mannose with β1,4-linked N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) (Wang2019Crosstalks). PGAP4 interacts with GPI lipids through its transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function in GPI glycan recognition (Hirata2018Identification). 

The enzyme's activity is influenced by the structure of the sn-2-linked fatty acyl chain in GPI, suggesting a specific interaction with GPI lipid components (Hirata2018Identification). PGAP4's role in GPI biosynthesis is also linked to its interaction with other enzymes in the pathway, such as B3GALT4, which extends the β4GalNAc modification (Narimatsu2021Genetic). 

Additionally, PGAP4 has been noted to have a high-confidence interaction with GOLPH3 and GOLPH3L, proteins involved in intra-Golgi transport, indicating its potential involvement in broader Golgi apparatus functions (Welch2021GOLPH3). These interactions highlight PGAP4's role in the complex network of glycosylation pathways within the cell.
