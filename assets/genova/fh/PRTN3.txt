# PRTN3

## Overview
The PRTN3 gene encodes proteinase 3 (PR3), a serine protease predominantly expressed in neutrophils. As a member of the serine protease family, PR3 is characterized by its catalytic triad, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This protease plays a pivotal role in immune regulation, particularly in the processes of neutrophil apoptosis and inflammation. PR3 is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components and the processing of inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to tissue remodeling and immune responses. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cancers, underscoring its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Casal2023Risk; Loison2014Proteinase; Shi2023Integrated).

## Structure
Proteinase 3 (PRTN3) is a serine protease primarily found in neutrophils. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, which includes a catalytic triad typical of serine proteases. The secondary structure of PRTN3 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its enzymatic function. The tertiary structure is a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by disulfide bonds, which is crucial for its stability and activity.

PRTN3 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably Asn-linked glycosylation at two specific sites: Asn-102 and Asn-147. Glycosylation at Asn-147 is critical for the enzyme's thermostability and optimal hydrolytic activity, while glycosylation at Asn-102 is important for efficient N-terminal processing (Specks2006Functional). These modifications influence the enzyme's conformational stability, folding, and immune recognition, although glycosylation is not essential for targeting to granules or for enzymatic activity (Specks2006Functional).

The quaternary structure of PRTN3 may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context. The glycosylation status of PRTN3 can affect its immunogenicity, potentially impacting the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (Specks2006Functional).

## Function
Proteinase 3 (PR3), encoded by the PRTN3 gene, is a serine protease primarily found in neutrophil granules. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis, a process essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation. PR3 cleaves and activates procaspase-3, leading to apoptosis in aging neutrophils. This activation occurs independently of the traditional caspase-8 and caspase-9 pathways, highlighting a unique mechanism by which PR3 modulates cell death (Loison2014Proteinase).

PR3 is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components such as elastin, fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type IV, contributing to tissue remodeling and degradation (Rao1991Characterization). It also processes various inflammatory molecules, including IL-8, IL-32, IL-1β, and TNF-α, and is implicated in the regulation of inflammation (Loison2014Proteinase).

In healthy human cells, PR3 is stored in neutrophil granules and becomes active when released into the cytosol during neutrophil death. Its activity is regulated by inhibitors such as SERPINB1, which counteracts PR3's proapoptotic effects, thereby protecting against premature neutrophil death (Loison2014Proteinase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PRTN3 gene are implicated in several diseases. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PRTN3 is associated with immune cell infiltration and poor prognosis following radiofrequency ablation (RFA). High PRTN3 expression correlates with unfavorable overall survival and promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the PI3K/AKT and P38/ERK signaling pathways (Shi2023Integrated).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PRTN3 negatively regulates myeloid differentiation by promoting the degradation of STAT3, a key transcription factor. Lower PRTN3 expression is linked to improved survival rates, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2024Proteinase).

PRTN3 is also significant in autoimmune conditions such as ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The Val119Ile polymorphism in PRTN3 is associated with a higher risk of severe relapse in AAV, potentially due to altered protein interactions (Casal2023Risk). Elevated PRTN3 expression in neutrophils is linked to increased relapse rates in GPA, highlighting its role in disease pathogenesis (Bonatti2014Genetic; Jones2020ANCA).

## Interactions
Proteinase 3 (PRTN3) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various biological processes. PRTN3 binds to the N-terminal domain of STAT3, a member of the STAT family of proteins, and this interaction is crucial for regulating the stability and degradation of STAT3 through ubiquitination and proteasome pathways (Liu2024Proteinase). Overexpression of PRTN3 leads to a decrease in STAT3 protein levels, while its depletion results in increased STAT3 stability, highlighting its role in promoting STAT3 degradation (Liu2024Proteinase).

PRTN3 also interacts with several membrane partners, including CD16/FcγRIIIb, phospholipid scramblase-1, CD11b/CD18, and human neutrophil antigen NB1/CD177. These interactions involve a hydrophobic patch on PRTN3, which is crucial for its membrane association and function (Korkmaz2010Neutrophil). Additionally, PRTN3 is involved in the degradation of progranulin (PGRN), an anti-inflammatory mediator, in conjunction with neutrophil elastase (NE). This degradation is essential for modulating inflammation and neutrophil activation (Kessenbrock2008Proteinase). These interactions underscore PRTN3's role in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
