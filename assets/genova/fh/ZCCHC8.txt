# ZCCHC8

## Overview
ZCCHC8 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 8 protein, which is a crucial component of the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex. This protein is characterized by its zinc-knuckle domain and proline-rich region, which are essential for its function in RNA processing and regulation. The ZCCHC8 protein plays a significant role in the maturation and degradation of various RNA species, including telomerase RNA and non-coding RNAs, by facilitating their interaction with the RNA exosome. It is involved in maintaining telomere length and ensuring proper gene expression regulation, thereby contributing to cellular stability. Mutations in the ZCCHC8 gene have been linked to several diseases, including familial pulmonary fibrosis and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in human health (Falk2016Structure; Wang2024ZCCHC8; Gable2019ZCCHC8).

## Structure
The ZCCHC8 protein is a component of the human NEXT complex, which includes RBM7 and hMTR4. It contains a zinc-knuckle domain and a proline-rich region, both crucial for its function (Falk2016Structure). The protein interacts with the RNA recognition motif (RRM) of RBM7, forming a stable complex. This interaction is facilitated by a proline-rich segment of ZCCHC8, which binds to the RRM domain of RBM7 (Falk2016Structure). The crystal structure of the ZCCHC8-RBM7 core complex has been resolved to 2.0 Å, revealing the interaction interface between residues 286-324 of ZCCHC8 and residues 7-86 of RBM7 (Falk2016Structure).

The tertiary structure of ZCCHC8 in complex with RBM7 shows that ZCCHC8 is recognized at the helical surface of the RBM7 RRM, which folds into a typical globular domain with four antiparallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices. ZCCHC8 interacts with RBM7 through conserved hydrophobic contacts, forming two interaction hotspots (Falk2016Structure). The ZCCHC8-RBM7 interface is evolutionarily conserved, with interactions reminiscent of other RRM-protein complexes (Falk2016Structure). The protein's role in RNA processing and its involvement in the NEXT complex suggest its importance in cellular RNA regulation (Gable2019ZCCHC8).

## Function
The ZCCHC8 gene encodes a zinc-knuckle containing protein that is a component of the nuclear exosome targeting complex (NEXT), which is crucial for RNA processing in healthy human cells. ZCCHC8 plays a significant role in the maturation of telomerase RNA (TR), which is essential for telomerase function and telomere maintenance. It is involved in the 3' end processing of TR, ensuring that mature TR is available for telomere maintenance (Gable2019ZCCHC8). 

ZCCHC8 is also involved in the degradation of pervasive transcripts, such as promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), enhancer RNAs, and other non-coding RNAs, which originate from various genomic regulatory features. This degradation is crucial for maintaining proper gene expression regulation and preventing the accumulation of potentially non-functional or deleterious RNA species (Collins2021ZCCHC8). 

In the cellular context, ZCCHC8 is active in the nucleoplasm, where it forms the NEXT complex with the RNA helicase MTR4 and the RNA binding protein RBM7. This complex directs non-coding RNAs for degradation by the nuclear exosome, playing a role in RNA turnover and processing (Wang2021The). The proper functioning of ZCCHC8 is essential for maintaining telomere length and ensuring cellular stability (Wang2024ZCCHC8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZCCHC8 gene are associated with several diseases, primarily affecting telomere biology. ZCCHC8 is crucial for the maturation of telomerase RNA (TR), and its dysfunction can lead to telomere-related disorders. Familial pulmonary fibrosis is one of the primary conditions linked to ZCCHC8 mutations, with specific variants such as P186L and c.586G>A being identified in affected individuals (Gable2019ZCCHC8; Groen2023A). These mutations result in impaired telomerase function, contributing to disease pathology (Gable2019ZCCHC8).

In addition to pulmonary fibrosis, ZCCHC8 mutations are implicated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The p.P410A mutation disrupts nucleocytoplasmic localization, affecting the expression of telomere-related genes and leading to shorter telomeres (Wang2024ZCCHC8). This mutation has been identified in both European and Asian populations, highlighting its global clinical significance (Wang2024ZCCHC8).

ZCCHC8 dysfunction is also linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Complete loss of ZCCHC8 in knockout models results in severe neurodevelopmental defects, including cranial deformities and hydrocephalus, due to defective RNA processing (Gable2019ZCCHC8). These findings underscore the gene's critical role in maintaining RNA stability and processing, with mutations leading to diverse clinical phenotypes.

## Interactions
ZCCHC8 is a component of the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, where it interacts with RBM7 and hMTR4. This complex is crucial for directing non-coding RNAs for degradation by the RNA exosome. ZCCHC8 acts as a bridging factor between RBM7 and hMTR4, facilitating the degradation of various RNA substrates, including LINE1 RNAs (Falk2016Structure; Wu2019Nuclear). The interaction between ZCCHC8 and RBM7 is characterized by a proline-rich segment of ZCCHC8 binding to the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) of RBM7, forming a stable architectural unit within the NEXT complex (Falk2016Structure).

ZCCHC8 also interacts with the RNA exosome to target specific RNAs for exonucleolytic activity, which is crucial for the maturation of telomerase RNA (TR) and other low abundance RNA polymerase II transcripts (Gable2019ZCCHC8). The interaction between ZCCHC8 and the RNA exosome is essential for the 3' end processing of RNAs, including replication-dependent histone (RDH) and cilia components (Gable2019ZCCHC8).

Mutational analysis has shown that specific substitutions in ZCCHC8 and RBM7 significantly weaken their interaction, highlighting the importance of hydrophobic contacts in their binding interface (Falk2016Structure). These interactions underscore ZCCHC8's role in RNA processing pathways and its involvement in maintaining proper RNA metabolism.
