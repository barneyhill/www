# SCYL3

## Overview
SCYL3 (SCY1 like pseudokinase 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle for protein processing and trafficking within cells. The protein encoded by SCYL3 is categorized as a pseudokinase, which means it resembles kinases but lacks catalytic activity. Despite this, SCYL3 plays a significant role in maintaining the organization and function of the trans-Golgi network, influencing cellular homeostasis and protein secretion (Chia2012RNAi). It is involved in intracellular trafficking processes and interacts with components of the COPI coatomer complex, essential for vesicle formation and transport (Witkos2019GORAB). SCYL3's unique functions, distinct from related proteins like Scyl1, underscore its importance in cellular transport mechanisms and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis, particularly in cancer (Witkos2019GORAB).

## Structure


## Function
SCYL3 (SCY1 like pseudokinase 3) is involved in the regulation of the Golgi apparatus, particularly affecting its morphology and function. It plays a role in maintaining the organization of the trans-Golgi network, as evidenced by its impact on Golgi morphology when perturbed. Specifically, SCYL3 knockdown results in a diffuse trans-Golgi phenotype, suggesting its involvement in the organization and maintenance of Golgi structure (Chia2012RNAi). SCYL3 is part of a larger signaling network that regulates glycosylation processes and Golgi homeostasis, indicating its importance in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking (Chia2012RNAi).

SCYL3 is also implicated in intracellular trafficking processes, sharing some functional redundancy with Scyl1, particularly in neurons. However, unlike Scyl1, SCYL3 does not interact with GORAB, suggesting distinct roles in COPI-mediated trafficking at the trans-Golgi (Witkos2019GORAB). This distinction highlights SCYL3's unique function in cellular transport mechanisms, separate from the GORAB-Scyl1 complex that is crucial for COPI recruitment (Witkos2019GORAB). Overall, SCYL3 contributes to the regulation of protein transport and Golgi apparatus function, influencing cellular homeostasis and protein secretion.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the SCYL3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. SCYL3 is involved in critical cellular processes such as protein trafficking and signal transduction, and disruptions in these functions can contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. Changes in the interactions of SCYL3 can affect cellular homeostasis, potentially leading to disease pathogenesis. The gene's role in cancer suggests that it may influence the behavior of tumor cells, possibly affecting their growth and spread. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which SCYL3 mutations or expression changes contribute to these processes is an area of ongoing research.

## Interactions
SCYL3 (SCY1 like pseudokinase 3) is known to interact with components of the COPI coatomer complex, which is essential for vesicle formation and transport within cells. This interaction suggests a role for SCYL3 in protein trafficking processes. Although SCYL3 and Scyl1 both bind to COPI, they have distinct roles, as SCYL3 does not bind to GORAB, unlike Scyl1, indicating a unique function for SCYL3 in cellular processes (Witkos2019GORAB).

In a study investigating potential binding targets of doxorubicin, SCYL3 was identified as one of the proteins that interact with the drug. The study used a protein microarray approach and found that SCYL3 had a significant signal-to-noise ratio, indicating a potential interaction with doxorubicin (Wang2021A). This interaction highlights SCYL3's involvement in drug binding, which may have implications for its role in cellular signaling pathways and therapeutic applications. 

Overall, SCYL3's interactions with the COPI complex and doxorubicin suggest its involvement in critical cellular processes, including protein trafficking and drug interactions, warranting further investigation into its specific functions and mechanisms.
