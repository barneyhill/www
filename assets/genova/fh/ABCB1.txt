# ABCB1

## Overview
The ABCB1 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (P-glycoprotein), a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the transport of various substrates across cellular membranes. As a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, P-glycoprotein utilizes the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to efflux a wide range of compounds, including drugs, lipids, and xenobiotics, thereby contributing to cellular detoxification and multidrug resistance (Mizutani2008Genuine; Choudhuri2006Structure). This protein is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the liver, kidney, intestine, and blood-brain barrier, where it serves a protective function by limiting the intracellular accumulation of potentially harmful substances (Choudhuri2006Structure). The clinical significance of ABCB1 is underscored by its involvement in drug resistance mechanisms in cancer and other diseases, where genetic polymorphisms can influence therapeutic outcomes (Wu2012Roles; Jamroziak2004Pharmacogenomics).

## Structure
The ABCB1 protein, also known as P-glycoprotein, is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. It is composed of 1,280 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 170 kDa (Jones2004The; Choudhuri2006Structure). The primary structure of ABCB1 includes two homologous halves, each containing six transmembrane (TM) segments and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) (Sharom2006Shedding). These TM segments are alpha-helices that span the membrane, forming a total of 12 transmembrane segments (Choudhuri2006Structure).

The secondary structure involves these alpha-helical transmembrane domains, which create a channel for substrate translocation (Jones2004The). The tertiary structure is characterized by a funnel-shaped aqueous chamber formed by the transmembrane domains, which opens towards the extracellular compartment and is closed at the intracellular end (Sarkadi2006Human). The quaternary structure of ABCB1 is typically monomeric, with each NBD being C-terminal to each TMD (Jones2004The; Rosenberg2001Repacking).

ABCB1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is common among proteins in this family (Sharom2006Shedding). The protein's structure facilitates its role in drug transport and multidrug resistance, particularly in cancer cells (Jones2004The).

## Function
The ABCB1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a crucial efflux transporter in healthy human cells. P-gp is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and functions by using energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport a wide range of substrates across cellular membranes. This includes drugs, xenobiotics, lipids, and cytokines, contributing to the body's defense against potentially harmful substances (Mizutani2008Genuine; Choudhuri2006Structure).

P-gp is expressed in various tissues, including the intestine, liver, kidney, blood-brain barrier, and placenta, where it plays a protective role by pumping out toxins and xenobiotics, thus contributing to drug resistance (Mizutani2008Genuine; Choudhuri2006Structure). In the intestine, P-gp limits the bioavailability of orally administered drugs by transporting them back into the intestinal lumen (Wu2015Interindividual).

In addition to its role in drug transport, P-gp is involved in lipid translocation, such as sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide, across the plasma membrane, and is implicated in cholesterol metabolism (Mizutani2008Genuine). It also plays a role in immune function by transporting cytokines like IL-1 and IL-2 from activated lymphocytes (Mizutani2008Genuine). These functions highlight P-gp's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from toxic insults.

## Clinical Significance
The ABCB1 gene, also known as MDR1 or P-glycoprotein, plays a significant role in drug resistance across various diseases. In epilepsy, the C3435T polymorphism in the ABCB1 gene is associated with multidrug resistance, potentially due to its influence on the blood-brain barrier and drug transport capacity (Siddiqui2003Association). In cancer, ABCB1 polymorphisms, such as C3435T and G2677T/A, have been linked to altered drug response and resistance. These polymorphisms can affect P-glycoprotein expression and function, impacting chemotherapy outcomes in conditions like breast carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia (Wu2012Roles; Jamroziak2004Pharmacogenomics).

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the 3435TT genotype has been associated with increased infectious complications, while the 1199G>A variant correlates with higher relapse rates in high-risk patients (Ankathil2017&lt; em&gt; ABCB1&lt). The gene's expression is also linked to multidrug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia, affecting the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Loscocco2021Clinical). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ABCB1 in influencing drug resistance and treatment outcomes across various diseases.

## Interactions
The ABCB1 protein, also known as P-glycoprotein, participates in several significant interactions with other proteins, which influence its function as a drug efflux transporter. One of the key interactions involves the linker domain of ABCB1, which binds to α- and β-tubulins. This interaction is mediated by specific sequences within the linker domain, and the binding has been confirmed through N-terminal sequencing and Western blot analysis (Georges2007The). The interaction with tubulin suggests a role in cellular processes related to the cytoskeleton.

ABCB1 also interacts with regulatory proteins involved in auxin transport, such as the serine-threonine kinase PINOID (PID) and the protein TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1). PID phosphorylates the ABCB1 linker domain, particularly at the S634 residue, which affects auxin transport activity. This phosphorylation can either enhance or inhibit ABCB1 activity, depending on the presence of TWD1 (Henrichs2012Regulation). The interaction between ABCB1, PID, and TWD1 is crucial for the regulation of auxin efflux, and it can be modulated by kinase inhibitors like quercetin (Henrichs2012Regulation). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing ABCB1's function in cellular transport processes.
