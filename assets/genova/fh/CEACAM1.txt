# CEACAM1

## Overview
Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a gene that encodes the CEA cell adhesion molecule 1, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family. This protein is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like structure and is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including immune regulation, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis. CEACAM1 is expressed in multiple alternatively spliced isoforms, which differ in their cytoplasmic domains, influencing their functional roles in signaling pathways. The protein plays a critical role in modulating immune responses, acting as a co-inhibitory molecule in T cells and B cells, and is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and cell migration. CEACAM1's interactions with other proteins, such as integrins and phosphatases, further underscore its importance in cellular signaling and immune modulation. Alterations in CEACAM1 expression have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer, where it can function as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter of metastasis, depending on the context (Gray-Owen2006CEACAM1:; Ebrahimnejad2000Cell; Kim2019CEACAM1).

## Structure
The CEACAM1 protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, characterized by its immunoglobulin-like structure. It is expressed in 12 alternatively spliced isoforms, each containing an N-terminal immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain, followed by up to three type 2 constant immunoglobulin (IgC2) ectodomains, a transmembrane sequence, and a cytoplasmic domain that can be either long or short (Gandhi2022Structural; Kim2019CEACAM1). The IgV domain, crucial for ligand binding, consists of 108 amino acids arranged in nine beta strands forming an anti-parallel beta-sandwich structure (Kim2019CEACAM1). 

The protein's quaternary structure involves the formation of cis dimers and trans interactions, essential for its signaling functions (Kim2019CEACAM1). The GFCC' face of the IgV domain is critical for homophilic and heterophilic interactions, facilitating dimerization and oligomerization (Gandhi2021Structural). CEACAM1 is heavily glycosylated, particularly on the ABED surface, which influences its interactions and function (Kim2019CEACAM1; Gandhi2021Structural). The long cytoplasmic domain contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are absent in the short form, playing a role in immune regulation (Kim2019CEACAM1).

## Function
CEACAM1 (CEA cell adhesion molecule 1) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in immune regulation, acting as a co-inhibitory molecule in T cells and B cells. In T cells, CEACAM1-L isoforms inhibit signaling pathways downstream of the TCR-CD3 complex, mediated by interactions with SHP1, a phosphatase that reduces phosphorylation of key signaling molecules like JNK and ERK1 (Gray-Owen2006CEACAM1:). In B cells, CEACAM1 inhibits BCR-induced calcium mobilization, crucial for B cell activation (Gray-Owen2006CEACAM1:).

CEACAM1 also plays a role in angiogenesis and cell adhesion. In endothelial cells, it acts as a potent angiogenic factor and a major effector of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Ebrahimnejad2000Cell). The protein's cytoplasmic domain, when tyrosine-phosphorylated, interacts with cytoskeletal proteins such as paxillin, vinculin, and talin, which are essential for maintaining cell structure and function (Ebrahimnejad2000Cell).

CEACAM1 is involved in modulating immune responses, influencing both innate and adaptive immunity. It inhibits NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and affects the expression of NKG2D ligands on tumor cells, thereby regulating immune cell activity (Kim2019CEACAM1).

## Clinical Significance
CEACAM1 (CEA cell adhesion molecule 1) plays a significant role in various diseases, particularly cancer, due to its involvement in cell adhesion, immune modulation, and angiogenesis. Alterations in CEACAM1 expression are linked to cancer progression and metastasis. In colorectal cancer, CEACAM1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression downregulated in early stages, but elevated in high-grade adenomas and metastatic stages, indicating a bimodal role (Calinescu2018On; Song2010Genetic). In prostate cancer, CEACAM1 downregulation correlates with increased malignancy and is significant during the transition from Gleason grade 3 to grade 4 (Busch2002Downregulation).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CEACAM1 expression is higher in tumors than in normal tissue, correlating with disease severity and reduced survival (Calinescu2018On). CEACAM1's role in immune regulation is also crucial, as its expression on T cells is associated with T cell exhaustion, impacting anti-tumor immunity (Kim2019CEACAM1). Additionally, CEACAM1 is involved in angiogenesis, with its expression in endothelial cells promoting vascular remodeling and tumor invasion (OliveiraFerrer2004Dual; Leung2006Deletion). These alterations in CEACAM1 expression and function highlight its clinical significance in cancer and other diseases.

## Interactions
CEACAM1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cell adhesion, signaling, and immune modulation. It associates with integrin β3, a relationship dependent on the phosphorylation of the Tyr-488 residue in CEACAM1's cytoplasmic domain. This interaction is crucial for processes like cell migration and tumor invasion, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and colocalization studies in granulocytes and epithelial cells (Brümmer2001cis).

CEACAM1 also binds to paxillin, a cytoskeletal protein, through its phosphorylated Tyr-488 residue. This interaction is specific and has been confirmed in granulocytes, HT29 cells, and HUVECs, suggesting a role in cell adhesion and signaling (Ebrahimnejad2000Cell).

The protein interacts with β-catenin, with key residues H469 and K470 in CEACAM1's cytoplasmic domain being critical for this binding. This interaction influences β-catenin's transcriptional activity, impacting cell growth regulation (Jin2008Direct).

CEACAM1 also forms homodimers and heterodimers with other CEACAM family members and interacts with SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, which are involved in immune signaling and modulation (Gray-Owen2006CEACAM1:; Kim2019CEACAM1).
