# CFAP251

## Overview
The CFAP251 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 251, a crucial component of the axonemal structure in sperm flagella. This protein is categorized as a member of the WD-repeat protein family, characterized by its 14 WD-domain repeats that facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for the assembly and function of flagellar structures. CFAP251 is predominantly expressed in the testis and plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and motility of sperm flagella, which is critical for male fertility. Mutations in the CFAP251 gene are linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), conditions that can lead to male infertility due to impaired sperm motility (Auguste2018Loss; Li2018Biallelic). The protein's involvement in the calmodulin-and radial-spoke-associated complex further underscores its importance in flagellar function and stability (Auguste2018Loss).

## Structure
The CFAP251 protein, encoded by the CFAP251 gene, is integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella. It consists of 1149 amino acids and is specific to the testis (Li2018Biallelic). The protein contains 14 WD-domain repeats (WDR), which are characterized by a conserved Trp-Asp dipeptide and are involved in protein-protein interactions (Li2018Biallelic; Wang2022Successful). Among these, nine are WD-40 repeat domains, and there is a calcium-binding EF-hand domain at the carboxy-terminal extremity, crucial for flagellar structure and function (Wang2022Successful).

The CFAP251 protein also features a large N-terminal Glu-rich domain, which is most pronounced in eutherian mammals (Auguste2018Loss). This domain is likely removed during sperm maturation, resulting in a spermatozoa-specific isoform of approximately 100 kDa (Auguste2018Loss). The protein is part of a calmodulin-and radial-spoke-associated complex necessary for efficient flagellar beating and motility (Auguste2018Loss). While specific post-translational modifications and detailed structural information are not extensively documented, the protein's role in the axonemal structure of flagella is well-established (Li2018Biallelic).

## Function
The CFAP251 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for the structure and function of sperm flagella in healthy human cells. This protein is specifically expressed in the testis and is involved in the proper morphology and motility of sperm. CFAP251 is associated with the axonemal structure of flagella, which is essential for sperm motility, contributing to the structural integrity and function of sperm flagella (Li2018Biallelic; Wang2022Successful). 

CFAP251 contains 14 WD-domain repeats, which are part of the WDR protein family known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are vital for the assembly of protein complexes or mediating transient interactions among other proteins (Li2018Biallelic). The protein is primarily located at the sperm flagella, playing a significant role in flagellar assembly and function (Wang2022Successful).

In model organisms like Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the ortholog of CFAP251 is a component of the cilium and is involved in signal transduction between the central pair of microtubules and inner dynein arms, suggesting a similar role in human sperm flagella (Li2018Biallelic). This highlights the importance of CFAP251 in maintaining normal flagellar function and its impact on fertility.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP251 gene are associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), a condition that leads to male infertility. This disorder is characterized by defects in sperm flagella, resulting in immotile spermatozoa that lack mitochondria, which are crucial for energy production and motility (Li2018Biallelic; Auguste2018Loss). Biallelic mutations in CFAP251, including nonsense and frameshift mutations, lead to premature translational termination or alternate splicing, causing reduced mRNA and protein expression. These mutations result in various flagellar abnormalities, such as absent, short, coiled, bent, and irregular-caliber flagella (Li2018Biallelic; Wang2022Successful).

The CFAP251 gene is also implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition characterized by defects in ciliary function, which shares structural similarities with sperm flagella (Auguste2018Loss). The gene's role in flagellar biogenesis is critical, and its absence can lead to significant reproductive issues, including asthenozoospermia, a condition marked by reduced sperm motility (Auguste2018Loss). Assisted reproductive technologies, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), have been used successfully to achieve pregnancy in patients with CFAP251 mutations (Wang2022Successful).

## Interactions
CFAP251, also known as WDR66, is a protein involved in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella. It is part of the WD-repeat protein family, which is known for forming platforms for protein complex assembly and mediating protein-protein interactions. CFAP251 contains 14 WD-domain repeats, which are highly conserved and play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of flagella (Li2018Biallelic).

In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the ortholog of CFAP251, known as FAP251, is a component of the cilium associated with radial spokes. These structures are essential for signal transduction between microtubules and dynein arms in the axoneme, suggesting that CFAP251 may interact with similar components in humans to maintain flagellar function (Li2018Biallelic).

CFAP251 is also associated with the calmodulin-associated and spoke-associated complex (CSC) in human sperm cells. It interacts closely with CFAP91, another component of the CSC, which is crucial for flagellar motility. The absence of CFAP251 in sperm cells from patients with MAATS1 variants indicates a close interaction between CFAP91 and CFAP251 within the CSC, highlighting its role in radial spoke assembly and stability (Martinez2020Biallelic).
