# CTSH

## Overview
The CTSH gene encodes cathepsin H, a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays a critical role in protein turnover and cellular homeostasis. As a member of the C1 protease family, cathepsin H is primarily characterized by its aminopeptidase activity, although it also exhibits limited endopeptidase activity. The enzyme is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme, which undergoes activation through proteolytic cleavage. Structurally, cathepsin H features a papain-like fold with a V-shaped active site cleft, and its activity is modulated by a unique mini-chain derived from its prodomain. Cathepsin H is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of bone morphogenetic protein gene expression and protection of insulin-secreting cells from apoptosis. It also participates in pathological conditions such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and type 1 diabetes, where its expression and activity are altered (Hao2018Crystal; Fløyel2020The; Stoka2023The).

## Structure
Cathepsin H (CTSH) is a lysosomal cysteine protease with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of CTSH includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, and the mature enzyme. The secondary structure is characterized by a combination of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a papain-like fold typical of the C1 protease family (Hao2018Crystal; Ketterer2017Inherited).

The tertiary structure of CTSH reveals a mature domain with a mostly α-helical left subdomain and a mostly β-sheet right subdomain, which together form an active site cleft containing the catalytic residues Cys26, His166, and Asn186 (Hao2018Crystal). The structure also includes an N-terminal prodomain and a C-terminal mature domain, linked by a disulfide bridge between Cys212 and the mini-chain Cys80P (Hao2018Crystal).

CTSH undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at Asn79P on the mini-chain and Asn115 on the mature domain (Hao2018Crystal). The mini-chain, derived from the prodomain, plays a crucial role in regulating the enzyme's activity by hindering access to the catalytic site (Ketterer2017Inherited). The dynamic nature of the mini-chain allows it to reorient during activation, which is essential for the enzyme's function (Hao2018Crystal).

## Function
Cathepsin H (CTSH) is a lysosomal cysteine protease that primarily functions as an aminopeptidase, with limited endopeptidase activity, in healthy human cells. It is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme, procathepsin H, which requires activation through the removal of its prodomain. This activation is facilitated by other proteases, such as cathepsin L, as procathepsin H is not capable of autoactivation (Hao2018Crystal). The enzyme is characterized by a two-domain structure with a V-shaped active site cleft, and its activity is regulated by the presence of a mini-chain, an octapeptide from the prodomain that remains bound through a disulfide bond, essential for its aminopeptidase function (Turk2001NEW; Dickinson2002Cysteine).

CTSH is involved in the regulation of protein turnover and processing within lysosomes, contributing to cellular homeostasis. It plays a role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) gene expression, which is crucial for the development of organs and tissues (Rojnik2011Cathepsin). CTSH is also implicated in protecting insulin-secreting cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Fløyel2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CTSH gene have been implicated in several diseases. Inherited myopia, particularly a severe form with refractive errors greater than -6 diopters, has been linked to mutations in the CTSH gene. A specific case involved a 1-year-old boy with severe myopia due to a homozygous deletion in the CTSH gene, leading to a truncated protein and reduced mRNA levels, suggesting recessive inheritance (Ketterer2017Inherited).

CTSH is also associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Alterations in CTSH expression, influenced by genetic and environmental factors through differential DNA methylation, have been linked to T1D risk. High CTSH expression correlates with rapid beta-cell function decline, while pro-inflammatory cytokines downregulate CTSH, promoting beta-cell apoptosis. This downregulation is linked to DNA hypermethylation, reducing promoter activity and CTSH transcription (Ye2021Genetic).

In atopic dermatitis (AD), CTSH plays a role in skin barrier function. Loss of CTSH inhibits filaggrin processing, crucial for maintaining the epidermal barrier, leading to a pro-inflammatory environment. This disruption is linked to increased macrophage numbers and mast cell degranulation, contributing to AD progression (Naeem2017A).

CTSH is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where its overexpression in reactive astrocytes and microglial cells may be associated with a reaction against misfolded proteins (Fukada2007Gene; Stoka2023The).

## Interactions
Cathepsin H (CTSH) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. It primarily acts as an aminopeptidase, a function attributed to an octapeptide 'mini-chain' that is disulphide-linked to the enzyme's main structure. This mini-chain is crucial for its aminopeptidase activity, as its absence results in the enzyme exhibiting only endopeptidase activity (Stoka2023The). 

CTSH is also known to interact with other proteins in the context of disease processes. In cancer, CTSH regulates the processing of talin, a focal adhesion protein, which promotes prostate cancer cell progression by modulating integrin activation and adhesion strength (Stoka2023The). In neurodegenerative diseases, CTSH is released by activated microglia in response to protein aggregates such as amyloid-β and α-Synuclein, contributing to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Stoka2023The).

In the context of type 1 diabetes, CTSH overexpression in insulin-secreting cells has been shown to protect against cytokine-induced apoptosis. This protective effect is partially mediated through the upregulation of Rac2, a GTPase involved in apoptosis regulation (Fløyel2020The). These interactions highlight CTSH's role in modulating cellular responses to stress and its involvement in disease pathogenesis.
