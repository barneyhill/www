# NMRK2

## Overview
NMRK2, or nicotinamide riboside kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a kinase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a vital cofactor in cellular metabolism. The protein product of NMRK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of nicotinamide riboside (NR) to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor in the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway. This enzymatic activity is particularly significant in skeletal muscle tissue, where it supports muscle metabolism and regeneration, especially under conditions of metabolic stress or injury (Fletcher2018The; Sonntag2022Nicotinamide). NMRK2 is also implicated in cardiac function, interacting with integrin proteins to maintain structural integrity and contributing to NAD+ homeostasis in myocardial tissues (Tannous2021NMRK2). Alterations in NMRK2 expression have been linked to cardiac conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tannous2021NMRK2; Diguet2018Nicotinamide).

## Function
NMRK2, or nicotinamide riboside kinase 2, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway by phosphorylating nicotinamide riboside (NR) to produce nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is subsequently converted to NAD+ by NMNAT. This process is essential for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and supporting various cellular functions, including DNA repair and regulation of circadian rhythms (Fletcher2017Nicotinamide; Fletcher2018The).

NMRK2 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue, where it is involved in muscle metabolism and regeneration. It is particularly active in type IIx muscle fibers, which are fast-twitch fibers associated with rapid and powerful movements (Sonntag2022Nicotinamide). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the efficient utilization of dietary NR as a precursor for NAD+ in muscle cells, contributing to muscle plasticity and adaptation during metabolic stress or injury (Fletcher2018The; Sonntag2022Nicotinamide).

In healthy muscle cells, NMRK2 is not essential for maintaining basal NAD+ levels, as other pathways like NAMPT can compensate for its absence. However, NMRK2 becomes more relevant under conditions of metabolic stress or when exogenous NR is available, highlighting its role in adaptive responses and muscle regeneration (Fletcher2017Nicotinamide; Fletcher2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NMRK2 gene are associated with several cardiac conditions, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure (HF). In mouse models of DCM, NMRK2 is upregulated as an early response to cardiac stress, suggesting its role in cardiac remodeling and adaptation to energy stress (Tannous2021NMRK2; Diguet2018Nicotinamide). This upregulation is also observed in human failing hearts, indicating a potential compensatory mechanism for maintaining NAD+ homeostasis when the NAMPT pathway is repressed (Tannous2021NMRK2; Diguet2018Nicotinamide).

NMRK2 deficiency in mice leads to progressive cardiac dysfunction and remodeling, characterized by eccentric cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, particularly under conditions of pressure overload or aging (Tannous2021NMRK2). These structural changes are linked to defects in laminin deposition and integrin signaling, which are crucial for maintaining cardiac integrity (Tannous2021NMRK2).

The gene's involvement in NAD+ biosynthesis and integrin signaling suggests that targeting NMRK2 could offer therapeutic potential for treating DCM and related cardiac dysfunctions, as it plays a critical role in maintaining cardiac function and structure during stress and aging (Tannous2021NMRK2).

## Interactions
Nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. NMRK2, also known as Muscle Integrin Binding Protein (MIBP), interacts with the integrin α7/β1 heterodimer, a receptor for laminin in muscle cells. This interaction is significant for maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and is associated with the phosphorylation of paxillin, a process that influences laminin deposition (Tannous2021NMRK2).

NMRK2 also plays a role in the NAD+ salvage pathway, where it is involved in the conversion of nicotinamide riboside to NAD+, a critical cofactor in cellular metabolism. This pathway is particularly important in maintaining myocardial NAD levels during aging, as NMRK2 expression is crucial for this process (Tannous2021NMRK2). The enzyme's interactions with integrin and laminin proteins suggest its involvement in maintaining cardiac structure and function, potentially through its role in NAD+ biosynthesis and cellular energy homeostasis (Tannous2021NMRK2). These interactions highlight NMRK2's importance in both structural and metabolic processes within muscle tissues.
