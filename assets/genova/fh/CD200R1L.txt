# CD200R1L

## Overview
CD200R1L is a gene that encodes the CD200 receptor 1-like protein, which is a member of the CD200 receptor family. This protein functions as an activating receptor primarily expressed on human neutrophils, a type of white blood cell crucial for the immune response. As a transmembrane receptor, CD200R1L plays a significant role in the activation of neutrophils, facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), which are essential for the body's defense mechanisms against pathogens (Pascoal2021CD200R1L). The receptor's activity is mediated through a signaling cascade involving key proteins such as Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk), PI3 kinase (PI3K), Akt, and Rac GTPase, highlighting its importance in immune signaling pathways (Pascoal2021CD200R1L). CD200R1L's expression and function have been linked to various immune-related conditions and diseases, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Function
The CD200R1L gene encodes a protein that functions as an activating receptor in human neutrophils, a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response. This receptor is part of the CD200 receptor family and is involved in activating cellular functions such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through signaling pathways involving Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk), PI3 kinase (PI3K), Akt, and Rac GTPase (Pascoal2021CD200R1L). The activation of CD200R1L leads to ROS production, which is crucial for the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils (Pascoal2021CD200R1L).

CD200R1L is expressed on CD16+ neutrophils, and its expression levels can vary between individuals. When cross-linked with antibodies, CD200R1L significantly increases ROS production and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion, indicating its role in promoting an oxidative burst and cytokine secretion, which are essential for the immune response (Pascoal2021CD200R1L). The receptor also plays a role in the release of extracellular traps (NETs) from neutrophils, although this effect is less pronounced compared to other stimuli (Pascoal2021CD200R1L). These functions suggest that CD200R1L is integral to the activation and function of neutrophils, contributing to the body's defense against pathogens.

## Clinical Significance
The CD200R1L gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in immune response modulation. Alterations in CD200R1L expression have been associated with an increased risk of developing psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and helminth infections, suggesting its involvement in these immune-related conditions (Pascoal2021CD200R1L). In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, CD200R1L is differentially expressed in Huntington's disease, particularly in microglia-enriched genes, indicating its potential role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Sneha2023Investigating).

The gene is also part of a recurrent 3q13.2-q13.31 microdeletion associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including cognitive and motor delays, language problems, and behavioral disorders such as autism and anxiety (Quintela2015Female). In cancer, CD200R1L expression is negatively correlated with risk scores in esophageal carcinoma, suggesting a potential link to immune regulation and response to immunotherapy (Han2024Novel). These associations highlight the clinical significance of CD200R1L in various diseases, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its role in pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CD200R1L is a protein expressed on human neutrophils and is part of the CD200 receptor family. It functions as an activating receptor and is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a signaling cascade. This cascade involves several key proteins, including Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk), PI3 kinase (PI3K), Akt, and Rac GTPase. Inhibition of these molecules reduces CD200R1L-induced ROS production, indicating their role in the signaling pathway (Pascoal2021CD200R1L).

The receptor's surface expression is stabilized by the adapter protein DAP12, suggesting a potential interaction between CD200R1L and DAP12. This interaction is necessary for proper surface expression in transfected cells, although direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been explicitly detailed (Pascoal2021CD200R1L).

CD200R1L's evolutionary history indicates it has undergone faster mutation rates compared to its inhibitory counterpart, CD200R1, likely due to pathogenic pressures. This suggests that CD200R1L may have adapted to interact with various immune signaling pathways to enhance immune responses (Pascoal2021CD200R1L).
