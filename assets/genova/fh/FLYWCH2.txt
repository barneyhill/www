# FLYWCH2

## Overview
FLYWCH2 is a gene that encodes the protein FLYWCH family member 2, which is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation. The protein is characterized by its role in transcriptional regulation, potentially acting as a transcription factor due to its involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene expression pathways. FLYWCH family member 2 has been implicated in several biological contexts, such as cardiac electrophysiology and neurodevelopment, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological and pathological conditions. The gene's expression and function are influenced by epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, which can impact its role in disease states, including neuroendocrine tumors and developmental disorders (Adriaens2018Systems; Nelson2011Multiple; Waterfield2023Chromosome; C2021The).

## Clinical Significance
FLYWCH2 has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in gene expression and cellular processes. In cardiac electrophysiology, FLYWCH2 is part of a gene network correlated with the QTc interval in rats, suggesting a potential association with cardiac electrophysiological traits in humans (Adriaens2018Systems). In the context of neurodevelopment, FLYWCH2 is involved in the development of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) neurons in the mouse hypothalamus, where it is regulated by the histone methyltransferase Mll4 and the transcription factor Nrf1 (C2021The). 

FLYWCH2 has also been studied in relation to small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (siNETs) with chromosome 18 loss of heterozygosity (18LOH). It was identified as having promoter-associated differentially methylated positions that inversely correlate with its expression levels, indicating a regulatory role of DNA methylation in its expression (Waterfield2023Chromosome). In a case study of a boy with multiple congenital anomalies and developmental delay, FLYWCH2 was part of a chromosomal deletion, although its specific clinical significance was not detailed (Nelson2011Multiple). These findings suggest that alterations in FLYWCH2 expression or interactions may contribute to various diseases and developmental disorders.
