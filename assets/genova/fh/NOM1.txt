# NOM1

## Overview
NOM1 is a gene located on human chromosome 7q36, encoding the nucleolar protein with MIF4G domain 1. This protein is primarily involved in the biogenesis of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a critical process for ribosome assembly and function in human cells. The NOM1 protein is characterized by the presence of MIF4G and MA3 domains, which facilitate its interaction with the eIF4A family of DEAD-box RNA helicases, particularly eIF4AIII. These interactions are essential for the processing of pre-rRNA into mature 18S rRNA, underscoring NOM1's role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular proliferation. The evolutionary conservation of NOM1's function from yeast to humans highlights its fundamental importance in cellular biology (Alexandrov2011Human; Simmons2005Identification).

## Structure
The NOM1 protein is a nucleolar protein encoded by the human NOM1 gene, located within the chromosome 7q36 breakpoint region associated with pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (Simmons2005Identification). The protein is composed of 860 amino acids and includes two key domains: the MIF4G and MA3 domains. These domains are crucial for its function, serving as binding sites for the eIF4A family of DEAD-box RNA helicases, which are involved in translation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Alexandrov2011Human; Simmons2005Identification).

The primary structure of NOM1 includes a basic amino terminus and an acidic region, with a highly similar carboxy terminal region that contains the MIF4G and MA3 domains (Simmons2005Identification). The secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the available context, but the presence of these domains suggests a conserved folding pattern that facilitates interaction with eIF4A proteins (Alexandrov2011Human).

NOM1 is known to localize predominantly to the nucleolus, similar to its yeast homolog Sgd1p, indicating a conserved function across species (Simmons2005Identification). The protein's interaction with eIF4AIII is essential for 18S rRNA biogenesis, highlighting its role in ribosome biogenesis (Alexandrov2011Human). The context does not provide specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
NOM1 is a nucleolar protein involved in the biogenesis of 18S rRNA, a critical component of ribosome assembly in human cells. It interacts with eIF4AIII, forming a complex that is essential for the proper processing of pre-rRNA into mature 18S rRNA. This interaction is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular biology (Alexandrov2011Human). NOM1's function in rRNA processing is distinct from the translation initiation role of eIF4G, with which eIF4A interacts in other contexts (Alexandrov2011Human).

NOM1 localizes predominantly to the nucleolus, where it participates in early stages of rRNA processing. Its interaction with eIF4AIII is crucial for the formation of 41S and 21S pre-RNAs, and its knockdown results in decreased levels of mature 18S rRNA, indicating defects in rRNA processing (Alexandrov2011Human). The presence of MIF4G and MA3 domains in NOM1 suggests its involvement in translation regulation and cell growth, as these domains are known to play roles in these processes (Simmons2005Identification). NOM1's activity in the nucleolus and its interactions with eIF4A family members underscore its importance in maintaining efficient ribosome production and cellular proliferation (Simmons2005Identification).

## Interactions
The human gene NOM1 encodes a nucleolar protein that interacts with members of the eIF4A family of DEAD-box RNA helicases. NOM1 has been shown to interact with eIF4A1, eIF4A2, and eIF4A3. These interactions are mediated by the MIF4G and MA3 domains of NOM1, which serve as binding sites for eIF4A isoforms (Simmons2005Identification). The interaction with eIF4A1 was confirmed in vivo through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in 293 HEK cells, where eIF4A1 was detected only when both NOM1 and eIF4A1 were co-transfected (Simmons2005Identification).

NOM1 also interacts with eIF4AIII, a protein involved in 18S rRNA biogenesis. This interaction is evolutionarily conserved and distinct from the exon junction complex. NOM1 copurifies with eIF4AIII from human cell nuclear extracts, indicating a strong interaction without the need for cross-linking (Alexandrov2011Human). The interaction between NOM1 and eIF4AIII is crucial for rRNA processing, as knockdown of NOM1 results in decreased formation of mature 18S rRNA (Alexandrov2011Human). NOM1 is also associated with ribosomal proteins, suggesting its role in preribosome assembly or rRNA processing (Alexandrov2011Human).
