# STAC3

## Overview
STAC3 is a gene that encodes the SH3 and cysteine-rich domain 3 protein, which is integral to the process of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscle cells. This protein is categorized as a cytosolic protein and is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue, where it plays a pivotal role in linking electrical signals to calcium release, thereby facilitating muscle contraction (Nelson2013Skeletal; Campiglio2017STAC3). The STAC3 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a polyglutamic acid region, a cysteine-rich C1 domain, and tandem SH3 domains, which are essential for its interaction with calcium channels, particularly the CaV1.1 channel (Nelson2013Skeletal; Rufenach2021Structure). Mutations in the STAC3 gene have been associated with congenital myopathies, such as Native American myopathy, underscoring its critical role in muscle function and development (Horstick2013Stac3).

## Structure
The STAC3 protein is a 364-residue, 41 kDa soluble protein predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, playing a critical role in excitation-contraction coupling (Rufenach2021Structure). Its molecular structure includes an N-terminal poly-Glu region, a cysteine-rich C1 domain, and tandem SH3 domains connected by intrinsically disordered regions (Rufenach2021Structure). The C1 domain is a lipid-binding module characterized by a typical fold with two Zn2+ ions coordinated by three cysteines and one histidine (Rufenach2021Structure). The SH3 domains are common protein-interaction modules composed of a five-stranded antiparallel beta sheet and a short 3_10 helix, forming a rigid unit due to extensive hydrophobic interactions (Rufenach2021Structure).

The tandem SH3 domains of STAC3 are crucial for binding to the II-III loop of the CaV1.1 channel, a key component in excitation-contraction coupling (Rufenach2020Multiple). The SH3 domains are connected by a short linker, and the protein's structure suggests a high degree of mobility between the C1 and tandem SH3 regions (Rufenach2021Structure). The protein is predicted to be phosphorylated at multiple serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (Yin2020Molecular).

## Function
STAC3 is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscle cells. This process links electrical signals to calcium release, facilitating muscle contraction. STAC3 is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and localizes to T-tubules, where it interacts with the voltage-sensor CaV1.1, forming a stable complex essential for EC coupling (Nelson2013Skeletal; Campiglio2017STAC3). The protein contains a polyglutamic acid region, a C1 domain, and two SH3 domains, which are important for its interaction with calcium channels (Nelson2013Skeletal).

STAC3 plays a critical role in modulating the properties of L-type calcium channels, such as CaV1.1, by reducing calcium-dependent inactivation, which is vital for maintaining proper calcium signaling in excitable cells (Rufenach2021Structure). It is involved in the trafficking of CaV1.1 to the plasma membrane, ensuring its proper expression and function in muscle cells (Rufenach2021Structure). The interaction of STAC3 with the II-III loop of CaV1.1 is crucial for EC coupling, and mutations in STAC3 can lead to congenital myopathy, highlighting its importance in muscle function (Rufenach2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STAC3 gene are linked to several congenital myopathies, most notably Native American myopathy (NAM). NAM is an autosomal recessive disorder primarily identified in the Lumbee Native American population. It is characterized by muscle weakness, susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, joint contractures, and facial dysmorphisms. A specific G4C missense mutation in the STAC3 gene, resulting in a tryptophan to serine substitution at amino acid 284, is causative for NAM (Horstick2013Stac3). This mutation impairs excitation-contraction coupling in muscles, leading to the myopathic symptoms observed in affected individuals (Horstick2013Stac3).

STAC3 mutations are also associated with congenital hypotonia and weakness in patients of Southern African ancestry, where the same p.Trp284Ser mutation is prevalent. This condition presents with prenatal signs like reduced fetal movements and neonatal respiratory distress, along with systemic abnormalities (Essop2024STAC3). Additionally, STAC3 variants have been identified in non-Native American families with features overlapping Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome and Moebius syndrome, indicating a broader clinical spectrum (Telegrafi2017Identification).

The STAC3 gene's role in excitation-contraction coupling is crucial, and its mutations can lead to impaired muscle function, as demonstrated in various animal models and human studies (Horstick2013Stac3).

## Interactions
STAC3 is a protein that plays a critical role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling by interacting with L-type calcium channels, particularly CaV1.1. This interaction is essential for the conversion of electrical signals into muscle contractions. STAC3 stably interacts with the CaV1.1 channel through its C1 domain, which is necessary for its association with L-type calcium channels (Campiglio2017STAC3). The C1 domain contains specific residues, V104 and Y133, that are crucial for the stable interaction with CaV1.1 and CaV1.2 channels (Campiglio2017STAC3).

STAC3 also interacts with the CaV1.1 II-III loop via its tandem SH3 domains, which are important for maintaining binding affinity and proper EC coupling (Rufenach2020Multiple). Mutations in these domains, such as W284S and F295L, can significantly affect binding affinity and disrupt EC coupling, highlighting the importance of these interactions (Rufenach2020Multiple).

STAC3 is part of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) complex in skeletal muscle triads, where it co-localizes with CaV1.1, β1a, and RyR1, indicating its role in the organization and function of these protein complexes (Campiglio2017STAC3).
