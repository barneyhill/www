# ITGB3BP

## Overview
ITGB3BP, or integrin subunit beta 3 binding protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell division, spindle apparatus assembly, and cellular communication. The protein, characterized by its N-terminal coiled-coil domain, is integral to protein-protein interactions and is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its function. ITGB3BP is a component of the centromere-specific complex, crucial for recruiting histone H3 to the centromere, thereby playing a vital role in chromosome segregation during cell division (Gresakova2019RETRACTED:). The protein is also implicated in cancer biology, particularly in mitotic progression and as a hub gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (Cai2020Identification; Fields2018Predictive). Additionally, ITGB3BP's expression levels have been associated with glioma progression, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Grabowicz2021The). The gene's involvement in diverse cellular functions and its clinical significance underscore its importance in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Structure
The ITGB3BP protein, or integrin subunit beta 3 binding protein, is characterized by its N-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions. This domain plays a significant role in the structural integrity and functional capabilities of the protein by enabling it to interact with integrin beta 3. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its function and influence its interaction with other cellular components. 

ITGB3BP exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can lead to variations in its structural and functional properties. These splice variants may result in differences in the protein's ability to interact with other molecules, potentially altering its role in cellular processes. The presence of these isoforms suggests a level of complexity in the regulation and function of ITGB3BP, as different isoforms may be expressed in response to specific cellular conditions or signals. 

Overall, the structural features of ITGB3BP, including its coiled-coil domain and the potential for post-translational modifications, highlight its importance in cellular interactions and regulatory mechanisms.

## Function
ITGB3BP, or integrin subunit beta 3 binding protein, plays a crucial role in cell division and spindle apparatus assembly. It is a member of the centromere-specific complex, which is essential for recruiting histone H3 to the centromere region, a process vital for proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Gresakova2019RETRACTED:). ITGB3BP interacts with proteins involved in spindle pole organization, such as Gpsm2, Eml1, and Svil, indicating its involvement in the establishment and functioning of spindle poles (Gresakova2019RETRACTED:).

In the context of cancer, ITGB3BP has been studied for its role in mitotic progression. Depletion of ITGB3BP in cancer stem cells results in a decreased mitotic index, suggesting its importance in mitotic processes (Fields2018Predictive). Although its specific function in healthy human cells is not detailed, ITGB3BP is known to be active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cytoskeletal organization and cellular communication. This protein is involved in gene expression regulation and may affect processes such as angiogenesis and immune responses, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular and organismal biology.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ITGB3BP gene have been associated with glioma progression and patient prognosis. In glioma, higher expression levels of ITGB3BP are linked to shorter survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker. This association indicates that changes in ITGB3BP expression or its interaction with enhancers may contribute to glioma progression (Grabowicz2021The).

In the context of lithium treatment in human neuronal cells, ITGB3BP is mentioned in relation to cell cycle and apoptosis. Although specific diseases or conditions directly associated with ITGB3BP are not detailed, the modulation of this gene by lithium suggests its involvement in broader neuronal functions and signaling processes. This modulation could have implications for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, although ITGB3BP is not directly linked to these conditions in the provided studies (Seelan2008Deciphering).

Overall, ITGB3BP's role in cancer, particularly glioma, and its modulation by therapeutic agents like lithium, highlights its clinical significance in disease progression and potential therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ITGB3BP, or integrin subunit beta 3 binding protein, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is known to interact with integrin beta 3, playing a role in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Hoskin1994Impact). In the context of hibernating brown bears, ITGB3BP undergoes isoform switching, which affects its interaction with nuclear hormone receptor dimers. This interaction is modulated by the presence of a C-terminal LXXIL motif during hibernation, which acts as a receptor-interaction domain (RID) (Tseng2021Longread).

In early embryonic development, ITGB3BP is part of a centromere-specific complex that recruits histone H3 to the centromere region, indicating its role in cell division processes such as spindle assembly and cytokinesis (Gresakova2021Dual). It is also identified as a putative interaction partner of Fam208a, a protein involved in spindle apparatus assembly and cell division regulation (Gresakova2021Dual).

In cancer research, ITGB3BP has been identified as a hub gene in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting its potential interactions with other proteins in a protein-protein interaction network (Cai2020Identification). These interactions highlight ITGB3BP's involvement in various cellular and physiological processes.
