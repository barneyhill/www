# CLDN7

## Overview
The CLDN7 gene encodes the protein claudin 7, a member of the claudin family, which is integral to the formation of tight junctions in epithelial cells. Claudin 7 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its four transmembrane helices and two extracellular loops, playing a crucial role in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and homeostasis (Ahlswede2022Human; Liu2016Systems). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for intestinal epithelial stem cell function and differentiation (Xing2020Tight). CLDN7's expression and function are context-dependent, acting as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer while exhibiting oncogenic properties in gastric cancer (Cherradi2019&lt; WU2018Claudin7; Claudin). Its role in disease and cellular interactions underscores its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions.

## Structure
Claudin-7 (CLDN7) is a member of the claudin family, characterized by its integral role in forming tight junctions in epithelial cells. The primary structure of CLDN7 consists of 211 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 22.4 kDa (Ahlswede2022Human). It features four transmembrane helices, with both the N- and C-termini located within the cytoplasm (Ahlswede2022Human; Liu2016Systems). The secondary structure includes α-helical transmembrane regions and β-sheet formations in the extracellular loops (Ahlswede2022Human; Suzuki2017Crystal).

The protein has two extracellular loops, with the first loop (ECL1) being larger and containing charged residues essential for paracellular pore formation (Liu2016Systems). The C-terminus of CLDN7 contains a PDZ domain binding motif, which is crucial for interactions with junction-associated proteins like ZO-1, -2, and -3 (Liu2016Systems).

CLDN7 can form various oligomeric structures, including monomers, hexamers, and higher-order oligomers, which are stabilized by specific cis-interactions involving residues R81 and Y149 (Ahlswede2022Human). Post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation influence its localization and integration into tight junctions (Liu2016Systems).

## Function
Claudin-7 (CLDN7) is a crucial component of tight junctions in epithelial cells, playing a significant role in maintaining epithelial cell homeostasis and integrity. In healthy human cells, CLDN7 is highly expressed in normal colon tissues and is integral to the formation and maintenance of tight junctions, which are essential for cell-cell adhesion and maintaining cellular polarity (Bhat2014Claudin7). This protein interacts with other molecules such as integrin α2 and claudin-1 to form complexes that are vital for normal intestinal epithelial cell function (Bhat2014Claudin7).

CLDN7 is also involved in regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for intestinal epithelial stem cell (IESC) function, self-renewal, and differentiation. The absence of CLDN7 disrupts this pathway, leading to impaired stem cell function and differentiation, as well as epithelial damage (Xing2020Tight). Additionally, CLDN7 is essential for maintaining the balance between stem cell renewal and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium, as its deletion results in the loss of active crypt stem cells and increased proliferation of epithelial cells (Xing2020Tight). These functions highlight CLDN7's role in preserving epithelial integrity and preventing tissue damage.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLDN7 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal and gastric cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CLDN7 expression is typically downregulated, particularly in subtypes characterized by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness, such as the mesenchymal CMS4 subtype. This downregulation is associated with tumor progression and EMT regulation, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for CLDN7 in CRC (Cherradi2019&lt; Bornholdt2011The; p&gt; Claudin). Reduced CLDN7 expression is considered an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis, contributing to compromised epithelial barriers and increased tissue permeability, which may facilitate carcinogen penetration (Bornholdt2011The).

Conversely, in gastric cancer (GC), CLDN7 is often overexpressed, correlating with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and maintenance of the mesenchymal state. This overexpression is linked to lymph node metastasis and enhanced expression of invasion-related markers, indicating an oncogenic role for CLDN7 in GC (WU2018Claudin7). The differential expression patterns of CLDN7 in these cancers highlight its complex role in tumorigenesis, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts and an oncogene in others. Additionally, CLDN7 expression changes are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, where its deficiency can lead to increased intestinal permeability and colonic inflammation (Tanaka2015Intestinal).

## Interactions
Claudin-7 (CLDN7) is involved in various interactions within cellular environments, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). It is known to oligomerize within the plasma membrane and interact with oligomers of adjacent cells to form tight junctions, although specific mutations in CLDN7, such as R81A and Y149A, do not significantly affect its ability to interact in trans (Ahlswede2022Human). 

In CRC, CLDN7 has been shown to indirectly interact with the integrin/FAK signaling pathway. While no direct protein-protein interactions were identified between CLDN7 and the integrin/FAK/ERK pathway genes, significant correlations were observed between CLDN7 and PTK2, as well as between DIAPH1 and RHOA, suggesting some level of co-expression (Ding2016Claudin7). CLDN7 also interacts with integrin α2, which may play a role in maintaining epithelial integrity (Ding2016Claudin7).

Additionally, CLDN7 interacts with Sox9 at the protein level in CRC, influencing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is indirect, as Sox9 does not directly bind to the CLDN7 promoter region, but both proteins were immunoprecipitated together, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism (Xu2021Claudin7).
