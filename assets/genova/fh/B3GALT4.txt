# B3GALT4

## Overview
The B3GALT4 gene encodes the enzyme beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 4, a crucial glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors. This enzyme facilitates the transfer of galactose residues to specific acceptor molecules, playing a significant role in the formation of complex gangliosides such as GM1, GD1b, and GT1c, which are integral to cell membrane structure and function (Wang2019Crosstalks; Potapenko2009Glycan). The protein is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to essential cellular processes, including cell signaling and interaction, particularly in neuronal cells where it supports calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function (Verma2019siRNAmediated). Alterations in B3GALT4 expression have been linked to various diseases, including neuroblastoma, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Sha2022B3GALT4; Madrid2018DNA; Verma2019siRNAmediated).

## Structure


## Function
The B3GALT4 gene encodes the enzyme beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 4, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. This enzyme is responsible for transferring a β1,3 galactose from UDP-Gal to specific structures, forming complex gangliosides such as GM1, GD1b, and GT1c, which are essential components of cell membranes involved in cell signaling and interaction (Wang2019Crosstalks; Potapenko2009Glycan). B3GALT4 is also involved in the galactosylation of the GalNAc sidechain of free GPI, indicating its role in modifying GPI anchors, which are important for cell membrane structure and function (Wang2019Crosstalks).

In neuronal cells, GM1 ganglioside, synthesized by B3GALT4, is critical for maintaining calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and lysosomal integrity, contributing to neuronal development and protection (Verma2019siRNAmediated). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the galactosylation processes necessary for the proper formation of these glycolipids (Wang2019Crosstalks). The activity of B3GALT4 is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of glycosphingolipids and GPI anchors in healthy human cells (Wang2019Crosstalks).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the B3GALT4 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In neuroblastoma, a type of cancer, B3GALT4 is involved in the synthesis of ganglioside GD2, which is overexpressed in tumor tissues. Low expression of B3GALT4 is associated with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. Overexpression of B3GALT4 has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and enhance immune response by promoting CD8+ T-cell infiltration, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor and potential prognostic biomarker (Sha2022B3GALT4).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), decreased expression of B3GALT4 leads to reduced levels of GM1 ganglioside, increasing the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to neurodegeneration. This reduction in GM1 is observed in the substantia nigra of PD patients, contributing to the progression of the disease. The study suggests that GM1 ganglioside has neuroprotective effects, and its administration in PD patients may slow symptom progression (Verma2019siRNAmediated).

Additionally, hypomethylation of the B3GALT4 gene has been linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Differentially methylated positions in B3GALT4 were identified in patients with LOAD, suggesting that changes in its methylation status may be associated with the disease's pathogenesis (Madrid2018DNA).

## Interactions
B3GALT4, a beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase, is involved in several interactions within the Golgi apparatus that are crucial for its function in glycosylation processes. It has been observed to co-localize with B4GALT1 and partially with TGN46 in the trans-Golgi cisterna, although it does not co-localize with TGN46 in super-resolution microscopy, suggesting specific spatial interactions within the Golgi (Wang2019Crosstalks). The protein is also implicated in a potential physical interaction with B4GALNT1, which may be a rate-limiting step in the synthesis of GM1, a ganglioside, supporting its localization in the trans-Golgi network for GM1 biosynthesis (Wang2019Crosstalks).

In the context of neuroblastoma, B3GALT4 influences lipid raft formation through its interaction with ganglioside GD2, which is co-localized with caveolin-1, a lipid raft marker. This interaction affects the c-Met/AKT/mTOR/IRF-1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for the synthesis of chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, thereby modulating the tumor microenvironment (Sha2022B3GALT4). These interactions highlight the role of B3GALT4 in both glycosylation and cellular signaling pathways, impacting processes such as cell adhesion and immune response.
