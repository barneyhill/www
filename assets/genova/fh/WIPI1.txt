# WIPI1

## Overview
WIPI1 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 1 protein, which is a member of the WD-repeat protein family. This protein is characterized by a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, enabling it to interact with phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), which is crucial for its role in autophagy and endosomal trafficking (ProikasCezanne2015WIPI; Gaugel2012Defining). WIPI1 is involved in the formation of autophagosomes and the regulation of endosomal transport, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and protein recycling (De2021WIPI1). Beyond its fundamental cellular functions, WIPI1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neural tube defects, due to its aberrant expression and critical role in autophagy (Almannai2022WIPI; D’Arcangelo2018WIPI1).

## Structure
The WIPI1 protein is characterized by a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, typical of the WD-repeat protein family. This structure is crucial for its function in autophagy, as it facilitates the binding of phosphoinositides, specifically phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) (ProikasCezanne2015WIPI; Gaugel2012Defining). The β-propeller structure of WIPI1 includes conserved residues that are essential for phospholipid binding, with key arginine residues playing a critical role in this interaction (Gaugel2012Defining; ProikasCezanne2004WIPI1α).

The WIPI1 protein contains seven WD repeats, which contribute to the formation of the β-propeller structure. These repeats are arranged in a manner that allows for the formation of two potential binding sites, one of which is involved in phosphoinositide binding (ProikasCezanne2004WIPI1α). The structure also includes an open Velcro topology, which is important for its function in autophagy (Gaugel2012Defining).

WIPI1 is known to interact with nuclear steroid hormone receptors, such as androgen and estrogen receptors, in a hormone-independent manner, suggesting additional roles beyond autophagy (ProikasCezanne2004WIPI1α). The protein's expression is aberrant in various human cancers, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related processes (ProikasCezanne2004WIPI1α).

## Function
WIPI1 is a crucial protein involved in the process of autophagy, a cellular mechanism for degrading and recycling cytoplasmic components. It functions as a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P)-binding β-propeller protein, which is essential for the initiation and formation of autophagosomes. WIPI1 localizes to the phagophore, the site of autophagosome formation, and operates upstream of the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation systems, facilitating the recruitment of the ATG16L1 complex to WIPI2-positive phagophores (Almannai2022WIPI; Gaugel2012Defining).

In addition to its role in autophagy, WIPI1 is involved in endosomal trafficking. It plays a significant role in the formation and fission of endosomal transport carriers, supporting the transport of endosomal cargo towards the plasma membrane, Golgi, and lysosomes. This function is mediated through its interaction with phosphoinositides, specifically PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P2, which are crucial for different aspects of its activity (De2021WIPI1).

WIPI1's activities in autophagy and endosomal trafficking are distinct yet interconnected, highlighting its versatile role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient protein recycling in healthy human cells (ProikasCezanne2015WIPI; De2021WIPI1).

## Clinical Significance
WIPI1 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in autophagy and its aberrant expression in various cancers. In melanoma, WIPI1 is significantly overexpressed, distinguishing melanoma from nevi with high sensitivity and specificity, and is associated with better survival outcomes in patients (D’Arcangelo2018WIPI1). This overexpression is particularly notable in melanoma compared to other cancer types, suggesting its potential as a melanoma biomarker (D’Arcangelo2018WIPI1).

WIPI1 is also upregulated in skin cancers and cervical carcinomas, indicating a broader role in cancer pathogenesis (ProikasCezanne2004WIPI1α). Its expression is linked to starvation-induced autophagy, a process that can act as a tumor suppressive mechanism, but its aberrant expression may contribute to tumor progression (ProikasCezanne2004WIPI1α).

In addition to cancer, WIPI1 has been associated with neural tube defects, as rare missense variants in WIPI1 were found in patients with these conditions. Experiments in zebrafish suggest that altering WIPI1 expression can lead to defects in neural tube formation (Almannai2022WIPI). WIPI1's role in autophagy and its interactions with other proteins may also have implications for other diseases, such as right ventricular failure (Almannai2022WIPI).

## Interactions
WIPI1 interacts with several proteins involved in autophagy and endosomal trafficking. It plays a crucial role in the recruitment of the ATG16L1 complex to WIPI2-positive phagophores, a process facilitated by the autophagy receptor optineurin (Almannai2022WIPI). WIPI1 also interacts with phosphoinositides such as PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P2, which are essential for its function in endosomal transport carrier formation and autophagosome assembly (ProikasCezanne2015WIPI; De2021WIPI1).

WIPI1's interaction with ATG16L1 is described as weak and possibly indirect, potentially mediated through WIPI2 (De2021WIPI1). It is involved in the LC3 lipidation process, a critical step in autophagosome formation, by interacting with ATG12, ATG16L, and LC3 (ProikasCezanne2015WIPI). WIPI1 also binds to the autophagy adaptor p62 (SQSTM1), and its function is dependent on ULK-mediated activation of PI3K3C and PtdIns3P production (ProikasCezanne2015WIPI).

In the context of melanoma, WIPI1 is functionally and physically connected to BAG1 and PEX3 through intermediate proteins such as ATG9A, BCL2, and PEX14, with HDAC1 serving as a central interconnection point (D’Arcangelo2018WIPI1). These interactions suggest that WIPI1 may influence melanoma progression through its role in autophagy and vesicle trafficking (D’Arcangelo2018WIPI1).
