# DNAJB6

## Overview
DNAJB6 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B6, which is a molecular chaperone involved in maintaining protein homeostasis. As a member of the Hsp40 family, the protein plays a critical role in protein folding and preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins, particularly those associated with neurodegenerative diseases. DNAJB6 is characterized by its conserved N-terminal J domain, which facilitates interaction with Hsp70 proteins, and a C-terminal domain rich in serine/threonine residues that is crucial for its function in preventing amyloid fibril formation. The protein exists in multiple isoforms, including a cytosolic form that can translocate to the nucleus under stress conditions. DNAJB6's ability to form oligomers enhances its capacity to bind aggregation-prone peptides, thereby contributing to cellular health and survival. Mutations in the DNAJB6 gene are linked to muscle diseases such as Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 1D, highlighting its clinical significance (Sarparanta2020Neuromuscular; Söderberg2018Structural; AbayevAvraham2023DNAJB6).

## Structure
DNAJB6 is a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family, characterized by its role in protein folding and stress response. The protein contains a conserved N-terminal J domain, essential for interaction with Hsp70 proteins, and a G/F domain, which is predicted to consist of an α-helix and flanking loops (Ruggieri2015Complete). The C-terminal domain (CTD) includes a serine/threonine (S/T) rich region crucial for its function in preventing amyloid fibril formation (Söderberg2018Structural).

DNAJB6 exists in multiple isoforms, including a nuclear (A) and a cytosolic (B) form, with the latter capable of translocating to the nucleus during heat shock (Söderberg2018Structural). The cytosolic isoform, DNAJB6b, is dynamic and can exist in closed, open, and extended states, with its structure characterized by interdomain interactions (Adupa2023Tertiary).

The protein forms oligomers, with dimers as building blocks. The dimeric structure features a peptide-binding cleft lined with conserved S/T residues at the dimer interface, which is significant for binding aggregation-prone peptides like Aβ42 (Söderberg2018Structural). DNAJB6 oligomers are dynamic, exchanging subunits and forming a heterogeneous population with varying numbers of subunits (Söderberg2018Structural).

## Function
DNAJB6 is a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis in human cells. It is a member of the Hsp40 family and functions primarily by assisting in protein folding and preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins. DNAJB6 exists in two isoforms, DNAJB6a and DNAJB6b, with DNAJB6b being particularly significant in preventing the aggregation of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as tau in Alzheimer's disease and α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease (Aprile2017The; Chang2023The).

In healthy cells, DNAJB6b interacts with the HSP70 chaperone system, facilitating the proper folding of proteins and preventing their aggregation. This interaction is mediated by the J-domain of DNAJB6, which is essential for recruiting misfolded proteins and transferring them to HSP70 for refolding (Aprile2017The; Chang2023The). DNAJB6b is predominantly located in the cytoplasm but can also transiently accumulate in the nucleus under stress conditions (Chang2023The).

The protective function of DNAJB6 extends to various proteins, including polyglutamine peptides, where it helps prevent aggregation and associated cytotoxicity, thereby contributing to cellular health and survival (RodríguezGonzález2020Cochaperones).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJB6 gene are associated with dominantly inherited muscle diseases, primarily Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 1D (LGMD1D). These mutations often occur in the G/F domain of the protein and lead to a toxic gain of function through unregulated interaction with Hsp70 chaperones. This interaction depletes Hsp70 levels, disrupting protein homeostasis and causing protein aggregation, which is a hallmark of the disease phenotype (Sarparanta2020Neuromuscular; AbayevAvraham2023DNAJB6). 

Clinically, DNAJB6 mutations result in variable presentations, including both limb-girdle and distal phenotypes. Symptoms can range from severe early-onset disease to milder forms, with some cases involving dysphagia and respiratory issues (Sarparanta2020Neuromuscular). Histological features include myofibrillar degeneration, protein aggregates, and rimmed vacuoles in muscle fibers (Sandell2016Diagnostically; Ruggieri2016DNAJB6).

There is also evidence suggesting a potential link between DNAJB6 mutations and neurodegenerative conditions, such as frontotemporal dementia, although this association requires further investigation (Yabe2014Pathology; Ruggieri2016DNAJB6). The expanding spectrum of DNAJB6-related phenotypes highlights the complexity and variability of the clinical manifestations associated with these mutations (Ruggieri2015Complete).

## Interactions
DNAJB6, a member of the Hsp40 family, interacts with Hsp70 chaperones, playing a crucial role in protein folding and preventing aggregation. The interaction is mediated through the J-domain of DNAJB6, which binds to Hsp70 and stimulates its ATPase activity, leading to increased substrate affinity (AbayevAvraham2023DNAJB6). In its wild-type form, DNAJB6 regulates this interaction through a glycine/phenylalanine-rich region that inhibits Hsp70 binding. However, mutations associated with Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 1D (LGMDD1) disrupt this regulation, resulting in unregulated, high-affinity binding to Hsp70 and a toxic gain of function (AbayevAvraham2023DNAJB6).

DNAJB6 also forms oligomers with a peptide-binding cleft lined with conserved serine/threonine residues, which interact with aggregation-prone peptides like Aβ42. This interaction is crucial for suppressing amyloid fibril formation, a function independent of Hsp70 (Söderberg2018Structural). The oligomeric structure of DNAJB6 enhances its ability to bind peptides, facilitating weak and transient interactions that prevent aggregation (Söderberg2018Structural). These interactions highlight DNAJB6's role in maintaining proteostasis and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms when mutated.
