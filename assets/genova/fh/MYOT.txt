# MYOT

## Overview
The MYOT gene encodes the protein myotilin, a critical component of the sarcomeric Z-disc in muscle cells. Myotilin is a structural protein that plays a pivotal role in the assembly and maintenance of the sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of muscle fibers. It is characterized by a unique N-terminal sequence and two C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins such as α-actinin and filamin C, contributing to the cross-linking and stabilization of actin filaments. Myotilin's ability to form dimers and its interactions with various Z-disc components underscore its importance in maintaining muscle integrity and function. Mutations in the MYOT gene are linked to several neuromuscular disorders, including myofibrillar myopathy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1A, and spheroid body myopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Selcen2004Mutations; Salmikangas1999Myotilin; Kostan2021Molecular).

## Structure
Myotilin is a 57 kDa protein encoded by the MYOT gene, characterized by a unique N-terminal sequence and a C-terminal region containing two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (Cannone2023Human; Salmikangas1999Myotilin). These Ig-like domains are homologous to those found in titin, another sarcomeric protein, and are crucial for myotilin's interactions with other proteins and its role in muscle structure (Salmikangas1999Myotilin). The N-terminal region is serine-rich, which facilitates interaction with α-actinin, a key component of the Z-disc in muscle cells (Cannone2023Human).

Myotilin can form dimers, a property attributed to its C-terminal Ig-like domains, which are involved in binding actin and filamin C, contributing to the cross-linking of actin filaments at the Z-disc (Cannone2023Human; Salmikangas2003Myotilin). This dimerization is essential for its function in maintaining the structural integrity of the sarcomere (Salmikangas2003Myotilin). The protein's structure allows it to stabilize F-actin and potentially displace tropomyosin, indicating its role as a co-organizer of Z-disc assembly (Kostan2021Molecular). Myotilin's flexible and intrinsically disordered regions contribute to its dynamic interactions within the sarcomere (Kostan2021Molecular).

## Function
Myotilin, encoded by the MYOT gene, is a crucial protein in the assembly and maintenance of the sarcomere structure in muscle cells. It is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, with moderate expression in the heart and peripheral nerves (Otey2005The). Myotilin localizes to the Z-discs of sarcomeres, where it cross-links actin filaments, contributing to the structural integrity of muscle fibers (Salmikangas2003Myotilin). It binds to and bundles actin filaments, stabilizing them by decreasing the off-rate of actin monomers from filament ends, thus preventing depolymerization (Salmikangas2003Myotilin).

Myotilin interacts with several components of the Z-disc, including α-actinin and filamin C, and directly binds to actin, stabilizing and bundling actin filaments (Otey2005The). It plays a regulatory role in the access of proteins like tropomyosin and α-actinin-2 to F-actin in the Z-disc, displacing them to create distinct regions on actin filaments (Kostan2021Molecular). This interaction is crucial for the displacement of tropomyosin, allowing the formation of tropomyosin-free actin filaments necessary for Z-disc development (Kostan2021Molecular). Myotilin's role in these processes is essential for maintaining the mechanical stability and assembly of Z-discs, which are critical for muscle contraction and function (Kostan2021Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYOT gene, which encodes the protein myotilin, are associated with several neuromuscular disorders. Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is one such condition, characterized by muscle weakness and degeneration due to disrupted sarcomere integrity. Mutations in the serine-rich exon 2 of MYOT have been identified in patients with MFM, presenting symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and distal muscle weakness (Selcen2004Mutations). 

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1A (LGMD1A) is another disorder linked to MYOT mutations. This condition is marked by late onset, rapid progression, and severe muscle weakness, often leading to loss of ambulation and respiratory failure. MYOT mutations can cause LGMD1A with or without clear MFM pathology, and the clinical presentation can vary significantly (Reilich2011A). 

Spheroid body myopathy (SBM) is also associated with MYOT mutations, specifically a thymine-for-cytosine substitution in exon 2. This mutation leads to the formation of spheroid bodies in muscle fibers, distinguishing SBM from other myopathies (Foroud2005A). 

Research into RNA interference (RNAi) therapy has shown potential in ameliorating muscle pathology in mouse models of LGMD1A by targeting mutant MYOT expression, suggesting a possible therapeutic approach for conditions caused by MYOT mutations (Liu2014RNAimediated).

## Interactions
Myotilin (MYOT) is a protein that plays a significant role in the structural organization of the sarcomeric Z-disc in muscle cells. It interacts with several proteins, including α-actinin-2, F-actin, and tropomyosin, to regulate the assembly and stability of the sarcomere. Myotilin binds to α-actinin-2 using a pseudoligand regulatory mechanism, similar to titin, and this interaction requires the open conformation of α-actinin-2 (Kostan2021Molecular). Myotilin competes with tropomyosin and α-actinin-2 for binding sites on F-actin, suggesting it can displace these proteins and regulate their access to F-actin in the Z-disc (Kostan2021Molecular).

Myotilin also interacts with FATZ-1 and FATZ-2, forming complexes that are crucial for the organization of the Z-disc. The entire myotilin molecule is necessary for efficient binding to FATZ-1, which uses its CD2 domain for this interaction (Gontier2005The). Myotilin can also bind to filamin-C, particularly with its repeats 19-24, and potentially with repeat 20, suggesting a synergistic strengthening of the interaction (Gontier2005The). These interactions highlight myotilin's role in maintaining the structural integrity of the Z-disc and its connection to the sarcolemma via filamins and β1 integrins (Gontier2005The).
