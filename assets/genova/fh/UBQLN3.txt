# UBQLN3

## Overview
UBQLN3 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquilin 3, which is a member of the ubiquilin family involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and quality control. Ubiquilin 3 is characterized by its ubiquitin-like (UBQ) and ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains, which facilitate interactions with the proteasome and ubiquitinated proteins, underscoring its role as a post-translational protein modifier. This intracellular protein is predominantly expressed in the testis, particularly in elongated spermatids during the post-meiotic stage of spermatogenesis, suggesting its importance in sperm development and function (Abu‐Halima2021MicroRNA‐targeting; Conklin2000Molecular). Alterations in UBQLN3 expression have been linked to male subfertility, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for sperm dysfunction (Abu‐Halima2021MicroRNA‐targeting).

## Structure
The UBQLN3 protein is characterized by several conserved domains that are crucial for its function. It contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBQ) domain, spanning from Lys-23 to Asp-74, which is involved in post-translational modification processes similar to ubiquitin (Conklin2000Molecular). This domain is a common feature in proteins related to ubiquitin, facilitating interactions with the proteasome and ubiquitinated proteins. The protein also includes a highly conserved NP domain, located between Arg-188 and Thr-280, and a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. The UBA domain shows a high degree of sequence identity with other proteins such as XDRP1, ubiquilin, PLIC-1, and PLIC-2, indicating its importance in the ubiquitination pathway (Conklin2000Molecular).

UBQLN3 lacks a signal peptide or transmembrane domain, suggesting it is an intracellular protein (Conklin2000Molecular). The presence of potential N-glycosylation sites indicates possible post-translational modifications that may regulate its function. The protein's structure is further supported by the conservation of these domains across species, highlighting their functional significance (Conklin2000Molecular). The study of UBQLN3 provides insights into its role in protein degradation pathways, typical of the ubiquilin family.

## Function
UBQLN3 (ubiquilin 3) is a testis-specific gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein quality control and degradation pathways. The protein contains an ubiquitin-like domain at the amino terminus and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain at the carboxy terminus, both of which are highly conserved and suggest a role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes (Conklin2000Molecular). UBQLN3 is specifically expressed in the testis, particularly in elongated spermatids during the post-meiotic stage of spermatogenesis, indicating its potential role in sperm development and function (Abu‐Halima2021MicroRNA‐targeting).

The protein is intracellular, lacking a signal peptide or transmembrane domain, and may undergo post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation (Conklin2000Molecular). While its precise function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, UBQLN3 is thought to act as a post-translational protein modifier, potentially influencing various cellular pathways, including cell-cycle progression, signal transduction, and apoptosis (Conklin2000Molecular). Its expression pattern and molecular characteristics suggest a significant role in maintaining normal sperm function and morphology, with implications for male fertility (Abu‐Halima2021MicroRNA‐targeting).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the UBQLN3 gene have been associated with male subfertility, particularly in the context of oligoasthenozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count and motility. The study by Abu-Halima et al. found that overexpression of microRNAs miR-23a/b-3p leads to reduced levels of UBQLN3 in spermatozoa of affected individuals. This reduction in UBQLN3 is correlated with impaired sperm parameters, including decreased sperm count, motility, and normal morphology, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of oligoasthenozoospermia (Abu‐Halima2021MicroRNA‐targeting).

UBQLN3 is a testis-specific gene expressed in elongated spermatids and is involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway. Its altered expression in sperm is hypothesized to reflect its expression pattern in the testes, potentially affecting spermatogenesis and contributing to subfertility (Abu‐Halima2021MicroRNA‐targeting). While the precise role of UBQLN3 in male subfertility remains less clear, its expression levels are positively correlated with sperm count, motility, and morphology, indicating its potential as a biomarker for sperm dysfunction and male subfertility (Abu‐Halima2021MicroRNA‐targeting).
