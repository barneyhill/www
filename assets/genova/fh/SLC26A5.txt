# SLC26A5

## Overview
The SLC26A5 gene encodes the protein known as prestin, which is a member of the solute carrier family 26. Prestin is a transmembrane motor protein predominantly expressed in the outer hair cells of the cochlea in the inner ear. It plays a crucial role in the process of cochlear amplification, which enhances auditory sensitivity and frequency selectivity by converting electrical signals into mechanical forces. This electromechanical transduction is essential for the rapid changes in cell length that facilitate sound amplification. Prestin's function is characterized by its unique 14-transmembrane domain structure and its ability to form stable oligomers, primarily tetramers, which are vital for its physiological role in hearing (Gorbunov2014Molecular; Zheng2006Analysis). Additionally, prestin interacts with intracellular anions and calmodulin, which modulate its activity and contribute to the homeostatic regulation of cochlear function (Costanzi2021Calmodulin; Oliver2001Intracellular).

## Structure
The SLC26A5 protein, also known as prestin, is a member of the solute carrier family 26 and functions as a motor protein in the outer hair cells of the cochlea. Prestin is characterized by a 14-transmembrane domain topology organized in a 7 + 7 inverted repeat architecture, which is crucial for its role in electromotility (Gorbunov2014Molecular; Costanzi2021Calmodulin). The transmembrane domains form a central cavity that serves as an anion-binding site, essential for its electromechanical activity (Gorbunov2014Molecular).

Prestin also contains a cytosolic STAS domain, which is involved in protein stabilization and membrane targeting. This domain harbors an anion-binding site that is unique to mammalian prestin, suggesting a specialized function in these species (Lolli2016The). The STAS domain is also implicated in calcium/calmodulin regulation, with a specific interaction involving the variable loop region (Costanzi2021Calmodulin).

In terms of quaternary structure, prestin forms stable oligomers, predominantly tetramers, which are resistant to dissociation and are connected by disulfide bonds within the hydrophobic core of the protein (Zheng2006Analysis). These oligomeric forms are essential for its physiological function in hearing.

## Function
The SLC26A5 gene encodes the protein prestin, which is a motor protein located in the lateral membrane of outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea of the inner ear. Prestin plays a critical role in cochlear amplification, a process that enhances the mechanical stimulus sensed by inner hair cells and transmitted to the central nervous system, contributing significantly to hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity (Zheng2000Prestin; Zhai2020Maturation). 

Prestin functions as an electromechanical transducer, converting electrical signals into mechanical forces that cause rapid changes in the length of OHCs. This electromotility is driven by voltage-dependent conformational changes in the protein, which are characterized by a nonlinear capacitance (NLC) (Gorbunov2014Molecular; Oliver2001Intracellular). The activity of prestin is influenced by intracellular anions, such as chloride and bicarbonate, which act as voltage sensors and are essential for its function (Oliver2001Intracellular).

Prestin's role extends beyond sound amplification; it also contributes to the homeostatic regulation of cochlear function by acting as a weak Cl−/HCO3− electrogenic antiporter, which helps regulate the internal pH of OHCs (Mistrík2012Mammalian). The protein's activity is crucial for normal hearing, and its dysfunction can lead to hearing loss (Gorbunov2014Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC26A5 gene, which encodes the cochlear motor protein prestin, have been studied for their potential role in hearing loss. A specific single nucleotide change, IVS2-2A>G, has been associated with hearing impairment. This variant occurs at the splice acceptor site for exon 3 and is predicted to cause exon 3 skipping during RNA processing, potentially leading to a lack of prestin protein production and subsequent hearing loss due to the absence of outer hair cell electromotility (Tang2005High). Despite this, the IVS2-2A>G variant was found in both hearing impaired and control subjects with no statistically significant difference in allele frequency, suggesting it may not be directly involved in hereditary hearing loss (Tang2005High). The high frequency of this variant in the general population further precludes its involvement in hereditary hearing loss (Tang2005High). The study also identified potential alternative splice acceptor sites within intron 2, which might maintain prestin expression despite the IVS2-2A>G variation (Tang2005High). Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of this variant on SLC26A5 splicing and hearing status.

## Interactions
The SLC26A5 protein, also known as prestin, interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction involves the STAS domain of prestin, specifically a region known as the 'variable loop.' The binding is characterized by a one-lobe interaction mode, primarily involving the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin. This interaction is transient, with a dissociation constant in the low micromolar range, indicating a relatively weak but significant binding. The presence of calcium is crucial for this interaction, as it is abolished in its absence or when the variable loop is removed (Costanzi2021Calmodulin).

The interaction between prestin and calmodulin is significant for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of prestin's function in outer hair cells. The variable loop's flexibility and partial ordering upon calmodulin binding are key factors in this interaction. Structural studies using techniques like NMR and SAXS have provided insights into the molecular interactions and structural details of the calmodulin-STAS domain complex, which are relevant for understanding the function of SLC26A5 in auditory processes (Costanzi2021Calmodulin).
