# EMC4

## Overview
EMC4 is a gene that encodes the ER membrane protein complex subunit 4, a critical component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC). This protein is integral to the biogenesis and proper folding of multipass transmembrane proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. EMC4 contributes to the structural integrity of the EMC by providing three transmembrane domains, which are essential for the insertion and stabilization of transmembrane domains in newly synthesized proteins (O’Donnell2020The; Hegde2022The). The protein's interactions with other EMC subunits, such as EMC1, EMC2, and EMC3, facilitate its role in maintaining protein homeostasis and ensuring the correct surface expression of membrane proteins, which are vital for various cellular processes (MillerVedam2020Structural; Wu2023EMC). EMC4's function is particularly significant in the context of its involvement in the gating mechanism that allows moderately hydrophobic transmembrane domains to be properly inserted into the membrane, impacting cellular functions such as protein trafficking and membrane protein biogenesis (Hegde2022The).

## Structure
EMC4 is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), playing a crucial role in the biogenesis of transmembrane proteins. The primary structure of EMC4 includes a sequence that allows it to form part of the core transmembrane helices of the EMC, contributing three transmembrane domains (TMDs) to the complex (O’Donnell2020The; Hegde2022The). 

In terms of secondary structure, the luminal C-terminus of EMC4 forms a parallel beta-sheet with EMC1 residues 668-674, indicating its involvement in a beta-strand structure (MillerVedam2020Structural). The extreme N-terminus of EMC4 is associated with a beta-strand-like density on the EMC8 surface, suggesting a role in the cytoplasmic domain (MillerVedam2020Structural).

The tertiary structure of EMC4 is characterized by its dynamic nature, with certain regions, such as the segment connecting the cytoplasmic domain to the transmembrane gate helices, being poorly resolved due to mobility (MillerVedam2020Structural). 

Quaternary interactions involve EMC4's integration into the EMC complex, where it interacts with other subunits like EMC1, EMC2, and EMC3, forming part of the larger complex (Hegde2022The; MillerVedam2020Structural). EMC4's placement in the EMC structure is supported by crosslinking data and structure predictions based on coevolutionary constraints (Hegde2022The).

## Function
EMC4 is a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a significant role in the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins. EMC4 is involved in the insertion and proper folding of transmembrane domains (TMDs) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), facilitating the assembly and stability of these proteins during synthesis (Shurtleff2018The; Wu2023EMC). The EMC, including EMC4, is essential for the insertion of C-terminal TMDs, as demonstrated in the GABA A receptor subunit GABRA1, where its absence leads to impaired receptor expression and degradation (Wu2023EMC).

EMC4 is part of a proposed gating mechanism that allows moderately hydrophobic TMDs to access the hydrophilic vestibule of EMC3, a process necessary for the proper insertion of these domains into the membrane (Hegde2022The). This function is critical for maintaining protein homeostasis and ensuring the correct surface expression of membrane proteins, impacting cellular processes such as protein trafficking and membrane protein biogenesis (Wu2023EMC). The activity of EMC4, along with other EMC components, is vital for the stability and function of multipass membrane proteins, which are integral to various cellular and organismal functions (Shurtleff2018The).

## Interactions
EMC4, a subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), is involved in various protein-protein interactions essential for its function. EMC4 interacts with Rab7, a small GTPase associated with late endosomes (LE), facilitating the transport of the SV40 virus from the LE to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This interaction is crucial for the ER-LE contact necessary for viral entry, and it is mediated by the N-terminal region of EMC4, particularly the first 50 amino acids containing a low complexity region (LCR) (Bagchi2020Selective).

EMC4 also forms part of a dynamic subdomain within the EMC, interacting with other subunits such as EMC3 and EMC7. These interactions are important for the structural integrity and function of the EMC, particularly in the insertion and stabilization of transmembrane domains (Hegde2022The). The cytoplasmic domain of EMC4 interacts with EMC2 and EMC3, contributing to the structural framework that supports the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins (MillerVedam2020Structural). EMC4's interactions are primarily protein-based, with no evidence of direct interactions with nucleic acids reported in the available literature.
