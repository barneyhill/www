# SH3GL1

## Overview
The SH3GL1 gene encodes the protein SH3 domain containing GRB2 like 1, also known as endophilin A2, which is a key player in cellular processes such as endocytosis and membrane dynamics. Endophilin A2 is categorized as a membrane-associated protein due to its involvement in clathrin-mediated and fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis, facilitated by its SH3 and BAR domains (Yang2023Biology). The SH3 domain allows for interactions with proline-rich domains of other proteins, while the BAR domain is crucial for membrane curvature and vesicle formation. SH3GL1 is expressed in various cell types, including neurons and hematopoietic cells, and is implicated in cellular signaling pathways, such as those involving receptor tyrosine kinases and the ras pathway (Matsutani2012Autologous). Its role in cellular communication and signaling underscores its importance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases (Norin2021Endophilin; Zhang2021SH3GL1).

## Function
The SH3GL1 gene encodes the protein Endophilin A2, which is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly endocytosis and membrane dynamics. Endophilin A2 contains an SH3 domain that facilitates interactions with proline-rich domains of synaptic and dynamin proteins, playing a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis (FEME) (Yang2023Biology). The protein's BAR domain is involved in membrane bending and curvature, essential for vesicle formation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yang2023Biology).

In healthy human cells, SH3GL1 is predominantly localized in the nuclei of hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts, while in neurons and osteoblasts, it is found in the cytoplasm (Matsutani2012Autologous). In the brain, SH3GL1 is highly expressed in neurons of the granular layer of the cerebral cortex, indicating its involvement in the development of the central nervous system (Matsutani2012Autologous). The protein is also implicated in linking receptor tyrosine kinase activation to the ras pathway, which is crucial for cell signaling related to proliferation (Matsutani2012Autologous). These functions highlight SH3GL1's role in cellular communication and signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SH3GL1 gene, also known as endophilin A2, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly gliomas and autoimmune conditions. In gliomas, SH3GL1 is overexpressed, especially in low-grade gliomas, where it elicits a strong humoral immune response. This overexpression is associated with higher serum levels of anti-SH3GL1 autoantibodies, which could serve as a novel serum marker specific to low-grade gliomas. The presence of these antibodies is linked to longer survival in patients, suggesting potential prognostic value (Matsutani2012Autologous). In high-grade gliomas, despite increased SH3GL1 expression, the immune response is suppressed due to immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (Matsutani2012Autologous).

In autoimmune diseases, SH3GL1 plays a significant role in T cell activation. Its expression is upregulated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and SH3GL1 deficiency in rodents leads to reduced T cell activation, providing protection against autoimmune arthritis. This suggests that SH3GL1 is a key regulator of T cell effector functions and a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases like RA (Norin2021Endophilin). Additionally, SH3GL1 is crucial for B cell-mediated immune responses, particularly in germinal center responses and antibody affinity maturation (Malinova2020Endophilin).

## Interactions
SH3GL1, also known as endophilin A2, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with dynamin and synaptojanin, both of which are essential for vesicle formation during endocytosis (Yin2005Identification). The interaction with these proteins is critical for the endocytic pathway, and amphiphysin can modulate this interaction by interfering with SH3GL1's binding to dynamin and synaptojanin, thus regulating their availability for endocytosis (Yin2005Identification).

SH3GL1 also interacts with β-catenin, facilitating the activation of β-catenin signaling, which is important for cancer cell proliferation and cancer stem cell maintenance in liver cancer (Zhang2021SH3GL1). This interaction underscores its role as an oncogene in liver tumorigenesis.

In B cells, SH3GL1, encoded as endophilin A2, is involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis and interacts with proteins such as dynamin2 (DNM2), intersectin2 (ITSN2), and Alix (PDCD6IP) (Malinova2020Endophilin). These interactions are vital for antigen uptake and the humoral immune response, highlighting SH3GL1's role in immune cell function (Malinova2020Endophilin).
