# ILDR1

## Overview
The ILDR1 gene encodes the immunoglobulin-like domain-containing receptor 1, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in various physiological processes. This protein is characterized by its extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and is essential for its function in tight junctions (Liu2017Angulin; Kim2015Downsloping). ILDR1 is involved in mediating fat-stimulated cholecystokinin secretion in the small intestine and is crucial for maintaining the integrity of tricellular tight junctions in the cochlea, which are vital for hearing (Chandra2013Immunoglobulinlike; Morozko2014ILDR1). Mutations in ILDR1 are linked to DFNB42, a form of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, underscoring its importance in auditory health (Morozko2014ILDR1; An2019Targeted). Additionally, ILDR1 is implicated in paracellular water transport in the kidney, contributing to water homeostasis (Gong2017ILDR1).

## Structure
The ILDR1 protein, encoded by the ILDR1 gene, is a type I transmembrane protein that includes several distinct domains. It features an extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, which is part of the Ig superfamily, and is crucial for its function in tight junctions (Liu2017Angulin; Kim2015Downsloping). The protein also contains a transmembrane domain, a cysteine-rich domain, an arginine-rich domain, an LSR (lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor) domain, a dileucine motif, and a 14-3-3 binding site (Tlili2017Identification). These domains are important for protein-protein interactions and the modulation of protein activity, stability, and localization (Tlili2017Identification).

ILDR1 is known to undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, including ILDR1α, ILDR1α', and ILDR1β. The full-length ILDR1α contains a di-leucine motif and a cysteine-rich region, which are necessary for interaction with splicing factors (Liu2017Angulin). The protein is also involved in recruiting tricellulin to tricellular tight junctions in the inner ear, a function that is crucial for maintaining hearing (Morozko2014ILDR1; Liu2017Angulin). The ILDR1 protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and localization.

## Function
The ILDR1 gene encodes a receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in mediating fat-stimulated cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion in the small intestine. ILDR1 is expressed in cholecystokinin-producing enteroendocrine cells and is activated by a combination of fatty acids and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), leading to increased intracellular calcium levels and subsequent CCK secretion. This process is crucial for the regulation of digestive functions, as CCK influences pancreatic secretion, gallbladder contraction, and satiety (Chandra2013Immunoglobulinlike).

In the inner ear, ILDR1 is essential for maintaining the integrity of tricellular tight junctions (tTJs) in the cochlea, which are vital for hearing. It is involved in the retention of tricellulin at these junctions, ensuring the structural and functional integrity necessary for normal auditory function. Mutations in ILDR1 can lead to DFNB42, a type of nonsyndromic autosomal recessive hearing impairment, highlighting its critical role in auditory health (Morozko2014ILDR1).

ILDR1 is also implicated in paracellular water transport in the kidney, where it regulates water permeability at tricellular tight junctions, contributing to urine concentration and water homeostasis (Gong2017ILDR1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ILDR1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss, specifically classified as DFNB42. This condition is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, which can range from moderate to profound, depending on the specific mutation. For instance, a novel homozygous loss-of-function mutation, c.427delT, identified in a Chinese family, results in a truncated ILDR1 protein and is linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (An2019Targeted). Another mutation, c.804delG, found in a UAE family, affects the intracellular domain of the ILDR1 protein, leading to severe hearing loss (Tlili2017Identification).

ILDR1 is crucial for the integrity of tricellular tight junctions in the inner ear, and its loss leads to structural aberrations and degeneration of auditory hair cells, as demonstrated in ILDR1-deficient mouse models (Morozko2014ILDR1). These structural changes are implicated in the pathophysiology of DFNB42 deafness, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining auditory function. The absence of ILDR1 disrupts the retention of tricellulin at tricellular tight junctions, which is essential for hearing (Morozko2014ILDR1).

## Interactions
ILDR1, a member of the angulin protein family, is known to interact with several splicing factors, including TRA2A, TRA2B, and SRSF1, which are part of the SR protein family. These interactions were identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The RS domain of these splicing factors is responsible for the interaction with ILDR1, facilitating its translocation into the nucleus and suggesting a role in splicing regulation (Liu2017Angulin).

ILDR1 also plays a crucial role in recruiting tricellulin to tricellular tight junctions (tTJs) in epithelial cells. It interacts with tricellulin, a protein essential for maintaining epithelial barrier function. This interaction is significant in the inner ear, where ILDR1 is expressed in the organ of Corti and other epithelial structures. Mutations in ILDR1 can impair its ability to recruit tricellulin, leading to compromised epithelial barrier function and contributing to deafness (Higashi2012Analysis).

ILDR1's interactions with these proteins highlight its dual role in both splicing regulation and maintaining epithelial integrity, with implications for hearing function and alternative pre-mRNA splicing (Morozko2014ILDR1; Liu2017Angulin).
