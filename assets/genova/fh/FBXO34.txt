# FBXO34

## Overview
FBXO34 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 34, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system is pivotal for protein degradation and regulation of various cellular processes. F-box protein 34 functions as part of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This protein is particularly significant in the regulation of the cell cycle and signal transduction pathways, with a notable role in oocyte maturation, where it facilitates the G2/M transition and anaphase entry during meiosis (Zhao2021FBXO34; Kinterová2022SCF). Additionally, FBXO34 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its association with the severity of COVID-19 and its upregulation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Upadhyai2022ExomeWide; Zhang2022Comprehensive).

## Function
FBXO34 is a member of the F-box protein family, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a pathway responsible for protein degradation. This protein is part of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complex, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The SCF complex tags specific proteins for degradation, thereby regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and signal transduction pathways (Zhao2021FBXO34; Kinterová2022SCF).

In the context of oocyte maturation, FBXO34 is essential for the G2/M transition and anaphase entry during meiosis. It is involved in maintaining the balance of protein ubiquitination, which is critical for the unidirectional progression of the cell cycle. Overexpression of FBXO34 can lead to increased ubiquitination and degradation of proteins, potentially impairing meiosis progression (Zhao2021FBXO34). Conversely, depletion of FBXO34 results in decreased activity of the maturation-promoting factor (MPF), leading to a failure in germinal vesicle breakdown, a critical step in oocyte maturation (Zhao2021FBXO34).

FBXO34's subcellular localization changes during different stages of oocyte maturation, being primarily localized in the nucleus and colocalizing with F-actin in the membrane at the germinal vesicle stage, and later concentrating in the cortex at the metaphase II stage (Zhao2021FBXO34).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO34 has been implicated in the severity of COVID-19, particularly in individuals of European ancestry. An exome-wide association study identified genetic variants in FBXO34 that are significantly associated with the acuteness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests that common genetic variants in FBXO34 may contribute to the severity of COVID-19, rather than rare pathogenic exonic variants with large effect sizes (Upadhyai2022ExomeWide).

In the context of cancer, FBXO34 has been found to be upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissues compared to normal pancreatic tissues. However, the specific role of FBXO34 in PDAC and its potential impact on disease progression or patient prognosis has not been detailed (Zhang2022Comprehensive).

FBXO34 is also involved in the regulation of oocyte maturation. Disruptions in its expression or function could potentially affect fertility by impairing the progression of meiosis. Overexpression of FBXO34 in oocytes has been shown to block anaphase entry, causing arrest at the metaphase I stage, which is associated with irregular spindle formation and failure of homologous chromosome separation (Zhao2021FBXO34).

## Interactions
FBXO34 is a member of the F-box protein family, which is involved in the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex plays a crucial role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Although the specific physical interactions of FBXO34 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not well-documented, it is known to be associated with the SRP of the E3-ubiquitin complex, indicating its involvement in ubiquitination and protein degradation processes (Falconieri2021Characterization).

FBXO34 has been identified as a potential interaction partner of FBXO2, another F-box protein, in the context of murine zygotes. This interaction is suggested through network analysis, although specific physical interactions have not been detailed (Ntostis2017Potential). Additionally, FBXO34 was identified in a genetic screen as a gene involved in ubiquitylation that affects sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, but again, specific interaction details were not provided (Frankum2015Complementary).

Overall, while FBXO34 is implicated in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, detailed information on its specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remains limited.
