# ZNF681

## Overview
ZNF681 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 681, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs enable the protein to bind to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby playing a crucial role in gene regulation and cellular processes. Zinc finger protein 681 is implicated in various biological functions, including signal transduction and mitosis, due to its potential guanine quadruplex motifs (Todd2011Mapping). The protein has been associated with several pathological conditions, such as metaplastic breast carcinoma and ovarian carcinomas, where alterations in its expression or genetic mutations have been observed (Smebye2014Chromosome; Djomehri2020Quantitative). Additionally, ZNF681's interaction with the TRIM28-K304Q mutant suggests a role in altered gene expression in certain cellular contexts (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). These findings underscore the gene's potential significance in cancer biology and other diseases.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF681 has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression and genetic mutations. In ovarian carcinomas, ZNF681 is part of a cluster of zinc finger genes on chromosome 19 that frequently exhibit DNA gains, leading to increased gene expression. This suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of ovarian carcinomas, particularly in cases with chromosome 19 rearrangements (Smebye2014Chromosome). 

In endometriosis, ZNF681 shows decreased methylation, which correlates with a significant increase in expression. This hypomethylation and upregulation are associated with the disease's pathophysiology, potentially affecting inflammatory or apoptotic pathways (Naqvi2014Altered).

ZNF681 mutations have also been identified in metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC), a subtype of triple-negative breast cancer. These mutations are present in a significant portion of MBC cases, indicating a possible role in the distinct mutational profiles of these tumors (Djomehri2020Quantitative).

Overall, ZNF681's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential significance in cancer and other diseases through genetic and epigenetic alterations.

## Interactions
ZNF681 is a zinc finger protein that participates in various interactions, primarily through its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. In the context of leukemic K562 cells, ZNF681 was identified as one of the zinc finger proteins that interact exclusively with the TRIM28-K304Q mutant, a form of TRIM28 that mimics acetylation. This interaction suggests that ZNF681 may play a role in the altered gene expression observed in cells expressing the TRIM28-K304Q mutant (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

ZNF681 is also part of a cluster of zinc finger genes that contain potential guanine quadruplex motifs. These motifs are often associated with signal-transduction pathways and mitosis, indicating that ZNF681 may be involved in these cellular processes (Todd2011Mapping).

In the context of cancer, ZNF681 has been implicated in metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC), where it is one of the genes with shared somatic mutations across MBC subtypes. This suggests a potential role in the molecular mechanisms underlying this type of cancer (Djomehri2020Quantitative). However, specific interactions of ZNF681 with other proteins or nucleic acids in these contexts are not detailed in the available literature.
