# DEFB115

## Overview
DEFB115 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 115, a member of the beta-defensin family, which is integral to the innate immune system. This protein is characterized by its small size, cysteine-rich structure, and cationic nature, which endows it with potent antimicrobial properties. Defensin beta 115 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and plays a critical role in mucosal immunity by disrupting the membrane integrity of pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This disruption prevents the proliferation and spread of these pathogens within the host. The gene's expression and function have been linked to various health conditions, including severe COVID-19 infections and cancer, where it may influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Carter2017Interaction; Bradic2022DNA).

## Function
DEFB115 (defensin beta 115) is a member of the beta-defensin family, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune response. These proteins are small, cysteine-rich, and cationic, known for their antimicrobial properties. DEFB115 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, where it contributes to mucosal immunity by protecting against microbial infections. The protein functions by disrupting the membrane integrity of various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, thereby preventing their proliferation and spread within the host (Bradic2022DNA).

In the context of COVID-19, DEFB115 has been observed to have differential methylation patterns, which may influence its expression levels. Specifically, DEFB115 was found to be less methylated in critical COVID-19 patients who succumbed to the disease, suggesting a potential increase in its expression during severe infections. This indicates that DEFB115 might play a significant role in the immune response during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19, possibly by enhancing the host's defense mechanisms against the virus (Bradic2022DNA).

Overall, DEFB115 is an essential component of the body's first line of defense, maintaining mucosal immunity and contributing to the protection against a wide range of microbial threats.

## Clinical Significance
DEFB115 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in the immune response. In critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), DEFB115 was found to be less methylated in those who did not survive, suggesting increased expression in severe cases. This differential methylation pattern indicates that DEFB115 may influence the immune response during severe COVID-19 infections, potentially affecting patient outcomes (Bradic2022DNA).

In the context of cancer, DEFB115 has been identified as frequently comutated with protein kinase C isozymes, which are known tumor suppressors. This suggests a potential role for DEFB115 in carcinogenesis, although it had not been previously recognized as frequently mutated in cancer genome studies. The study highlights the importance of analyzing mutation rates based on germline genotype to uncover novel genes involved in cancer, indicating that DEFB115 mutations could influence cancer risk and progression (Carter2017Interaction).

In schizophrenia, DEFB115 has been mentioned in the context of DNA methylation studies, particularly in the striatum region, although specific clinical significance regarding its mutations or expression changes in this condition is not detailed (MigdalskaRichards2019Epigenetic).
