# ACBD4

## Overview
ACBD4, or acyl-CoA binding domain containing 4, is a gene that encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein involved in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis. The protein, also referred to as ACBD4, contains an acyl-CoA binding domain, which facilitates its role in binding acyl-CoA molecules, thereby contributing to fatty acid transport and metabolism. Functionally, ACBD4 is implicated in the regulation of peroxisome numbers and the formation of peroxisome-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites, which are crucial for lipid transfer and organelle communication. Although structurally similar to ACBD5, ACBD4 has evolved distinct regulatory functions, particularly at peroxisome-ER contact sites, potentially through mechanisms that do not involve direct tethering. The protein's interaction with VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs) via a FFAT-like motif is essential for its role in cellular lipid homeostasis and organelle integrity, although its tethering efficiency is reduced compared to ACBD5 due to mutations in its FFAT motif (Kors2024New; Kors2021Regulating).

## Function
ACBD4 is a peroxisomal membrane protein involved in cellular lipid metabolism, particularly in the regulation of peroxisome numbers and peroxisome-ER contact sites. It contains an acyl-CoA binding domain, which allows it to bind acyl-CoA molecules, playing a role in fatty acid transport and metabolism. ACBD4 is structurally similar to ACBD5 but has evolved to provide a regulatory function at peroxisome-ER contact sites, potentially through mechanisms independent of peroxisome-ER tethering (Kors2024New).

In human cells, overexpression of ACBD4 has been shown to reduce peroxisome numbers, possibly through autophagic processes, as indicated by increased YFP-LC3 fluorescence (Kors2024New). This suggests that ACBD4 may regulate peroxisome number through autophagy-related pathways. The protein's interaction with ER-resident VAP proteins via a FFAT motif is crucial for mediating peroxisome-ER contacts, although ACBD4 does this less efficiently than ACBD5 due to mutations in its FFAT motif that have altered its VAP-binding properties (Kors2024New).

ACBD4's role in peroxisomal functions and its specific physiological roles in humans are not fully understood, but it is implicated in cellular lipid homeostasis and organelle integrity (Kors2024New).

## Clinical Significance
ACBD4 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its role in lipid metabolism and cellular interactions. In colon adenocarcinoma (CRC), ACBD4 is identified as one of the fatty acid metabolic genes linked to cancer prognosis. It is suggested that ACBD4 could serve as a target p53 gene, and its dysregulation in CRC cells may contribute to tumor growth. Inhibition of ACBD4 has the potential to suppress tumor growth, making it a possible therapeutic target in CRC (ZHANG2024Identification).

In cardiac conduction, ACBD4 is part of a gene expression network associated with the PR interval in the heart. Although not previously linked to cardiac electrophysiology, it is expressed in the heart and may influence the PR interval by affecting vesicular ion channel transport to the membrane. ACBD4 is a target gene of the homeobox protein Nkx2.5, mutations of which are associated with atrioventricular conduction disturbances (Adriaens2018Systems).

Despite its involvement in these conditions, no patients with pathogenic mutations in the ACBD4 gene have been detected to date, indicating that its clinical significance may be more related to expression levels and interactions rather than direct mutations (Carmichael2022Fission).

## Interactions
ACBD4 is known to interact with VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs) through a FFAT-like motif, which is crucial for its role in tethering peroxisomes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Kors2024New; Kors2021Regulating). This interaction facilitates the formation of peroxisome-ER membrane contact sites, which are important for lipid transfer and metabolism (Kors2024New). The FFAT motif in ACBD4 has undergone mutations that have altered its VAP-binding properties, reducing its tethering function compared to ACBD5 (Kors2024New). Despite these mutations, the FFAT-like motif remains essential for VAPB binding, as a mutation in this motif results in the loss of association with VAPB (Kors2021Regulating).

ACBD4's interaction with VAPB is insensitive to phosphatase treatment, indicating that phosphorylation does not affect this interaction, unlike the interaction between ACBD5 and VAPB, which is sensitive to phosphorylation (Kors2021Regulating). While ACBD4 is primarily involved in peroxisome-ER tethering, it may also have a regulatory function at these contact sites (Kors2024New). There is no evidence in the provided context of ACBD4 interacting with nucleic acids.
