# OGFOD2

## Overview
OGFOD2, or 2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenase domain-containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and iron-dependent oxygenase family. This family of enzymes is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the hydroxylation of specific substrates, which can affect gene expression, protein stability, and cellular metabolism (Jia2017Largescale). The protein encoded by OGFOD2 is characterized by its dioxygenase activity, which involves the incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen, and is associated with L-ascorbic acid binding and iron ion binding activities (Lu2024The). Functionally, OGFOD2 is implicated in the regulation of translation and stress responses, with activity in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Lu2024The). The protein's interactions and expression patterns, particularly in neuronal cells, highlight its potential regulatory roles in both normal cellular function and in the context of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Function
OGFOD2, or 2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenase domain-containing 2, is a gene encoding a protein that is part of the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and iron-dependent oxygenase family. These enzymes are involved in various cellular processes, including the hydroxylation of specific substrates, which can influence gene expression, protein stability, and cellular metabolism (Jia2017Largescale). OGFOD2 is associated with L-ascorbic acid binding activity, dioxygenase activity, and iron ion binding activity, playing a role in oxidoreductase activity by acting on paired donors with the incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen (Lu2024The).

In healthy human cells, OGFOD2 is implicated in the regulation of translation and may play a role in stress responses and cellular growth. The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Lu2024The). Although specific functions of OGFOD2 in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, its involvement in hydroxylation reactions related to ribosomal proteins suggests a role in protein biosynthesis and gene expression regulation (Jia2017Largescale). The protein's activity in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and responding to physiological changes.

## Clinical Significance
The OGFOD2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In schizophrenia (SCZ), genetic variations in OGFOD2, particularly in the cerebellum, have shown a significant association with the disorder. The gene's expression in the cerebellum is linked to a decreased risk of SCZ, suggesting that alterations in OGFOD2 expression may influence the risk of developing this psychiatric disorder (Lu2024The).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), the OGFOD2/CCDC62 rs11060180 SNP is associated with higher UPDRS-III scores, indicating more severe motor symptoms. This SNP affects brain network topologies, particularly the small-worldness properties of the gray matter covariance network, which are correlated with clinical assessments of PD patients (Chen2022Parkinson’s). The presence of the G allele in this SNP is linked to alterations in brain network structures and clinical outcomes in PD (Chen2022Parkinson’s).

OGFOD2 is also identified as a potential pleiotropic gene associated with the comorbidity of schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes (T2D), although the specific clinical implications of its mutations or expression changes in this context remain unclear (Liu2020Integrated).

## Interactions
OGFOD2, a member of the 2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenase family, is involved in specific interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In neuronal cells, OGFOD2 has been shown to associate with the COPI coatomer complex, which includes subunits such as COPa, COPg, and COPg2. This interaction was identified through formaldehyde cross-linking and immunoprecipitation techniques, revealing that OGFOD2 RNA is enriched in COPa immunoprecipitations and detectable in both COPg and COPg2 samples. This suggests a specific interaction between OGFOD2 and these COPI subunits, indicating a potential role in RNA recognition and binding within neuronal cells (Todd2012COPI).

In the context of psychiatric disorders, genetic variations in OGFOD2 have been associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia, particularly due to its expression in the cerebellum. Single-cell RNA-seq data indicate that OGFOD2 is highly expressed in the cerebellum but not in the prefrontal cortex or anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting that its role in schizophrenia may be specific to its cerebellar expression (Lu2024The). These interactions and expression patterns highlight the potential regulatory roles of OGFOD2 in both neuronal function and psychiatric conditions.
