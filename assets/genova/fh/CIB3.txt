# CIB3

## Overview
CIB3, or calcium and integrin binding family member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in mechanotransduction within the inner ear. The CIB3 protein is categorized as a calcium-binding protein and plays a critical role as an auxiliary subunit of the mechanotransduction (MET) channel in hair cells. This protein is essential for converting mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals, a process vital for sensory perception. CIB3 interacts with TMC1 and TMC2, which are integral components of the MET channel complex, through specific hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, CIB3 is involved in calcium and magnesium ion binding, which affects its structural conformation and protein interactions, including those with integrin subunits. The expression of CIB3 in various tissues, such as the heart and muscle, suggests its involvement in diverse physiological roles. Notably, CIB3 can compensate for the loss of CIB2 in vestibular hair cells, highlighting its potential compensatory functions in maintaining MET channel activity (Huang2012Biophysical; Liang2021CIB2).

## Function
CIB3 (calcium and integrin binding family member 3) functions as an auxiliary subunit of the mechanotransduction (MET) channel in hair cells, playing a crucial role in converting mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals, essential for sensory perception in the inner ear (Liang2021CIB2). CIB3 interacts with TMC1 and TMC2, which are pore-forming subunits of the MET channel complex, through a hydrophobic groove, similar to the interaction of KChIP proteins with Kv4 channels (Liang2021CIB2). This interaction is vital for the mechanotransduction process, as CIB3 binds to a specific domain of TMC1, with key residues such as Phe312 and Tyr317 playing significant roles (Liang2021CIB2).

CIB3 is also involved in calcium and magnesium ion binding, which influences its secondary and tertiary structures, affecting protein interactions (Huang2012Biophysical). It is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, stomach, ovary, testis, and muscle, suggesting tissue-specific roles (Huang2012Biophysical). In vestibular hair cells, CIB3 can compensate for the loss of CIB2, indicating its role in maintaining MET channel function (Liang2021CIB2). CIB3's interactions and binding properties are essential for understanding its function in cellular processes and its potential compensatory roles in the absence of CIB2 (Huang2012Biophysical).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CIB3, a member of the calcium and integrin-binding protein family, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It binds to calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions, which influence its structural conformation and interactions with other proteins (Huang2012Biophysical). CIB3 interacts with the integrin aIIb subunit, a relationship modulated by its metal-binding states, suggesting a role in integrin signaling pathways (Huang2012Biophysical). This interaction is studied using fluorescence experiments with a 7-azatryptophan labeled peptide (Huang2012Biophysical).

CIB3 also interacts with TMC1, a component of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells. The interaction involves a specific TMC1 fragment binding to CIB3, primarily through hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges, with key residues such as Phe312 and Tyr317 playing significant roles (Liang2021CIB2). This binding displaces the CIB3 C terminus, which is involved in dimer formation, indicating that the TMC1 binding site overlaps with the dimer-binding site (Liang2021CIB2). CIB3's interaction with TMC1 is crucial for the function of the mechanotransduction channel, and it can compensate for the loss of CIB2 in outer hair cells (Liang2021CIB2).
