# NYAP1

## Overview
NYAP1 is a gene that encodes the neuronal tyrosine phosphorylated phosphoinositide-3-kinase adaptor 1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in neuronal development and function. This protein is primarily involved in neuronal migration and morphogenesis, particularly during the process of corticogenesis, where it facilitates the transition of neurons from a multipolar to a bipolar morphology. This transition is essential for the proper migration of neurons from the intermediate zone to the cortical plate. The protein functions as an adaptor, interacting with key signaling molecules such as the PI3K and WAVE complexes, which are crucial for actin cytoskeletal remodeling. This remodeling is vital for providing structural support and enabling neuron movement. NYAP1 is phosphorylated by Fyn, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, which is critical for its role in neuronal migration. The protein's activity in the cytoplasm is also linked to synaptic plasticity, underscoring its importance in brain development and function (Wang2019Nyap1).

## Function
NYAP1 is a critical gene involved in neuronal migration and morphogenesis during corticogenesis. It plays a significant role in the transition of neurons from multipolar to bipolar morphology, which is essential for their proper migration from the intermediate zone (IZ) to the cortical plate (CP) (Wang2019Nyap1). This transition is facilitated by the phosphorylation of NYAP1 by Fyn, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, which is crucial for its function in neuronal migration (Wang2019Nyap1). The phosphorylation occurs at specific tyrosine residues, and mutations at these sites can lead to altered neuronal migration patterns (Wang2019Nyap1).

NYAP1 interacts with the PI3K and WAVE complexes, contributing to actin cytoskeletal remodeling, which is vital for providing structural support and facilitating neuron movement (Wang2019Nyap1). Overexpression of NYAP1 leads to increased neurite outgrowth and extension, indicating its role in promoting the structural complexity of neurons (Wang2019Nyap1). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it is implicated in synaptic plasticity and neuronal migration, highlighting its importance in brain development and function (Wang2019Nyap1).

## Interactions
NYAP1 interacts with several proteins that play crucial roles in neuronal development and signaling pathways. It is phosphorylated by the Fyn tyrosine kinase, which is essential for its function in neuronal migration and morphogenesis. This phosphorylation is particularly important for the multipolar-bipolar transition of migrating neurons during corticogenesis (Wang2019Nyap1). NYAP1 also interacts with the p85 subunit of PI3Ks, linking PI3K signaling to the WAVE1 complex, which is involved in actin polymerization. This interaction suggests a mechanism for local actin cytoskeleton reshaping in response to external signals (Mack2011New).

NYAP1's role in actin cytoskeletal remodeling is critical for neuronal morphogenesis, and it interacts with other molecules such as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and doublecortin (DCX) as part of the complex processes regulating neuronal migration (Wang2019Nyap1). The phosphorylation of NYAP1 by Fyn is confirmed through a solid-phase phosphorylation screen, and decreased phosphorylation is observed in Fyn-KO brains, indicating its dependence on Fyn for activation (Wang2019Nyap1). These interactions highlight NYAP1's significant role in neuronal morphology and neurodevelopmental processes.
