# PPARD

## Overview
The PPARD gene encodes the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ), a nuclear receptor protein that functions as a transcription factor. PPARδ is involved in the regulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and inflammation. As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, PPARδ plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and glucose metabolism. The protein is characterized by a ligand-binding domain that accommodates a range of ligands, facilitating its role in gene expression regulation. PPARδ's activity is modulated through interactions with coactivators and corepressors, and it forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to exert its transcriptional effects. The gene and its encoded protein have significant implications in metabolic disorders, cardiovascular health, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets (Liu2018The; Fyffe2006Recombinant; Mukundan2009PPARδ).

## Structure
The PPARD gene encodes the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta, a nuclear receptor protein involved in regulating gene expression. The protein structure includes a ligand-binding domain (LBD) that is crucial for its function. The LBD of PPARD is characterized by a Y-shaped ligand-binding pocket with three sub-arms, which accommodates various ligands, including endogenous fatty acids and synthetic compounds (Wu2017Structural; Fyffe2006Recombinant). The LBD is a single globular domain with a large cavity lined with hydrophobic and polar residues, facilitating interactions with ligands (Fyffe2006Recombinant).

The PPARD protein shares structural similarities with other PPAR isotypes, such as PPARα and PPARγ, with a high degree of sequence identity and structural conservation (Fyffe2006Recombinant). The ligand-binding site is composed of 34 residues, 80% of which are conserved across PPAR types, and features a hydrogen-bonding network crucial for maintaining the active conformation of the activation function helix (Fyffe2006Recombinant).

PPARD can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional properties. Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which can influence the receptor's activity and interactions with coactivators. The structural features of PPARD, including its ligand-binding domain and post-translational modifications, play a significant role in its function as a transcription factor.

## Function
PPARD, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta, is a nuclear receptor that functions as a transcription factor, regulating genes involved in lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and inflammation. It plays a crucial role in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), mitochondrial biogenesis, and glucose metabolism. In human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs), PPARD activation enhances metabolic and contractile maturation by inducing a metabolic switch from glycolysis to FAO, increasing mitochondrial content and function, and improving myofibril organization (Wickramasinghe2021PPARdelta).

PPARD is also involved in the differentiation and survival of various cell types, including muscle cells, where it maintains fatty acid oxidation and prevents lipid accumulation. In skeletal muscle, PPARD expression increases during fasting and exercise, promoting a shift towards oxidative muscle fibers and enhancing oxidative capacity (Attianese2015Integrative). In cardiac muscle, PPARD is essential for preventing heart failure and reducing lipotoxicity (Attianese2015Integrative).

Additionally, PPARD plays a role in the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, which is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune diseases. It regulates the expression of opsonins, facilitating the phagocytic response to apoptotic cells (Mukundan2009PPARδ).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PPARD gene have been implicated in several diseases. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), PPARD is involved in regulating insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β-cell function. Activation of PPARD by agonists can enhance GLP-1 production, improve glucose tolerance, and restore glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for PPARD agonists in managing obesity and diabetes (Tan2016Transcriptional).

In cancer, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC), PPARD has shown both pro-tumorigenic and protective effects. It is involved in the expression of VEGF and the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway, which are associated with tumorigenesis. Dietary fat and PPARD agonists can promote the proliferation of intestinal stem cells and potentially initiate tumors, although the role of PPARD in CRC is complex and influenced by factors such as sex, genetic background, and tumor heterogeneity (Tan2016Transcriptional). PPARD is also upregulated in several human cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancers, and its expression is associated with negative survival outcomes. It can promote inflammation-driven cancer development through mechanisms involving COX-2 and PGE2 signaling pathways (Liu2018The).

In Huntington's disease (HD), PPARD repression is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Mutant huntingtin protein represses PPARD, leading to these defects. Activation of PPARD has shown neuroprotective effects in HD models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Dickey2015PPARδ).

## Interactions
PPARD, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate gene expression. It forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to bind to PPAR response elements (PPREs) in gene promoters, influencing transcriptional activity (Liu2018The). In its unliganded state, PPARD can interact with corepressors such as SMRT and HDAC1, which repress transcription by down-regulating PPARα and PPARγ-dependent transactivation (Attianese2015Integrative). Upon ligand binding, PPARD undergoes conformational changes that release corepressors and allow coactivator binding, facilitating transcriptional activation (Liu2018The).

PPARD also interacts with other transcription factors, including β-catenin and NF-κB, which are involved in various signaling pathways (Liu2018The). It can form a complex with the transcription factor BCL-6, affecting the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes. Binding with an agonist disrupts this complex, allowing BCL-6 to repress gene expression (Liu2018The). These interactions highlight the role of PPARD in modulating inflammation and metabolic processes. Additionally, PPARD's interaction with coactivators is cell type-specific, gene-specific, and signal-specific, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism (Attianese2015Integrative).
