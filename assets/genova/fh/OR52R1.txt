# OR52R1

## Overview
The OR52R1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily R member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odorants, facilitating the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways in the olfactory epithelium (Pucci2020High). While primarily associated with olfactory functions, there is evidence suggesting that olfactory receptors, including OR52R1, may have additional roles in cell signaling beyond olfaction (Pucci2020High). The OR52R1 gene is also noted as a segregating pseudogene, indicating potential alterations in its functional capacity, although the presence of missense variants suggests it may retain some activity (Birolo2021Functional).

## Function
OR52R1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR52R1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory sensation (Pucci2020High).

In addition to its role in olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR52R1 may have functions beyond smell perception, potentially participating in cell signaling pathways. This suggests that OR52R1 could be involved in broader biological processes, although specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain unclear (Pucci2020High).

The OR52R1 gene has been identified as a segregating pseudogene, which typically implies a loss of function. However, the presence of missense variants in the gene suggests that it may still have some functional roles, although these are not well-defined in the current literature (Birolo2021Functional). The gene's classification as a pseudogene indicates that its functional capacity might be reduced or altered compared to other olfactory receptors.
