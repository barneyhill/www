# ATP5PD

## Overview
ATP5PD is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit d, a critical component of the ATP synthase complex located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein is integral to the peripheral stalk of ATP synthase, a key structure that stabilizes the enzyme complex during the process of oxidative phosphorylation. By linking the catalytic F1 domain to the membrane-embedded F0 domain, ATP5PD ensures the proper function and efficiency of ATP synthase, facilitating the conversion of ADP to ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (He2020Assembly; Tsipourlianos2024Regulatory). The stability and assembly of the ATP synthase complex are dependent on ATP5PD, and its disruption can lead to impaired cellular respiration and energy production (He2020Assembly). Additionally, ATP5PD interacts with other mitochondrial proteins, such as thioredoxin 2, indicating its broader role in cellular processes beyond energy metabolism (Chasapis2019Implications).

## Structure


## Function
ATP5PD encodes a subunit of the ATP synthase complex, specifically part of the peripheral stalk, which plays a crucial role in ATP production during oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. The peripheral stalk stabilizes the ATP synthase complex by connecting the catalytic F1 domain to the membrane-embedded F0 domain, preventing the stators from spinning with the rotor during ATP synthesis (Tsipourlianos2024Regulatory). This structural role is essential for the enzyme's function, ensuring efficient energy conversion and maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (He2020Assembly).

In healthy human cells, ATP5PD is involved in the assembly and stability of the ATP synthase complex. Disruption of ATP5PD can lead to vestigial complexes with depleted peripheral stalk subunits, affecting cell growth and respiration, which underscores its importance in maintaining ATP synthase function (He2020Assembly). The protein is active in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it contributes to the structural integrity and function of ATP synthase, facilitating the production of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (He2020Assembly). This role is vital for supporting various cellular processes and overall organismal energy metabolism.

## Interactions
ATP5PD, also known as ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit d, is involved in the assembly and function of the ATP synthase complex in human mitochondria. It plays a crucial role in forming the peripheral stalk (PS) module of ATP synthase, which is essential for the structural stability of the enzyme complex. ATP5PD interacts with other subunits within the PS module, including subunits e, f, and g, to form a key intermediate that facilitates the integration of mitochondrially encoded subunits ATP6 and ATP8 into the enzyme complex (He2020Assembly).

In addition to its role in ATP synthase assembly, ATP5PD has been identified as an interactor of thioredoxin 2 (Trx2), a mitochondrial protein involved in redox regulation. This interaction occurs through both non-covalent and covalent bonds, as confirmed by proteomics and yeast two-hybrid screens. The interaction between ATP5PD and Trx2 is significant for maintaining normal cellular function and may have implications in disease contexts (Chasapis2019Implications).

These interactions highlight the importance of ATP5PD in mitochondrial function and its potential involvement in broader cellular processes, including energy metabolism and redox regulation.
