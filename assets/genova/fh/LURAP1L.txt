# LURAP1L

## Overview
LURAP1L, or leucine rich adaptor protein 1 like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to inflammation and cancer progression. The protein encoded by LURAP1L is an adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the NF-κB signaling pathway, influencing the transformation of fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through interactions with key kinases such as IKKα. This interaction is significant in the context of diseases like oral squamous cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where LURAP1L is implicated in tumor progression and immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, LURAP1L is associated with inflammatory conditions, particularly in individuals with a history of smoking, and is linked to immune cell recruitment and regulation. The gene's expression and its regulatory mechanisms, including the involvement of the long non-coding RNA LURAP1L-AS1, suggest its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and inflammatory diseases (Yang2022Comprehensive; Zecevic2022GenomeWide; Ren2021PDGF‑BB).

## Clinical Significance
The LURAP1L gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in inflammatory signaling and cancer progression. Alterations in LURAP1L expression have been associated with inflammatory conditions, particularly in individuals with a history of smoking, where it may impact pulmonary function (Zecevic2022GenomeWide). The gene's expression is notably increased in CD4+ T-cells, suggesting a link to inflammatory diseases.

In cancer, LURAP1L is identified as a ferroptosis-related gene with significant roles in non-small cell lung cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma. Its expression levels are elevated in renal carcinoma, indicating potential involvement in tumor progression (Yang2022Comprehensive). LURAP1L is also associated with immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment, influencing immune cell recruitment and potentially affecting the tumor immune response.

In prostate cancer, LURAP1L expression is linked to cell migration and invasiveness, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Schulten2016Microarray). The lncRNA LURAP1L-AS1, associated with LURAP1L, is involved in the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, impacting tumor growth and progression through the NF-κB pathway (BuenoUrquiza2023The). These findings highlight LURAP1L's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
LURAP1L (leucine rich adaptor protein 1 like) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It plays a significant role in the transformation of fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through the PDGF-BB signaling pathway. This process involves the long non-coding RNA LURAP1L-AS1, which regulates the expression of LURAP1L, a key component in the NF-κB signaling pathway. LURAP1L interacts with IKKα, a crucial kinase in the NF-κB pathway, promoting its activation and thereby affecting fibroblast activation. The interaction between LURAP1L and IKKα was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated that LURAP1L binds to IKKα, facilitating the activation of the NF-κB pathway (Ren2021PDGF‑BB).

The study also highlights that the knockdown of LURAP1L-AS1 weakens the interaction between LURAP1L and IKKα, underscoring the regulatory role of LURAP1L-AS1 in this signaling pathway (Ren2021PDGF‑BB). These interactions suggest that LURAP1L is a critical player in the PDGF-BB-induced transformation of fibroblasts, potentially serving as a therapeutic target in conditions like oral squamous cell carcinoma (Ren2021PDGF‑BB).
