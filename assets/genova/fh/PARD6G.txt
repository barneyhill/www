# PARD6G

## Overview
PARD6G is a gene that encodes the par-6 family cell polarity regulator gamma, a protein integral to the regulation of cell polarity and epithelial integrity. This protein is a member of the PAR-6 family and is characterized by its involvement in the formation of the PAR complex, which includes PAR3 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). The PARD6G protein contains several functional domains, such as the PB1, semi-CRIB, and PDZ domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins like aPKC, Cdc42, and Par3, crucial for maintaining cell polarity (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical; Rouaud2020Scaffolding). Functionally, PARD6G acts as a negative regulator of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling pathway, thereby playing a role in suppressing cell proliferation and maintaining epithelial cell cycle restriction (Marques2015Par6G). The gene is frequently targeted by loss-of-function mutations in various cancers, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Marques2015Par6G).

## Structure
The PARD6G protein is a member of the PAR-6 family, characterized by its role in cell polarity regulation. It contains several key domains that facilitate its function. The protein includes a Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain, a semi-CRIB (Cdc42 and Rac Interactive Binding) domain, and a PDZ domain. These domains are crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as aPKC, Cdc42, and Par3, which are important for establishing cell polarity and maintaining epithelial integrity (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical; Rouaud2020Scaffolding).

The PB1 domain allows for interaction with atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), while the semi-CRIB domain binds the active GTP-bound form of Cdc42, confining its activity to tight junctions. The PDZ domain interacts with Par3 and links the core complex to other polarity complexes, including Pals1 and Crumbs-3 (Rouaud2020Scaffolding).

PARD6G is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity. The protein is encoded by the PARD6G gene, which is frequently targeted by loss-of-function mutations in various cancers, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Marques2015Par6G).

## Function
PARD6G (par-6 family cell polarity regulator gamma) is a crucial component of the PAR complex, which includes PAR3 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and plays a significant role in establishing and maintaining cell polarity in epithelial cells. This protein is involved in regulating the epithelial cell cycle and maintaining cell quiescence by suppressing the Akt signaling pathway, which is associated with cell proliferation (Marques2015Par6G). In healthy human cells, particularly mammary epithelial cells, PARD6G is part of the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex, which is essential for regulating cell polarity and epithelial integrity (Marques2015Par6G).

PARD6G functions as a negative regulator of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway, contributing to its role in suppressing cell proliferation and maintaining epithelial cell cycle restriction (Marques2015Par6G). It is active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with other proteins to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction pathways, impacting tissue organization and development (Marques2015Par6G). The loss of PARD6G function can lead to disorganized acinar morphology and overgrowth, indicating its importance in maintaining normal epithelial structure and function (Marques2015Par6G).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PARD6G gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. PARD6G is frequently inactivated in epithelial cancers, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. Loss-of-function mutations and deletions of PARD6G are common in various cancers, including breast cancer, where its inactivation leads to increased cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential (Marques2015Par6G). The gene's inactivation disrupts epithelial integrity and cell cycle restriction, contributing to disorganized cell morphology and enhanced invasive properties of cancer cells (Marques2015Par6G).

PARD6G negatively regulates the PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway, a key signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation. Its loss results in increased Akt activity, even in the absence of growth factors, promoting uncontrolled cell growth (Marques2015Par6G). This deregulation is associated with the development and progression of epithelial cancers, highlighting PARD6G's potential as a therapeutic target (Marques2015Par6G).

Additionally, the PARD6G-AS1 region, which overlaps with PARD6G, shows differential methylation patterns associated with various diseases, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and transient neonatal diabetes, indicating its broader implications in disease pathogenesis (de2018Maternal).

## Interactions
PARD6G, a member of the PAR-6 family, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cell polarity. It interacts directly with atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) through its N-terminal region, forming a complex essential for cell polarization processes. This interaction is crucial for linking small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 to aPKC, facilitating the formation of a ternary complex that is vital for cell polarization both in vitro and in vivo (Noda2001Human).

PARD6G also plays a role in the regulation of the Akt signaling pathway. Loss of PARD6G leads to increased phosphorylation of Akt, indicating its involvement in suppressing cell proliferation by negatively regulating the PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway. This suggests that PARD6G interacts with components of the Akt signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor (Marques2015Par6G).

In the context of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), PARD6G interacts with TGF-β receptors, facilitating the phosphorylation of Par6, which is necessary for EMT. This interaction is mediated by the PB1 domain of Par6, which is crucial for binding to TGF-β receptor complexes (Gunaratne2013Atypical; Ozdamar2005Regulation).
