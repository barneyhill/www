# OGFRL1

## Overview
The OGFRL1 gene encodes the opioid growth factor receptor-like 1 protein, which is a member of the receptor family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including growth regulation and signal transduction. OGFRL1 shares structural similarities with the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFR), suggesting a potential role in modulating the effects of opioid growth factors, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The protein's involvement in cellular pathways highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
