# SLC13A4

## Overview
SLC13A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 13 member 4 (NaS2), which functions as a sodium-dependent sulfate transporter. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 13, characterized by multiple transmembrane domains that facilitate the transport of ions across cellular membranes. NaS2 is primarily expressed in the placenta and brain, where it plays a critical role in maintaining sulfate homeostasis, essential for various physiological processes such as neurogenesis and fetal development. The protein's function is vital for the sulfonation of extracellular matrix components, membrane phospholipids, and neurotransmitters, impacting neuroplasticity and fetal tissue development. Disruptions in SLC13A4 expression or function have been linked to developmental and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Yang2021SLC13A4; Zhang2019Postnatal; Rakoczy2015Loss).

## Structure
The SLC13A4 gene encodes a sodium sulfate co-transporter that is part of the solute carrier family 13. This family includes proteins characterized by having multiple transmembrane domains, typically ranging from 8 to 13, which facilitate the transport of ions across cell membranes (Yang2021SLC13A4). The human NaS2 protein, encoded by SLC13A4, is predicted to have 12 putative transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function in sulfate transport (Dawson2006Molecular). 

The primary structure of the human NaS2 protein consists of 627 amino acids, sharing over 40% amino acid identity with other mammalian NaS1 orthologs (Dawson2006Molecular). The secondary and tertiary structures are not explicitly detailed in the available context, but the presence of transmembrane domains suggests a complex folding pattern typical of membrane proteins. 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, affecting the protein's function, although specific modifications for SLC13A4 are not detailed in the context. The gene's expression and function are crucial for maintaining sulfate metabolic balance, with implications in various physiological processes and potential roles in disease states (Yang2021SLC13A4).

## Function
SLC13A4 is a sodium-dependent sulfate transporter that plays a crucial role in maintaining sulfate homeostasis in the body. It is primarily expressed in the placenta and brain, where it facilitates the uptake of sulfate ions, which are essential for various physiological processes, including the sulfonation of extracellular matrix constituents, membrane phospholipids, neurosteroids, and neurotransmitters (Zhang2019Postnatal). In the brain, SLC13A4 is expressed in the choroid plexus and pia mater, where it is vital for maintaining sulfate availability, which is necessary for proper neurogenesis and the maturation of synaptic connections (Zhang2019Postnatal).

Sulfate transport by SLC13A4 affects cellular sulfonation reactions, impacting the metabolism of neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine peptides, which are crucial for the establishment of perineuronal nets that regulate neuroplasticity (Zhang2019Postnatal). The gene's expression in the placenta is critical for mediating sulfate supply to the fetus, supporting fetal development by ensuring adequate sulfate levels for processes such as the sulfonation of glycosaminoglycans, which are important for tissue development (Rakoczy2015Loss). The absence of SLC13A4 can lead to severe developmental abnormalities, highlighting its essential role in maintaining sulfate homeostasis during development (Rakoczy2015Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SLC13A4 gene have been linked to several developmental and neurodevelopmental disorders. In mice, haploinsufficiency of SLC13A4 leads to atypical phenotypes, including deficits in social interaction and long-term memory, which are associated with altered sulfate availability during critical developmental periods (Zhang2019Postnatal). These phenotypes suggest a potential link to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as some behaviors in SLC13A4 haploinsufficient mice overlap with those observed in ASD models (Zhang2019Postnatal). 

SLC13A4 is also crucial for placental sulfate transport, and its disruption can result in severe fetal abnormalities and embryonic lethality in mice, highlighting its importance in fetal development (Rakoczy2015Loss). The gene's role in sulfate metabolism is significant for maintaining normal brain function, and its impairment may contribute to conditions like intellectual disability and schizophrenia, particularly those involving social and memory deficits (Zhang2019Postnatal).

In the context of cancer, decreased expression of SLC13A4 is associated with poor survival outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker (Yang2021SLC13A4).
