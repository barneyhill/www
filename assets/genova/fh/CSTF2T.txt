# CSTF2T

## Overview
CSTF2T is a gene that encodes the τCstF-64 protein, a variant of the cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2, which is involved in the polyadenylation of mRNA in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a polyadenylation factor and plays a pivotal role in the formation of the 3' ends of mRNAs, influencing mRNA stability, export, and translation. The τCstF-64 protein is particularly significant in male germ cells, where it compensates for the inactivation of the X-linked CSTF2 gene during meiosis, facilitating alternative polyadenylation necessary for spermatogenesis (Dass2002The; Grozdanov2018Cstf2t). The CSTF2T gene is intronless and is believed to have arisen through retroposition, similar to other germ cell-expressed autosomal paralogs of X-chromosomal genes (Dass2002The). Mutations in CSTF2T have been associated with male infertility, underscoring its critical role in reproductive health (Gorukmez2020First). Additionally, τCstF-64 interacts with various proteins and RNA sequences as part of the cleavage stimulation factor complex, highlighting its importance in mRNA processing and gene expression regulation (Yao2013Overlapping).

## Structure
The CSTF2T gene encodes the human variant of the CstF-64 polyadenylation protein, known as τCstF-64. This protein is 616 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of approximately 64,442.90 Da (Dass2002The). The primary structure of τCstF-64 includes an N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) of the RRM type, which is identical to that of the mouse CstF-64 (Dass2002The). The protein also contains two unique insert regions not found in somatic homologs, making it larger than the somatic CstF-64 (Dass2002The). Additionally, it has a conserved C-terminal domain that may interact with the transcriptional coactivator PC4 (Dass2002The).

The protein features 9 MEARA/G repeats and a CstF-77-interaction domain, which is recognized by the 6A9 monoclonal antibody, diagnostic for CstF-64 (Dass2002The). The CSTF2T gene is intronless and is thought to have arisen through retroposition, similar to other germ cell-expressed autosomal paralogs of X-chromosomal genes (Dass2002The). The protein is expressed in male germ cells and the brain, suggesting a role in male fertility (Dass2002The). The context does not provide specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of the CSTF2T protein.

## Function
The CSTF2T gene encodes the τCstF-64 protein, a variant of the CstF-64 polyadenylation protein, which plays a crucial role in the polyadenylation process of mRNA in eukaryotic cells. This process is essential for the formation of the 3' ends of most mRNAs, impacting mRNA stability, export, and translation, thereby influencing global gene expression and cellular function (Dass2002The; Li2012The). τCstF-64 is particularly important in male germ cells, where it compensates for the inactivation of the X-linked CSTF2 gene during meiosis. It is involved in alternative polyadenylation, which is critical for the restructuring of gene expression necessary for spermatogenesis (Dass2002The; Grozdanov2018Cstf2t).

In the testis, τCstF-64 is expressed in germ cells and is necessary for the proper expression of testis-specific histones and histone-like proteins, which are vital for chromatin packaging and genome integrity during sperm development (Grozdanov2018Cstf2t). The absence of τCstF-64 leads to defects in spermatogenesis, resulting in male infertility, highlighting its essential role in reproductive health (Dass2007Loss). τCstF-64 is active in the nucleus, where it participates in the cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA, ensuring accurate mRNA processing and transcription termination (Li2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CSTF2T gene have been linked to male infertility. A study identified a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.979C>T, p.Arg327*) in a human patient, which was associated with severe oligoasthenospermia and 100% immotile spermatozoa. This mutation was not found in existing mutation databases, suggesting its potential pathogenicity in causing infertility (Gorukmez2020First). In animal models, male mice lacking the CSTF2T gene (Cstf2t -/-) exhibited infertility due to low sperm counts and structural abnormalities in sperm, resembling human oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. These findings underscore the gene's critical role in spermatogenesis and its specific impact on male fertility (Dass2007Loss).

The CSTF2T gene's role extends beyond fertility, as it is involved in mRNA processing, which is crucial for gene expression regulation. Alterations in CSTF2T expression or function can disrupt normal RNA processing, potentially contributing to various diseases. While the context does not provide specific examples of other diseases linked to CSTF2T mutations, its involvement in critical cellular processes suggests that disruptions could have broader implications for human health.

## Interactions
CSTF2T, also known as CstF64τ, is involved in mRNA 3′ end processing and interacts with various proteins and RNA sequences. It is a component of the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) complex, where it interacts with proteins such as CstF77 and CstF50 (Yao2013Overlapping). CSTF2T and its paralog CstF64 can bind to UG-repeat RNA sequences with high affinity, and their binding sites are enriched near polyadenylation sites, indicating a role in mRNA processing (Yao2013Overlapping).

CSTF2T interacts with symplekin, a subunit of the CPSF complex, although this interaction is less efficient compared to CstF64 due to the inhibitory effect of the P/G-rich domain in CSTF2T (Yao2013Overlapping). Despite this, CSTF2T may still associate with symplekin indirectly through dimerization with CstF64, which is crucial for linking CstF to CPSF (Yao2013Overlapping). The interactions between CSTF2T, CstF64, and symplekin are essential for efficient RNA processing, particularly in histone RNA 3′-end formation (Ruepp2011Interactions). These interactions highlight the functional redundancy and distinct roles of CSTF2T and CstF64 in mRNA 3′ processing and alternative polyadenylation regulation (Yao2013Overlapping).
