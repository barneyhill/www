# TBPL2

## Overview
The TBPL2 gene encodes the TATA-box binding protein like 2, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression during oogenesis. As a paralog of the TATA-binding protein (TBP), TBPL2 is specifically expressed in oocytes and is crucial for the initiation of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Unlike TBP, TBPL2 does not interact with TAFs or form a TFIID complex; instead, it forms a stable association with TFIIA, facilitating transcription from oocyte-specific promoters (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA; Yu2020TBPL2TFIIA). The protein's unique structure, characterized by a bipartite domain with a conserved C-terminal core, allows it to bind DNA and regulate the maternal transcriptome necessary for oocyte development and fertility (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA; Akhtar2011TBPrelated). Mutations in TBPL2 have been linked to primary female infertility, underscoring its essential role in oocyte maturation and reproductive competence (Wang2021A).

## Structure
The TBPL2 protein is a TBP-like factor with a bipartite structure, consisting of variable N-terminal domains and relatively well-conserved C-terminal core domains. The C-terminal core domains form a saddle-like structure with a concave surface that binds to DNA, similar to the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA; Yu2020TBPL2TFIIA). This core domain shares a high degree of identity with TBP, allowing TBPL2 to bind canonical TATA box sequences (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA; Akhtar2011TBPrelated).

The N-terminal domain of TBPL2 is distinct from that of TBP, with only 23% identity, which may influence its interaction capabilities and prevent interaction with TAFs in growing oocytes (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA). TBPL2 contains a Proline-rich region in its N-terminal domain, which is not found in other TBP paralogs and may mediate new protein-protein interactions (Ravarani2020Molecular).

TBPL2 forms stable complexes with TFIIA, which is crucial for its role in transcription initiation during oocyte growth (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA). The protein's structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets typical of DNA-binding proteins, and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate its activity (Akhtar2011TBPrelated).

## Function
The TBPL2 gene, also known as TATA-box binding protein like 2, plays a crucial role in transcription regulation in human cells. It is a paralog of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and is essential for RNA polymerase II transcription initiation, particularly in oocytes. TBPL2 is expressed exclusively in oocytes and is vital for mediating oocyte-specific transcription necessary for oogenesis (Wang2021A). It establishes the maternal transcriptome through oocyte-specific promoter usage, regulating the activity of deadenylation, decapping, and decay complexes involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA stability and translation (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA).

TBPL2 does not interact with Pol I and Pol III, indicating its specific role in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. It utilizes a maternal-specific transcription start site (TSS) grammar, contributing to the establishment of a TBPL2-dependent oocyte transcriptome and proteome necessary for development and fertilization competence (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA). The gene's function is critical for the growth and maturation of oocytes, and its absence leads to oocyte maturation arrest and degeneration, resulting in primary female infertility (Wang2021A). TBPL2's role in transcription is distinct from TBP, as it does not interact with TAFs or ALF, possibly due to differences in their N-terminal domains (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBPL2 gene have been associated with primary female infertility due to oocyte maturation arrest and degeneration. A specific homozygous missense mutation (c.895T>C; p.C299R) in TBPL2 was identified in two infertile sisters from a consanguineous family, which impaired the transcription initiation function of TBPL2. This mutation affects the DNA-binding region of the protein, crucial for its function, leading to oocyte germinal vesicle (GV) arrest and degeneration (Wang2021A).

In mice, TBPL2 is essential for oocyte development and female fertility. TBPL2 knockout mice exhibit sterility due to defective folliculogenesis, characterized by an increased number of immature follicles and abnormal oocytes. Despite hormonal stimulation, these mice do not ovulate mature oocytes, indicating a failure in oogenesis (Gazdag2009TBP2). The absence of TBPL2 results in impaired transcription and chromatin organization, leading to infertility (Gazdag2009TBP2).

TBPL2's role in transcription regulation is specific to oogenesis, and its deficiency leads to significant changes in the ovary transcriptome, particularly affecting genes specifically expressed in oocytes (Gazdag2009TBP2). These findings underscore the critical role of TBPL2 in maintaining female fertility.

## Interactions
TBPL2, also known as TRF3 or TBP2, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in oocyte-specific transcription. Unlike the canonical TATA-binding protein (TBP), TBPL2 does not form a TFIID complex. Instead, it forms a stable association with TFIIA, specifically with the TFIIA-αβ and TFIIA-γ subunits, creating a unique transcription complex in oocytes (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA; Yu2020TBPL2TFIIA). This complex is essential for RNA polymerase II transcription initiation in oocytes, particularly from promoters containing TATA-like motifs (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA).

TBPL2's interaction with TFIIA is significant, as it does not interact with TAFs in growing oocytes, which is attributed to differences in their N-terminal domains (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA; Yu2020TBPL2TFIIA). TBPL2 also does not interact with Pol I-associated SL1 or Pol III-associated TFIIIB complexes, indicating its specific role in Pol II transcription initiation (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA). In NIH3T3 cells, TBPL2 can form TFIID-like complexes but shows a stronger interaction with TFIIA, suggesting its intrinsic ability to interact with TFIIA (Yu2020TBPL2/TFIIA).
