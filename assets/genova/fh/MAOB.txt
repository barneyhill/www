# MAOB

## Overview
The MAOB gene encodes the enzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO B), a member of the flavin monoamine oxidase family, which is primarily located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This enzyme plays a critical role in the catabolism of neuroactive and vasoactive amines through oxidative deamination, impacting neurotransmitter regulation and neuronal signaling. MAO B is particularly involved in the metabolism of dopamine, phenylethylamine, and benzylamine, contributing to the maintenance of neurotransmitter balance in the brain (Shih1999MONOAMINE; Ramsay2016Molecular). The enzyme's activity is associated with the production of hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species, which underscores its involvement in oxidative stress and its implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's (Naoi2017Type). The regulation of MAOB expression and activity is complex, involving various transcription factors and genetic polymorphisms that influence its role in health and disease (Shih2004Regulation; Jakubauskiene2012GA).

## Structure
The human monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) protein is a mitochondrial outer membrane enzyme composed of 520 amino acids, forming a compact structure. Its primary structure includes a sequence that facilitates the binding of a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, essential for its catalytic activity (Cesura1998Structurefunction; Binda2001Structure). The secondary structure of MAO B features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Iacovino2018The).

The tertiary structure of MAO B is characterized by a globular shape with distinct domains, including a FAD-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain. The FAD-binding domain is crucial for stabilizing the enzyme and enabling its catalytic function (Shi2019Structure‐Based). The quaternary structure of MAO B is a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the dimer's stability through extensive monomer-monomer interactions, burying a significant surface area (Binda2001Structure; Iacovino2018The).

MAO B is anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane via a C-terminal transmembrane helix, which is partly disordered, allowing interaction with the lipid bilayer (Iacovino2018The). The enzyme's active site features a hydrophobic cavity, with key residues such as Tyr398 and Tyr435 forming an aromatic sandwich that stabilizes substrate binding (Vianello2016The). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which may influence its activity and stability.

## Function
Monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) is an enzyme located in the outer membrane of mitochondria, primarily in glial cells, serotonergic neurons, and histaminergic neurons in the brain. It plays a crucial role in the oxidative deamination of monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, phenylethylamine, and benzylamine, producing hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct (Shih1999MONOAMINE; Ramsay2016Molecular). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining the balance of neurotransmitter levels, which influences neuronal signaling and normal brain function (Ramsay2016Molecular).

In healthy human cells, MAO B regulates neurotransmitter levels, contributing to normal neurological function and behavior. It is involved in the metabolism of phenylethylamine and possibly dopamine, which are important for mood regulation and cognitive processes (Shih1999MONOAMINE). The enzyme's activity is also linked to the production of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide, which can contribute to oxidative stress if not properly managed (Naoi2017Type).

MAO B's activity increases with age, which may be associated with the proliferation of glial cells and has implications for age-related changes in brain function (Shih1999MONOAMINE). The enzyme's regulation involves various transcription factors, including Sp1 and Sp3, which influence its expression in different tissues (Shih2004Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the MAOB gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In PD, increased MAOB activity is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), contributing to neurodegeneration. This is exacerbated by a G/A polymorphism in intron 13 of the MAOB gene, which enhances splicing efficiency and is linked to higher MAOB protein levels, increasing the risk of PD (Naoi2015Modulation; Jakubauskiene2012GA). The A allele of this polymorphism is associated with a two-fold increased risk of developing PD (Jakubauskiene2012GA).

In Alzheimer's disease, elevated MAOB expression is observed in the brains of patients, correlating with increased amyloid-beta levels, which are characteristic of the disease (Naoi2017Type). MAOB inhibitors, such as selegiline and rasagiline, are used in PD treatment to increase extracellular dopamine levels and slow neurodegeneration, although their impact on AD progression is less clear (Jones2021The).

MAOB is also implicated in the metabolism of neurotoxicants, such as the conversion of MPTP to MPP+, which is relevant to PD pathogenesis (Costa‐Mallen2004DNA). Elevated MAOB activity in astrocytes contributes to excessive GABA synthesis, leading to tonic inhibition of dopaminergic neurons, a mechanism implicated in PD symptoms (Nam2022Revisiting).

## Interactions
Monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the metabolism of neuroactive and vasoactive amines. It is involved in the oxidative deamination of neurotransmitters such as dopamine. MAOB is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is part of the flavin monoamine oxidase family (Molla2023Integrated). The enzyme's active site is characterized by a hydrophobic bipartite cavity and an aromatic cage formed by tyrosyl residues, which are crucial for its interaction with inhibitors (Molla2023Integrated).

MAOB interacts with various compounds, including neurotoxic substances like MPTP, which it metabolizes into MPP+, a compound that can induce Parkinsonism (Murugan2020Performance). The enzyme also forms complexes with inhibitors such as zonisamide, which binds within the substrate cavity of MAOB through noncovalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces (Binda2010Interactions). These interactions are significant for the enzyme's role in neurological processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases like Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer (Murugan2020Performance; Molla2023Integrated).
