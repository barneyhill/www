# UMPS

## Overview
The UMPS gene encodes the bifunctional enzyme uridine monophosphate synthetase, which is integral to the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides in human cells. This enzyme is categorized as a synthetase and is responsible for catalyzing the final two steps in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, converting orotate to uridine monophosphate (UMP) through its orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) and orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODC) domains (Suttle1988Molecular; Wittmann2008Structures). The UMPS protein is highly conserved across species and functions as a dimer, with its structural integrity being crucial for enzymatic activity (Wittmann2008Structures). Mutations in the UMPS gene can lead to hereditary orotic aciduria, a metabolic disorder characterized by excessive orotic acid excretion and various clinical symptoms (Ravesh2019Next; Wortmann2017Mild).

## Structure
The human UMPS (uridine monophosphate synthetase) protein is a bifunctional enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of UMP. It consists of two distinct domains: the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) domain and the orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODC) domain. The ODC domain is located at the COOH-terminal and comprises 258 amino acids, while the NH2-terminal 214 amino acids form the OPRT domain (Suttle1988Molecular). The ODC domain exhibits a TIM-barrel fold, a common structural motif characterized by eight β-strands surrounded by α-helices, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Appleby2000The).

The quaternary structure of UMPS is typically a dimer, which is essential for its function. This dimeric form is stabilized by interactions across the dimer interface, contributing to the enzyme's catalytic efficiency (Wittmann2008Structures). The enzyme's structure allows for functional protein fusions, as the N and C termini of each monomer are positioned away from the active site (Miller2000Anatomy). The human UMPS protein is highly conserved, with significant homology to similar proteins in other species, such as yeast and E. coli (Suttle1988Molecular).

## Function
The UMPS gene encodes the bifunctional enzyme uridine monophosphate synthase, which plays a critical role in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the final two steps of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway: the conversion of orotate to orotidine-5'-monophosphate (OMP) by the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) domain, and the subsequent decarboxylation of OMP to uridine monophosphate (UMP) by the orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODC) domain (Suttle1988Molecular; Wittmann2008Structures).

UMP is a precursor for the synthesis of other pyrimidine nucleotides, which are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, and thus for cell growth and division (Wortmann2017Mild). The enzyme is located in the cytosol and functions as a dimer in mammals, with the N-terminal 214 amino acids forming the OPRT domain and the C-terminal 258 amino acids forming the ODC domain (LOFFLER2005Pyrimidine; Wortmann2017Mild). The activity of UMPS is crucial for maintaining the balance of pyrimidine nucleotides in cells, which is important for various cellular functions, including DNA replication and repair (LOFFLER2005Pyrimidine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UMPS gene, which encodes the enzyme uridine monophosphate synthase, lead to hereditary orotic aciduria, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by excessive excretion of orotic acid in the urine, megaloblastic anemia, developmental delays, and growth retardation. If untreated, it can result in neutropenia, failure to thrive, sparse hair and nail growth, intellectual disability, and epilepsy (Ravesh2019Next; Wortmann2017Mild). 

Hereditary orotic aciduria is classified into subtypes based on the specific enzyme activity affected. Type I involves deficiencies in both orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase) and orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (OMPdecase), leading to increased urinary excretion of orotate and orotidine. Type II, although less clearly defined, is associated with a defect in OMPdecase and can be alleviated by uridine supplementation (Bailey2009Orotic; Balasubramaniam2014Inborn). 

Mild orotic aciduria can occur in individuals heterozygous for UMPS mutations, often without significant clinical symptoms. These mutations can lead to elevated urinary orotic acid levels, but do not necessarily result in severe clinical consequences (Wortmann2017Mild).
