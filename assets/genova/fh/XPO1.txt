# XPO1

## Overview
XPO1 is a gene that encodes the protein exportin 1, a key nuclear export receptor involved in the transport of various macromolecules from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Exportin 1 is characterized as a nuclear transport protein, specifically functioning as a nuclear export receptor. It plays a critical role in cellular processes by recognizing and binding to leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES) on its cargo molecules, facilitating their translocation through the nuclear pore complex. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, regulating gene expression, and ensuring proper cell cycle progression. The protein's structure is defined by its toroidal shape, formed by 21 HEAT repeats, which allow dynamic interactions with RanGTP and cargo proteins. XPO1 is frequently implicated in cancer, where it is often overexpressed or mutated, affecting the function of tumor suppressors and contributing to disease progression (Yang2023Nuclear; Azmi2020The).

## Structure
Exportin 1 (XPO1) is a nuclear export protein characterized by its toroidal structure, which is formed by 21 consecutive tandem HEAT repeats. Each HEAT repeat consists of an outer A-helix and an inner B-helix, contributing to the protein's superhelical architecture (Azmi2020The). The first three HEAT repeats form the CRIME domain, which interacts with the switch II portion of RanGTP (Azmi2020The). The NES-binding groove is located within HEAT repeats H11 and H12, and the cargo binding site extends from HEAT repeats H11 to H16 (Azmi2020The). 

XPO1's structure is dynamic, with the NES-binding cleft opening upon RanGTP binding, allowing cargo proteins to bind through NES recognition by H11 and H12 residues (Azmi2020The). The protein's conformation is further stabilized by interactions involving the H9 acidic loop and the C-terminal tail (Azmi2020The). 

XPO1 is known to interact with leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES), which bind in a hydrophobic groove on the convex side of the protein (Yang2023Nuclear). The binding of RanGTP to the concave side stabilizes the open groove conformation, facilitating cargo export (Yang2023Nuclear). XPO1 is frequently overexpressed in cancers, affecting the function of tumor suppressors by exporting them to the cytoplasm (Yang2023Nuclear).

## Function
XPO1, also known as exportin 1, is a crucial protein involved in the nuclear export of various macromolecules, including ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a subset of microRNAs (miRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which are essential for ribosomal biogenesis (Azmi2020The). It functions by recognizing nuclear export signals (NES) on its cargo molecules and facilitating their translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex (Baumhardt2020Recognition). This process is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis, regulating gene expression, and ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Baumhardt2020Recognition).

XPO1 also plays a significant role in mitosis by maintaining chromosome integrity and facilitating microtubule nucleation at the kinetochore. It stabilizes microtubules to kinetochores with partner proteins like RanBP2, RanGAP, and RanGTP, which is crucial for proper chromosome segregation (Azmi2020The). Additionally, XPO1 is involved in spindle microtubule assembly and centrosome duplication, processes vital for cell division (Azmi2020The). In transcription regulation, XPO1 affects cell survival and metabolism, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Azmi2020The). XPO1 is active in both the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal functions (Baumhardt2020Recognition).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the XPO1 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In hematological malignancies, XPO1 is frequently overexpressed or mutated, contributing to disease progression. The E571K mutation is a recurrent somatic mutation found in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL), where it is considered a specific genetic feature (Camus2017XPO1; Jardin2016Recurrent). This mutation is associated with poor prognosis and can be detected in plasma cell-free DNA, serving as a potential prognostic marker (Camus2017XPO1).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), XPO1 mutations, including E571K, are linked to high-risk genetic features and accelerated disease progression (Walker2021Recurrent). These mutations are associated with poor survival outcomes and are often found alongside other genetic abnormalities (Walker2021Recurrent).

In multiple myeloma (MM), high XPO1 expression correlates with shorter survival and resistance to treatments like bortezomib (Camus2017XPO1). XPO1 is also implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where mutations are associated with a higher tumor mutational burden and poorer survival outcomes (Nagasaka2021Impact). These findings highlight the potential of targeting XPO1 in cancer therapy and its utility as a biomarker for disease monitoring.

## Interactions
Exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as CRM1, is a key nuclear export receptor that interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids. XPO1 is responsible for the nuclear export of proteins containing a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES). It forms complexes with RanGTP, facilitating the translocation of cargo through the nuclear pore complex (Fung2014Atomic).

XPO1 interacts with several tumor suppressor proteins, including p53, p21, p27, and p73, as well as other regulatory proteins like nucleophosmin-1, PP2A, FOXO, β-catenin/APC, topoisomerase II, and IκB. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of apoptosis and cell growth, as XPO1 mediates their export from the nucleus, thereby modulating their activity (Yoshimura2014Induction).

The interaction of XPO1 with its cargo is inhibited by selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) compounds, such as KPT-185 and KPT-251. These inhibitors bind to the NES-binding groove of XPO1, preventing the formation of XPO1-cargo complexes and disrupting nuclear export processes (Lapalombella2012Selective).

Mutations in XPO1, such as the E571K mutation, can alter its localization and interaction with other proteins, including importin β1 (IPO1), which affects its nuclear export function and has implications in B-cell lymphoma (Miloudi2020XPO1E571K).
