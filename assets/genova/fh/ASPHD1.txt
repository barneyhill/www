# ASPHD1

## Overview
The ASPHD1 gene encodes the protein aspartate beta-hydroxylase domain containing 1, which is a member of the α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent dioxygenase family. This protein is involved in hydroxylation processes, playing a crucial role in the regulation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites and potentially influencing epigenetic regulation through chromatin demethylation (Sun2023Aspartate). ASPHD1 is predominantly expressed in the brain and pituitary gland, suggesting its involvement in neuronal functions and processes such as neurogenesis and neuronal migration (Männik2019Leveraging). The gene's expression is notably upregulated in certain cancers, including skin cutaneous melanoma, where it is associated with a favorable prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Sun2023Aspartate). Despite its recognized roles, the specific functions of ASPHD1 in normal physiology and its broader implications in disease contexts remain areas of active research.

## Structure


## Function
The ASPHD1 gene encodes a protein involved in hydroxylation, a biochemical process that introduces a hydroxyl group into an organic compound. This protein is part of the family of α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent dioxygenases, which are known to regulate tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites, including αKG, 2-hydroxyglutarate, and fumarate. These metabolites are linked to chromatin demethylation, suggesting a role in epigenetic regulation (Sun2023Aspartate).

ASPHD1 is co-expressed with genes related to synaptic vesicle function, such as SEZ6L2 and CELF4, indicating its involvement in neuronal processes. It is part of a cluster of genes enriched for functions like 'neuron projection' and 'transmission across chemical synapses,' highlighting its potential role in neurogenesis and neuronal migration (Männik2019Leveraging).

In terms of cellular localization, ASPHD1 is predominantly expressed in the brain and pituitary gland, suggesting its activity in these regions (Männik2019Leveraging). However, the specific function of ASPHD1 in healthy human cells remains less understood, and its role in neoplasm progression is not clear (Sun2023Aspartate).

## Clinical Significance
ASPHD1 (aspartate beta-hydroxylase domain containing 1) has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. In skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), ASPHD1 expression is significantly upregulated, especially in metastatic tissues, and is associated with a better prognosis. High levels of ASPHD1 expression correlate with longer overall survival in SKCM patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Sun2023Aspartate). The gene's expression is linked to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and immune checkpoints, indicating its role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (Sun2023Aspartate).

ASPHD1 is also associated with diseases such as schizophrenia 3 and chromosome 16P11.2 Deletion Syndrome, although the specific mechanisms and implications of these associations are not fully detailed (Sun2023Aspartate). The gene's involvement in cancer progression is further supported by its association with signaling pathways like proline hydroxylation and N-linked glycosylation, which are related to cancer development (Sun2023Aspartate).

Overall, ASPHD1's expression and interactions in various cancers, particularly SKCM, highlight its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its role in other diseases.
