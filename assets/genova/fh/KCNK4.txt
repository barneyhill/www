# KCNK4

## Overview
KCNK4 is a gene that encodes the potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 4, commonly referred to as TRAAK. This protein is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which is characterized by its unique structure comprising two pore-forming domains and four transmembrane segments per subunit. TRAAK channels are integral membrane proteins that function as mechano-gated ion channels, playing a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability. They are sensitive to mechanical and chemical stimuli, including lipids like arachidonic acid, and are activated by positive pressure. The proper functioning of these channels is essential for various physiological processes, including neurotransmitter release and thermoperception, particularly in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Yan2023Expanding; Bauer2018Mutations).

## Structure
The KCNK4 gene encodes a potassium channel that is part of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, specifically known as TRAAK. This channel is composed of 393 amino acids and features four transmembrane segments (TM1-4) and two pore domains (P1 and P2) per subunit, which are characteristic of the K2P channel family (Yan2023Expanding). The protein forms homodimers, with each subunit contributing to the formation of the channel's selectivity filter (Bauer2018Mutations).

The secondary structure includes four transmembrane helices (M1 to M4) and two pore domains that are crucial for its function. The M4 helix can transition between 'up' and 'down' conformations, which is significant for the gating mechanism of the channel (Bauer2018Mutations). The channel's quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is essential for its function as a mechano-gated ion channel (Bauer2018Mutations).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common and can regulate the activity of the channel, although specific modifications for KCNK4 are not detailed in the provided context. The channel is sensitive to mechanical and chemical stimuli, playing a role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and cellular excitability (Gripp2021Syndromic).

## Function
The KCNK4 gene encodes a potassium channel protein that is part of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, specifically the TRAAK/TREK subfamily. These channels are involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability in healthy human cells (Yan2023Expanding; Bauer2018Mutations). KCNK4 channels contribute to the stabilization of the resting membrane potential by providing voltage-independent 'leak' potassium currents, which are crucial for modulating neuronal excitability and action potential dynamics (Beltrán20132Aminoethoxydiphenyl; Mariani2021Hereditary).

KCNK4 channels are sensitive to mechanical stimuli and certain lipids, such as arachidonic acid, and are typically activated by positive pressure and arachidonic acid, leading to increased current amplitudes (Bauer2018Mutations). These channels are expressed in various tissues, including the central and peripheral nervous systems, where they play a role in processes such as neurotransmitter release, hormone secretion, and thermoperception (Beltrán20132Aminoethoxydiphenyl; Yan2023Expanding). The proper function of KCNK4 channels is essential for maintaining normal neuronal activity and ensuring the correct balance of ions across cell membranes, which is vital for cellular processes and organismal homeostasis (Yan2023Expanding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNK4 gene are associated with a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by facial dysmorphism, gingival overgrowth, hypertrichosis, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. These mutations, such as p.Ala172Glu and p.Ala244Pro, result in a gain of function in the KCNK4 channel, leading to increased basal potassium conductance and impaired response to mechanical stimuli and arachidonic acid (Gripp2021Syndromic; Bauer2018Mutations). The clinical features of KCNK4-related disorders overlap with those of Zimmermann-Laband syndrome and Temple-Baraitser syndrome, which are linked to variants in other potassium channel genes like KCNH1 (Gripp2021Syndromic).

The KCNK4 mutations are de novo events and have been confirmed through whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing (Bauer2018Mutations). These mutations affect the gating mechanism of the channel, potentially altering its structural conformation and ion conduction ability (Bauer2018Mutations). The p.Ala244Pro mutation, in particular, is associated with hereditary gingival fibromatosis, where gingival fibroblasts become permanently activated, leading to excessive growth and increased production of collagen and fibronectin (Mariani2021Hereditary). The JNK pathway is implicated in this process, contributing to the gingival fibromatosis phenotype (Mariani2021Hereditary).
