# CDC42BPA

## Overview
CDC42BPA is a gene that encodes the protein CDC42 binding protein kinase alpha, also known as MRCKα, which is a serine/threonine kinase. This protein is integral to numerous cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell motility, and membrane protein trafficking. As a member of the AGC kinase family, CDC42 binding protein kinase alpha interacts with the small GTPase CDC42, playing a pivotal role in regulating the actin-myosin cytoskeleton and influencing cell shape and motility (Unbekandt2019The; He2017Inhibition). The protein is also involved in erythropoiesis by modulating the internalization and surface expression of key receptors in erythroid cells (Richard2021Myotonic). Additionally, CDC42 binding protein kinase alpha is implicated in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and is involved in focal adhesion signaling, which is crucial for cell adhesion and migration (Kurimchak2020Functional; Bai2021MRCKα).

## Function
CDC42BPA, also known as CDC42 binding protein kinase alpha, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. It interacts with the small GTPase CDC42, which is crucial for regulating the actin-myosin cytoskeleton and cell motility (Unbekandt2019The). CDC42BPA is involved in the regulation of erythropoiesis, the process of red blood cell production, by controlling the internalization and cell surface expression of key receptors such as transferrin receptor type 2 (TFR2), transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), and erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) in erythroid cells (Richard2021Myotonic).

In healthy human cells, CDC42BPA is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences signaling pathways that affect cell shape and motility. It enhances cell motility by promoting contractile force generation and stress fiber formation, strengthening the connection between the cell cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane (He2017Inhibition). This kinase is part of the AGC kinase family and is involved in membrane protein trafficking, potentially influencing the localization and function of its associated receptors during erythroid differentiation (Richard2021Myotonic).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CDC42BPA, also known as MRCKα, is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility. It specifically interacts with the β1 subunit of Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) in epithelial cells, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. This interaction is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments and is independent of the ion-transport activity of NKA. MRCKα colocalizes with the β1 subunit on the cell membrane and is involved in stabilizing tight junction proteins like occludin and zo-1, enhancing alveolar barrier function (Bai2021MRCKα).

In colorectal cancer, CDC42BPA is a downstream effector of CDC42, contributing to cell motility by promoting contractile force generation and stress fiber formation. It interacts with proteins involved in actin dynamics, such as SSH1 and IQGAP2, which are upregulated by miR-29a-3p inhibition (He2017Inhibition). In high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, CDC42BPA is implicated in focal adhesion signaling, affecting the phosphorylation of FAK1 and Paxillin, which are essential for cell adhesion and migration (Kurimchak2020Functional). These interactions highlight CDC42BPA's role in various signaling pathways related to cell movement and growth.
