# ADIPOR2

## Overview
ADIPOR2, or adiponectin receptor 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein involved in metabolic regulation. The ADIPOR2 protein is part of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family and is characterized by a unique seven-transmembrane domain structure, which distinguishes it from typical G-protein-coupled receptors (Tanabe2015Crystal). This receptor plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis by mediating the effects of adiponectin, a hormone involved in glucose regulation and fatty acid breakdown. ADIPOR2's intrinsic ceramidase activity facilitates the conversion of ceramides to sphingosine, which is further phosphorylated to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a key signaling molecule in maintaining membrane fluidity and lipid homeostasis (Vasiliauskaité-Brooks2017Structural; Ruiz2022Sphingosine). The gene's expression and function are significant in the context of metabolic disorders, with alterations linked to conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (Solayman2017In; Iwabu2019AdiponectinAdipoR).

## Structure
The ADIPOR2 protein is characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain architecture, which is distinct from typical G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its C-terminus-out topology (Tanabe2015Crystal). This structure includes a large internal cavity formed by the transmembrane helices, which is crucial for its function (Tanabe2015Crystal). The protein's tertiary structure features a zinc-binding site within the 7TM domain, coordinated by three conserved histidine residues and a water molecule, forming a tetrahedral coordination. This zinc-binding site is essential for both structural stability and functional activity, such as adiponectin-stimulated signaling (Vasiliauskaité-Brooks2017Structural; Tanabe2015Crystal).

ADIPOR2 also exhibits intrinsic ceramidase activity, facilitated by its zinc-binding domain, which hydrolyzes ceramides into sphingosine and free fatty acids. This enzymatic activity is enhanced by adiponectin and involves key residues like H202, H348, H352, and D219 (Vasiliauskaité-Brooks2017Structural). The protein's structure is conserved across species, indicating a shared functional role within the PAQR family (Vasiliauskaité-Brooks2017Structural). The ADIPOR2 protein does not have known splice variant isoforms mentioned in the provided context.

## Function
ADIPOR2, or adiponectin receptor 2, plays a critical role in maintaining membrane fluidity and lipid homeostasis in human cells. It is involved in the regulation of cell membrane composition by promoting the desaturation of fatty acids and the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into membrane phospholipids. This function is crucial for preventing membrane rigidification, especially when cells are exposed to saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (Pilon2021Paradigm; Ruiz2019AdipoR1).

ADIPOR2 exerts its effects through pathways involving sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which acts via S1PR3 and SREBP1 to enhance fatty acid desaturation and maintain membrane fluidity. This pathway also involves the transcription factor PPARγ, which is activated by S1P to regulate lipid metabolism (Ruiz2022Sphingosine). The receptor's ceramidase activity is essential for converting ceramides to sphingosine, which is then phosphorylated to form S1P, further supporting membrane homeostasis (Ruiz2022Sphingosine).

In the absence of ADIPOR2, cells exhibit increased membrane rigidity, transcriptional mis-regulation, and mitochondrial respiration defects, highlighting its importance in cellular function and viability under SFA stress (Ruiz2021Extensive). This function is conserved across species, as demonstrated in studies involving C. elegans (Ruiz2019AdipoR1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADIPOR2 gene are associated with several metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Variants in ADIPOR2 have been linked to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. In particular, mutations such as R126W, L160Q, and L195P are predicted to have deleterious effects on protein function, potentially contributing to disease susceptibility (Solayman2017In). 

The expression of ADIPOR2 is notably reduced in obesity and type 2 diabetes models, which contributes to insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism. This reduction is associated with decreased adiponectin sensitivity and increased hyperinsulinemia, creating a 'vicious cycle' that exacerbates metabolic dysfunction (Iwabu2019AdiponectinAdipoR). 

Genetic variations in ADIPOR2, such as the rs767870 polymorphism, have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and are linked to changes in cardiovascular health markers like intima-media thickness and flow-mediated dilation (Halvatsiotis2010Genetic). Additionally, certain ADIPOR2 gene variants are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, suggesting a role in disease progression (Siitonen2011Association).

## Interactions
ADIPOR2, a receptor for adiponectin, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its signaling pathways. It forms both homomeric and heteromeric complexes with AdipoR1, which exhibit distinct ligand binding and intracellular signaling properties. These complexes are found at the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum and dissociate upon adiponectin binding, with heteromers dissociating faster than homomers (Almabouada2013Adiponectin).

ADIPOR2 interacts with several proteins, including APPL1, ERP46, RACK1, and CK2b, which are important for adiponectin signaling. These interactions are involved in pathways such as PPARα activation, distinct from AdipoR1's role in AMPK phosphorylation (Buechler2010Adiponectin; Keshvari). The receptor's ability to form high-order complexes is suggested by the presence of a GXXXG dimerization motif, similar to AdipoR1 (Almabouada2013Adiponectin).

ADIPOR2's interactions also include its involvement in the adipocytokine signaling pathway, influencing metabolic processes like fatty-acid oxidation and glucose uptake. It is part of a gene network with ADIPOQ and CDH13, highlighting its role in metabolic regulation and potential implications in obesity-related conditions (Bag2014Revealing).
