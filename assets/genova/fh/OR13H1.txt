# OR13H1

## Overview
OR13H1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily H member 1, which belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR13H1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants to trigger neuronal responses. Beyond its olfactory functions, OR13H1 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the skin, where it participates in various cellular processes, including keratinocyte proliferation and cytokine production. The gene is conserved between humans and chimpanzees, suggesting its evolutionary importance (Uehara2021Non‐invasive; GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

## Function
OR13H1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR13H1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR13H1 and other olfactory receptors are expressed in non-olfactory tissues, including the skin. In the skin, these receptors are involved in various cellular processes such as epidermal/keratinocyte proliferation, migration, regeneration, and cytokine production. The downregulation of OR13H1 in sensitive skin suggests a potential link to disturbances in epidermal homeostasis, although it remains unclear whether this is a cause or consequence of sensitive skin (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

OR13H1 is also shared between humans and chimpanzees, indicating its potential evolutionary significance (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells beyond its role in olfaction and skin processes are not fully elucidated.
