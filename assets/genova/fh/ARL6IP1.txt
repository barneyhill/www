# ARL6IP1

## Overview
ARL6IP1 is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6 interacting protein 1, which is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is characterized by its reticulon homology domain (RHD)-like structural elements, which include transmembrane helical hairpins that contribute to its role in shaping the ER membrane (Foronda2023Heteromeric). As a transmembrane protein, ARL6IP1 is involved in forming ER tubules and maintaining ER structure through homo-oligomeric complexes and interactions with other proteins such as atlastin and FAM134B, an ER-phagy receptor (Yamamoto2014Arl6IP1; Foronda2023Heteromeric). The protein's function extends to ER-phagy, a selective autophagy process, and it plays a role in neuronal health by regulating glutamate transport (Wakil2019Truncating). Mutations in the ARL6IP1 gene have been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, highlighting its clinical significance in neurological disorders (Wakil2019Truncating).

## Structure
ARL6IP1 is a protein characterized by the presence of reticulon homology domain (RHD)-like structural elements, which include two long hydrophobic regions forming transmembrane helical hairpins (TM1+2 and TM3+4) separated by an accessible linker segment (Foronda2023Heteromeric). Both the amino and C termini of ARL6IP1 face the cytoplasm, and the protein is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Foronda2023Heteromeric). The secondary structure involves short hairpin transmembrane domains crucial for its membrane-shaping function, similar to reticulons (Yamamoto2014Arl6IP1).

ARL6IP1 forms homo-oligomers in the ER membrane, suggesting a quaternary structure where it forms complexes of at least four monomers (Yamamoto2014Arl6IP1). It also forms heterodimers with FAM134B, which are involved in ER-phagy (Foronda2023Heteromeric). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination at lysine residues K96, K114, and K130, which influence its conformation and interactions, particularly with FAM134B and LC3B (Foronda2023Heteromeric). These modifications are crucial for its role in ER-phagy and maintaining proteostasis (Foronda2023Heteromeric). The structural features and interactions of ARL6IP1 are essential for its function in shaping the ER membrane and participating in cellular processes like ER-phagy.

## Function
The ARL6IP1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in mammalian cells. It is involved in the formation of ER tubules, contributing to the structural organization of the ER by stabilizing its tubular structure through homo-oligomeric complexes (Yamamoto2014Arl6IP1). ARL6IP1 contains reticulon homology domains (RHDs) and interacts with atlastin, a GTPase that mediates the formation of the tubular ER network, indicating its role in ER membrane shaping (Yamamoto2014Arl6IP1).

ARL6IP1 is also involved in ER-phagy, a selective form of autophagy targeting the ER for degradation. It forms heteromeric complexes with FAM134B, an ER-phagy receptor, which are essential for the degradation and recycling of ER components (Foronda2023Heteromeric). The ubiquitination of ARL6IP1 enhances its interaction with FAM134B and the autophagic machinery, facilitating ER-phagy (Foronda2023Heteromeric).

In neurons, ARL6IP1 regulates glutamate transport, and its disruption is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining neuronal health and function (Wakil2019Truncating). Overall, ARL6IP1 is essential for maintaining ER structure and function, contributing to cellular homeostasis and stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARL6IP1 gene have been linked to a severe form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a neurological disorder characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity, primarily affecting the lower limbs. A specific truncating variant, c.112C > T: p.Arg38*, results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein and loss of function. This mutation has been identified as the genetic cause of a fatal form of complicated HSP in a Saudi family, where affected individuals exhibited severe clinical features, including spastic paraplegia, developmental delay, microcephaly, cerebral atrophy, and neonatal death (Wakil2019Truncating).

Alterations in ARL6IP1 expression have also been studied in the context of cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP). In a rat model, reduced expression of ARL6IP1 was observed in CIBP, which was reversed by oxycodone treatment. This suggests a potential role for ARL6IP1 in pain modulation and response to opioid treatment, although its direct involvement in human disease requires further investigation (Deng2019Proteomic).

Overall, disruptions in ARL6IP1 function, whether through genetic mutations or altered expression, can significantly impact neurological health, contributing to the pathogenesis of disorders like hereditary spastic paraplegia and potentially influencing pain mechanisms.

## Interactions
ARL6IP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dynamics and ER-phagy. It forms heterodimers with FAM134B, an ER-phagy receptor, which are crucial for ER-phagy processes. This interaction is facilitated by the ubiquitination of ARL6IP1, particularly at lysine 96, mediated by the E3 ligase AMFR. This modification enhances ARL6IP1's interaction with FAM134B and LC3B, a protein involved in autophagy (Foronda2023Heteromeric). ARL6IP1 also interacts with FAM134A and FAM134C, homologues of FAM134B, indicating its involvement in a broader network of ER-phagy receptors (Foronda2023Heteromeric).

ARL6IP1 is involved in forming multi-protein clusters with other ER-shaping proteins, such as reticulon proteins RTN1, RTN3, and RTN4, which are essential for ER-phagy and membrane remodeling (Foronda2023Heteromeric). It also binds to atlastin, a GTPase that mediates the formation of the tubular ER network, suggesting a role in shaping the ER membrane similar to reticulon family proteins (Yamamoto2014Arl6IP1).

In addition to protein interactions, ARL6IP1 mRNA is stabilized by the RNA binding protein HuD, which protects it from degradation, highlighting a regulatory mechanism at the RNA level (Bishayee2022RNA).
