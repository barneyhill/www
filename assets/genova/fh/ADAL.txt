# ADAL

## Overview
The ADAL gene encodes the adenosine deaminase-like protein, which is a member of the deaminase enzyme family. These enzymes are involved in the catalysis of the deamination process, which is crucial for nucleotide metabolism and the regulation of nucleic acid function. The adenosine deaminase-like protein shares structural similarities with other deaminases, suggesting a potential role in modulating adenosine levels within cells. Although the precise biological functions of the ADAL gene and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, they are believed to be involved in various cellular processes, including RNA editing and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of ADAL in human health and disease.
