# C12orf50

## Overview
C12orf50 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 12 open reading frame 50. This protein is currently not well-characterized in terms of its specific biological function or classification into a known protein family, such as kinases or receptors. Despite the limited understanding of its precise role, C12orf50 has been implicated in various biological processes and conditions through differential expression and genomic alterations. Notably, it has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, Meckel syndrome, cerebello-oculo-renal syndrome, and male infertility, particularly non-obstructive azoospermia. These associations suggest that C12orf50 may play a role in diverse physiological and pathological contexts, although further research is needed to elucidate its exact functions and mechanisms (Coppieters2010CEP290; Omolaoye2022Omics; Vastrad2020Bioinformatics; Molin201312q21).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the C12orf50 gene is not well-defined, but it has been implicated in several conditions through alterations in its expression or genomic deletions. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, C12orf50 is identified as a differentially expressed gene with a log fold change of 2.583041, indicating upregulation, although its specific clinical implications in COVID-19 remain unclear (Vastrad2020Bioinformatics). 

C12orf50 has also been associated with genetic deletions in certain syndromes. For instance, a study on Meckel syndrome identified a microdeletion on chromosome 12q21 that includes C12orf50, suggesting its potential involvement in the syndrome's pathology, although the exact role of C12orf50 in this context is not detailed (Molin201312q21). Similarly, a large heterozygous deletion affecting C12orf50 was noted in a patient with cerebello-oculo-renal syndrome, but the clinical significance of this deletion remains speculative (Coppieters2010CEP290).

In male infertility, C12orf50 was identified as one of the differentially expressed genes in non-obstructive azoospermia, though its specific role in this condition is not fully understood (Omolaoye2022Omics). Overall, while C12orf50 is implicated in various conditions, its precise clinical significance requires further investigation.
