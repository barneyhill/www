# NF1

## Overview
The NF1 gene is a critical component of human genetics, encoding the protein neurofibromin 1, which functions primarily as a tumor suppressor. Neurofibromin 1 is a large, cytoplasmic protein that plays a pivotal role in regulating the Ras signaling pathway by acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). This regulation is essential for controlling cell growth and preventing tumorigenesis. The protein is characterized by several important domains, including the GAP-related domain (GRD), which is crucial for its tumor suppressor activity, and the Sec14-like and pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domains, which are involved in lipid binding and transfer (Scheffzek1998Structural; Bergoug2020Neurofibromin). Neurofibromin 1 is expressed in various tissues, particularly in the nervous system, where it is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing the development of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder associated with mutations in the NF1 gene (Daston1992The; Xu1990The).

## Structure
The NF1 gene encodes the neurofibromin 1 protein, which is involved in regulating cell growth. Neurofibromin 1 is a large protein composed of over 2,800 amino acids and contains several important domains. The GAP-related domain (GRD) is crucial for its function as it accelerates the conversion of active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP, acting as a tumor suppressor (Scheffzek1998Structural). The protein also includes a Sec14-like domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain, which together form a bipartite module known as the SecPH domain. This domain is involved in lipid binding and transfer, with the Sec14-like portion binding glycerophospholipids (Bergoug2020Neurofibromin; Welti2008Structure).

Neurofibromin 1 exhibits secondary structures such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its complex tertiary structure. The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at its cysteine-serine-rich domain (CSRD) and C-terminal domain (CTD), which influences its activity and interactions (Bergoug2020Neurofibromin). Neurofibromin 1 forms a high-affinity dimer, which is essential for its stability and function (Sherekar2020Biochemical). Multiple splice variant isoforms of neurofibromin 1 exist, contributing to its functional diversity (Naschberger2021The).

## Function
The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a protein that functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating the Ras signaling pathway. Neurofibromin acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which is crucial for converting the active GTP-bound form of Ras to its inactive GDP-bound form. This regulation is essential for controlling cell growth and preventing uncontrolled proliferation, which can lead to tumorigenesis (Xu1990The; Shen1996Molecular). Neurofibromin is expressed in various tissues, including neurons, Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes, where it plays a significant role in maintaining normal cellular functions and promoting the differentiated phenotype of neurons (Daston1992The).

In healthy cells, neurofibromin's activity is vital for regulating cell growth and differentiation, preventing the formation of benign and malignant tumors (Shen1996Molecular; HIRVONEN1998DevelopmentalregulationofNF1tumorsuppressorgeneinhumanperipheralnerve). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it associates with cytoplasmic microtubules, indicating its involvement in cellular structural functions (Shen1996Molecular). Neurofibromin's role in the nervous system is particularly important, as its aberrant expression can lead to neurological abnormalities, including learning disabilities and mental retardation (Daston1992The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin, are primarily associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease. This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by a variety of clinical features, including café-au-lait macules, neurofibromas, optic pathway tumors, and skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis (Rasmussen2000NF1; Napolitano2022GenotypePhenotype). NF1 mutations lead to the loss of neurofibromin function, resulting in increased Ras signaling and a predisposition to both benign and malignant tumors, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and gliomas (Thomas2011Exploring; Nix2019An).

The condition exhibits nearly complete penetrance by adulthood, with symptoms typically manifesting by age 6 (Rasmussen2000NF1). NF1 is also associated with learning disabilities and an increased risk of malignancies, such as central nervous system tumors and myeloid leukemias (Rasmussen2000NF1). Variants of NF1, such as Watson syndrome and familial spinal neurofibromatosis, may be allelic to NF1, and features of Noonan syndrome have been observed in some patients, suggesting a genetic link (Rasmussen2000NF1). The NF1 gene is also implicated in sporadic breast cancers, with mutations contributing to malignancy and treatment resistance (Philpott2017The).

## Interactions
Neurofibromin, encoded by the NF1 gene, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a tumor suppressor. It interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), specifically binding to the N-terminal domain of FAK. This interaction is significant for cell adhesion and growth pathways, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays (Kweh2009Neurofibromin). Neurofibromin also forms a high-affinity dimer, which is important for its biological activity and regulation of the RAS signaling pathway (Sherekar2019Biochemical).

The protein interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which modulate its function by binding to its C-terminal domain. This interaction is regulated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation, affecting neurofibromin's ability to interact with Ras-GTP and its GAP activity (Feng2003PKA). Neurofibromin also associates with kinesin-1, linking it to cellular pathways related to neurofibromatosis (Hakimi2002The). These interactions highlight neurofibromin's role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and motility.
