# TTC21B

## Overview
TTC21B is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 21B, also known as intraflagellar transport protein 139 (IFT139). This protein is a critical component of the retrograde transport system within primary cilia, which are essential cellular organelles involved in signal transduction and sensory functions. IFT139 contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, enabling its role in ciliary function and cellular processes (Chen2022Biallelic; Strong2021A). The TTC21B gene is expressed in various tissues, with significant roles in kidney development and cerebellar function, particularly through its involvement in the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway (Driver2017Ttc21b; Bezdíčka2021Tubuloglomerular). Mutations in TTC21B are linked to several ciliopathies, including nephronophthisis and short-rib thoracic dysplasia, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (McInerney‐Leo2015Whole; Gambino2021Case).

## Structure
The TTC21B gene encodes a protein known as intraflagellar transport protein 139 (IFT139), which is a critical component of the retrograde transport system within primary cilia (Strong2021A). This protein contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, facilitating its role in ciliary function (Chen2022Biallelic). The TPR domains contribute to the protein's ability to participate in complex cellular processes by mediating interactions with other proteins.

The primary structure of TTC21B consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with TPR domains, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is essential for its function in ciliary transport. The quaternary structure, if applicable, would involve the assembly of multiple subunits, but specific information on this aspect is not available in the provided context.

Post-translational modifications and splice variants may influence the function and localization of TTC21B, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context (Liu2019Biallelic).

## Function
The TTC21B gene encodes the retrograde intraflagellar transport protein IFT139, which is essential for the proper formation and function of primary cilia in human cells. Primary cilia are immotile microtubular structures that play critical roles in sensing physical or biochemical extracellular signals. In healthy human cells, TTC21B, through its product IFT139, is involved in maintaining the stability of the podocyte cytoskeleton and is implicated in kidney development (Bezdíčka2021Tubuloglomerular). The protein is universally expressed in most tissues, although it has relatively lower expression levels in spermatocytes and respiratory ciliated cells (Chen2022Biallelic).

TTC21B is also crucial for the structure and signaling of Bergmann glia in the cerebellum, where it is necessary for proper granule cell migration and development. This function is likely mediated through its involvement in the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, which is important for granule cell proliferation and differentiation (Driver2017Ttc21b). The gene's role in retrograde intraflagellar transport is vital for maintaining ciliary structure and function, which is essential for various developmental signaling pathways and cellular processes (BenYosef2021Retinal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTC21B gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in the structure or function of cilia. These mutations can lead to nephronophthisis, a kidney disorder characterized by reduced renal concentrating ability, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) before age 30 (BenYosef2021Retinal; Gambino2021Case). TTC21B mutations are also linked to biliary ciliopathy, which includes conditions such as neonatal cholestasis and biliary cirrhosis, often necessitating liver-kidney transplantation (Chen2022Biallelic; Gambino2021Case).

The gene is implicated in short-rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD), a condition characterized by skeletal abnormalities and respiratory issues (McInerney‐Leo2015Whole). Additionally, TTC21B mutations can result in retinal dystrophy, a rare finding in ciliopathy patients, and are associated with other extrarenal manifestations such as congenital hepatic fibrosis and pancreatitis (BenYosef2021Retinal; Gambino2021Case).

The phenotypic outcomes of TTC21B mutations can vary significantly, influenced by genetic background and other modifying factors, such as the presence of additional genetic variants (Snedeker2019Gpr63; Chen2022Biallelic). This variability underscores the complexity of diagnosing and managing ciliopathy syndromes associated with TTC21B mutations.

## Interactions
TTC21B, also known as IFT139, is a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically involved in retrograde transport within primary cilia. It interacts with other proteins in the IFT complex, such as IFT-A and IFT-B, which are essential for the proper formation and function of cilia. These interactions are vital for the trafficking of proteins and signaling molecules within the cilium, impacting various developmental signaling pathways, including the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway (Driver2017Ttc21bis).

Mutations in TTC21B can disrupt these interactions, leading to ciliopathies characterized by skeletal abnormalities and organ involvement. For instance, the p.Pro209Leu and p.Cys14Arg variants in TTC21B are associated with conditions like nephronophthisis and asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, which are linked to the shortening and dysfunction of cilia (Bezdíčka2021Tubuloglomerular).

TTC21B's role in ciliary function also indirectly affects nucleic acid interactions through its involvement in ciliary signaling pathways. This includes the regulation of GLI transcription factors, which are processed within the cilium and are crucial for Shh signal transduction (Driver2017Ttc21bis). The proper functioning of TTC21B is therefore essential for maintaining normal cellular signaling and development.
