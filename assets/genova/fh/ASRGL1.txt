# ASRGL1

## Overview
ASRGL1 is a gene that encodes the protein asparaginase and isoaspartyl peptidase 1, which belongs to the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase family. This protein exhibits dual enzymatic activities, functioning as both an L-asparaginase and a β-aspartyl peptidase, and plays a significant role in amino acid metabolism and protein maintenance within cells. The ASRGL1 protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor and undergoes autocatalytic processing to become active, a process essential for its function. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, testis, and liver. ASRGL1 is involved in the hydrolysis of L-asparagine and isoaspartyl-dipeptides, contributing to the maintenance of protein integrity by preventing the accumulation of damaged proteins. Its activity is particularly crucial in the retina, where it helps maintain retinal tissue and prevent degeneration. Additionally, ASRGL1 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xue2021ASRGL1; Biswas2016A; GarciaMontojo2024TDP43; Cantor2009The).

## Structure
ASRGL1 is a member of the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase family, characterized by its αβ-βα sandwich homodimer structure. This protein undergoes autocatalytic cleavage at the G167-T168 bond to become active, with the active site for substrate hydrolysis located at T219 (GarciaMontojo2024TDP43). The protein's structure includes a conserved αββα folding pattern, typical of Ntn hydrolases, consisting of two antiparallel β-sheets flanked by α-helical layers (Cantor2009The).

ASRGL1 functions as a protease, hydrolyzing L-asparagine and isoaspartyl-peptides. It shares structural similarities with plant-type asparaginases and is the first mammalian enzyme identified in the β-aspartyl peptidase family (Cantor2009The). The protein's activity involves both L-asparaginase and β-aspartyl peptidase activities, with a preference for β-aspartyl dipeptides (Cantor2009The).

The protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor and becomes active after autocatalytic processing, which is crucial for its function (Biswas2022A). The ASRGL1 gene may produce different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
The ASRGL1 gene encodes a protein that functions as an N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase with dual enzymatic activities: L-asparaginase and β-aspartyl peptidase. This protein is involved in the hydrolysis of L-asparagine and isoaspartyl-dipeptides, playing a crucial role in amino acid metabolism and protein maintenance within cells (Li2012Uncoupling; Cantor2009The). ASRGL1 is synthesized as an inactive precursor and undergoes autocatalytic intramolecular processing to become active, with Thr168 acting as the catalytic nucleophile (Li2012Uncoupling).

In healthy human cells, ASRGL1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is abundantly expressed in tissues such as the brain, testis, and liver (Cantor2009The). Its enzymatic activity helps clear isoaspartate-containing peptides, which are common sources of non-enzymatic protein damage, thereby maintaining protein integrity and preventing the accumulation of damaged proteins (Biswas2016A; Cantor2009The). In the retina, ASRGL1 is highly expressed in the photoreceptor layer, suggesting a key role in maintaining retinal tissue and preventing retinal degeneration (Biswas2016A; Biswas2022A). The protein's activity is also linked to the production of L-aspartate, an excitatory neurotransmitter in certain brain regions (Zhou2022Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression levels of the ASRGL1 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In retinal degeneration, a homozygous G178R mutation in ASRGL1 is linked to early onset retinal degeneration in humans, affecting the enzyme's autocatalytic activity and leading to impaired function (Biswas2022A). This mutation results in decreased rod and cone response, progressive vision loss, and night blindness (Biswas2022A). In a mouse model, similar mutations lead to structural and functional abnormalities in photoreceptors, supporting ASRGL1's critical role in normal retinal function (Biswas2022A).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, ASRGL1 interacts with TDP-43, a protein implicated in ALS. Loss of ASRGL1 leads to TDP-43 misfolding and aggregation, contributing to ALS pathology (GarciaMontojo2024TDP43). ASRGL1's role in maintaining TDP-43 homeostasis suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions (GarciaMontojo2024TDP43).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ASRGL1 is upregulated, with higher expression levels associated with poor survival outcomes. It is suggested as a prognostic biomarker, with its expression levels indicative of patient outcomes and potential involvement in immune cell infiltration (Xue2021ASRGL1).

## Interactions
ASRGL1 interacts with several proteins that are significant in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). It interacts with Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 β (GSK3β), which is involved in tau phosphorylation and is elevated in ALS brains. GSK3β inhibitors are being explored for treating neurodegenerative diseases (GarciaMontojo2024TDP43). ASRGL1 also interacts with ERBB2, a receptor for Neuregulin-1, which is elevated in the spinal cord of ALS individuals and may contribute to microglial activation (GarciaMontojo2024TDP43). 

ASRGL1 has a direct interaction with TDP-43, a protein involved in RNA transcription and processing. This interaction was confirmed using a proximity ligation assay in HEK-293 cells, showing intense fluorescence primarily in the perinuclear region. The binding affinity between ASRGL1 and TDP-43 was measured, revealing an apparent binding affinity (EC50) of 36.1 nM (GarciaMontojo2024TDP43). ASRGL1 is suggested to cleave detrimental isoaspartates in TDP-43, preventing its misfolding and aggregation, which are implicated in ALS pathogenesis (GarciaMontojo2024TDP43). 

ASRGL1 also interacts with Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK81P2 and MAPK2K5), which are part of a signal transduction pathway altered in ALS (GarciaMontojo2024TDP43). The prion protein (PRNP) is another interactor, suggesting that ASRGL1 dysfunction might link several neurodegenerative diseases (GarciaMontojo2024TDP43).
