# SMIM26

## Overview
SMIM26 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 26, a transmembrane protein localized in the mitochondria. This protein is characterized by its alpha-helix motif and transmembrane region, which are conserved among mammals, indicating its functional importance. SMIM26 is involved in various mitochondrial processes, including apoptosis regulation, mitochondrial organization, and oxidation-reduction activities. The protein's interactions with numerous mitochondrial proteins suggest its significant role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in cellular responses to stress and damage, as well as its upregulation in certain conditions, such as in boar spermatozoa, which may point to broader biological roles (Yeasmin2021Identification; Konina2021Investigation).

## Structure
The SMIM26 protein, encoded by the LINC00493 gene, is a small integral membrane protein that is predicted to contain a transmembrane region. This region is part of an alpha-helix motif located at the N-terminal of the peptide, which is highly conserved among mammals, suggesting its functional significance (Yeasmin2021Identification). The peptide is 95 amino acids long and is translated from a short open reading frame (sORF) within LINC00493 (Yeasmin2021Identification; Yi2024CircRNA). The protein is localized in the mitochondria, where it interacts with various mitochondrial proteins involved in apoptosis, mitochondrial organization, and oxidation-reduction processes (Yeasmin2021Identification).

The secondary structure of SMIM26 includes two alpha-helix motifs and a beta sheet motif, with the N-terminal alpha-helix predicted to be a transmembrane region (Yeasmin2021Identification). The tertiary and quaternary structures of SMIM26 have not been detailed in the available literature. The protein's role in cellular processes, particularly in cancer, highlights its potential significance in biological research and therapeutic applications (daisybeyond page 5 of 6).

## Function
SMIM26, encoded by the LINC00493 gene, is a small integral membrane protein that plays a significant role in mitochondrial function. The protein contains an alpha-helix motif and a predicted transmembrane region, suggesting its function as a small integral membrane protein involved in membrane-related activities (Yeasmin2021Identification). SMIM26 is conserved among mammals and is upregulated in boar spermatozoa, indicating its potential role in cellular processes related to the membrane (Yeasmin2021Identification).

Functional proteomics studies have identified that SMIM26 interacts with numerous mitochondrial proteins, with a significant enrichment in proteins involved in apoptosis regulation, mitochondrial organization, and oxidation-reduction processes (Yeasmin2021Identification). Immunostaining experiments have confirmed the localization of SMIM26 in mitochondria, where it interacts with these mitochondrial proteins, suggesting its involvement in mitochondrial functions related to apoptosis (Yeasmin2021Identification).

The expression of SMIM26 is upregulated by stimuli with proliferative or apoptotic effects, further supporting its role in mitochondrial functions and its potential involvement in cellular responses to stress or damage (Yeasmin2021Identification). However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
SMIM26, encoded by the LINC00493 gene, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly within the mitochondria. Studies have shown that the SMIM26 protein interacts with numerous mitochondrial proteins, suggesting a role in mitochondrial organization and function (Yeasmin2021Identification; Konina2021Investigation). Functional proteomics analysis identified hundreds of proteins interacting with the LINC00493-encoded peptide, SMIM26, through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry techniques. These interactions are significantly enriched in processes such as apoptosis regulation, mitochondrial organization, and oxidation-reduction processes (Yeasmin2021Identification).

Gene ontology term enrichment analysis further supports the involvement of SMIM26 in mitochondrial processes, with immunostaining experiments confirming its localization in mitochondria (Yeasmin2021Identification). The LINC00493 transcript, which encodes SMIM26, also interacts with various rRNAs, tRNAs, and RNA-binding proteins involved in inflammatory processes and basic cell functions. This suggests that SMIM26 may play a role in cell migration, invasion, and inflammatory processes, potentially influencing tumor development (Konina2021Investigation). These interactions highlight the potential regulatory functions of SMIM26 in cellular processes, particularly those related to mitochondrial function and apoptosis.
