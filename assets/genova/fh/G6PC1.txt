# G6PC1

## Overview
The G6PC1 gene encodes the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1, a critical enzyme in glucose metabolism. This enzyme is a membrane-bound phosphatase located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a pivotal role in the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, a key step in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. The protein is characterized by its nine transmembrane alpha helices, which anchor it to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, facilitating its function as a transmembrane enzyme (Cao2023Amnio). The activity of glucose-6-phosphatase is essential for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis, and its dysfunction is implicated in metabolic disorders such as Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ia (GSD-Ia) (Karthi2019Mutational; Lei1993Mutations). The regulation of G6PC1 expression involves complex interactions with transcription factors such as FoxO1, highlighting its importance in metabolic regulation and its potential impact on conditions like diabetes (Singh2017Crystal).

## Structure
The human glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 (G6PC1) is a membrane-bound enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum, crucial for glucose metabolism. The protein is characterized by its primary structure, which consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes nine transmembrane alpha helices, which are integral to its function as an ER-anchored membrane protein (Cao2023Amnio).

The tertiary structure of G6PC1 involves the folding of the polypeptide into a three-dimensional shape, essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure is stabilized by interactions within the protein and potentially by disulfide bonds, although specific disulfide bond formation was not observed in the S298C variant (Cao2023Amnio).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, play a significant role in the protein's activity and stability. Glycosylation is critical for the enzymatic function of G6PC1, as mutations affecting glycosylation sites can lead to a loss of activity despite protein synthesis (Cao2023Amnio). The protein's quaternary structure, if present, may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the G6PC1 gene are associated with Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ia (GSD-Ia), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase-α. This enzyme deficiency disrupts glucose homeostasis, leading to the accumulation of glycogen in the liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa. Clinical manifestations of GSD-Ia include hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hyperlipidemia, and hepatomegaly. Long-term complications can include hepatic adenomas, renal dysfunction, and gout (Karthi2019Mutational; Lei1993Mutations).

The G6PC1 gene has been found to have over 116 different mutations, most of which are missense mutations. These mutations can lead to impaired enzyme activity, as demonstrated by studies showing that certain mutations result in significantly reduced phosphohydrolase activity of the G6Pase enzyme (Karthi2019Mutational). Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3'-UTR of G6PC1, rs2229611, affects mRNA stability and expression, potentially increasing the risk of GSD-Ia. This SNP alters microRNA binding sites, which can influence gene regulation and disease susceptibility (Karthi20173′UTR).

## Interactions
The human gene G6PC1 encodes the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1, which plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism. G6PC1 interacts with the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (SLC37A4) to form a complex essential for the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose within the endoplasmic reticulum, a process vital for maintaining blood glucose levels (Torabidastgerdooei2023A).

In the context of transcriptional regulation, the FoxO1 transcription factor interacts with the promoter region of the G6PC1 gene. FoxO1 binds to multiple sites on the G6PC1 promoter, including a newly identified nonconsensus binding site that overlaps with the CREB binding site, suggesting a mutual exclusion mechanism for FoxO1 and CREB binding (Singh2017Crystal). The binding of FoxO1 to the G6PC1 promoter involves both base-specific and non-specific DNA interactions, with the recognition helix H3 docking into the major groove of the DNA (Singh2017Crystal). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of G6PC1 gene transcription, which is important for hepatic glucose production and is implicated in diabetes (Singh2017Crystal).
