# HSD11B1L

## Overview
The HSD11B1L gene encodes the hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 1-like protein, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This protein shares significant structural and functional similarities with 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11βHSD1), suggesting a potential role in steroid metabolism (Bird2017Hydroxysteroid; Fu2023Interaction). The HSD11B1L protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, ovary, testis, and lung, indicating its possible involvement in various physiological processes, including reproductive hormone regulation (Bird2017Hydroxysteroid; Fu2023Interaction). It is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, which implies a membrane-bound nature and potential interactions with other ER-associated proteins (Bird2017Hydroxysteroid; Fu2023Interaction). Although the precise biological functions of HSD11B1L remain to be fully elucidated, its interaction with the parkin protein and potential involvement in glioblastoma carcinogenesis highlight its significance in cellular processes and disease (Fu2023Interaction).

## Structure
The HSD11B1L gene encodes a protein that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which includes enzymes with conserved NAD+/NADP+ nucleotide binding and dehydrogenase/reductase catalytic site domains (Fu2023Interaction; GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid). The protein structure of HSD11B1L is predicted to have similarities to 11βHSD1 and 11βHSD2, featuring α-helices and the β-sheet 'Rossmann' fold, which is common in SDR enzymes (Fu2023Interaction). The catalytic site residues are positioned similarly to those in 11βHSD1, with a conserved triad of Ser, Tyr, and Lys residues crucial for catalytic activity (GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid).

HSD11B1L uses two alternate ATG translation start sites in exons 2 and 3, and alternative RNA splicing in exon 9 generates two isoforms, A and B, with variable C-terminal ends (Fu2023Interaction). The protein also contains a putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization signal sequence at the N-terminus, supported by a hydrophobicity surface map showing charged residues pointing towards a hydrophobic pocket (Fu2023Interaction). The predicted molecular mass of the protein is approximately 30.8 kDa, slightly less than that of 11βHSD1 and 11βHSD2 (GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid).

## Function
The HSD11B1L gene encodes a protein that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, sharing significant homology with the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11βHSD1). This protein is involved in the modulation of substrate availability, although its exact function in healthy human cells remains unclear (Bird2017Hydroxysteroid; Fu2023Interaction). The HSD11B1L protein is highly expressed in the brain and is also present in the ovary, testis, and lung, suggesting a potential role in these tissues (Bird2017Hydroxysteroid; Fu2023Interaction).

Structurally, HSD11B1L shares similarities with 11βHSD1, particularly in the NAD+/NADP+ nucleotide binding and dehydrogenase/reductase catalytic site domains, indicating a possible involvement in steroid metabolism (Bird2017Hydroxysteroid; Fu2023Interaction). The protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting it may be membrane-bound and involved in cellular processes related to the ER (Bird2017Hydroxysteroid; Fu2023Interaction). Immunohistochemistry studies have shown its presence in the cytoplasm of ovarian granulosa cells, testis Leydig cells, and gonadotroph cells in the anterior pituitary, indicating a potential role in reproductive hormone regulation (Bird2017Hydroxysteroid; Fu2023Interaction).

## Interactions
The HSD11B1L protein, a novel alternatively spliced variant, has been shown to interact with the parkin protein, enhancing the carcinogenesis potential of glioblastoma. This interaction is significant as it suggests a role in cancer progression, although the specific mechanisms of this interaction are not detailed in the available literature (Fu2023Interaction). The protein is also localized within the endoplasmic reticulum in human HEK293 cells, indicating a potential membrane-bound nature similar to 11βHSD1, which may imply interactions with other ER-associated proteins (Fu2023Interaction).

While the HSD11B1L protein shares high homology with glucocorticoid steroid metabolizing enzymes such as 11βHSD1 and 11βHSD2, specific physical interactions with these or other proteins have not been explicitly documented. The protein's conservation in regions forming the Rossmann fold suggests potential interaction capabilities, although these have not been confirmed (Fu2023Interaction). The study also mentions the potential interaction of HSD1L, a variant of HSD11B1L, with Hexose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (H6PD) in the ER, but this interaction remains unexplored (Fu2023Interaction). Overall, while some interactions are suggested, detailed physical interactions of HSD11B1L with other proteins or nucleic acids are not comprehensively described in the current literature.
