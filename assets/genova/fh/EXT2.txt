# EXT2

## Overview
The EXT2 gene encodes the protein exostosin glycosyltransferase 2, which is a crucial component of the EXT1-EXT2 complex involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan essential for various cellular functions. This protein is categorized as a glycosyltransferase and is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in conjunction with EXT1 to polymerize HS chains. The EXT1-EXT2 complex significantly enhances the glycosyltransferase activity necessary for the addition of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, which are critical for HS chain elongation. Mutations in the EXT2 gene can lead to hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal bone growths due to impaired HS biosynthesis (Duncan2001The; McCormick2000The). The structural and functional integrity of the EXT1-EXT2 complex is vital for normal skeletal development and cellular signaling processes (Mizumoto2005Biosynthesis; Leisico2022Structure).

## Structure
The human EXT2 protein is a component of the EXT1-EXT2 complex, which is essential for heparan sulfate biosynthesis. This complex is a hetero-dimeric structure, with EXT2 forming a tightly packed 1:1 hetero-dimer with EXT1, featuring a total interaction surface of 3523 Å² (Leisico2022Structure). The EXT2 protein contains two main domains: a glucuronic acid transferase (GlcA-T) domain and a N-acetylglucosamine transferase (GlcNAc-T) domain. The N-terminal glycosyltransferase domain of EXT2 (residues 78-419) adopts a GT-B fold architecture, while the C-terminal domain (residues 455-702) features a GT-A fold (Leisico2022Structure).

The EXT2 protein shares 34% sequence identity with EXT1, and their domains superimpose well, indicating structural similarity (Leisico2022Structure). The GlcA-T and GlcNAc-T domains of EXT2 are connected through a potentially flexible hinge region, which includes an N-linked glycan at Asn637 (Leisico2022Structure). EXT2 does not form monomeric or homo-dimeric structures, emphasizing the necessity of the hetero-dimeric complex with EXT1 for its function (Leisico2022Structure). The EXT2 pseudo-GlcA-T domain is catalytically inactive, with glucuronic acid transfer likely carried out solely by EXT1 (Leisico2022Structure).

## Function
The EXT2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the EXT family, which is involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan essential for various cellular functions. EXT2, along with EXT1, forms a hetero-oligomeric complex in the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for the polymerization of HS chains. This complex significantly enhances glycosyltransferase activity, specifically the addition of D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to form HS chains, compared to the activity of EXT2 alone (Duncan2001The; McCormick2000The).

The EXT1/EXT2 complex is essential for maintaining normal HS biosynthesis, which plays a critical role in cell signaling, ligand-binding, and cell adhesion. In particular, HS proteoglycans synthesized by EXT2 are vital for the diffusion and signaling of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) in the growth plate of developing bone, regulating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation during endochondral ossification (Duncan2001The). Mutations in EXT2 can disrupt these processes, leading to conditions such as hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), characterized by abnormal bone growths due to impaired HS biosynthesis (Duncan2001The; McCormick2000The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXT2 gene are primarily associated with hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), also known as multiple osteochondromas (MO), a rare autosomal dominant skeletal disorder. This condition is characterized by the development of multiple benign bone tumors, known as exostoses, which can lead to pain, decreased range of motion, skeletal deformities, and short stature (Cousminer2016Assessing; Ciavarella201320). In some cases, these benign tumors can undergo malignant transformation into chondrosarcoma, although this occurs in less than 5% of cases (Delgado2014A; Ciavarella201320).

The EXT2 gene mutations are often nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations, resulting in a loss of function (Cousminer2016Assessing). These mutations disrupt the normal synthesis of heparan sulfate, a critical component for skeletal growth and morphogenesis (Xu2017Identification). The clinical severity of HME can vary significantly among individuals with the same mutation, indicating variable penetrance (Cousminer2016Assessing).

Studies have shown that EXT2 mutations are more frequent in certain populations, such as Chinese and Saudi Arabian patients, compared to others (Xu2017Identification; BukowskaOlech2021Hereditary). Despite the presence of EXT2 mutations, some individuals may not exhibit symptoms, suggesting the influence of other genetic or environmental factors (Cousminer2016Assessing).

## Interactions
EXT2 (exostosin glycosyltransferase 2) primarily interacts with EXT1 to form a stable hetero-dimeric complex essential for heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis. This complex is localized in the Golgi apparatus and exhibits significantly higher glycosyltransferase activity than either protein alone, catalyzing the polymerization of HS chains (Mizumoto2005Biosynthesis; McCormick2000The). The interaction between EXT1 and EXT2 is crucial, as neither protein can substitute for the other, and their coexpression results in enhanced glycosyltransferase activities (Senay2000The).

The EXT1/EXT2 complex is involved in the elongation of HS chains by adding alternating D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. This interaction is biologically significant, as mutations in either EXT1 or EXT2 can lead to hereditary multiple exostoses, a genetic disorder characterized by cartilage-capped tumors (Duncan2001The; McCormick2000The). Structural studies have shown that EXT1 and EXT2 form a tightly packed complex with a significant interaction surface, which is essential for their function in HS biosynthesis (Leisico2022Structure). There is no evidence of EXT2 interacting with nucleic acids (Lindahl2009Chapter; McCormick2000The).
