# CDC42SE2

## Overview
CDC42SE2 is a gene that encodes the CDC42 small effector 2 protein, which is a member of the small effector protein family involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, motility, and division by acting as an effector of the CDC42 GTPase, a member of the Rho GTPase family. CDC42SE2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences actin filament organization and dynamics, contributing to cell migration and polarity maintenance. The protein's interaction with the GTP-bound form of CDC42 is crucial for its function in cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling, particularly in the context of immune cell function and cancer biology (Ching2005The; Xiao2023CDC42SE2).

## Function
CDC42SE2 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division. As an effector of the CDC42 GTPase, CDC42SE2 is involved in various cellular processes, including endocytosis and signal transduction. The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences the organization and dynamics of actin filaments. This activity is vital for processes such as cell migration and the maintenance of cell polarity. By modulating the actin cytoskeleton, CDC42SE2 contributes to the proper functioning of cellular mechanisms that are critical for tissue development and repair. The protein's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating responses to environmental cues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDC42SE2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). In CRC, CDC42SE2 is significantly down-expressed in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This down-expression is associated with tumor progression, poor prognosis, larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced clinical stages. Overexpression of CDC42SE2 in CRC cells has been shown to inhibit proliferation, migration, invasion, and promote apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Xiao2023CDC42SE2).

CDC42SE2 is also involved in a novel gene fusion with BRAF, known as CDC42SE2-BRAF, which has been identified in certain tumors. This fusion has been observed in a low-grade malignant soft tissue tumor and a rare pediatric anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (APXA). The CDC42SE2-BRAF fusion retains the BRAF kinase domain while losing its autoinhibitory region, potentially promoting tumor growth and metastasis. This fusion is associated with resistance to certain therapies, highlighting the need for targeted treatment strategies (Sheng2020A; Damayanti2023Establishment).

## Interactions
CDC42SE2, also known as SPEC2, is a small effector protein that interacts specifically with the GTP-bound form of the small GTPase CDC42, a member of the Rho GTPase family. This interaction is crucial for its role in cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling. CDC42SE2 is recruited to the immunological synapse in T cells, where it colocalizes with F-actin and CDC42, indicating its involvement in actin dynamics and cellular processes (Ching2005The).

Biochemical studies have shown that CDC42SE2 interacts strongly with CDC42 through its CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain, which is a conserved feature among Cdc42-binding proteins. This interaction is specific to the GTP-bound form of CDC42, similar to the interaction observed with the WASP protein (Ching2005The; Umarao2022Cdc42/Rac).

In the context of colorectal cancer, CDC42SE2 has been shown to modulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor metastasis through its interaction with CDC42 and the downstream effector IQGAP3. Overexpression of CDC42SE2 leads to decreased levels of CDC42 and IQGAP3, suggesting an inhibitory role in these signaling pathways (Xiao2023CDC42SE2).
