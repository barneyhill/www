# ERAP1

## Overview
ERAP1, or endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1, is a gene that encodes a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase enzyme involved in the antigen processing pathway. The protein product of ERAP1 plays a crucial role in the immune system by trimming antigenic peptide precursors within the endoplasmic reticulum to optimal lengths for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. This process is essential for the generation of mature epitopes that enable the immune system to recognize and respond to infected or aberrant cells (York2002The). ERAP1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple domains that facilitate its enzymatic activity and regulation (Papakyriakou2022Can; López2018How). The enzyme's activity is modulated by proinflammatory cytokines and can influence immune responses by either enhancing or limiting antigen presentation (York2002The). Variations in the ERAP1 gene have been associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, Behçet's disease, and psoriasis (López2016Molecular; SanzBravo2018Ranking).

## Structure
ERAP1 is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase involved in antigen processing. The primary structure of ERAP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, sharing about 50% sequence identity with ERAP2 (López2018How). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the catalytic site located in domain II (López2018How). The tertiary structure of ERAP1 is characterized by four globular domains arranged around the active site, with the substrate-binding site spanning domains II and IV (Papakyriakou2022Can; López2018How).

The C-terminal domain of ERAP1 acts as a regulatory domain, distinct from the catalytic site, and is involved in binding the peptide's C-terminus, which allosterically activates its peptidase activity (Gandhi2011Structural). This domain is composed of a small beta-sandwich and a larger bowl-shaped alpha-helix domain (Gandhi2011Structural). ERAP1 can exist in open and closed conformations, with the closed conformation being more active and stabilized by specific interdomain interactions (Maben2021Conformational).

ERAP1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which may influence its function and stability. The protein's conformational dynamics and domain interactions are crucial for its enzymatic activity and regulation (Maben2021Conformational).

## Function
ERAP1 (endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the antigen processing pathway within healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it trims antigenic peptide precursors to optimal lengths, typically eight to nine residues, for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules (York2002The). This trimming process is essential for the generation of mature epitopes that can be presented on the cell surface, allowing the immune system to recognize and respond to infected or aberrant cells (York2002The; Mavridis2020A).

ERAP1's activity is influenced by the presence of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which upregulates the enzyme and enhances its role in antigen processing during immune responses (York2002The). The enzyme's function is not limited to enhancing antigen presentation; it can also limit it by over-trimming peptides, thus destroying potential epitopes (York2002The). ERAP1's ability to modulate the repertoire of peptides available for immune presentation is crucial for balancing immune activation and tolerance (York2002The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ERAP1 gene have been implicated in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. ERAP1 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), particularly in individuals with the HLA-B*27 allele. Certain polymorphisms in ERAP1, such as K528R and D575N/R725Q, are linked to protection against AS, while others increase disease risk by affecting the HLA-B*27 peptidome (López2016Molecular; SanzBravo2018Ranking). 

In Behçet's disease (BD), ERAP1 interacts with the HLA-B*51:01 allele, with specific polymorphisms like Asp575Asn and Arg725Gln contributing to disease susceptibility. The ERAP1 Hap10 haplotype is a known risk factor, particularly in the Turkish population, influencing peptide trimming and the stability of the HLA-B*51:01 peptidome (López2016Molecular; Dimopoulou2019Variant).

ERAP1 is also linked to psoriasis, especially in individuals with the HLA-C*06:02 allele. Variants such as Lys528 and Gln730 are part of the Hap2 haplotype, which predisposes individuals to psoriasis by affecting peptide processing (López2016Molecular). 

Alterations in ERAP1 expression levels are significant, with higher expression associated with diseases like ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis, while lower expression is linked to Behçet's disease (Paladini2020The).

## Interactions
ERAP1 (endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing immune responses and inflammation. One significant interaction is with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1). Studies have shown that different isoforms of ERAP1, such as P127-K528, P127-R528, and the ΔExon-11 spliced variant, can associate with TNF-R1. This interaction is suggested to occur within the first 10 exons of ERAP1 and may affect the expression levels of TNF-R1, potentially maintaining it in an inactive form to prevent inappropriate activity (Yousaf2015Differences).

ERAP1 also forms functional heterodimers with ERAP2, which could enhance the trimming function of these enzymes and influence the human immunopeptidome. The heterodimerization involves specific interactions, such as hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bridges, particularly in the exon 10 loop, which is crucial for the stability of the complex (Papakyriakou2022Can). Molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that ERAP1/ERAP2 heterodimers undergo significant structural rearrangements, suggesting a dynamic interaction that may optimize their interface for enhanced function (Papakyriakou2022Can). These interactions highlight ERAP1's role in modulating immune responses through its interactions with other proteins.
