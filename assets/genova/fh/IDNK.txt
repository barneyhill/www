# IDNK

## Overview
The IDNK gene encodes the enzyme IDNK gluconokinase, a kinase that is integral to carbohydrate metabolism. This enzyme specifically catalyzes the phosphorylation of gluconate to 6-phosphogluconate, a critical step in the pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway is essential for producing NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate, which are crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and nucleotide synthesis, respectively. The IDNK protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in sustaining cellular energy homeostasis and supporting biosynthetic processes necessary for cell growth and repair. Its activity is vital for detoxifying reactive oxygen species and maintaining the reduced state of glutathione, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism and protection against oxidative stress (p&gt; Wu2020&lt; Gluconokinase).

## Function
The IDNK gene encodes the enzyme gluconokinase, which plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism by catalyzing the phosphorylation of gluconate to 6-phosphogluconate. This reaction is a part of the pentose phosphate pathway, an essential metabolic pathway that generates NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. NADPH is vital for maintaining cellular redox balance and supporting anabolic reactions, while ribose-5-phosphate is a precursor for nucleotide synthesis (p&gt; Wu2020&lt; Gluconokinase).

In healthy human cells, the IDNK protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. By participating in the pentose phosphate pathway, IDNK supports biosynthetic processes necessary for cell growth and repair. The enzyme's activity ensures a steady supply of NADPH, which is crucial for detoxifying reactive oxygen species and maintaining the reduced state of glutathione, a key antioxidant in cells (p&gt; Wu2020&lt; Gluconokinase).

While the specific function of IDNK in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed in the available studies, its role in the pentose phosphate pathway suggests it is integral to cellular metabolism and protection against oxidative stress (p&gt; Wu2020&lt; Gluconokinase).
