# STON1

## Overview
STON1 is a gene that encodes the protein stonin 1, which functions as an endocytic adaptor protein. Stonin 1 is primarily involved in the regulation of focal adhesion dynamics and cell motility through its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It facilitates the internalization of the proteoglycan NG2, a co-receptor for integrins and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, thereby modulating cell signaling and maintaining proper focal adhesion turnover. This protein is characterized by its interaction with various endocytic and focal adhesion components, including clathrin, dynamin2, and vinculin, highlighting its significance in cellular processes related to endocytosis and motility (Feutlinske2015Stonin1). The STON1 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and polycystic ovary syndrome, where its expression levels and interactions suggest potential roles in tumor suppression and metabolic regulation (Zheng2021Integrated; Cao2021ThreeDimensional).

## Function
Stonin1 (STON1) is an endocytic adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in regulating focal adhesion (FA) dynamics and cell motility. It facilitates the internalization of the proteoglycan NG2, which acts as a co-receptor for integrins and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). This internalization is essential for controlling cell signaling and maintaining proper FA turnover, which is necessary for efficient cell migration (Feutlinske2015Stonin1).

In the absence of Stonin1, there is an accumulation of NG2 on the cell surface, leading to increased cellular signaling and impaired FA disassembly. This results in altered cell motility and shape, characterized by more persistent leading edge protrusions and longer trailing ends (Feutlinske2015Stonin1). Stonin1 localizes to clathrin-coated pits near FAs, facilitating their disassembly and contributing to dynamic protein exchange within FAs (Feutlinske2015Stonin1).

Stonin1's role in endocytosis and FA dynamics suggests it may have a tumor suppressor function by limiting the oncogenic potential of NG2 through its removal from the plasma membrane (Feutlinske2015Stonin1). This regulation is significant for maintaining cellular motility and signaling in healthy cells.

## Clinical Significance
The STON1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), STON1 is significantly downregulated, which is associated with clinical progression, including tumor grade, stage, metastasis, and patient survival. High expression of STON1 correlates with better overall survival, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and prognostic biomarker in KIRC (Zheng2021Integrated). The gene's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and mismatch repair proteins, indicating its involvement in modulating the immune microenvironment and potentially affecting immunotherapy efficacy (Zheng2023Integrated).

In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), STON1 has been identified as a potential target gene at the rs13405728 locus, with elevated expression observed in PCOS patients. This suggests a role in adipocyte metabolism and immune function, although the specific clinical implications of STON1 mutations in PCOS are not fully detailed (Cao2021ThreeDimensional).

Additionally, STON1 is involved in the endocytosis of the proteoglycan NG2, which affects cell motility and signaling. Alterations in these processes are linked to tumorigenesis, indicating that STON1 may play a role in limiting tumor growth by controlling NG2's oncogenic potential (Feutlinske2015Stonin1).

## Interactions
Stonin1 (STON1) is an endocytic adaptor protein that participates in several interactions with other proteins, primarily within the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. It shares structural motifs with Stonin2, including WVxF motifs for interacting with the adaptor protein complex AP-2, which is crucial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Feutlinske2015Stonin1). Stonin1 also co-localizes with endocytic proteins such as clathrin, dynamin2, and intersectin at clathrin-coated pits, indicating its role in the formation and function of these structures (Feutlinske2015Stonin1).

Stonin1 specifically interacts with the proteoglycan NG2, facilitating its endocytosis. This interaction involves the Stonin1 m-homology domain binding to the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of NG2, although full-length Stonin1 shows less efficient binding, possibly due to autoinhibition (Feutlinske2015Stonin1). The interaction between Stonin1 and NG2 is significant for regulating focal adhesion dynamics and cell motility, as Stonin1 localizes to NG2 clusters involved in signaling (Feutlinske2015Stonin1).

Stonin1 also interacts with focal adhesion components such as vinculin, and its presence is associated with the dynamics of focal adhesions, particularly in their disassembly and turnover (Feutlinske2015Stonin1). These interactions highlight Stonin1's role in cellular processes related to endocytosis and cell motility.
