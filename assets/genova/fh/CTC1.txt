# CTC1

## Overview
The CTC1 gene encodes the CST telomere replication complex component 1, a protein integral to the CST complex, which also includes STN1 and TEN1. This complex is pivotal in telomere maintenance and DNA replication, playing a crucial role in the protection and replication of telomeric DNA. The CTC1 protein is characterized by its seven tandem oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domains, which facilitate its interaction with single-stranded DNA and other CST components, thereby ensuring proper telomere length and stability (Lim2020The; Shastrula2017Structural). Functionally, CTC1 is involved in the regulation of telomerase activity and the prevention of telomere degradation, contributing to genomic stability and cell division (Gu2018CTC1‐STN1; Feng2017CTC1mediated). Mutations in the CTC1 gene are linked to telomere-related disorders such as Coats plus syndrome and dyskeratosis congenita, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining telomere integrity (Han2020A; Polvi2012Mutations).

## Structure
The CTC1 protein is a component of the CST complex, which plays a crucial role in telomere maintenance and DNA replication. Structurally, CTC1 is composed of seven tandem oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domains, labeled OB-A through OB-G. The C-terminal domains (OB-D through G) serve as a hub for the assembly of the CST complex by interacting with STN1 and TEN1 (Lim2020The). The OB-fold is a common structural motif involved in nucleic acid binding, and the OB-fold domain of CTC1 is implicated in telomere maintenance and bone marrow syndromes (Shastrula2017Structural).

The tertiary structure of CTC1 reveals a decameric assembly when bound to telomeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), forming a supercomplex that organizes ssDNA similarly to nucleosomes organizing double-stranded DNA (Lim2020The). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other CST components, with specific docking sites facilitating the assembly of the CST decamer (Lim2020The).

CTC1 also interacts with the DNA polymerase α-primase complex, with the OB-D domain forming a major interaction with the POLA1 C-terminal domain (Cai2022CryoEM). Disease mutations in CTC1, such as R840W and V871M, are located within the OB-fold and affect the protein's structural integrity (Shastrula2017Structural).

## Function
The CTC1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the CST complex, which includes STN1 and TEN1. This complex is essential for telomere maintenance and replication in human cells. CTC1 plays a significant role in telomere replication by facilitating the efficient restart of stalled replication forks and ensuring the synthesis of the telomeric C-strand by DNA polymerase alpha (Pol α) (Gu2012CTC1). The CST complex, through CTC1, coordinates the extension of the G-strand by telomerase and the fill-in of the C-strand, maintaining proper telomere length and stability (Gu2018CTC1‐STN1).

CTC1 is involved in preventing excessive telomere elongation by repressing telomerase activity, thus playing a role in regulating telomere length (Gu2018CTC1‐STN1). It also helps protect telomeres from degradation and prevents the formation of excessively long single-stranded G-overhangs, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Gu2013Functional). In healthy cells, CTC1 ensures efficient telomere replication and C-strand protection, which is critical for preventing telomere dysfunction and associated genomic instability (Feng2017CTC1mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTC1 gene are associated with several telomere-related disorders, most notably Coats plus syndrome and dyskeratosis congenita (DC). Coats plus syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinal telangiectasia, intracranial calcifications, cerebral cysts, and systemic symptoms such as osteopenia and bone marrow failure (Netravathi2015Whole; Polvi2012Mutations). Dyskeratosis congenita is marked by skin pigmentation abnormalities, nail dystrophy, and bone marrow failure (Han2020A). 

CTC1 mutations disrupt the CST complex, impairing telomere maintenance and leading to telomere dysfunction. This results in the accumulation of single-stranded DNA gaps and defects in telomere replication, which are primary causes of these diseases (Chen2013Molecular). While some studies report short telomeres in individuals with CTC1 mutations, others suggest that telomere dysfunction may not be directly related to overall telomere length but rather to structural defects (Polvi2012Mutations; Sargolzaeiaval2018CTC1). 

CTC1 mutations have also been linked to other conditions such as cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts (CRMCC), which shares overlapping features with Coats plus syndrome and DC (Polvi2012Mutations).

## Interactions
The human gene CTC1 encodes a component of the CST complex, which includes STN1 and TEN1. This complex is crucial for telomere maintenance and replication. CTC1 interacts with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through its oligosaccharide-binding (OB)-fold domains, with the two N-terminal OB-fold domains primarily contributing to DNA-binding activity (Polvi2012Mutations). The C-terminal region of CTC1 is essential for forming the CST complex by interacting with STN1, indicating a physical interaction between these proteins (Polvi2012Mutations).

In ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres) cancer cells, CTC1 forms nuclear foci that colocalize with PML (Promyelocytic Leukemia protein) and telomeric DNA, suggesting its localization in ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) (Huang2017The). The presence of STN1 is necessary for the formation of these foci, as its depletion reduces CTC1 foci formation and colocalization with PML and TRF2 (Telomeric Repeat-binding Factor 2) (Huang2017The).

CTC1 also interacts with POT1, a component of the shelterin complex, to regulate telomere overhang length and prevent DNA damage signaling. Overexpression of POT1 in CTC1-deficient cells partially rescues telomeric DNA damage signaling, indicating a functional interaction between these proteins (Feng2017CTC1mediated).
