# DPYS

## Overview
The DPYS gene encodes the enzyme dihydropyrimidinase, a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily, which is primarily involved in the catabolism of pyrimidines. This enzyme plays a critical role in the pyrimidine degradation pathway by catalyzing the hydrolytic ring opening of dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine, facilitating the conversion of these compounds into N-carbamoyl-β-alanine and N-carbamoyl-β-aminoisobutyric acid, respectively (Mirzaei2020A; Hishinuma2020In). Dihydropyrimidinase is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidneys, where it functions in the cytoplasm to maintain nucleotide balance and prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic metabolites (Nakajima2016Altered; Hishinuma2020In). Mutations in the DPYS gene can lead to dihydropyrimidinase deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder that can result in neurological abnormalities and other clinical symptoms due to the buildup of pyrimidine metabolites (Nakajima2016Altered). Understanding the structure and function of the DPYS gene and its encoded enzyme is essential for elucidating its role in cellular metabolism and its implications in human health.

## Structure
The DPYS gene encodes the enzyme dihydropyrimidinase, which plays a crucial role in pyrimidine metabolism. The primary structure of DPYS consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that are encoded by the DPYS gene. This sequence determines the protein's secondary structure, which includes the formation of alpha helices and beta sheets. These elements contribute to the enzyme's overall three-dimensional shape, or tertiary structure, which is essential for its enzymatic function.

DPYS can form a quaternary structure as a homotetramer, meaning it assembles into a complex of four identical subunits. This multimeric form is typical for enzymes in the amidohydrolase superfamily, to which DPYS belongs. The enzyme contains conserved domains characteristic of this superfamily, which are crucial for its catalytic activity.

Post-translational modifications and the presence of splice variant isoforms can influence the activity and stability of DPYS. These modifications may alter the enzyme's structure or function, impacting its role in pyrimidine metabolism. Understanding these structural aspects of DPYS is vital for comprehending its function and regulation within the cell.

## Function
The DPYS gene encodes the enzyme dihydropyrimidinase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of pyrimidines, specifically in the breakdown of uracil and thymine. This enzyme is involved in the second step of the pyrimidine degradation pathway, catalyzing the hydrolytic ring opening of dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine to form N-carbamoyl-β-alanine and N-carbamoyl-β-aminoisobutyric acid, respectively (Mirzaei2020A; Hishinuma2020In). Dihydropyrimidinase is primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys, where it functions in the cytoplasm (Mirzaei2020A; Hishinuma2020In).

The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining nucleotide balance and preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites, which can lead to various clinical symptoms if disrupted (Nakajima2016Altered). Proper function of dihydropyrimidinase is critical for normal pyrimidine metabolism, impacting cellular processes such as DNA synthesis and repair (Hishinuma2020In). Mutations in the DPYS gene can lead to dihydropyrimidinase deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated levels of dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine in biological fluids, potentially resulting in neurological abnormalities (Nakajima2016Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DPYS gene, which encodes the enzyme dihydropyrimidinase, are associated with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of pyrimidine metabolites such as dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine, leading to a range of clinical manifestations including neurological abnormalities, gastrointestinal issues, and skeletal deformities (Albokhari2023The; Mirzaei2020A). Patients with this deficiency may present with symptoms such as intellectual disability, seizures, movement disorders, and dysmorphic features, although some individuals remain asymptomatic (Albokhari2023The; Assmann1997Dihydropyridmidinase).

The condition is diagnosed through elevated pyrimidine metabolites in urine, detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and confirmed by identifying biallelic pathogenic variants in the DPYS gene (Albokhari2023The). Mutations in DPYS can also lead to severe toxicity when patients are treated with pyrimidine analog drugs like 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), due to the accumulation of toxic metabolites (Hiratsuka2015Genetic; De2023The). Genetic testing for DPYS variants is crucial for predicting and managing these adverse drug reactions, particularly in cancer patients undergoing fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (De2023The).
