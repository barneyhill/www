# ADGRD2

## Overview
The ADGRD2 gene encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor D2, which is a member of the adhesion GPCR family. These receptors are characterized by their long N-terminal regions and are involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and signaling. The protein encoded by ADGRD2 is a transmembrane receptor that plays a role in mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which are crucial for maintaining tissue architecture and function. Adhesion GPCRs, such as the one encoded by ADGRD2, are implicated in a range of physiological and pathological processes, including development, immune response, and cancer (Qiu2020aarFDC).
