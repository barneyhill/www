# BEND2

## Overview
BEND2 is a gene that encodes the BEN domain containing 2 protein, which is a member of the BEN domain-containing protein family. This protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization, functioning as a chromatin modulator and transcriptional repressor. It plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as differentiation and development, particularly within the nucleus (Ma2021Identification; Huang2024BEND2). The BEND2 protein is characterized by the presence of two C-terminal BEN domains, which facilitate protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions essential for chromatin remodeling and transcription repression (Huang2024BEND2). BEND2 is expressed in two forms, a full-length 140 kDa form and a truncated 80 kDa form, which may arise from alternative transcription, translation, or protein cleavage (Ma2021Identification). The gene's involvement in meiosis, particularly in double-strand break repair and synapsis, underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and fertility (Ma2021Identification; Huang2024BEND2).

## Structure
The BEND2 protein is characterized by the presence of two C-terminal BEN domains, which are marked by an α-helical structure. These domains are conserved across a range of metazoan and viral proteins and are involved in mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions during chromatin organization and transcription (Huang2024BEND2). The primary structure of BEND2 consists of 728 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 80 kDa, although the full-length form (p140) displays a greater molecular mass due to its unusual sequence/structure at the N-terminus, which affects its electrophoretic mobility (Ma2021Identification).

BEND2 is expressed in two forms: a full-length 140 kDa form (p140) and a truncated 80 kDa form (p80), which may result from alternative transcription, translation, or protein cleavage (Ma2021Identification). The N-terminal half of BEND2 is more disordered and hydrophobic than the C-terminal half, contributing to its slower electrophoretic mobility (Ma2021Identification). The BEN domains in BEND2 are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription repression, interacting with several chromatin-associated proteins (Ma2021Identification). However, detailed information on the tertiary and quaternary structures of BEND2 is not provided in the available sources.

## Function
The BEND2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. It is a member of the BEN domain-containing protein family, which is involved in protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. BEND2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences cellular processes such as differentiation and development (Ma2021Identification; Huang2024BEND2).

In the context of meiosis, BEND2 acts as a chromatin modulator and transcriptional repressor. It is involved in shutting down the mitotic program and activating the meiotic and post-meiotic program in spermatogenic cells. BEND2 binds to multiple chromatin states and interacts with various transcriptional suppressors and chromatin-binding proteins, such as ZMYM2, ADNP, and CHD4, which are epigenetic regulators and transcription factors (Ma2021Identification).

BEND2 is essential for proper double-strand break (DSB) repair and synapsis during meiosis. In its absence, there is an increase in unrepaired DSBs, leading to defects in meiotic progression and increased apoptosis in spermatocytes (Ma2021Identification; Huang2024BEND2). These molecular activities highlight BEND2's critical role in maintaining genomic stability and fertility.

## Clinical Significance
The BEND2 gene is implicated in various tumors, particularly those involving fusion events. Tumors with MN1-BEND2, EWSR1-BEND2, and MAMLD1-BEND2 fusions are associated with specific histological features and varying prognoses. EWSR1-BEND2 fusions, for instance, are found in children and young adults and are linked to a less favorable prognosis compared to MN1-BEND2 tumors (Lehman2023Early). These fusions are recurrent in high-grade neuroepithelial tumors with MN1 alteration (HGNET-MN1), a new entity of CNS brain tumors (Yamasaki2020Spinal).

The MN1-BEND2 fusion is a key feature of CNS HGNET-MN1 tumors, which are distinct from classical astroblastomas and have a good prognosis, particularly in female children (Lehman2023Early). These tumors are characterized by perivascular pseudorosettes and a solid and cystic appearance on imaging (Lehman2023Early). The MN1-BEND2 fusion results in increased expression of BEND2, suggesting its potential role in tumor pathogenesis (Burford2018The).

BEND2 expression levels also have prognostic implications in other cancers. High expression of BEND2 is protective in prostate adenocarcinoma, while it is an unfavorable factor for the prognosis of adrenocortical carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and ovarian cancer (Fan2022The).

## Interactions
BEND2 interacts with several transcriptional suppressors and chromatin-binding proteins, playing a role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. It is known to interact with proteins such as ZMYM2, ADNP, and KDM1A (LSD1), which are components of repressive complexes involved in chromatin remodeling. ZMYM2 is part of the MYM-type zinc finger protein family and is a component of LSD1-containing repressive complexes, which also include histone deacetylases like HDAC1 and HDAC2 (Ma2021Identification). BEND2 also interacts with proteins from the NuRD and ChAHP complexes, including HDAC1, HDAC2, CHD4, and HP1γ. These interactions are robust, as demonstrated by high-salt co-immunoprecipitation washing solutions (Ma2021Identification).

BEND2's interaction with CHD4 is particularly significant, as CHD4 is involved in regulating double-strand break repair, a process disrupted in Bend2 knockout mice (Ma2021Identification). BEND2 also interacts with DNA-binding proteins such as TAF1B, GTF2H1, and PIWIL2 (Ma2021Identification). ChIP-seq analyses have shown that BEND2 preferentially binds to simple sequence repeats in the genome, with peaks enriched in regulatory regions such as promoters, CpG islands, and repetitive sequences (Ma2021Identification).
