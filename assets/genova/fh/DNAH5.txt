# DNAH5

## Overview
DNAH5 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein axonemal heavy chain 5, a critical component of the outer dynein arm (ODA) in cilia and flagella. This protein is categorized as a motor protein, playing a pivotal role in the motility of these hairlike organelles. The dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 protein is essential for the ATPase-driven microtubule sliding mechanism that facilitates ciliary and flagellar movement. Proper function and localization of this protein are crucial for various physiological processes, including respiratory tract fluid clearance and sperm motility. Mutations in DNAH5 can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, resulting in chronic respiratory infections, fertility issues, and situs inversus (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization; Knowles2013Primary).

## Structure
The DNAH5 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the outer dynein arm (ODA), essential for ciliary motility. The protein structure includes an N-terminal stem, six AAA domains (AAA1-6), and C-terminal globular fragments that form heptagonal rings. The N-terminal stem is responsible for binding cargo and interacting with other dynein components. Each AAA domain contains an ATPase site, with the ATPase in the AAA1 domain likely responsible for ATP hydrolysis. A microtubule binding site is located between the AAA4 and AAA5 domains, which is crucial for the protein's function in ciliary movement (Yao2024A).

Mutations in DNAH5, such as the c.4314delT frameshift mutation, can lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation or truncated proteins, resulting in ODA defects and cilia immobility. The C-terminal region is particularly important for the assembly of ODA Type 2, and mutations affecting this region can disrupt proper ciliary function (Yao2024A). The DNAH5 protein's structure and function are vital for maintaining ciliary movement, and defects in this gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (Yao2024A).

## Function
The DNAH5 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the outer dynein arm (ODA) in cilia and flagella, which are essential for their motility. In healthy human cells, DNAH5 is involved in the proper functioning of motile cilia and flagella, which are hairlike organelles extending from the cell surface. These structures are crucial for various biological processes, including the movement of extracellular fluid in the respiratory epithelium, embryonic node, and brain ventricles, as well as the propulsion of sperm cells (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization).

The DNAH5 protein, along with other dynein heavy chains, forms part of the molecular motor complexes that generate microtubule sliding, leading to the movement of cilia and flagella through ATPase-dependent reactions (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization). In respiratory cells, DNAH5 is present throughout the entire length of the ciliary axoneme, indicating its role in ciliary motility (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization). In sperm cells, DNAH5 localizes exclusively to the proximal part of the flagellum (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization).

The proper localization of DNAH5 is crucial for the normal function of cilia, as it is involved in the motility of these structures. Mislocalization or absence of DNAH5 in the ciliary axoneme can lead to immotile or dysmotile cilia, resulting in conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (Fliegauf2005Mislocalization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH5 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function leading to chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormal organ positioning, and fertility issues. DNAH5 mutations account for a significant proportion of PCD cases, particularly those involving outer dynein arm defects (Knowles2013Primary). These mutations can result in a range of clinical manifestations, including bronchiectasis, sinusitis, and situs inversus, a condition where the major visceral organs are mirrored from their normal positions (Wang2021Novel).

Studies have identified various types of mutations in DNAH5, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations, which disrupt the normal function of cilia (Kano2016Wholeexome; Berg2011Next). In some populations, novel pathogenic variants have been discovered, highlighting the genetic diversity and complexity of PCD (AlMutairi2024Novel; Chen2024NextGeneration). The presence of compound heterozygous mutations in DNAH5 has been linked to Kartagener Syndrome, a subtype of PCD characterized by the triad of bronchiectasis, sinusitis, and situs inversus (Wang2021Novel).

The identification of DNAH5 mutations is crucial for the diagnosis and management of PCD, as these mutations can lead to severe respiratory issues and other complications (Kano2016Wholeexome). Genetic testing, including next-generation sequencing and copy number variation analysis, plays a vital role in detecting these mutations and understanding their impact on ciliary function (Chen2024NextGeneration).

## Interactions
The DNAH5 protein is a component of the outer dynein arm (ODA) in cilia, which are essential for ciliary movement. It interacts with microtubules through its dynein heavy chain, which includes an N-terminal stem, six AAA domains, and C-terminal globular fragments. The N-terminal stem is responsible for binding cargo and interacting with other dynein components, while the AAA domains contain ATPase sites crucial for ATP hydrolysis and regulation. This structure facilitates microtubule sliding, necessary for effective ciliary movement (Yao2024A).

Mutations in DNAH5, such as the c.13,338 + 5G > C splice mutation, can disrupt the assembly of ODA type 2, leading to defects in the distal ciliated axoneme and resulting in cilia immobility or ineffective movement, characteristic of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (Yao2024A). Although specific physical interactions of DNAH5 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in the assembly and function of the ODA suggests interactions with other dynein components and microtubules are critical for its function in ciliary motility (Yao2024A).
