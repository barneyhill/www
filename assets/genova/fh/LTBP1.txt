# LTBP1

## Overview
LTBP1, or latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in the regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling. The protein encoded by LTBP1 is categorized as a binding protein, playing a pivotal role in the sequestration and activation of TGF-β, a critical growth factor involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and repair. LTBP1 is integral to the formation of the large latent complex by binding to the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of TGF-β, thereby facilitating its incorporation into the extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulating its bioavailability (Saharinen1996Association; Todorovic2012LTBPs). The protein's structure, characterized by multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and 8-cysteine domains, allows it to interact with various ECM components, such as fibronectin and fibrillins, which are essential for its localization and function (Isogai2003Latent; ÖKLÜ2000The). Mutations in the LTBP1 gene have been linked to connective tissue disorders, underscoring its significance in maintaining ECM integrity and proper TGF-β signaling (Pottie2021Biallelic).

## Structure
LTBP1 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1) is a complex glycoprotein involved in the regulation of TGF-beta signaling. Its molecular structure is characterized by multiple domains, including 18 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and four 8-cysteine (8-Cys) domains, which are crucial for its function and interaction with other proteins (Saharinen1996Association; ÖKLÜ2000The). The third 8-Cys domain is particularly important as it binds covalently to the latency-associated propeptide (LAP) region of TGF-beta, facilitating the formation of a large latent complex (Saharinen1996Association).

LTBP1 can form oligomers through interactions at its N- and C-terminal regions, with calcium playing a significant role in stabilizing these structures (Troilo2016Independent). The N-terminal region is rigid, while the C-terminal region is flexible, allowing for various conformations (Troilo2016Independent). The protein's structure is further stabilized by calcium-binding EGF domains, which protect it from proteolysis (Troilo2016Independent).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, are essential for LTBP1's function (Saharinen1996Association). Alternative splicing results in different isoforms, including LTBP1S and LTBP1L, which may have distinct roles in the extracellular matrix (ÖKLÜ2000The).

## Function
LTBP1 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1) plays a crucial role in the regulation of TGF-beta activity, a key growth factor involved in various cellular processes. LTBP1 is essential for the correct folding, secretion, and activation of latent TGF-beta by binding to the Latency Associated Peptide (LAP) within the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing misfolding and ensuring efficient secretion (Saharinen1996Association; Todorovic2012LTBPs). It facilitates the incorporation of TGF-beta into the extracellular matrix (ECM), where it is stored until activation is required (Todorovic2012LTBPs).

LTBP1 interacts with various ECM proteins, such as fibronectin and fibrillins, which are important for its localization and function. Its binding to fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 suggests a role in the structural organization of connective tissue microfibrils (Todorovic2012LTBPs; Isogai2003Latent). LTBP1 is also involved in elastogenesis by interacting with fibulin-4, which helps tether lysyl-oxidase to tropoelastin, facilitating crosslinking (Todorovic2012LTBPs).

LTBP1 exists in two isoforms, LTBP1L and LTBP1S, which have distinct roles in ECM assembly. LTBP1L is more efficient in promoting the assembly of both fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, while LTBP1S promotes the incorporation of fibrillin-2 more efficiently (Przyklenk2021LTBP1). These interactions and functions highlight LTBP1's multifaceted role in maintaining ECM integrity and regulating TGF-beta activity in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LTBP1 gene are associated with cutis laxa syndrome, a connective tissue disorder characterized by loose and inelastic skin, craniofacial dysmorphology, and skeletal abnormalities such as craniosynostosis, short stature, brachydactyly, and syndactyly (Pottie2021Biallelic). Bi-allelic premature truncating variants in LTBP1 lead to altered extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly and increased transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) activation, contributing to the clinical manifestations of the syndrome (Pottie2021Biallelic).

In vitro studies on dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals show that C-terminal variants of LTBP1 result in altered anchoring in the microfibrillar network, leading to increased ECM deposition and excessive TGF-β activation, while N-terminal truncations do not alter TGF-β levels or ECM assembly (Pottie2021Biallelic). Zebrafish models with LTBP1 mutations exhibit abnormal collagen fibrillogenesis, ectopic bone formation, and hypo-mineralized vertebrae, highlighting the gene's role in skeletal development and ECM organization (Pottie2021Biallelic).

LTBP1 is also crucial for cardiovascular development, as evidenced by knockout mouse models that exhibit severe cardiovascular abnormalities and perinatal lethality due to disrupted TGF-β signaling (Todorovic2010Long; Horiguchi2015Abrogation). These findings underscore the importance of LTBP1 in maintaining tissue homeostasis and its deficiency's link to significant developmental abnormalities.

## Interactions
LTBP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the regulation of TGF-β signaling and extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics. It specifically binds to the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of TGF-β1 through its third 8-cysteine (8-Cys) repeat, forming a covalent complex essential for the secretion and storage of TGF-β in the ECM (Saharinen2000Specific; Saharinen1996Association). This interaction involves direct disulfide bridge formation between cysteine residues of TGF-β1•LAP and the 8-Cys repeat of LTBP1 (Saharinen2000Specific).

LTBP1 also interacts with Notch3 extracellular domain (Notch3-ECD) in the context of CADASIL, a genetic disorder affecting brain vessels. This interaction is specific to the N-terminal domain of LTBP1 and the first 11 EGF-like repeats of Notch3-ECD, contributing to the co-aggregation mechanism in CADASIL (Kast2014Sequestration).

Additionally, LTBP1 associates with fibronectin and fibrillin-1, which are important for its localization and function within the ECM. It binds to fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, major components of microfibrils, and interacts with fibulin-4, which is involved in elastogenesis (Todorovic2012LTBPs). These interactions highlight LTBP1's role in ECM structure and TGF-β signaling regulation.
