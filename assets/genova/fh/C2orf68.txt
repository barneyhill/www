# C2orf68

## Overview
C2orf68 is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 68. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of human colorectal cancer. C2orf68 is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it plays a significant role in cancer biology through its interactions with other proteins. Notably, C2orf68 interacts with the RNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1), influencing post-transcriptional regulation and affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. The gene's expression is notably upregulated in rectal cancer tissues, correlating with cancer progression and metastasis. These characteristics suggest that C2orf68 may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in colorectal cancer (Wen2014The; Lv2019Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
C2orf68 has been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly in rectal cancer. Studies have shown that C2orf68 expression is significantly upregulated in rectal cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, suggesting its involvement in cancer development (Lv2019Interaction). The gene's expression is associated with clinicopathological parameters such as pathological grade and lymph node metastasis, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and metastasis (Lv2019Interaction).

C2orf68 interacts with the HuR protein, an RNA-binding protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation, which may enhance cancer cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting apoptosis (Lv2019Interaction). This interaction is thought to promote cancer development by upregulating oncogenes like Bcl-2, c-Myc, cyclin A, and cyclin D1, and downregulating pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax (Lv2019Interaction).

Inhibition of C2orf68 expression in colorectal cancer cell lines has been shown to increase apoptosis and decrease cell proliferation and migration, suggesting that C2orf68 may serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in CRC (Wen2014The).

## Interactions
C2orf68, a protein encoded by the C2orf68 gene, has been shown to interact with several proteins in the context of human colorectal cancer. According to studies, C2orf68 interacts with 12 proteins, including KLHL15, GMNN, SMG6, GNE, DDHD2, PIR, ELAVL1 (HuR), NAGK, XPO1, HSPA9, JOSD2, and GUK1, as identified in the BioGrid database (Lv2019Interaction). The interaction between C2orf68 and HuR (ELAVL1) is particularly significant. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments and immunofluorescence studies, which demonstrated that C2orf68 and HuR co-localize in the nucleus of SW480 and LoVo colorectal cancer cell lines (Lv2019Interaction).

HuR is an RNA-binding protein that regulates gene expression through post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as mRNA decay and protein translation. The interaction between C2orf68 and HuR appears to influence key cellular processes, including cell migration, apoptosis, and proliferation. C2orf68, in conjunction with HuR, promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, as evidenced by the upregulation of Bcl-2, c-Myc, cyclin A, and cyclin D1, and the downregulation of Bax (Lv2019Interaction).
