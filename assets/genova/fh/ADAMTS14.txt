# ADAMTS14

## Overview
ADAMTS14 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 14, a member of the ADAMTS family of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases. This protein is characterized by its complex multi-domain structure, which includes a catalytic metalloproteinase domain and multiple thrombospondin type 1 motifs, facilitating its role in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and remodeling (Bolz2001Characterization; Cal2002Cloning). ADAMTS14 is involved in the processing of ECM components such as collagens and proteoglycans, and it plays a crucial role in tissue integrity and signaling pathways, including TGF-β and Wnt signaling (Bekhouche2016Determination). The protein's activity is significant in processes like wound healing, lymphangiogenesis, and tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation is associated with various pathological conditions, including osteoarthritis and certain cancers (Colige2002Cloning; Lin2020Decreased).

## Structure
The ADAMTS14 protein is a member of the ADAMTS family of zinc metalloproteinases, characterized by a complex multi-domain structure. It includes an N-terminal signal peptide, a prodomain, a catalytic metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and four thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) motifs (Bolz2001Characterization). The catalytic domain features a Zn-binding motif typical of reprolysins, with a Thr residue at position 3, and a 'Met-turn' (Cal2002Cloning). The C-terminal region contains a second TS-module with three TS-like repeats and a PLAC domain with six conserved cysteine residues (Cal2002Cloning).

ADAMTS14 has four potential N-linked glycosylation sites at residues 109-112, 475-478, 941-944, and 1027-1030, indicating post-translational modifications (Bolz2001Characterization). The protein's structure is highly similar to ADAMTS-2 and ADAMTS-3, with 63% and 56% identity, respectively, forming a distinct subbranch within the ADAMTS family (Bolz2001Characterization). Structural modeling shows that ADAMTS-14 shares a superimposable pattern near the catalytic center with ADAMTS-2 and -3, and has a short sIII-sIV loop similar to snake venom proteases (Cal2002Cloning). The S3' site is wider due to a valine residue at position 439, distinguishing it from other ADAMTSs (Cal2002Cloning).

## Function
ADAMTS14 is a member of the ADAMTS family of metalloproteases, which are involved in the processing of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. It plays a significant role in ECM organization, particularly in the presence of fibril-forming collagens and fibronectin, which are crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and function (Bekhouche2016Determination). ADAMTS14 is involved in the cleavage of specific proteins such as lysyl oxidase, versican, and perlecan, which are important for ECM remodeling and signaling regulation (Bekhouche2016Determination).

In addition to its role in ECM organization, ADAMTS14 is implicated in the TGF-β receptor signaling pathway, affecting proteins like TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, which are essential for modulating cellular processes and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Bekhouche2016Determination). It also participates in the processing of pro-VEGFC into VEGFC, which is crucial for lymphangiogenesis and maintaining lymphatic homeostasis in adults (Dupont2022ADAMTS2).

ADAMTS14 is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to collagen maturation and tissue remodeling, processes vital for wound healing and development (Colige2002Cloning). Its activity in cleaving collagen and other ECM components underscores its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues (Leduc2021In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADAMTS14 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. The rs4747096 polymorphism in ADAMTS14 is associated with an increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA), particularly knee OA, as evidenced by its higher prevalence in individuals requiring joint replacement and in those with symptomatic hand OA (RodriguezLopez2009Association; Li2023Correlation). This polymorphism is also linked to Achilles tendon pathology, where it may influence the age of onset of the condition (El2013Polymorphic).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), decreased cytoplasmic expression of ADAMTS14 is significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, advanced cancer stages, and reduced survival rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Lin2020Decreased). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high expression levels of ADAMTS14 correlate with poor prognosis and are linked to various clinicopathologic variables, indicating its role as an independent prognostic factor (Chen2022Survival).

ADAMTS14 polymorphisms have also been studied in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), where certain haplotypes are associated with different forms of the disease, suggesting a role in MS susceptibility (Goertsches2005Genetic).

## Interactions
ADAMTS14 is involved in various interactions with proteins that play significant roles in extracellular matrix organization and signaling pathways. It shares many substrates with ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS3, including fibrillar collagens, fibronectin, DKK3, HLA-A, and LTBP1. Unique substrates for ADAMTS14 include lysyl oxidase and lysyl oxidase like-1, which are crucial for collagen and elastin crosslinking, as well as versican and perlecan, which are secreted proteoglycans with diverse functions (Bekhouche2016Determination).

ADAMTS14 is also implicated in the cleavage of DKK3, influencing its role in inhibiting the Wnt pathway, and LTBP1, affecting TGF-β signaling by altering the abundance of LTBP1 complexes (Bekhouche2016Determination). It can cleave TGF-β RIII, a transmembrane receptor, resulting in shed fragments that modulate TGF-β signaling (Bekhouche2016Determination).

The enzyme's interactions extend to the cleavage of type XVIII collagen, particularly at a site involved in releasing endostatin, a potent antiangiogenic fragment (Bekhouche2016Determination). These interactions highlight ADAMTS14's role in modulating extracellular matrix components and signaling pathways, particularly those related to TGF-β and Wnt signaling.
