# CLMN

## Overview
The CLMN gene encodes the protein calmin, which is a transmembrane protein characterized by its role as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-actin tether. Calmin is integral to cellular processes involving the actin cytoskeleton, particularly in cell migration and morphology. The protein contains two N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domains that facilitate its interaction with F-actin, a key component of the cytoskeleton, and a carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain that localizes it to ER tubules. This localization is crucial for its function in linking the ER to actin structures, thereby influencing cell motility and intracellular signaling pathways. Calmin's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular architecture and promoting dynamic cellular activities essential for tissue development and repair (Merta2024Spatial; Marzinke2010Calmin).

## Structure
The CLMN (calmin) protein is characterized by its carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain and two N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domains, which are known for their actin-binding capabilities (Marzinke2012The; Marzinke2010Calmin). These CH domains are structurally related to those found in the LINC complex components Nesprin 1/2, suggesting a potential actin-binding function (Merta2024Spatial). The CH1 domain directly binds to actin, while the CH2 domain regulates this interaction, with a hinge region modulating their flexibility (Merta2024Spatial).

The transmembrane domain of CLMN is short, consisting of 17-18 amino acids, and is crucial for its localization to ER tubules, excluding it from the nuclear envelope (Merta2024Spatial). The protein is hypothesized to act as an ER-actin tether, facilitating interactions between the ER network and actin structures, which influences cell migration (Merta2024Spatial).

Several splice variants of CLMN have been described, including isoforms that result in truncated proteins lacking the transmembrane domain and another with a 31 amino acid insertion that retains the transmembrane domain (Marzinke2010Calmin). The full-length protein is detected at approximately 160 kDa in rat and mouse brain tissues (Marzinke2010Calmin).

## Function
Calmin (CLMN) is a protein that functions as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-actin tether, playing a crucial role in cell migration and F-actin dynamics. It localizes primarily to ER tubules and focal adhesions, where it influences the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. The protein contains calponin homology (CH) domains, which mediate its interaction with F-actin, facilitating its role in tethering the ER to actin structures at focal adhesions (Merta2024Spatial).

CLMN is involved in the regulation of cell morphology and motility by promoting focal adhesion disassembly and influencing intracellular calcium dynamics. It recruits ER tubules to cell peripheries rich in F-actin, enhancing local calcium signaling necessary for adhesion disassembly and stress fiber destabilization, which are critical for efficient cell migration (Merta2024Spatial).

The protein's transmembrane domain is essential for its localization to ER tubules and exclusion from the nuclear envelope, highlighting its specific spatial activity within the cell (Merta2024Spatial). CLMN's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cell structure and promoting cell movement, which are vital for tissue development and repair.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Calmin (CLMN) is involved in interactions with actin structures within cells. It contains calponin homology (CH) domains, specifically CH1 and CH2, which are crucial for its interaction with F-actin, a filamentous form of actin. The CH1 domain directly binds to actin, while the CH2 domain regulates this interaction. The hinge region between these domains influences CLMN's binding to actin, and modifications to this region can alter its localization and function (Merta2024Spatial). CLMN acts as a molecular tether, connecting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to actin structures, and is involved in cell migration by affecting F-actin organization (Merta2024Spatial).

CLMN localizes to ER tubules and F-actin assemblies on the cell's basolateral surface. It colocalizes with RTN4-positive tubules and is found in punctae at the basolateral surface associated with F-actin structures. These structures are stable and persist over time, indicating a strong interaction with F-actin (Merta2024Spatial). CLMN also associates with paxillin-positive focal adhesions, which are F-actin-rich structures that anchor the cell to its environment. It is enriched at a subset of these focal adhesions, particularly at the ends of F-actin stress fibers (Merta2024Spatial).
