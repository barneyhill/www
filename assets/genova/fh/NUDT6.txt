# NUDT6

## Overview
NUDT6 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 6, which is a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphates linked to other moieties, although the specific substrate for nudix hydrolase 6 in healthy human cells has not been conclusively identified (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). The NUDT6 gene is located on the reverse strand of chromosome 4q26 and is highly conserved across species, underscoring its potential importance in cellular functions (MacFarlane2010Regulation). The protein encoded by NUDT6 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, invasion, and cell-cycle regulation, particularly influencing the transition from the G0/G1 to the S phase (MacFarlane2010Regulation). It also plays a role in modulating cell proliferation in response to growth signals, possibly through its interaction with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) (Sukhthankar2010A). Additionally, NUDT6 is implicated in mRNA decapping and cellular responses to oxidative stress, although its precise molecular activities remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
NUDT6, also known as nudix hydrolase 6, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) through an antisense RNA mechanism. This gene is located on the reverse strand of the 4q26 region on human chromosome 4, and it is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential functional role (MacFarlane2010Regulation). NUDT6 is part of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, which is involved in hydrolyzing nucleoside diphosphates linked to other moieties, although its specific substrate in healthy human cells has not been identified (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

In cellular processes, NUDT6 is implicated in cell adhesion, invasion, and cell-cycle regulation, particularly in the transition from the G0/G1 to the S phase (MacFarlane2010Regulation). It is suggested to play a role in modulating cell proliferation in response to growth signals, potentially through its interaction with FGF-2 (Sukhthankar2010A). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and may influence processes like mRNA decapping and cellular response to oxidative stress, impacting cell proliferation and survival. However, the precise molecular activities of NUDT6 in healthy human cells remain unclear, as no specific substrate or activity has been identified under the conditions tested (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NUDT6 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders. In the context of cancer, NUDT6 acts as an antisense partner to the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) gene, and its expression inversely correlates with FGF2 levels. This relationship is crucial in regulating cellular processes such as proliferation and invasion. Disruptions in this balance can lead to increased tumor progression in esophageal adenocarcinoma and pituitary adenomas, as well as increased invasiveness in endometriosis (McEachern2014ChromatinRemodeling). In esophageal adenocarcinoma, elevated expression of NUDT6, also known as FGF antisense (FGF-AS), is associated with reduced tumor recurrence and improved survival rates (MacFarlane2010Regulationa).

In neuropsychiatric disorders, NUDT6 has been shown to play a role in depression-like behaviors by promoting inflammation and suppressing neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Overexpression of NUDT6 leads to increased expression of proinflammatory proteins and activation of inflammatory pathways, contributing to its depressogenic effects. These changes occur independently of FGF2 signaling, suggesting a distinct mechanism by which NUDT6 influences affective behavior (Uzay2022NUDT6).
