# PMEL

## Overview
The PMEL gene encodes the premelanosome protein, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of melanosomes, the organelles responsible for melanin synthesis and storage in pigment cells. This protein is crucial for the formation of amyloid fibrils within melanosomes, providing a scaffold for melanin deposition. PMEL is predominantly expressed in pigmented tissues, including skin melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelium, and undergoes extensive post-translational modifications and proteolytic processing to achieve its functional form. The protein's structure includes several domains, such as a polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain and a kringle-like domain (KLD), which are essential for its role in fibril formation and melanosome maturation (Chrystal2021Functional; McGlinchey2009The; Ho2016The). Mutations in the PMEL gene have been linked to various pigmentation and ocular disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease (Andersson2013Equine; LaholaChomiak2018NonSynonymous).

## Structure
The PMEL protein, also known as Pmel17 or gp100, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein involved in melanin synthesis. Its primary structure includes a signal sequence, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, with a large lumenal domain that undergoes extensive post-translational modifications such as N-linked and O-linked glycosylation (Chrystal2021Functional; Theos2013The). The protein is composed of several domains, including a polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain, a kringle-like domain (KLD), and a repeat (RPT) region, which is crucial for amyloid fibril formation (McGlinchey2009The; Ho2016The).

The secondary structure of PMEL is rich in beta-sheet content, particularly within the RPT domain, which forms amyloid fibers under acidic conditions typical of the melanosome lumen (McGlinchey2009The). The tertiary structure involves the formation of disulfide bonds, particularly involving the conserved cysteine residue Cys-301, which is crucial for the stabilization of PMEL dimers and the prevention of premature fibril formation (Ho2016The).

PMEL undergoes proteolytic processing to form fibrillogenic fragments, which oligomerize into fibrils, forming the fibrillar matrix of early-stage melanosomes (Theos2013The). The quaternary structure is characterized by the assembly of these fibrils into a functional amyloid matrix, essential for melanin deposition (Graham2019Repeat).

## Function
The PMEL gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the formation and function of melanosomes, which are specialized organelles responsible for melanin synthesis and storage in pigment cells. PMEL is primarily expressed in pigmented tissues such as skin melanocytes, uveal melanocytes, and retinal pigment epithelium (Theos2005The). The protein is involved in the early stages of melanosome biogenesis, where it forms fibrillar structures within stage II melanosomes. These fibrils provide a scaffold for melanin deposition, facilitating the polymerization of eumelanin precursors (Hellström2011Inactivation; Theos2005The).

PMEL is synthesized as a type I integral membrane glycoprotein and undergoes several modifications and proteolytic cleavages essential for its function. These processes include the addition of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides and cleavage by proteases to generate fibrillogenic fragments (Theos2013The). The protein is targeted to early endosomes, where it associates with intralumenal vesicles and undergoes further processing to form fibrils, which are crucial for melanin deposition (Theos2013The).

In healthy human cells, PMEL's role in melanosome development contributes to pigmentation and potentially protects cells from UV damage (Theos2013The). Its absence or dysfunction can lead to hypopigmentation and altered melanosome structure (Hellström2011Inactivation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PMEL gene are associated with several ocular and pigmentation disorders. Non-synonymous variants in PMEL have been linked to ocular pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) and pigmentary glaucoma (PG), conditions characterized by the release and deposition of pigment in the eye, leading to increased intraocular pressure and potential vision loss (LaholaChomiak2018NonSynonymous). These mutations often result in defective processing of the PMEL protein, leading to abnormal amyloid fibril formation and structural changes in melanosomes (LaholaChomiak2018NonSynonymous).

In zebrafish models, PMEL mutations cause pigmentation defects and ocular abnormalities, supporting the gene's role in eye health (Hodges2023Disrupting). The mutations in PMEL are typically dominantly inherited and may act as gain-of-function mutations, disrupting normal protein function through intermolecular interactions (Hodges2023Disrupting).

In horses, a missense mutation in PMEL is responsible for Equine Multiple Congenital Ocular Anomalies (MCOA) syndrome and the silver coat color, demonstrating the gene's pleiotropic effects on pigmentation and ocular health (Andersson2013Equine). This mutation affects the cytoplasmic region of the PMEL protein, leading to changes in melanocyte structure and function (Andersson2013Equine).

## Interactions
The PMEL protein, also known as premelanosome protein, is involved in several interactions crucial for its function in melanosome biogenesis and amyloid formation. PMEL forms disulfide-bonded dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum or early Golgi, which are resolved to monomers in the late Golgi or post-Golgi compartments. This process is essential for the assembly of functional amyloid fibrils (Ho2016The). The PMEL protein undergoes proteolytic processing, resulting in the formation of a core amyloid fragment that is essential for fibril formation (Hee2017Melanosomal).

PMEL interacts with its own fragments, such as the Mα and Mβ subunits, which remain associated intracellularly, forming disulfide-linked heterooligomers (Berson2001Pmel17). The kringle-like domain (KLD) of PMEL facilitates post-endoplasmic reticulum changes to its oligomerization and disulfide bond configuration, promoting amyloid formation (Ho2016The). The PMEL protein also forms distinct native disulfide-bonded complexes, p250 and p160, which are crucial for its function in amyloid formation (Ho2016The).

Additionally, PMEL's interaction with CD63 is significant in the regulation of endosomal sorting during melanogenesis. CD63 is involved in both ESCRT-independent and -dependent sorting pathways, affecting the localization and degradation of PMEL fragments (van2011The). These interactions highlight PMEL's role in melanosome maturation and its involvement in complex protein networks within the cell.
