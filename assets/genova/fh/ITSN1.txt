# ITSN1

## Overview
The ITSN1 gene encodes intersectin 1, a multifunctional scaffold protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as endocytosis and signal transduction. Intersectin 1 is characterized by its complex multi-domain structure, which includes Eps15 homology (EH) domains, Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, and additional domains in its long isoform that facilitate interactions with various proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways (Alvisi2018Intersectin; Tsyba2011Intersectin). As an adaptor protein, intersectin 1 is integral to the regulation of endocytic pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics, influencing processes like vesicle formation and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (Hunter2013Emerging; Wong2012Intersectin). The gene's expression and function are critical in neuronal development and have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders, as well as in cancer pathogenesis (Skuladottir2024Lossoffunction; Bruel2021ITSN1:; Russo2012Intersectin).

## Structure
ITSN1 (intersectin 1) is a multi-domain protein with a complex structure that includes several key domains facilitating its role in endocytosis and signal transduction. The primary structure of ITSN1 consists of two Eps15 homology (EH) domains, a coiled-coil region, and five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (SH3A-E) (Alvisi2018Intersectin; Tsyba2011Intersectin). The long isoform, ITSN1-L, includes additional domains such as a Dbl homology (DH) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C2 domain, which are involved in activating Rho GTPases like Cdc42 (Hunter2013Emerging; Tsyba2011Intersectin).

ITSN1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms with distinct domain organizations. For instance, the neuron-specific inclusion of exon 20 in the SH3A domain alters its binding properties, enhancing affinity for proteins like dynamin 1 and synaptojanin 1 (Tsyba2008Alternative). The SH3 domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions, recognizing proline-rich motifs in target proteins (Tsyba2011Intersectin).

ITSN1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its interactions and functions (Tsyba2008Alternative). The protein's structure allows it to function as a scaffold, orchestrating the assembly of multiprotein complexes involved in cellular processes like endocytosis and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Novokhatska2013Adaptor).

## Function
The ITSN1 gene encodes a multifunctional scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily endocytosis and cell signaling. ITSN1 plays a crucial role in endocytosis by interacting with components of the endocytic machinery, such as dynamin and the clathrin adaptor complex AP2, facilitating vesicle formation and synaptic vesicle recycling (Hunter2013Emerging; Wong2012Intersectin). It stabilizes dynamin-2 oligomers, influencing their function and affecting endocytosis (Hunter2013Emerging). ITSN1 also regulates receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways, enhancing RTK ubiquitylation through the activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl, and facilitating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) endocytosis (Hunter2013Emerging).

In neurons, ITSN1 is essential for dendritic spine development and synaptic vesicle recycling, interacting with proteins involved in microtubule dynamics to maintain axonal connectivity (Hunter2013Emerging). It is involved in the regulation of GTPase activity, particularly in the Ras and Arf GTPase pathways, through interactions with guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins (Wong2012Intersectin). ITSN1's role extends to regulating membrane curvature and vesicle formation by binding to FCHo proteins and Arfaptin2 (Wong2012Intersectin). These functions highlight ITSN1's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITSN1 gene have been linked to several neurological and developmental disorders. Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in ITSN1 are associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), with a significant odds ratio of 7.3. These variants may contribute to PD pathogenesis through disruptions in Rho GTPases and synaptic vesicle transport, potentially leading to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and α-synuclein aggregation, which are key pathological features of PD (Skuladottir2024Lossoffunction).

ITSN1 mutations are also implicated in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. De novo nonsense and heterozygous truncating or missense variants in ITSN1 have been identified in patients with conditions such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy. These mutations often result in severe behavioral and psychiatric issues, including ADHD, aggressive outbursts, and psychosis. The presence of de novo variants in many cases suggests a significant role for ITSN1 in these disorders (Bruel2021ITSN1:).

Alterations in ITSN1 expression have been observed in various cancers, including neuroblastoma, where the ITSN1-S isoform is predominantly expressed. ITSN1 is involved in tumorigenesis through its role in the PI3K-C2β signaling pathway, which is crucial for the survival and growth of cancer cells (Russo2012Intersectin).

## Interactions
ITSN1 (intersectin 1) is a multi-domain protein that participates in numerous interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in endocytosis and signal transduction. ITSN1 interacts with endocytic accessory proteins such as epsin, Eps15, and the α subunit of AP2, which are involved in membrane invagination and linking ubiquitinated membrane proteins to clathrin (Tsyba2011Intersectin). The SH3 domains of ITSN1 bind to dynamin, synaptojanin 1, synapsin, SGIP1, and connecdenn, facilitating vesicle fission and other endocytic processes (Tsyba2011Intersectin). ITSN1 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl, enhancing c-Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitylation and degradation (Tsyba2011Intersectin).

ITSN1 is involved in actin cytoskeleton rearrangements by activating the small GTPase Cdc42 and interacting with its effectors, WASP and N-WASP (Tsyba2011Intersectin). It forms complexes with Sos1, stimulating Ras activation, and with Ruk/CIN85, which regulates the recruitment of the Cbl-EGFR complex to endosomes (Tsyba2011Intersectin). ITSN1 also interacts with PI3K-C2β, regulating neuronal cell survival through the PI3K-AKT pathway (Tsyba2011Intersectin). These interactions highlight ITSN1's role in coordinating endocytosis and cytoskeletal dynamics.
