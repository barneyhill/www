# LMBRD1

## Overview
LMBRD1 is a gene that encodes the LMBD1 protein, a transmembrane transporter primarily involved in vitamin B12 metabolism. The LMBD1 protein is integral to lysosomal membranes and plays a critical role in the intracellular transport of cobalamin, facilitating its release from lysosomes into the cytoplasm. This process is essential for the conversion of cobalamin into its active coenzyme forms, which are necessary for the function of vitamin B12-dependent enzymes. Additionally, LMBD1 acts as an adaptor in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, particularly in the internalization and recycling of the insulin receptor, thereby influencing insulin signaling pathways. Mutations in the LMBRD1 gene are linked to cobalamin F (cblF) disorder, a rare condition characterized by impaired vitamin B12 metabolism, leading to a spectrum of clinical symptoms. The gene's involvement in both metabolic and signaling pathways underscores its significance in cellular function and human health (Constantinou2015A; Deme2014Purification; Tseng2013LMBD1).

## Structure
The LMBRD1 gene encodes the LMBD1 protein, which is a membrane protein involved in vitamin B12 metabolism. The primary structure of LMBD1 consists of 540 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 61.4 kDa (Gailus2010Insights). The protein is predicted to have nine transmembrane helices, indicating its role as a transmembrane transporter (Kawaguchi2016Translocation; Deme2014Purification). The secondary structure includes these transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function in lysosomal membranes.

LMBD1 is known to form dimers, as evidenced by various biochemical analyses, including Blue Native PAGE and chemical crosslinking, which suggest that the native form of LMBD1 is dimeric (Deme2014Purification). The protein also contains six predicted lysosomal N-glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that may affect its stability and function (Deme2014Purification).

The protein shares homology with the lipocalin-1 interacting membrane receptor (LIMR), suggesting a similar structural fold that may be involved in the internalization of small hydrophobic molecules (Deme2014Purification). No specific information on splice variant isoforms is provided in the context.

## Function
The LMBRD1 gene encodes the LMBD1 protein, which plays a crucial role in the intracellular transport and metabolism of cobalamin (vitamin B12) in healthy human cells. LMBD1 is primarily located in the lysosomal membrane and is essential for the release of cobalamin from lysosomes into the cytoplasm. This release is vital for the conversion of cobalamin into its active coenzyme forms, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, which are necessary for the function of vitamin B12-dependent enzymes such as methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Breuer2022Exome; Deme2014Purification).

LMBD1 also acts as an adaptor for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the insulin receptor (IR), facilitating its internalization and recycling. This process is important for regulating insulin signaling pathways and maintaining glucose metabolism (Tseng2013LMBD1). The protein's interaction with adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) and its involvement in clathrin-mediated endocytosis highlight its role in cellular signaling and trafficking (Tseng2013LMBD1). Additionally, LMBD1 is involved in the translocation of the ABC transporter ABCD4 from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes, which is crucial for proper cobalamin metabolism (Kawaguchi2016Translocation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LMBRD1 gene are associated with cobalamin F (cblF) disorder, a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by defects in vitamin B12 metabolism. This disorder results from bi-allelic mutations in LMBRD1, leading to impaired export of cobalamin from lysosomes, causing its accumulation and subsequent disruption in the conversion to active enzyme cofactors. Clinically, cblF disorder presents with a range of symptoms including intrauterine growth restriction, failure to thrive, developmental delay, macrocytic anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperhomocysteinemia, and methylmalonic aciduria (Constantinou2015A; Huizing2020Inherited).

The prevalence of cblF disease is less than 1 per 1,000,000 individuals worldwide, with only 16 cases reported. All known mutations in LMBRD1 are truncating, and there is no clear genotype/phenotype correlation (Huizing2020Inherited). Treatment with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin can improve survival and reduce clinical manifestations, although it may not reverse developmental delays (Constantinou2015A; Alfadhel2011Eighteen‐year).

LMBRD1 may also play a role in cardiovascular laterality defects, as suggested by the identification of a novel homozygous missense variant in individuals with congenital heart defects and heterotaxy, although these cases did not exhibit metabolic abnormalities (Breuer2022Exome).

## Interactions
LMBRD1 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in vitamin B12 metabolism and insulin receptor internalization. It forms a complex with the ABC transporter ABCD4, facilitating the translocation of ABCD4 from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes. This interaction is essential for the proper lysosomal targeting of ABCD4, and mutations in either LMBRD1 or ABCD4 can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency due to impaired cobalamin transport (Kawaguchi2016Translocation; Fettelschoss2017Clinical).

LMBRD1 also interacts with the cytoplasmic vitamin B12-processing protein MMACHC, forming a high-affinity complex that is crucial for the export of cobalamin from lysosomes to the cytosol. This interaction is characterized by a slow dissociation rate, indicating a stable complex formation (Deme2014Purification).

In addition to its role in vitamin B12 metabolism, LMBRD1 acts as a specific adaptor for the insulin receptor (IR), facilitating its internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This interaction is selective, as LMBRD1 does not co-localize with the transferrin receptor. Knockdown of LMBRD1 results in the accumulation of IR on the plasma membrane, highlighting its importance in IR endocytosis and signaling (Tseng2013LMBD1).
