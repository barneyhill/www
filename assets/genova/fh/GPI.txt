# GPI

## Overview
The GPI gene encodes the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism and various physiological processes. As a key enzyme in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase catalyzes the reversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, facilitating energy production and glucose homeostasis (Lin2009Effects). Beyond its metabolic functions, this enzyme is categorized as a moonlighting protein due to its involvement in diverse biological activities, including acting as an autocrine motility factor in tumor progression and as neuroleukin, a neurotrophic factor (Manco2016Hereditary). The structural integrity of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, characterized by its homodimeric form and TIM barrel fold, is crucial for its catalytic and non-catalytic roles (Lin2009Effects). The enzyme's interactions with other proteins, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and oxidation resistance 1, further underscore its significance in cellular processes and disease mechanisms (Das2016Molecular; Finelli2018Oxidation).

## Structure
The human glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) is a homodimeric enzyme, meaning it consists of two identical subunits, each with a molecular weight of approximately 63 kDa (Lin2009Effects; Repiso2006Red). The enzyme's primary structure is composed of 558 amino acids (Manco2016Hereditary). The secondary structure of GPI includes a large and a small domain, each featuring a parallel β-sheet core surrounded by α-helices (Lin2009Effects). The tertiary structure of GPI is characterized by a prominent TIM barrel fold, which is common in enzymes that catalyze isomerization reactions (Lin2009Effects). 

The active site for phosphosugar conversion is located in a cleft between the domains and is formed by amino acid residues from the two neighboring subunits, highlighting the importance of the quaternary structure for its catalytic function (Lin2009Effects). GPI is also known to function as a moonlighting protein, sharing sequence homology with neuroleukin and acting as an autocrine motility factor (Manco2016Hereditary). The enzyme's structure is conserved across different species, indicating its essential role in carbohydrate metabolism (Lin2009Effects).

## Function
Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) is a crucial enzyme in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways, catalyzing the reversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). This reaction is essential for energy production and glucose metabolism in cells, as it facilitates the breakdown and synthesis of glucose, maintaining glucose homeostasis (Lin2009Effects). GPI is active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (Lin2009Effects).

In addition to its metabolic functions, GPI has several other physiological roles. It acts as an autocrine motility factor (AMF), which is involved in tumor progression and metastasis by interacting with a glycosylated AMF receptor, leading to the activation of RhoA and Rac1 and subsequent rearrangement of actin fibers (Lin2009Effects). GPI is also known as neuroleukin, a factor that supports the survival of sensory and specific embryonic spinal neurons (Lin2009Effects). Furthermore, GPI functions as a maturation factor, mediating the differentiation of human myeloid leukemic HL-60 cells into terminal monocytic cells (Lin2009Effects).

## Interactions
Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in cancer cells. It forms complexes with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). In tumor tissues, the expression of GPI and PKM2 is elevated, while GAPDH expression decreases. Immunoprecipitation assays have shown that GPI and PKM2 associate with GAPDH in tumor cells, forming distinct complexes: GAPDH-GPI and GAPDH-PKM2. However, PKM2 does not directly interact with GPI (Das2016Molecular). 

Molecular docking analyses suggest that the C-terminal domain of GAPDH is involved in its interaction with both GPI and PKM2, while the C-terminal domain of GPI is likely used in its interaction with GAPDH (Das2016Molecular). 

In the context of neuroprotection, GPI interacts with the oxidation resistance 1 (Oxr1) protein. Oxr1 modulates the oligomerization and activity of GPI, influencing its glycolytic and cytokine functions. This interaction is significant in the cerebellum, where Oxr1 affects GPI's role in glucose metabolism and oxidative stress response (Finelli2018Oxidation). These interactions highlight GPI's multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
