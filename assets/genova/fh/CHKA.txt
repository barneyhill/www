# CHKA

## Overview
The CHKA gene encodes the enzyme choline kinase alpha (CKα), which is a member of the kinase family and plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a key component of cell membranes. CKα catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline to phosphocholine, marking the initial step in the CDP-choline pathway crucial for lipid metabolism and cell membrane integrity (GallegoOrtega2011Involvement; Wu2008Early). The enzyme is particularly important during embryonic development and rapid cell growth, as it is involved in cell signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK, which are essential for cellular proliferation and survival (Chen2017Molecular). CHKA's interactions with proteins like the androgen receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor further underscore its role in cancer cell signaling and proliferation, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in oncology (Lin2017Choline; Asim2015Choline).

## Structure
The human choline kinase alpha (CHKA) protein is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine and exists in multiple isoforms, including hChoKα1 and hChoKα2, which are products of alternative splicing of the CHKA gene (Chen2017Molecular; Rubio‐Ruiz2020Recent). The protein's structure includes a choline kinase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Arlauckas2016Choline). 

The tertiary structure of CHKA has been elucidated through X-ray crystallography, revealing the ATP and choline binding pockets. The ATP binding site is located in a cleft between the N and C-terminal lobes, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with specific residues (Rubio‐Ruiz2020Recent). The choline binding site is a deep hydrophobic groove surrounded by acidic residues, facilitating the binding of phosphocholine (Rubio‐Ruiz2020Recent).

CHKA functions as a homodimer or heterodimer, with the homodimeric form showing higher enzymatic activity (Chen2017Molecular; Arlauckas2016Choline). The protein's quaternary structure involves the assembly of these dimeric forms, which are essential for its function in catalyzing the conversion of choline into phosphocholine (Rubio‐Ruiz2020Recent). The flexibility of certain residues, such as W420 in hChoKα1, contributes to the binding of specific inhibitors, highlighting the structural differences between isoforms (Rubio‐Ruiz2020Recent).

## Function
The CHKA gene encodes choline kinase alpha (CKα), an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major component of eukaryotic cell membranes. CKα catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline to phosphocholine, the first step in the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis. This process is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes and is involved in cell signaling and lipid metabolism (GallegoOrtega2011Involvement; Wu2008Early).

CKα is crucial during early embryonic development, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality observed in mice lacking this enzyme. However, in adult tissues, a reduced level of CKα is sufficient to maintain normal PC levels, indicating its critical role during rapid cell growth and development (Wu2008Early). CKα is also involved in cell proliferation and survival, influencing pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK, which are important for organ development and cellular functions (Chen2017Molecular).

In healthy human cells, CKα is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the synthesis of phosphocholine, a precursor for PC. This activity is vital for maintaining lipid homeostasis and supporting cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (GallegoOrtega2011Involvement; Li2014Phosphatidylcholine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHKA gene are associated with several significant clinical conditions. Bi-allelic variants in CHKA have been linked to a novel neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, early-onset seizures, and microcephaly. This disorder is marked by a significant reduction in choline kinase activity, particularly for the missense variants p.(Arg141Trp) and p.(Pro194Ser), which show activity levels at 15-20% of the wild-type. Another variant, p.(Phe341Leu), results in a 50% reduction in activity and is found in a compound-heterozygous state with a frameshift variant, leading to an overall activity of about 25% (Klöckner2022Biallelic).

In cancer, CHKA is frequently overexpressed and is implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. In colorectal carcinoma, CHKA overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to the activation of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival (Hu2016Overexpression). In prostate cancer, CHKA acts as an androgen receptor chaperone, stabilizing the receptor and influencing androgen signaling, which is significant in the context of treatment resistance (Asim2015Choline). These findings suggest that CHKA is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers.

## Interactions
Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cancer cell signaling and proliferation. In prostate cancer, CHKA acts as a chaperone for the androgen receptor (AR), interacting specifically with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AR. This interaction stabilizes AR conformation and is crucial for AR's cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation. CHKA knockdown reduces AR protein levels, indicating a regulatory role in AR stability and function (Asim2015Choline).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CHKA interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), enhancing its autophosphorylation and dimerization, which is essential for activating the AKT signaling pathway. This interaction promotes the migratory and invasive abilities of HCC cells and contributes to drug resistance by preventing EGFR internalization (Lin2017Choline).

In breast cancer, CHKA forms a complex with EGFR in a c-Src-dependent manner. This interaction is critical for EGF-dependent cell proliferation, with c-Src phosphorylating CHKA at specific tyrosine residues, enhancing its association with EGFR. This complex formation is important for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Miyake2011Functional).
