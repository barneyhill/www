# CATSPER4

## Overview
CATSPER4 is a gene that encodes the protein cation channel sperm-associated 4, which is a crucial component of the CatSper channel complex. This complex is a sperm-specific, calcium-selective ion channel that plays a vital role in male fertility by regulating calcium influx necessary for sperm motility and hyperactivation. CATSPER4 is a transmembrane protein characterized by six transmembrane segments and is part of the ion-conducting pore of the channel. It interacts with other CatSper proteins to form a functional heterotetrameric channel essential for processes such as sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction, which are critical for successful fertilization (Lishko2018CatSper:; Rahban2020CatSper:). Mutations or disruptions in the CATSPER4 gene can lead to impaired sperm function and male infertility, underscoring its importance in reproductive health (Brown2019Human; Sun2017The).

## Structure
The CATSPER4 protein is a component of the CatSper channel complex, which is crucial for sperm motility. It is a transmembrane protein with six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), forming part of the ion-conducting pore. The S4 segment contains positively charged amino acids that function as a voltage sensor, although CATSPER4 has a particularly weak voltage sensor domain characterized by the sequence xxxRxxRxxx (Lishko2018CatSper:; Sun2017The).

The primary structure of CATSPER4 includes conserved motifs typical of voltage-gated calcium channels, such as the T×D×W motif in the pore-forming region between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains (Song2011Molecular). The secondary structure is characterized by alpha helices forming the transmembrane domains, while the tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a functional 3D conformation.

In terms of quaternary structure, CATSPER4 assembles with other CatSper proteins, specifically forming a heterotetramer with CatSper1, CatSper2, and CatSper3, to create the functional CatSper channel (Lishko2018CatSper:; Bystroff2018Intramembranal). This assembly is stabilized by disulfide cross-linking interactions, which are crucial for the correct assembly and function of the channel (Bystroff2018Intramembranal).

## Function
CATSPER4 is a critical component of the CatSper channel complex, a sperm-specific calcium ion channel essential for male fertility. This channel is composed of four pore-forming α subunits, including CATSPER4, and several auxiliary subunits. CATSPER4 is localized in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum, where it plays a vital role in regulating calcium influx, which is crucial for sperm motility and hyperactivation (Rahban2020CatSper:; Sun2017The).

The CatSper channel is activated by various factors, including changes in pH, membrane voltage, and the presence of progesterone and prostaglandins. This activation leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, which is necessary for processes such as sperm capacitation, hyperactive motility, and the acrosome reaction, all of which are essential for successful fertilization (Rahban2020CatSper:; NowickaBauer2021Structure).

Mutations or disruptions in CATSPER4 can lead to impaired sperm function and male infertility, as the absence of any CatSper subunit, including CATSPER4, results in the loss of channel function and the inability to achieve hyperactivated motility (Rahban2020CatSper:; Sun2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CATSPER4 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly due to their impact on sperm motility. CATSPER4 is a subunit of the CatSper ion channel, which is essential for sperm hyperactivated motility, a critical factor for successful fertilization. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of CATSPER4 results in infertility due to impaired sperm motility, despite normal spermatogenesis (Jin2007Catsper3). In humans, mutations in CATSPER4 have been associated with asthenozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility. Specific mutations, such as c.247A>G (p.Met83Val) and c.157T>C (p.Tyr53His), have been identified in men with this condition, suggesting a significant impact on protein function and sperm motility (Visser2011A).

The CATSPER4 gene's role in male fertility is underscored by its evolutionary conservation and the severe fertility issues arising from its dysfunction. Genetic evidence indicates that alterations in CATSPER4 expression or mutations can lead to compromised fertilization both in vivo and in vitro, highlighting its critical role in reproductive health (Brown2019Human).

## Interactions
CATSPER4 is a component of the CatSper calcium channel complex, which is essential for sperm motility and fertility. This complex is located in the plasma membrane of sperm tails and is composed of four main subunits: CATSPER1, CATSPER2, CATSPER3, and CATSPER4, along with several auxiliary subunits. CATSPER4 interacts with these other CatSper proteins to form a tetrameric, calcium-selective channel that is crucial for sperm hyperactivation, a process necessary for successful fertilization (Sehrish2011CatSper).

The assembly and function of the CatSper complex are regulated by several interacting proteins. C2CD6 is necessary for the proper incorporation of the CatSper complex into sperm flagella, interacting strongly with CATSPER4 among other CatSper components (Yang2021C2CD6). EFCAB9, a pH-dependent Ca2+ sensor, interacts with the CatSper complex, including CATSPER4, to regulate its activity and ensure proper sperm motility (Hwang2018EFCAB9). The Multiple PDZ domain protein (MPDZ) also influences the expression of CatSper subunits, including CATSPER4, through transcriptional regulation, impacting sperm motility and fertility (Wang2023Multiple). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving CATSPER4 that is critical for its role in sperm function.
