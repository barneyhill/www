# ATG2A

## Overview
ATG2A is a gene that encodes the autophagy-related protein 2A, which plays a pivotal role in the cellular process of autophagy. This protein is primarily involved in the biogenesis of autophagosomes, acting as a lipid transporter essential for the expansion of the autophagosome membrane. Structurally, ATG2A is a large, rod-shaped protein that facilitates the transfer of lipids at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagophore junction, a critical site for autophagosome formation. The protein's interactions with other autophagy-related proteins, such as WIPI4 and members of the GABARAP family, are crucial for its function in autophagosome maturation and cellular homeostasis. Mutations in the ATG2A gene have been linked to various diseases, including Crohn's disease and hyperuricemia, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (TamargoGómez2020Pathogenic; Valverde2019ATG2; Yamada2017Identification).

## Structure
The ATG2A protein is a large, rod-shaped protein involved in autophagosome biogenesis, characterized by a length of approximately 180-200 Å and a width of 30-50 Å (Wang2024Structural; Chowdhury2018Insights). It features a central hydrophobic cavity formed by 34 pairs of β-strands arranged into a twisted β-sheet, facilitating the passage of lipid acyl chains (Wang2024Structural). The protein is divided into three regions: the N-terminal region, the middle passage region, and the C-terminal region (Wang2024Structural).

The N-terminal region contains the Chorein_N domain, which is crucial for ER anchoring and lipid extraction (Wang2024Structural; Noda2021Atg2). The C-terminal region includes the ATG_C domain, which is flexible and may interact transiently with the lipid transfer cavity (Wang2024Structural). The ATG2A protein also contains a C-terminal localization region (CLR) that is essential for localizing ATG2A to the phagophore, utilizing amphipathic α-helices (Wang2024Structural).

ATG2A forms a complex with WIPI4, which anchors it to PI3P-positive phagophore membranes, and with ATG9A, facilitating lipid transfer and phagophore expansion (Wang2024Structural). The ATG2A-WIPI4 complex is characterized by a 1:1 stoichiometric interaction, forming a stable complex (Chowdhury2018Insights). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in autophagosome biogenesis.

## Function
The ATG2A gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the process of autophagy, specifically in the biogenesis of autophagosomes, which are essential for cellular degradation and recycling. ATG2A functions primarily as a lipid transporter, facilitating the transfer of lipids necessary for the expansion of the autophagosome membrane. This activity is critical for the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, which sequester and degrade cytoplasmic components (Valverde2019ATG2).

ATG2A is localized to the contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and autophagosomes, where it supports lipid homeostasis and membrane expansion. It operates at the ER-phagophore junction, often in complex with WIPI4, to tether PI3P-containing vesicles to non-PI3P-containing vesicles, facilitating lipid transfer necessary for phagophore expansion (Valverde2019ATG2; Chowdhury2018Insights).

The protein's structure allows it to bind and transfer multiple glycerophospholipids simultaneously, which is essential for maintaining the lipid composition of the growing autophagosome membrane. This function is conserved across eukaryotic organisms, highlighting its fundamental role in autophagy (Valverde2019ATG2; Tamura2017Differential). The ability of ATG2A to tether membranes and facilitate lipid transfer is vital for cellular homeostasis and the organism's response to nutrient deprivation (Chowdhury2018Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATG2A gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. Variants of the ATG2A gene are associated with granuloma formation in Crohn's disease and hyperuricemia. These conditions are related to the gene's role in lipid transfer to nascent autophagosomal membranes, which is crucial for autophagy, a process involved in cellular degradation and recycling (TamargoGómez2020Pathogenic). 

The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs188780113 in the ATG2A gene has been significantly associated with serum uric acid levels, suggesting a role in hyperuricemia. This SNP, with a minor allele frequency of 3.3%, is linked to decreased uric acid levels, indicating that ATG2A may influence uric acid regulation, a factor in conditions like gout and chronic kidney disease (Yamada2017Identification).

Pathogenic SNPs in ATG2A and related lipid transfer mediators are implicated in various pathologies, while those affecting PI(3)P-binding proteins are more commonly associated with neurological disorders (TamargoGómez2020Pathogenic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ATG2A in disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
ATG2A is a protein involved in the autophagy process, interacting with several other proteins to facilitate autophagosome formation and maturation. A critical interaction is with the GABARAP family of proteins, including GABARAP and GABARAP-L1. This interaction is mediated by a conserved LC3 interaction region (LIR) within ATG2A, which is essential for phagophore closure and autophagy flux. Mutations in the LIR motif disrupt this interaction, leading to impaired autophagy, highlighting its importance (Bozic2019A; Bozic2020A).

ATG2A also interacts with WIPI4 through a separate YFS motif, located approximately 30 amino acids from the LIR. This interaction, however, is not essential for phagophore closure or autophagy flux, as mutations in the YFS motif do not significantly impact these processes (Bozic2019A; Bozic2020A). The interaction with WIPI4 may play a regulatory role, potentially negatively influencing the ATG2A-GABARAP interaction (Bozic2020A).

Additionally, ATG2A interacts with WDR45, a component of the ATG2-WIPI complex, through a conserved Y/HF motif. This interaction is crucial for the binding of WDR45, which may play a role in autophagosome maturation (Zheng2017Architecture).
