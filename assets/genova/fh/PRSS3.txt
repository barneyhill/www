# PRSS3

## Overview
The PRSS3 gene encodes for the enzyme serine protease 3, also known as mesotrypsin, which is a member of the trypsin family of serine proteases. This enzyme is distinguished by its unique resistance to natural trypsin inhibitors, a characteristic attributed to specific structural features, including a critical amino acid substitution. Mesotrypsin plays a significant role in various physiological processes, such as the regulation of trypsin activity and the processing of pro-filaggrin in the epidermis. It is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence its function in both normal and pathological conditions, including viral replication and inflammatory diseases. Clinically, PRSS3 is implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Ma2019PRSS3Mesotrypsin; Jiang2010PRSS3; Szmola2003Human; Kida2024PRSS3mesotrypsin).

## Structure
The PRSS3 gene encodes for mesotrypsin, a unique variant of trypsin that exhibits resistance to natural trypsin inhibitors due to specific structural features. The primary structure of mesotrypsin includes a notable substitution at position 198, where glycine is replaced by arginine. This substitution is crucial for its resistance to inhibitors like soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) and human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (SPINK1) (Szmola2003Human).

The secondary and tertiary structures of mesotrypsin are characterized by the typical serine protease fold, which includes a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity. The presence of Arg-198 near the active site impairs inhibitor binding, enhancing its stability against autocatalytic degradation (Szmola2003Human).

Mesotrypsin's quaternary structure involves interactions that may influence its function, although specific details on dimerization or complex formation are not provided. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, which may include glycosylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided.

Splice variant isoforms of PRSS3 result in different functional forms, such as trypsinogen IV, which is expressed at low levels in various tissues and may have distinct physiological roles (Rowen2005Interchromosomal).

## Function
The PRSS3 gene encodes mesotrypsin, a unique isoform of trypsin that plays a significant role in various molecular processes in healthy human cells. Mesotrypsin is primarily involved in the degradation of trypsin inhibitors, such as SPINK1 and SBTI, due to its resistance to these inhibitors. This resistance is attributed to a mutation where glycine 198 is replaced by arginine, which affects inhibitor binding and substrate hydrolysis (Szmola2003Human). Mesotrypsin's ability to degrade trypsin inhibitors suggests its role in regulating trypsin activity and preventing premature activation of trypsinogen in the pancreas (Szmola2003Human).

In the epidermis, mesotrypsin is expressed in the upper layers and is crucial for processing pro-filaggrin (Pro-FLG) into filaggrin, which is important for maintaining the biophysical characteristics of epidermal keratinocytes. It influences cellular morphology by altering F-actin assembly, enhancing E-cadherin adhesive activity, and facilitating tight junction formation (Kida2024PRSS3mesotrypsin). Mesotrypsin also induces G1 growth arrest in keratinocytes, suggesting a role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation (Kida2024PRSS3mesotrypsin).

## Clinical Significance
The PRSS3 gene, encoding the enzyme mesotrypsin, is implicated in several cancers due to its role in promoting tumor progression and metastasis. In lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), PRSS3 expression is associated with poor prognosis, contributing to cancer cell invasion and proliferation. Targeting PRSS3/mesotrypsin has been shown to reduce these malignant behaviors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ma2019PRSS3Mesotrypsin).

In pancreatic cancer, PRSS3 is overexpressed in metastatic cell lines, promoting tumor growth and metastasis through the upregulation of VEGF via the PAR1-mediated ERK pathway. This overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and increased metastasis, making PRSS3 a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Jiang2010PRSS3).

PRSS3 is also upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer, where it is associated with early recurrence post-prostatectomy. Inhibiting mesotrypsin has been shown to suppress prostate cancer cell invasion, highlighting its role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Hockla2012PRSS3Mesotrypsin).

In gastric cancer, high PRSS3 expression correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis, acting as an oncogene that promotes tumor growth and invasion (Wang2019High‐level).

## Interactions
PRSS3, also known as serine protease 3, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence its role in various physiological and pathological processes. One significant interaction is with the enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) 3A protein. This interaction has been demonstrated through colocalization studies and co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction. The PRSS3 variant 3 (PRSS3-V3) specifically binds to the EV-A71 3A protein, suggesting a role in viral replication. This interaction may facilitate the recruitment of PRSS3 to replication organelles, potentially enhancing viral replication and contributing to the neuropathogenesis of EV-A71 infection (Rattanakomol2022Host).

In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), PRSS3 has been identified as a key protein potentially involved in the disease's pathogenesis. It interacts with several proteins, including TCN1, DEFA4, DEFA1, DEFA5, DEFA3, DEFA6, PRSS2, SPINK1, and CBLIF. These interactions suggest that PRSS3 is part of a network of proteins involved in neutrophil degranulation, the innate immune system, and antimicrobial peptide pathways. Dysregulated interactions between these proteins may trigger inflammation in IBD (Jan2023Rare).
