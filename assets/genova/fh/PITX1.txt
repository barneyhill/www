# PITX1

## Overview
PITX1 is a gene that encodes the paired-like homeodomain 1 protein, a transcription factor integral to various developmental processes, particularly in limb formation and specification. The protein is characterized by a homeodomain, which facilitates its binding to DNA and interaction with other proteins, thereby regulating gene transcription (Poulin2000Specific; Ohira2019PITX1). PITX1 plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, influencing the differentiation and development of hindlimbs and the pituitary gland (Charles2005PITX; Gurnett2008Asymmetric). It also acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating the RAS pathway and suppressing the TERT gene, which is involved in telomerase activity (Kolfschoten2005A; Qi2011Identification). Mutations or misregulation of PITX1 are linked to congenital limb malformations and syndromes such as Liebenberg syndrome and Mandibular-Pelvic-Patellar syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance in developmental biology (Morel2020Mandibular‐pelvic‐patellar; Kragesteen2019H2AFY).

## Structure
The PITX1 protein is a transcription factor characterized by the presence of a homeodomain, which is a conserved DNA-binding domain typically comprising 60 amino acids forming a helix-turn-helix structure. This domain is crucial for its interaction with other proteins and for regulating gene transcription (Poulin2000Specific; Ohira2019PITX1). The homeodomain is shared between exon 2 and exon 3 of the PITX1 gene (Tran2021Pitx). 

In addition to the homeodomain, PITX1 contains an OAR domain, a 15 amino acid motif that includes a nuclear localization signal, although its precise function remains unclear (Tran2021Pitx). The OAR domain may modulate transactivation capacities or be involved in protein-protein interactions (Ohira2019PITX1).

PITX1 is known to interact with other proteins, such as ZCCHC10 and Pan1, through its homeodomain, indicating its role in forming protein complexes that regulate transcription (Poulin2000Specific; Ohira2019PITX1). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, and alternative splicing can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions.

## Function
PITX1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in the formation and specification of hindlimbs. It is a homeodomain-containing protein that is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to influence the transcription of target genes, impacting cell differentiation and development (Poulin2000Specific; Gurnett2008Asymmetric).

In healthy human cells, PITX1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, interacting with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors to control gene expression critical for cell-specific transcription and differentiation processes (Poulin2000Specific). It also acts as a suppressor of the TERT gene, which is crucial for telomerase enzyme activity, thereby playing a role in cellular aging and cancer prevention (Qi2011Identification).

PITX1 is also involved in the regulation of the RAS pathway, where it restrains endogenous wild-type RAS activity, suggesting a role in tumor suppression (Kolfschoten2005A). Its expression is essential for the proper development of the pituitary gland, where it cooperates with PITX2 to maintain the expression of the LHX3 transcription factor, crucial for pituitary organogenesis (Charles2005PITX).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PITX1 gene are associated with several congenital limb malformations and syndromes. Liebenberg syndrome is characterized by the partial transformation of arms into legs due to the misregulation of the PITX1 gene. This condition is linked to a deletion affecting the H2AFY promoter, which normally insulates the Pen enhancer from PITX1 in forelimbs, leading to its misexpression (Kragesteen2019H2AFY).

PITX1 mutations are also implicated in asymmetric lower-limb malformations, such as clubfoot, pes planus, tibial hemimelia, and patellar hypoplasia. The E130K mutation in PITX1 affects the DNA-binding homeodomain, resulting in negative effects on transcriptional activity and is associated with these conditions (Gurnett2008Asymmetric).

Mandibular-Pelvic-Patellar syndrome (MPP syndrome) is another disorder linked to PITX1, characterized by mandibular hypoplasia, narrowed iliac wings, and patellar hypo/aplasia. This syndrome is associated with novel missense variants in PITX1 that significantly reduce its transactivation ability (Morel2020Mandibular‐pelvic‐patellar).

Deletions in the PITX1 gene can lead to a spectrum of lower-limb malformations, including mirror-image polydactyly and tibial hemimelia, highlighting the gene's critical role in limb development (Klopocki2012Deletions).

## Interactions
PITX1, a transcription factor, engages in several protein-protein interactions that influence gene expression. It interacts with ZCCHC10, a protein with a CCHC domain, through its homeodomain. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of hTERT mRNA transcription, where the PITX1-ZCCHC10 complex acts as a suppressor, particularly in melanoma cells. The interaction between these proteins leads to a significant decrease in hTERT mRNA levels, suggesting a role in cellular senescence and apoptosis (Ohira2019PITX1).

PITX1 also interacts with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, such as Pan1. The homeodomain of PITX1 is essential for this interaction, which is specific to the Pitx subfamily. This interaction is important for the transcriptional activation of the POMC promoter, which is involved in pituitary development. The interaction with Pan1 is mediated by the bHLH domain of Pan1, and it is crucial for the synergistic activation of transcription (Poulin2000Specific).

These interactions highlight the role of PITX1 in transcriptional regulation through its ability to form complexes with other proteins, influencing various biological processes, including tumor suppression and development.
