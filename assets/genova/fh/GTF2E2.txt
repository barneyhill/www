# GTF2E2

## Overview
GTF2E2 is a gene that encodes the beta subunit of the general transcription factor IIE (TFIIE), a crucial component in the transcription initiation process by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. The protein product, TFIIEβ, is part of the TFIIE complex, which plays a significant role in the formation and stabilization of the transcription preinitiation complex (PIC). This complex is essential for the recruitment of other transcription factors and the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. TFIIEβ, in conjunction with TFIIEα, facilitates DNA melting and promoter clearance, processes vital for the proper functioning of transcription machinery (Compe2019TFIIE; Miwa2016Crystal). The interactions within the TFIIE complex are stabilized by specific hydrophobic and polar contacts, ensuring its structural integrity and function (Miwa2016Crystal). GTF2E2 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including its involvement in cancer progression and viral replication, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Bi2021Knockdown; Dziuba2012Identification).

## Function
The GTF2E2 gene encodes the beta subunit of the general transcription factor IIE (TFIIE), which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. TFIIE is a critical component of the transcription preinitiation complex (PIC), where it facilitates the recruitment and stabilization of other transcription factors, including TFIIH, to the promoter region of genes (Compe2019TFIIE; Miwa2016Crystal). The TFIIE complex, composed of TFIIEα and TFIIEβ subunits, plays a significant role in DNA melting and promoter clearance, aiding the transition from transcription initiation to elongation (Miwa2016Crystal).

In healthy human cells, TFIIE is involved in anchoring the CAK module of TFIIH within the PIC, which is crucial for the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by CDK7. This phosphorylation is a key step in transcription initiation, allowing RNA polymerase II to escape the promoter and begin elongation (Compe2019TFIIE). The interactions between TFIIEα and TFIIEβ are stabilized by hydrophobic and polar contacts, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the TFIIE complex (Miwa2016Crystal). TFIIE is active in the cell nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression (Compe2019TFIIE).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GTF2E2 gene have been implicated in the development and progression of certain cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), GTF2E2 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival in patients. The gene's upregulation is more pronounced in advanced-stage tumors, suggesting its role in cancer progression. Experimental evidence indicates that knockdown of GTF2E2 in LUAD cells leads to reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as increased apoptosis, highlighting its potential function as an oncogene in this context (Bi2021Knockdown).

In glioblastoma, GTF2E2 is involved in upregulating the expression of CDC20, a gene associated with poor prognosis. The aberrant expression of GTF2E2 and its interaction with CDC20 are linked to glioblastoma pathogenesis, suggesting that GTF2E2 may contribute to the disease's development through its role in transcription regulation (Yang2020Bioinformatical).

These findings suggest that GTF2E2 could serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in these cancers and as a potential therapeutic target. However, the specific role of GTF2E2 mutations in other diseases or conditions remains to be fully elucidated (Yang2020Bioinformatical; Bi2021Knockdown).

## Interactions
GTF2E2, a subunit of the general transcription factor IIE (TFIIE), is involved in several critical protein interactions. It forms a complex with GTF2E1, the alpha subunit of TFIIE, which is essential for the stability and function of the TFIIE complex. This interaction is crucial for transcription initiation, as TFIIE facilitates the loading and stable binding of TFIIH, contributing to promoter opening and transcription initiation (Theil2017Trichothiodystrophy; Gonçalves2017Widespread).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), GTF2E2 interacts with the RPS4X protein, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This interaction is significant for the proliferation and migration of tumor cells, as GTF2E2 promotes LUAD development through its interaction with RPS4X, affecting the mTOR signaling pathway (Bi2021Knockdown).

GTF2E2 also plays a role in the replication of HIV-1, where it is part of a complex involving the viral Tat protein and RNA polymerase II, crucial for HIV-1 transcription. Silencing GTF2E2 significantly inhibits HIV-1 replication, highlighting its importance in the viral life cycle (Dziuba2012Identification).
