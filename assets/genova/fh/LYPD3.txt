# LYPD3

## Overview
LYPD3 is a gene that encodes the protein LY6/PLAUR domain containing 3, also known as C4.4A, which is a member of the Ly6/uPAR family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its two LU-domains and is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, classifying it as a GPI-anchored protein. C4.4A is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues and plays a significant role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, contributing to tissue integrity and cell-cell interactions. While its precise biological function in normal human cells remains to be fully elucidated, LYPD3 is implicated in epithelial differentiation and has been identified as a biomarker for this process. The protein's involvement in cancer pathology, particularly in melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target due to its role in tumor progression and metastasis (Hu2023LY6PLAUR; Leth2019Evolution).

## Structure
The LYPD3 gene encodes the C4.4A protein, which is characterized by its two LU-domains, part of the Ly6/uPAR/α-neurotoxin domain family. These domains are known for their compact cysteine-rich knot structure with three extended loops, forming a three-fingered motif (Jiang2020Crystal; Leth2019Evolution). The protein's primary structure includes a notable absence of the plesiotypic 7-8 disulfide bond in the N-terminal LU domain, which is typically crucial for the stability of single LU-domain proteins (Leth2019Evolution).

The secondary structure of C4.4A involves six β-strands in each LU-domain, creating a scaffold for the protruding loops (Jiang2020Crystal). The tertiary structure is a compact globule formed by a large hydrophobic interface between the two LU-domains, stabilized by hydrophobic and polar interactions (Jiang2020Crystal). The protein also contains four N-linked glycans, contributing to its stability and function (Jiang2020Crystal).

C4.4A's quaternary structure involves its interaction with other proteins, such as the Fab fragment of a monoclonal antibody and AGR2, highlighting its role in protein-ligand interactions (Jiang2020Crystal). The protein is GPI-anchored, allowing it to localize on the cell membrane, which is typical for members of the Ly6/uPAR family (Loughner2016Organization).

## Function
LYPD3, also known as C4.4A, is a GPI-anchored protein with two LU domains, primarily expressed in epithelial tissues. It is a robust biomarker of epithelial differentiation, specifically confined to the stratum spinosum of the stratified squamous epithelium (Leth2019Evolution). The N-terminal LU domain of LYPD3 lacks the 7-8 disulfide bond, a feature it shares with other proteins in its genomic locus on chromosome 19q13 (Leth2019Evolution). While the precise biological function of LYPD3 in healthy human cells is not fully defined, it is implied to play a role in epithelial differentiation (Leth2019Evolution).

In terms of molecular processes, LYPD3 is involved in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, contributing to cell-cell interactions and maintaining tissue integrity (Loughner2016Organization). Despite its significant expression in epithelial tissues, mice deficient in C4.4A/LYPD3 exhibit only minor phenotypes, suggesting that its absence does not lead to significant developmental issues (Leth2019Evolution). However, high levels of C4.4A expression are associated with poor survival in patients with pulmonary non-small cell adenocarcinomas, indicating a potential role in cancer pathology (Leth2019Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LYPD3 gene have been implicated in several cancers, contributing to poor prognosis and disease progression. In melanoma, LYPD3 is part of a signaling axis with Junction Plakoglobin (JUP) and Anterior Gradient 2 (AGR2), which is crucial for maintaining cancer cell stemness and promoting glycolysis. This axis is associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, leading to resistance against immune checkpoint blockades (Hu2023LY6PLAUR). High LYPD3 expression in melanoma correlates with poor overall survival and disease-specific survival, and it is linked to increased tumor invasiveness (Hu2023LY6PLAUR).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), elevated LYPD3 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to the p53 signaling pathway, promoting tumor progression and metastasis (Hu2020Elevated). Similarly, in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), high LYPD3 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and is involved in the upregulation of the p53 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, contributing to abnormal cell proliferation (Hu2022LYPD3).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), LYPD3 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression inversely related to miR-151-5p levels. The METTL3/miR-151-5p/LYPD3 axis is implicated in the disease's metastatic progression (Huang2024m6Adependent).

## Interactions
LYPD3, also known as C4.4A, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in cancer progression and metastasis. It interacts with Anterior Gradient 2 (AGR2), forming part of a signaling axis with Junction Plakoglobin (JUP) that regulates melanoma cell stemness and promotes glycolysis through a GLUT1-dependent pathway (Hu2023LY6PLAUR). This interaction is significant in maintaining melanoma cell stemness and mediating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Hu2023LY6PLAUR).

LYPD3 also interacts with laminin, a component of the extracellular matrix, through associations with α6β4 integrin and matrix metallopeptidase-14 (MMP-14), contributing to laminin fragmentation (Gruet2020β2Adrenergic). This interaction is crucial for cell motility and invasion, as LYPD3 is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and the formation of pseudopods (Hu2023LY6PLAUR).

In breast cancer, LYPD3 expression is upregulated in response to β2-adrenergic signaling, which enhances cell migration. This process involves the ADRβ2/cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway, where norepinephrine binding to ADRβ2 leads to increased LYPD3 expression (Gruet2020β2Adrenergic). These interactions highlight LYPD3's role in cancer metastasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.
