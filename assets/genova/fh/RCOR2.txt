# RCOR2

## Overview
RCOR2 (REST corepressor 2) is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. As a member of the CoREST family, RCOR2 plays a critical role in regulating gene expression by forming complexes with other proteins, such as LSD1/KDM1A, and participating in the maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. The protein REST corepressor 2 is a core component of nuclear speckles, subnuclear structures that are essential for RNA processing and gene expression regulation. It interacts with various nuclear speckle components and non-coding RNAs, influencing the morphology and function of these structures. RCOR2 is also implicated in neurodevelopment, where it helps balance neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation, and has been associated with several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (Zheng2023Comprehensive; Monaghan2017REST; Rivera2021Revealing).

## Structure
RCOR2 (REST corepressor 2) is a protein that is part of the CoREST family, which includes CoREST1 and CoREST3. It contains conserved domains such as the ELM2 and SANT domains, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins in transcriptional complexes (Barrios2014Differential). The ELM2 domain is particularly important for recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs), although RCOR2 has a weaker interaction with HDAC1/2 compared to CoREST1 due to specific amino acid differences, such as a nonconserved leucine in its SANT1 domain (Barrios2014Differential).

RCOR2 forms complexes with LSD1/KDM1A, acting as a transcriptional co-repressor. This interaction is significant in embryonic stem cells, where RCOR2 is predominantly expressed and plays a role in maintaining pluripotency (Yang2011RCOR2). RCOR2's interaction with LSD1 facilitates its nucleosomal demethylase activity, which is crucial for neurogenesis in the developing mouse brain (Wang2016LSD1).

RCOR2 is also a core component of nuclear speckles, where it interacts with RNA and other nuclear speckle components like SRRM2, SON, and SRSF7. Its localization within nuclear speckles is RNA-dependent, as RNAse A treatment reduces its nuclear levels (Rivera2021Revealing).

## Function
RCOR2 (REST corepressor 2) is a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. It is a core component of nuclear speckles, subnuclear structures involved in RNA processing and gene expression regulation. RCOR2 stabilizes the morphology of nuclear speckles, maintaining their size and shape, and influences their fusion rates, which may affect transcriptional regulation at active chromatin compartments (Rivera2021Revealing).

RCOR2 is enriched in nuclear speckles and interacts with core speckle components such as SRRM2, SON, and SRSF7, as well as non-coding RNAs like MALAT1 and 7SK. Its localization within nuclear speckles is RNA-dependent, as RNAse A treatment reduces its nuclear levels, indicating that RNA stabilizes RCOR2 at these sites (Rivera2021Revealing).

In addition to its role in nuclear speckles, RCOR2 is involved in maintaining pluripotency and central nervous system development. It is part of the CoREST family of transcriptional corepressors, known for silencing neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells and during early neuronal differentiation (Rivera2021Revealing). RCOR2's unique properties, such as not requiring HDAC1/2 activity for repression, distinguish it from other RCOR proteins (Rivera2021Revealing).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RCOR2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of aging, RCOR2 underexpression is associated with inflammaging, a chronic low-grade inflammation linked to aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Studies using the SAMP8 mouse model, which exhibits accelerated aging, have shown that decreased RCOR2 expression correlates with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines like IL6, suggesting a role in promoting inflammation and potentially contributing to neurodegenerative traits (AlvarezLópez2014Rcor2).

In cancer, RCOR2 expression levels have been studied as potential prognostic biomarkers. High RCOR2 expression is associated with better progression-free survival in glioblastoma multiforme but indicates a poor prognosis in mesothelioma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. RCOR2 expression is also linked to tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability in various cancers, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression and immune response (Zheng2023Comprehensive).

In brain development, RCOR2, along with RCOR1, is crucial for maintaining the balance between neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of RCOR2 leads to severe brain developmental abnormalities, indicating its essential role in neurodevelopment and potential links to neurodevelopmental disorders (Monaghan2017REST).

## Interactions
RCOR2 (REST corepressor 2) is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. It forms complexes with nuclear speckle components such as SON, SRSF7, and SRRM2, indicating its role as a core component of nuclear speckles. These interactions are essential for maintaining the morphology and function of nuclear speckles, which are involved in gene expression regulation (Rivera2021Revealing).

RCOR2 also interacts with the transcription factor INSM1 in neural progenitors, forming complexes that regulate the balance between proliferation and differentiation in the developing brain. This interaction is crucial for proper brain development, as evidenced by the phenotypes observed in knockout mice lacking RCOR2 and INSM1 (Monaghan2017REST).

In embryonic stem cells, RCOR2 is part of the REST complex and interacts with LSD1, a lysine-specific demethylase. This interaction is significant for the regulation of pluripotency genes such as Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2. RCOR2's role in this context involves transcriptional repression and chromatin modification, contributing to the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency and differentiation (Knaupp2020TINC—).
