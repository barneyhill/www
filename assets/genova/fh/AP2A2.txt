# AP2A2

## Overview
The AP2A2 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 2 subunit alpha 2, a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein, playing a pivotal role in the internalization of transmembrane receptors and other cargo molecules at the plasma membrane. The AP2A2 protein, as part of the heterotetrameric AP-2 complex, interacts with clathrin, lipids, and various cargo proteins to facilitate their incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) (Azarnia2019Endocytic; Partlow2022Structural). Its function is crucial for cellular processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, nutrient uptake, and membrane recycling, impacting diverse physiological and pathological contexts, including metabolic regulation, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases (Wu2019Risk; Montgomery2019The).

## Structure
The AP2A2 protein is a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), which plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The AP2A2 subunit is part of a heterotetrameric complex that includes the α (AP2A2), β2 (AP2B1), μ2 (AP2M1), and σ2 (AP2S1) subunits (Partlow2022Structural). The primary structure of AP2A2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, such as the alpha-adaptin C-terminal domain, which is important for protein-protein interactions.

The secondary structure of AP2A2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its three-dimensional conformation. The tertiary structure of AP2A2 is essential for its function, allowing it to interact with other proteins and the plasma membrane. The quaternary structure involves its assembly with other subunits in the AP-2 complex, forming a functional unit that can engage with cargo and the membrane (Partlow2022Structural).

AP2A2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. The protein may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, contributing to functional diversity. These structural features enable AP2A2 to participate effectively in the endocytic process, facilitating the internalization of cargo into cells.

## Function
The AP2A2 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), which is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process crucial for the internalization of transmembrane receptors and other cargo molecules at the plasma membrane. This complex is composed of large α and β2-adaptin subunits, a medium-sized μ2-adaptin subunit, and a small σ2-adaptin subunit, and it functions as a central hub in the endocytic machinery (Azarnia2019Endocytic).

AP2A2 specifically interacts with lipids, clathrin, and various cargo proteins, facilitating their internalization via clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). These cargos include the amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and synaptic vesicle proteins, among others (Nelson2020The). The AP2A2 protein is predominantly active at the plasma membrane, where it plays a key role in receptor-mediated endocytosis, impacting cellular signaling, nutrient uptake, and membrane recycling (Azarnia2019Endocytic).

In adipose tissue, AP2A2 is involved in the endocytosis of β2 and β3-adrenergic receptors, which is important for the regulation of lipolysis and systemic lipid metabolism (Montgomery2019The). The protein's role in endocytosis also extends to hematopoietic stem cells, where it influences cell fate determination through asymmetric cell division (Ting2012Asymmetric).

## Clinical Significance
The AP2A2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in AP2A2 expression or function can contribute to cancer, particularly through its involvement in asymmetric cell division and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Overexpression of AP2A2 in HSCs has been linked to enhanced proliferative activity, which may be relevant in cancer contexts where abnormal cell proliferation occurs (Ting2012Asymmetric). AP2A2's role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis is also significant in cancer biology, as it interacts with EGFR, affecting endocytic uptake and potentially influencing tumorigenesis and tumor progression (Wu2019Risk).

In cardiovascular disease, genetic variants near the AP2A2 gene, such as rs7396366, have been associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in specific populations. The rs7396366 TT genotype is more frequent in CAD patients, suggesting a potential genetic risk factor for the disease, particularly in cases involving multiple vessel disease (Wang2018A).

AP2A2 also plays a role in metabolic regulation. In adipose tissue, it is involved in the regulation of lipolysis mediated by PPARα. Knockout studies in mice have shown that deletion of Ap2a2 impairs beta-adrenergic activation of lipolysis, indicating its importance in metabolic processes (Montgomery2019The).

## Interactions
The AP2A2 protein, a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and participates in various protein interactions. AP2A2 interacts with clathrin through a clathrin box motif (LLNLD) on its β2 subunit, which is essential for clathrin recruitment and polymerization during the formation of clathrin-coated pits (Kelly2014AP2). It also interacts with accessory proteins such as AP180 and Eps15, which are crucial for the assembly and disassembly of clathrin-coated vesicles (Collins2002Molecular).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, AP2A2 has been shown to colocalize with phosphorylated tau (pTau) in neurons, particularly in the hippocampus and neocortex, although it does not physically interact with Tau in the same manner as it does with its known binding partner AP2B1 (Katsumata2019Alzheimer). AP2A2 is also involved in the endocytosis of beta-adrenergic receptors, interacting with proteins such as dynamin 1 (Dnm1) and NECAP1, which are not found as interacting partners for Ap2a1 (Montgomery2019The). These interactions highlight the role of AP2A2 in cellular uptake processes and its potential involvement in disease pathology.
