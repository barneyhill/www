# KRTAP19-4

## Overview
KRTAP19-4 is a gene that encodes the keratin associated protein 19-4, which is part of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the keratin matrix. The KAP family is known for its involvement in the structural integrity and mechanical properties of keratinized tissues. Keratin associated protein 19-4, specifically, contributes to the complex network of interactions that stabilize the keratin intermediate filaments, which are essential for the resilience and strength of hair fibers. The expression and regulation of KRTAP19-4 are of particular interest in studies related to hair biology and disorders affecting hair texture and growth (Qiu2020aarFDC).
