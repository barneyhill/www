# LCN2

## Overview
Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is a gene that encodes the protein lipocalin 2, which is a member of the lipocalin family of proteins. These proteins are known for their ability to bind and transport small hydrophobic molecules, such as steroids, fatty acids, and hormones. Lipocalin 2 plays a significant role in iron metabolism by binding to iron-loaded bacterial siderophores, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth and contributing to the body's innate immune response (Chandrasekaran2024Structure; Yang2009Lipocalin). It is also involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation, cellular signaling, and metabolic regulation, and is expressed in multiple tissues such as the liver, kidneys, and adipose tissue (Chandrasekaran2024Structure; Schröder2023Lipocalin). The protein's interactions with receptors and other proteins, such as matrix metalloproteinases, further underscore its role in disease mechanisms, including cancer progression and metabolic disorders (SantiagoSánchez2020Biological; Jaberi2021Lipocalin2:). Due to its involvement in these critical biological processes, LCN2 is considered a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, chronic kidney disease, and cancer (Viau2010Lipocalin; Dekens2021Lipocalin).

## Structure


## Function
Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is a protein involved in various molecular processes in healthy human cells, primarily functioning in the transport of small lipophilic substances, such as steroids, fatty acids, and hormones. It plays a crucial role in iron metabolism by binding to iron-loaded bacterial siderophores, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth and contributing to innate immunity (Chandrasekaran2024Structure; Yang2009Lipocalin). LCN2 is also involved in cellular signaling, interacting with multiple receptors, including melanocortin receptors, which influence processes like appetite regulation and energy metabolism (Schröder2023Lipocalin).

In the immune system, LCN2 acts as an acute response protein, promoting inflammation and synthesizing immune mediators upon infection or injury (Chandrasekaran2024Structure). It is expressed in various tissues, including liver, renal cells, and adipose tissue, and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating iron trafficking (Chandrasekaran2024Structure; Schröder2023Lipocalin). LCN2 also plays a role in metabolic processes, influencing insulin resistance and lipid metabolism, and is associated with conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes (Chandrasekaran2024Structure; Jaberi2021Lipocalin2:). Its activity in the central nervous system includes modulating appetite and contributing to neuroinflammation (Schröder2023Lipocalin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCN2 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and vascular dementia, LCN2 levels are altered, contributing to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Elevated LCN2 levels have been observed in affected brain regions, while decreased levels in cerebrospinal fluid may affect amyloid-β clearance (Dekens2021Lipocalin). LCN2 is also implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD), where its overexpression correlates with rapid disease progression and increased tubular damage (Viau2010Lipocalin).

In cancer, LCN2 is frequently upregulated and plays a role in promoting metastasis and inhibiting apoptosis. It stabilizes matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), enhancing cancer cell survival and proliferation (Chandrasekaran2024Structure). In lung adenocarcinoma, LCN2 is significantly elevated, particularly in KRAS-mutant tumors, and is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Treekitkarnmongkol2021Augmented).

LCN2 also affects metabolic disorders, with its expression linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is involved in insulin resistance and inflammation, contributing to conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Asimakopoulou2014Lipocalin-2). These associations make LCN2 a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for various diseases.

## Interactions
Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is known to interact with various proteins, influencing its biological functions. One significant interaction is with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), where LCN2 stabilizes MMP-9 and inhibits its auto-degradation, which may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (SantiagoSánchez2020Biological; Jaberi2021Lipocalin2:). LCN2 also interacts with matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), inhibiting the activity of the latter (Dekens2021Lipocalin).

LCN2 binds to cell surface receptors such as megalin (LRP2) and 24p3R (SLC22A17), facilitating its internalization into cells. The interaction with megalin is particularly strong, driven by electrostatic forces, and is crucial for renal reabsorption of LCN2 (Xiao2017Lipocalin; Schröder2023Lipocalin). LCN2 can also bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), promoting its sustained activation, which could lead to kidney damage (Dekens2021Lipocalin).

In the context of immune response, LCN2 is a component of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), contributing to their antimicrobial properties (Dekens2021Lipocalin). These interactions highlight LCN2's multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
