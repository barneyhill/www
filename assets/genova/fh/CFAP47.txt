# CFAP47

## Overview
The CFAP47 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 47, which plays a critical role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, particularly in sperm cells. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the axoneme, the core of cilia and flagella, and is essential for maintaining their integrity and motility. CFAP47 is predominantly expressed in the testis and is crucial for sperm flagellar assembly and stability, interacting with other proteins such as CFAP65, CFAP69, and SEPTIN4 to support sperm morphogenesis and function. Mutations in the CFAP47 gene can lead to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), resulting in male infertility due to impaired sperm motility. Additionally, CFAP47 has been implicated in X-linked polycystic kidney disease, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Liu2023A; Mori2024CFAP47; Liu2021Deleterious).

## Structure
The CFAP47 protein, encoded by the CFAP47 gene, is associated with the structure and function of cilia and flagella. It contains ASH (ASPM, SPD-2, Hydin) domains, which are implicated in microtubule binding, suggesting a role in anchoring the protein complex to the central apparatus of the axoneme (Zhao2019Proteome). The protein is part of a complex that includes FAP49 and other proteins, potentially linking it to both C1 and C2 microtubules within the axoneme (Zhao2019Proteome). 

The CFAP47 protein is primarily distributed in the flagella of spermatozoa, and its expression is significantly reduced in individuals with certain mutations, affecting sperm morphology and function (Liu2023A). The protein's structure is affected by missense mutations, such as c.1414G>A [p.V472M], which destabilizes the β-sheet region due to the larger space occupied by methionine compared to valine (Liu2023A). 

While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of ASH domains and its role in the axoneme suggest a complex structural organization critical for its function in ciliary and flagellar assembly and stability. The protein's interactions with other flagellar proteins, such as CFAP65 and CFAP69, further indicate its involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of sperm flagella (Liu2023A).

## Function
The CFAP47 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for the proper formation and function of cilia and flagella, particularly in sperm cells. In healthy human cells, CFAP47 is highly expressed in the testis and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and motility of sperm flagella. This protein is associated with the assembly and stability of axonemes, the core structural component of cilia and flagella, which are essential for cell movement and fluid flow (Liu2021Deleterious).

CFAP47 interacts with other proteins such as CFAP65, CFAP69, and SEPTIN4, which are important for sperm morphogenesis. CFAP65 and CFAP69 are involved in the development of the sperm acrosome and flagellum, while SEPTIN4 is crucial for the structural integrity of the sperm annulus (Liu2023A). The protein is localized at the base of sperm flagella, and its presence is vital for normal sperm motility and fertility (Liu2021Deleterious).

Mutations in CFAP47 can lead to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), resulting in reduced sperm motility and male infertility. These mutations affect the protein's structure and stability, leading to defects in sperm morphology and function (Liu2023A; Liu2021Deleterious).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP47 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting male fertility and kidney function. Deleterious variants in CFAP47 have been linked to asthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility and multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), leading to primary male infertility. These mutations result in significantly reduced CFAP47 mRNA and protein levels in spermatozoa, causing structural defects such as absent, short, or coiled flagella, and irregular caliber, which severely impair sperm motility (Liu2021Deleterious). The condition has been observed in individuals with hemizygous missense variants of CFAP47, which are absent in large human population genome datasets, indicating their rarity and potential pathogenicity (Liu2021Deleterious).

CFAP47 has also been implicated in X-linked polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Rare missense variants in CFAP47 have been identified in males with hemizygous X-chromosome mutations, suggesting a role in cyst formation in renal tubules. Experimental validation confirmed CFAP47 expression in human renal tubular cilia, and knockout mice exhibited cyst-like changes in renal tubules, supporting its involvement in PKD (Mori2024CFAP47).

## Interactions
CFAP47 is known to interact with several proteins involved in sperm morphogenesis and function. It has a significant interaction with CFAP65, a protein associated with sperm head development and flagellar structure. This interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation assays and immunostaining, which show altered localization of CFAP65 in spermatozoa with CFAP47 variants, indicating a potential regulatory relationship between these proteins during spermiogenesis (Liu2023A; Liu2021Deleterious).

CFAP47 also interacts with CFAP69, a protein involved in sperm flagellar formation, and SEPTIN4, which is essential for the structural integrity of the sperm annulus. These interactions suggest that CFAP47 may regulate the expression and function of these proteins, thereby influencing sperm morphology and motility (Liu2023A).

In the context of ciliary axonemes, CFAP47 is identified as a component of the central apparatus, potentially forming part of a complex with other proteins such as FAP49, FAP72, and FAP154. These proteins are likely part of the same substructure, with CFAP47 playing a role in their assembly and stability within the axoneme (Zhao2019Proteome).
