# ROPN1B

## Overview
ROPN1B, or rhophilin associated tail protein 1B, is a gene that encodes a protein primarily involved in the regulation of sperm motility and fertility. The protein, categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, is integral to the function of the sperm flagellum, where it interacts with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) to facilitate cellular signaling and structural organization (Da2021Ropporin1). While its expression is predominantly observed in the testis and fetal liver, ROPN1B is also noted in certain cancers, suggesting a potential role in cell motility and invasion beyond reproductive tissues (Da2021Ropporin1). The protein's involvement in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, further underscores its regulatory functions in sperm capacitation and fertilization processes (Yu2015Acetylproteomic; Castillo2019Proteomic). Despite its established role in reproductive biology, the full spectrum of ROPN1B's functions in other cellular contexts remains an active area of research.

## Function
ROPN1B (rhophilin associated tail protein 1B) is primarily known for its role in sperm motility and fertility, where it is associated with the sperm flagellum. It interacts with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), particularly AKAP110, which are involved in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal organization (Da2021Ropporin1). This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of the sperm flagellum, contributing to the motility necessary for successful fertilization.

In healthy human cells, ROPN1B's expression is mainly restricted to the testis and fetal liver, with some expression noted in hematologic malignancies and breast cancers (Da2021Ropporin1). The protein's function in these contexts is not fully understood, but its involvement in cellular processes related to the cytoskeleton suggests a broader role in cell motility and structure. ROPN1B may also activate RhoA signaling via rhophilin-1, which is known to promote cell migration and invasion, although specific details of this function in healthy cells are not provided (Da2021Ropporin1). The precise molecular activities and cellular locations of ROPN1B in non-reproductive tissues remain areas for further research.

## Interactions
ROPN1B, a protein involved in sperm motility and flagellar function, participates in several protein interactions. It is known to interact with ROPN1, with a combined score of 0.719, indicating a potential physical interaction between these two proteins (Castillo2019Proteomic). This interaction suggests a role in the organization and function of the sperm tail, particularly in processes related to sperm motility and signaling (Castillo2019Proteomic).

ROPN1B is also involved in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its role in sperm capacitation and motility. The protein undergoes changes in abundance and modification during these processes, highlighting its regulatory role in sperm function (Castillo2019Proteomic).

Additionally, ROPN1B has been identified as a protein potentially involved in sperm-egg plasma fusion, with changes in acetylation observed after capacitation (Yu2015Acetylproteomic). This suggests that ROPN1B may play a role in the later stages of fertilization, although specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been documented in the provided context. The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in reproductive biology.
