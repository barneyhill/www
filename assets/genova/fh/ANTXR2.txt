# ANTXR2

## Overview
The ANTXR2 gene encodes the ANTXR cell adhesion molecule 2, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis and angiogenesis. This protein, also known as anthrax toxin receptor 2, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain and an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain, facilitating its function as a receptor for the protective antigen (PA) of anthrax toxin (Sun2016Roles; Sun2010Disulfide). ANTXR2 is involved in the regulation of collagen VI degradation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, which are crucial for ECM remodeling and tissue integrity (Bürgi2017CMG2ANTXR2; Reeves2012Anthrax). Mutations in ANTXR2 are linked to hyaline fibromatosis syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining tissue homeostasis (Liu2021Hyaline).

## Structure
The ANTXR2 protein, also known as anthrax toxin receptor 2, is a type I transmembrane protein with a complex structure that includes several distinct domains. The extracellular ectodomain comprises a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain and an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain. The VWA domain, spanning residues 38-218, features a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) crucial for binding the protective antigen (PA) of anthrax toxin with high affinity (Sun2016Roles; Sun2010Disulfide). The Ig domain, covering residues 219-318, connects the VWA domain to the transmembrane domain and contains disulfide bonds essential for the receptor's function (Sun2016Roles; Sun2010Disulfide).

The protein also includes a 23-amino acid transmembrane segment and a 148-amino acid cytosolic domain (Archana2024Investigating). ANTXR2 exists in four isoforms generated through alternative splicing, which may influence its function and interaction with ligands (Archana2024Investigating). The ectodomain's disulfide bonds, particularly in the Ig domain, are crucial for maintaining structural integrity and function, although they are not required for PA binding (Sun2010Disulfide). The protein's structure facilitates its role in receptor-mediated endocytosis and anthrax toxin translocation into the cytosol (Sun2010Disulfide).

## Function
The ANTXR2 gene, also known as Capillary Morphogenesis Gene 2 (CMG2), encodes a transmembrane surface protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis and regulating collagen VI degradation. In healthy human cells, ANTXR2 is involved in binding collagen IV and laminin through its extracellular von Willebrand A (vWA) domain, facilitating the intracellular degradation of collagen VI to prevent its accumulation in the ECM, which can lead to tissue disruption and disease (Bürgi2017CMG2ANTXR2).

ANTXR2 is also implicated in angiogenesis, where it is expressed in endothelial cells and is essential for endothelial cell proliferation and the formation of capillary-like structures. Knockdown of ANTXR2 results in diminished endothelial cell proliferation, while overexpression enhances it, indicating its role in endothelial cell morphogenesis and angiogenesis (Reeves2009Anthrax).

In the context of the reproductive system, ANTXR2 is necessary for ECM remodeling, particularly through its regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, which is crucial for ECM turnover and tissue integrity (Reeves2012Anthrax). ANTXR2's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANTXR2 gene are associated with hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the abnormal deposition of hyaline material in the skin, mucosa, joints, and internal organs. Clinical manifestations of HFS include skin thickening with nodules, gingival enlargement, joint stiffness, and systemic involvement. The severity of the condition varies, with some patients experiencing only cutaneous and mucosal symptoms, while others suffer from severe systemic complications (Liu2021Hyaline).

HFS encompasses two forms: infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH), a severe form with early onset, and juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF), a milder form. ISH is characterized by early onset, failure to thrive, and often results in death before two years of age, while JHF presents later and allows for survival into adulthood (Denadai2012Identification). Mutations in ANTXR2, particularly frameshift mutations in exon 13, lead to low mRNA and undetectable protein levels due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and ER-associated degradation (Yan2013InDepth).

The ANTXR2 gene is also implicated in other conditions, such as primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), where it has been identified as a candidate gene in genetic association studies (Pottinger2024Rare).

## Interactions
ANTXR2, also known as anthrax toxin receptor 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. ANTXR2 interacts with collagen VI through its von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain, facilitating the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of collagen VI. This interaction is significant in the context of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome, where collagen VI accumulation leads to tissue integrity loss (Bürgi2017CMG2ANTXR2).

ANTXR2 also plays a role in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It interacts with Membrane Type I Matrix Metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), enhancing its activity and promoting the activation of MMP2. This interaction is crucial for extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and is particularly important in the reproductive tract, where it affects ECM homeostasis and myometrial cell function (Reeves2012Anthrax).

In the context of anthrax toxin action, ANTXR2 serves as a receptor for the protective antigen (PA) component of the toxin. It binds PA with high affinity, facilitating the formation of a prepore complex that is internalized into cells. This interaction is essential for the translocation of anthrax toxin enzymes into the cytosol (Sun2016Roles).
