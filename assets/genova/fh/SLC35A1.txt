# SLC35A1

## Overview
The SLC35A1 gene encodes the CMP-sialic acid transporter (CST), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the transport of CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi apparatus. This transporter is integral to the sialylation process, which involves the addition of sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids, thereby influencing cell-cell communication, immune responses, and protein stability (Hadley2019Nucleotide; Szulc2020Novel). The CST is characterized by its 10 transmembrane helices and a large, flexible binding pocket that accommodates various substrates, including CMP-sialic acid and CDP-ribitol (Ury2021The; Szulc2020Novel). Mutations in SLC35A1 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, manifesting in neurological and hematological symptoms due to impaired glycan assembly (Xiaolin2020Slc35a1; Riemersma2014Disease). The protein's ability to form dimers and interact with other molecules underscores its importance in glycosylation processes within the Golgi apparatus (Szulc2020Novel; MaszczakSeneczko2022Delivery).

## Structure
The SLC35A1 gene encodes the CMP-sialic acid transporter (CST), a protein integral to the transport of CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi apparatus. The protein is characterized by 10 transmembrane helices, with both the N- and C-termini facing the cytosol, which are essential for substrate recognition and transport (Szulc2020Novel). These helices undergo conformational changes during transport, facilitating the movement of substrates across the membrane (Szulc2020Novel).

The molecular structure of SLC35A1 includes a large and flexible binding pocket that accommodates bulky molecules like sialic acid. This pocket interacts with negatively charged groups of CMP and CMP-sialic acid through conserved residues such as Lys124 and Lys272, which are crucial for binding and transport (Ury2021The). The protein's ability to transport various substrates is attributed to its promiscuous binding pocket, which allows for the transport of CDP-ribitol in addition to CMP-sialic acid (Ury2021The).

Mutations in SLC35A1 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, affecting glycan assembly and causing various symptoms. These mutations can impair the protein's function, particularly when combined, although they do not necessarily affect its localization in the Golgi (Szulc2020Novel). The CST also forms dimers in its native environment, with dimerization being important for its activity and transport (Szulc2020Novel).

## Function
The SLC35A1 gene encodes a CMP-sialic acid transporter, which is crucial for the transport of CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi apparatus. This transporter is essential for the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, a process that plays a significant role in cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein stability (Hadley2019Nucleotide; Szulc2020Novel). Sialylation involves the addition of sialic acid to proteins and lipids, which is important for various cellular functions, including the modulation of pro-apoptotic signals and the regulation of platelet clearance (Kauskot2018A; Moskovskich2019The).

SLC35A1 is localized in the Golgi apparatus and is part of the nucleotide sugar transporter family, specifically the SLC35 family. It has a large binding pocket that allows it to accommodate bulky molecules like sialic acid, and it can also transport smaller cytidine-phosphate-coupled molecules such as CDP-ribitol (Ury2021The). This flexibility is due to specific interactions with the nucleotide part of the nucleotide sugar, allowing the transporter to recognize and transport various substrates (Ury2021The).

Mutations in SLC35A1 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, affecting multiple pathways in brain development and function (Riemersma2014Disease). The gene's role in glycosylation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC35A1 gene, which encodes the CMP-sialic acid transporter, are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). These disorders result from defects in glycosylation pathways, leading to improper glycan assembly and a range of clinical manifestations. Patients with SLC35A1-CDG often exhibit neurological symptoms such as intellectual disability, hypotonia, ataxia, and seizures. Specific mutations, such as Q101H and the compound heterozygous mutation T156R/E196K, have been linked to reduced transporter activity and impaired sialylation, contributing to these symptoms (Szulc2020Novel).

SLC35A1 mutations also affect platelet function, leading to conditions like macrothrombocytopenia. This is characterized by reduced platelet counts and increased clearance of desialylated platelets in the liver, as seen in patients with the S147P mutation (Kauskot2018A; Xiaolin2020Slc35a1). The deficiency in sialylation due to SLC35A1 mutations impacts platelet homeostasis and can result in thrombocytopenia, as demonstrated in mouse models with Slc35a1 gene deletions (Xiaolin2020Slc35a1). These findings underscore the critical role of SLC35A1 in maintaining normal glycosylation and its impact on human health.

## Interactions
The SLC35A1 protein, encoded by the SLC35A1 gene, is involved in several interactions crucial for its function as a CMP-sialic acid transporter. It has been shown to form dimers in its native environment, particularly within the Golgi membranes, as demonstrated by a split luciferase complementation assay. This dimerization is essential for its function, although certain mutations, such as Q101H and E196K, impair this ability, leading to reduced transporter activity (Szulc2020Novel).

SLC35A1 also participates in forming homo-oligomeric complexes, as confirmed in HEK293T cells using the NanoBiT system. These interactions suggest that SLC35A1 might act as a hub protein in glycosylation-related networks, potentially enhancing the efficiency and fidelity of glycan synthesis (MaszczakSeneczko2022Delivery).

The protein's interactions are not limited to dimerization. It also interacts with negatively charged groups of CMP and CMP-sialic acid through conserved residues, such as Lys124 and Lys272, which are crucial for binding and transporting negatively charged phosphate-containing molecules (Ury2021The). These interactions highlight the importance of SLC35A1 in the glycosylation processes within the Golgi apparatus.
