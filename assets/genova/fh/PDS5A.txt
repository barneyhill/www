# PDS5A

## Overview
PDS5A, or PDS5 cohesin associated factor A, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the regulation of the cohesin complex, a crucial component in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. The PDS5A protein is categorized as a cohesin-associated factor and plays a significant role in chromosomal architecture and genome stability. It interacts with various cohesin regulatory proteins, such as RAD21 and WAPL, to facilitate the establishment, maintenance, and resolution of sister chromatid cohesion. Additionally, PDS5A is involved in chromatin loop regulation, influencing genome topology and cell cycle progression. The gene's expression and function are critical in both normal cellular processes and pathological conditions, including developmental disorders and cancer (Arruda2022PDS5A; Morales2020PDS5; Zhang2021PDS5A).

## Function
PDS5A (PDS5 cohesin associated factor A) is a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of the cohesin complex, which is essential for sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. PDS5A is involved in the establishment, maintenance, and resolution of sister chromatid cohesion by interacting with cohesin regulatory proteins such as Eco1/Esco1/Esco2, sororin, and WAPL (Zhang2021PDS5A). It is recruited to the cohesin complex by binding to RAD21 and assists in the acetylation of SMC3, a process crucial for cohesion establishment during DNA replication (Zhang2021PDS5A). PDS5A also prevents the de-acetylation of SMC3, maintaining cohesion through the G2/M phase (Zhang2021PDS5A).

In addition to its role in chromatid cohesion, PDS5A is involved in regulating chromatin loop length through a brake mechanism that controls loop enlargement at CTCF sites, affecting genome topology (van2022The). It is active in the nucleus, where it influences cell cycle progression and ensures proper chromosomal architecture (Zhang2021PDS5A). PDS5A is also implicated in protecting replication forks and maintaining genomic stability, which are critical for healthy cell function (Morales2020PDS5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PDS5A gene have been implicated in various developmental disorders and cancers. In developmental contexts, PDS5A deficiency in mouse models leads to severe outcomes such as perinatal death, growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities, and cleft palate, highlighting its critical role in embryonic development (Zhang2021PDS5A). These findings suggest that mutations in PDS5A can result in significant developmental defects and are crucial for survival.

In cancer, PDS5A is notably upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and other astrocytic tumors, correlating with tumor grade (Hagemann2010The). Despite its high expression, PDS5A does not appear to influence mitotic checkpoint function or cell proliferation in GBM cells, suggesting a complex role in tumor biology (Hagemann2010The). The overexpression of PDS5A in various tumors, including those of the esophagus, stomach, liver, and colon, indicates its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Hagemann2010The).

In the context of HIV-1 infection, PDS5A expression is significantly downregulated in infected T cells, although this does not directly affect viral replication. This suggests that PDS5A may play a role in mediating HIV-1-induced cellular pathogenesis (Capalbo2012HIV1).

## Interactions
PDS5A is a protein that interacts with several components of the cohesin complex, which is crucial for sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. It binds to RAD21, a core subunit of the cohesin complex, and is involved in the regulation of cohesin's function in chromatin architecture and gene regulation (Arruda2022PDS5A; Zhang2021PDS5A). PDS5A also interacts with WAPL, a protein that facilitates the unloading of cohesin from chromosomes, affecting processes such as gene transcription and DNA replication (Morales2020PDS5; Zhang2021PDS5A).

PDS5A is known to co-purify with STAG1 and STAG2, indicating its role in various cohesin complexes that contribute to chromosomal cohesion (Arruda2022PDS5A). It also interacts with acetyltransferases like ESCO1 and ESCO2, which acetylate SMC3, a cohesin subunit, during DNA replication. This interaction is essential for the establishment and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion (Zhang2021PDS5A).

PDS5A can interact with CTCF binding sites independently of the core cohesin complex, suggesting a role in chromatin loop formation and maintenance (Arruda2022PDS5A). It also interacts with NIPBL, although cohesin complexes lacking PDS5A do not show increased interactions with NIPBL, indicating no competition between PDS5A and NIPBL for cohesin binding (Arruda2022PDS5A).
