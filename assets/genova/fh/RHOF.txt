# RHOF

## Overview
The RHOF gene encodes the protein ras homolog family member F, filopodia associated, which is a member of the Rho GTPase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and is particularly involved in the formation of filopodia, which are essential for cell movement, adhesion, and environmental sensing (Sugawara2019Structural). As a 'fast-cycling' GTPase, RhoF rapidly transitions between its active and inactive states, allowing it to function predominantly in its active form, which is crucial for rapid cellular responses (Aspenström2022The). The protein's interactions with BAR domain proteins and its involvement in signaling pathways such as NFκB highlight its significance in cellular processes and disease mechanisms (Aspenström2018BAR; Shaverdashvili2019KLF4). Despite its critical roles, RHOF knockout models suggest that it may not be essential under normal physiological conditions, although its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions (Shaverdashvili2019KLF4; Carbone2008Array‐based).

## Structure
The RHOF protein, a member of the Rho GTPase family, is characterized by its involvement in actin cytoskeleton organization. Its primary structure includes a GTP-binding domain, which is typical of the Rho GTPase family (Stevens2009Overview). The secondary structure of RHOF comprises both alpha-helices and beta-strands, with estimated contents of 21% and 28%, respectively, as revealed by circular dichroism analysis (Sugawara2019Structural). This structural composition is similar to that of K-ras, another member of the RAS superfamily of GTPases.

In terms of tertiary structure, RHOF forms a compact, globular shape. Structural analysis using 1H, 15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum and dynamic light scattering (DLS) suggests that RHOF can form a multimeric structure, which may contribute to its unique functional characteristics (Sugawara2019Structural). The protein's quaternary structure is not extensively developed due to its monomeric nature.

RHOF can undergo post-translational modifications such as farnesylation and geranyl-geranylation, which are types of prenylation (Aspenström2018Activated). These modifications are crucial for its membrane association and subcellular localization. RHOF also contains an N-terminal extension of 16 amino-acid residues, although the specific role of this extension is not fully understood (Aspenström2018Activated).

## Function
The RHOF gene encodes a member of the Rho GTPase family, specifically involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of filopodia, which are slender, actin-rich protrusions on the cell surface. These structures play a crucial role in cell movement, adhesion, and environmental sensing (Sugawara2019Structural). RhoF acts as a molecular switch, cycling between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active states, and is categorized as a 'fast-cycling' GTPase due to its elevated rate of GDP dissociation. This allows RhoF to function predominantly as a constitutively active GTP-bound protein (Sugawara2019Structural).

RhoF is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, influencing cell shape and motility. It shares a conserved mechanism of GTP hydrolysis with other RAS superfamily GTPases, although it adopts a unique multimeric structure (Sugawara2019Structural). The protein's activity is crucial for cellular signaling pathways, and its fast-cycling nature suggests a role in rapid cellular responses (Aspenström2022The). Despite its involvement in these processes, constitutive RhoF knockout mice do not exhibit an overt phenotype, indicating that RHOF may not be essential for cellular function under normal conditions (Shaverdashvili2019KLF4).

## Clinical Significance
RHOF has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression or genetic deletions. In esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC), RHOF is upregulated by the transcription factor KLF4, leading to the activation of NFκB signaling, which is associated with chronic inflammation and cancer development (Shaverdashvili2019KLF4). RHOF is also upregulated in eosinophilic esophagitis, a significant inflammatory disease of the esophagus (Shaverdashvili2019KLF4).

In early-stage mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, RHOF is frequently deleted, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role. This deletion is specific to tumor cells and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease (Carbone2008Array‐based).

In pancreatic cancer, RHOF is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is linked to increased cancer cell invasiveness and drug resistance. Lower levels of miR-3656, which targets RHOF, are associated with higher RHOF expression and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Modulating the miR-3656/RHOF/EMT axis has been shown to enhance the chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine (Yang2017miR3656).

## Interactions
RHOF, a member of the Rho GTPase family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration. It interacts with BAR domain proteins, which are known to regulate Rho GTPase signaling pathways. Specifically, RHOF, also known as Rif, has been shown to bind the I-BAR protein IRTKS, leading to the induction of filopodia through a mechanism involving Eps8 and the WASP family protein WAVE2 (Aspenström2018BAR). 

RHOF is also implicated in the activation of NFκB signaling in esophageal epithelial cells. The transcription factor KLF4 upregulates RHOF, which in turn activates NFκB signaling, essential for esophageal keratinocyte proliferation and migration (Shaverdashvili2019KLF4). This interaction highlights RHOF's role as a mediator of esophageal inflammation.

In the context of Huntington's disease, RHOF interacts with the SH3 domain of BAIAP2, a protein involved in the Rho GTPase signaling pathway. This interaction is part of a network that may modify mutant huntingtin toxicity, suggesting a role for RHOF in the pathogenesis of the disease (Tourette2014A).
