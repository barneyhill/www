# UTY

## Overview
The UTY gene, located on the Y chromosome, encodes the protein ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat containing, Y-linked, which is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) family of enzymes. This protein is characterized by its involvement in histone demethylation, specifically targeting the trimethylation mark on lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3), a critical modification for transcriptional repression (Gažová2019Lysine; Walport2014Human). Despite its reduced demethylase activity compared to its homologues, UTY retains significant protein binding capacity and is involved in various biological processes, including chromatin modification and transcription regulation (Gažová2019Lysine; Walport2014Human). The protein contains several domains, such as tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and chromatin structure modification (Gažová2019Lysine; Ginalski2004Protein). UTY's expression and function are crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis and have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Punjani2020Clinical).

## Structure
The UTY gene encodes a protein that includes several distinct domains contributing to its structure and function. The protein contains nine tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which are involved in protein-protein interactions and facilitate the assembly of multiprotein complexes (Gažová2019Lysine; Ginalski2004Protein). These TPR domains typically form a helical structure, which is characteristic of their role in mediating interactions.

The UTY protein also features a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is homologous to an aspartyl hydrolase enzyme and is involved in transcription regulation and chromatin structure modification (Gažová2019Lysine; Ginalski2004Protein). This domain is conserved across species, indicating its ancient evolutionary role (Gažová2019Lysine).

Additionally, the UTY protein includes a C-terminal domain characterized as a treble-clef zinc finger, which contains conserved cysteine residues that coordinate a zinc ion. This domain may be involved in direct DNA binding or interactions with other proteins (Ginalski2004Protein).

The UTY gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcripts, some of which may lack the JmjC domain or full-length TPR domains, affecting the protein's function (Gažová2019Lysine). Despite its reduced demethylase activity compared to its homologue KDM6A, UTY retains significant protein binding capacity (Gažová2019Lysine).

## Function
The UTY gene, also known as KDM6C, encodes a protein that is part of the Jumonji C (JmjC) family of enzymes, which are involved in the demethylation of histone lysine residues, a key process in regulating gene expression (Walport2014Human). Specifically, UTY catalyzes the demethylation of the trimethylation mark on lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3), a modification important for transcriptional repression (Gažová2019Lysine; Walport2014Human). Despite having reduced catalytic activity compared to its homologues KDM6A and KDM6B, UTY retains functional Fe(II)/2OG binding sites and demonstrates catalytic activity in vitro (Walport2014Human).

UTY is involved in various biological processes, including chromatin modification, transcription regulation, and possibly non-catalytic functions such as competing with other histone-binding proteins (Walport2014Human). It may also act on non-histone substrates, indicating a broader role in cellular regulatory pathways (Walport2014Human). The protein's activity and function in cells may be modulated by unidentified factors or co-factors that enhance substrate binding and enzymatic activity (Walport2014Human). UTY is expressed in a wide range of cell types and is involved in shared regulation with KDM6A, suggesting a compensatory role in males due to KDM6A's escape from X inactivation in females (Gažová2019Lysine).

## Clinical Significance
The UTY gene, located in the AZFa region of the Y chromosome, has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily related to cancer and cardiovascular disease. UTY is associated with urothelial cancers of the genitourinary tract, particularly bladder cancer. In animal models, UTY functions as a tumor suppressor for bladder cancer, and its loss, along with its X-chromosome counterpart KDM6A, has been observed in human bladder cancer specimens. This suggests that mutations or deletions in these genes may lead to the hyperproliferation of bladder cancer cells (Punjani2020Clinical). 

UTY is also linked to prostate cancer, where alterations in its expression and copy number have been noted (Punjani2020Clinical). Additionally, UTY may predispose some men to increased risks of coronary artery disease (Punjani2020Clinical). 

The gene's role in histone demethylation and its potential to compensate for KDM6A haploinsufficiency in males suggest that it may have broader implications in cancer biology, including myeloid leukemogenesis and lymphoma models (Gažová2019Lysine). Despite its reduced catalytic activity, UTY's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Interactions
The UTY protein, encoded by the Y chromosome, is involved in various protein-protein interactions and forms part of multiprotein complexes. It contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as the N-terminal Q domain of TLE1 (Ginalski2004Protein). UTY is known to associate with the H3K4 methyl-transferase complex, which includes components like MLL3, MLL4, PTIP, ASH2L, RBBP5, PA-1, and WDR5, indicating its role in gene regulation through promoter methylation (Shpargel2012UTX). 

Despite losing its ability to demethylate H3K27, UTY retains the ability to form multimeric complexes with UTX and participate in transcriptional regulation (Shpargel2012UTX). It also interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler BRG1 and heart transcription factors such as NKX2-5, TBX5, and SRF, which are involved in cardiac development (Shpargel2012UTX). 

Alternative splicing of the UTY gene results in diverse protein isoforms, which interact with proteins like aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) and guanine nucleotide binding protein (GNB2L1) (Laaser2011Huge). These interactions highlight UTY's involvement in complex regulatory networks essential for various cellular processes.
