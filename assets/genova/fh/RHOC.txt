# RHOC

## Overview
RHOC is a gene that encodes the protein ras homolog family member C, a small GTPase belonging to the Rho family. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell shape, motility, and division (Ridley1997The). As a member of the Rho GTPase family, RHOC is involved in signal transduction pathways that control cell dynamics and has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration and invasion, particularly in cancerous cells (Chen2011RhoC). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, which are essential for its localization and function (Adamson1992Posttranslational). RHOC's interactions with other proteins, such as integrins and scaffold proteins, further underscore its role in cellular signaling and cancer progression (Chen2011RhoC; Li2013RhoC). Given its involvement in cancer metastasis, RHOC is considered a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Kleer2005RhoCGTPase).

## Structure
The RHOC protein is a member of the RhoGTPase family, characterized by a core G domain typical of the Ras-like GTPase superfamily. This domain includes a 6-stranded mixed beta-sheet surrounded by 5 alpha-helices, extended by a helical insert region. The G domain features five conserved sequence motifs (G1-G5), crucial for nucleotide binding and interaction with Mg2+ ions (Schaefer2014Toward). RHOC shares identical sequences in the switch I and switch II regions with RhoA and RhoB, except for specific positions that affect GEF and effector binding. Notably, RHOC has an isoleucine at position 43, influencing isoform-specific interactions (Schaefer2014Toward).

RHOC undergoes post-translational modifications, including prenylation and carboxymethylation at the COOH-terminal cysteine residue of the CAAX box, specifically geranylgeranylation by a C20 prenoid group (Adamson1992Posttranslational). These modifications are essential for its function and localization. The protein's structure and modifications enable it to interact with regulatory proteins and effectors, playing a role in cellular processes such as actin cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (Schaefer2014Toward; Ridley1997The).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RHOC gene are significantly associated with the progression and metastasis of various cancers. In breast cancer, RHOC overexpression is linked to increased metastatic potential and is associated with breast cancer stem cells, contributing to a worse prognosis (Kleer2005RhoCGTPase; Rosenthal2012RhoC). RHOC is also implicated in the progression of ovarian carcinoma, where its upregulation is associated with enhanced invasiveness and advanced-stage tumors (Horiuchi2003UpRegulation). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, elevated RHOC expression correlates with tumor progression and poorer prognosis (Suwa1998Overexpression).

RHOC plays a critical role in hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly in cases with metastasis, where its expression is significantly higher compared to solitary tumors. This suggests its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Expression; Shen2019&lt; p&gt). In non-small cell lung carcinoma, melanoma, and other cancers, RHOC overexpression is linked to increased invasiveness and metastatic potential (Karlsson2009Rho; del2005Rho). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RHOC in cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
RHOC, a member of the Rho GTPase family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as migration and invasion. It interacts with the scaffold protein IQGAP1, which acts as a downstream effector in gastric cancer cell migration. This interaction stimulates cell migration, and the binding site for RHOC is located on the C-terminal fragment of IQGAP1 (Chen2011RhoC).

RHOC also interacts with integrin α5β1 in pancreatic carcinoma cells, enhancing integrin trafficking and promoting cell migration and invasion. This interaction is crucial for the internalization and recycling of integrin α5β1, which is dependent on the C-terminus of RHOC (Li2013RhoC).

In terms of regulatory interactions, RHOC is targeted by the E3 ubiquitin ligase LNX1 for monoubiquitination, which activates RHOC by reducing its interaction with RhoGDIα, a protein that inhibits RHOC activation. This process is negatively regulated by LIS1, which can inhibit LNX1-mediated monoubiquitination of RHOC (Kholmanskikh2022Activation).

Additionally, RNF168, another ubiquitin ligase, promotes the degradation of RHOC through ubiquitination, thereby restraining gastric cancer progression (Xu2021RNF168).
