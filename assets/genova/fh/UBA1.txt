# UBA1

## Overview
UBA1, or ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1, is a gene that encodes a crucial enzyme in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), known as ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the initial step of the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. UBA1 is a multidomain protein that facilitates the activation and transfer of ubiquitin to E2 conjugating enzymes, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as protein homeostasis, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression (Lv2018Crystal; LambertSmith2020The). The gene is implicated in several clinical conditions, including VEXAS syndrome and X-linked spinal muscular atrophy, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Groen2015UBA1:; Beck2020Somatic).

## Structure
UBA1, or ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1, is a multidomain protein crucial for the ubiquitination pathway. The human UBA1 protein has a modular structure, consisting of several distinct domains: the inactive adenylation domain (IAD), active adenylation domain (AAD), first catalytic cysteine half-domain (FCCH), second catalytic cysteine half-domain (SCCH), a four-helix bundle, and the ubiquitin-fold domain (UFD) (Lv2018Crystal; Lee2008Structural). These domains form a large central canyon that accommodates E2 enzymes during the ubiquitin transfer process (Lv2018Crystal).

The UFD is involved in recruiting E2 conjugating enzymes, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E1 to E2 (Lv2018Crystal). The SCCH domain undergoes significant conformational changes, transitioning between open and closed states, which are essential for thioester bond formation (Hann2019Structural). The UBA1 structure is characterized by a pseudodimeric adenylation domain formed by the IAD and AAD, with the SCCH domain tethered by crossover and reentry loops (Lv2018Crystal).

UBA1 also exhibits structural plasticity, allowing it to interact with various E2 enzymes, which is crucial for its function in ubiquitin activation and transfer (Lv2018Crystal). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and interactions (Lv2018Crystal).

## Function
UBA1, or ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, is a pivotal enzyme in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is essential for protein degradation and cellular regulation. UBA1 catalyzes the activation of ubiquitin, a process crucial for various cellular functions, including protein degradation, cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, transcription, translation, vesicle transport, and apoptosis (LambertSmith2020The). The enzyme exists in two main isoforms, UBA1a and UBA1b, which differ in their N-terminal sequences and cellular localization, with UBA1a being nuclear and UBA1b cytoplasmic (Beck2020Somatic).

UBA1's enzymatic activity involves the adenylation of ubiquitin, forming a ubiquitin~AMP intermediate, followed by the formation of a thioester bond between UBA1 and ubiquitin. This activated ubiquitin is then transferred to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which collaborates with E3 ligases to attach ubiquitin to substrate proteins (LambertSmith2020The). This process is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular processes such as DNA repair and cell cycle progression (Moudry2012Ubiquitinactivating).

In the nervous system, UBA1 regulates neuronal differentiation, growth, and synapse formation, and its impairment is linked to neurodegenerative diseases (LambertSmith2020The). UBA1 also plays a role in autophagy, particularly in cells where Atg7 and Atg3 are not required (LambertSmith2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UBA1 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably VEXAS syndrome and X-linked spinal muscular atrophy (XL-SMA). VEXAS syndrome is a severe adult-onset autoinflammatory condition characterized by systemic inflammation, bone marrow failure, and multiorgan involvement. It is linked to somatic mutations in the UBA1 gene, particularly at codon 41, which lead to dysregulated proinflammatory neutrophil activation and severe autoinflammatory symptoms (Beck2020Somatic; van2022Adultonset). Patients with VEXAS syndrome often present with symptoms such as recurrent fevers, pulmonary involvement, and macrocytic anemia, and the condition is predominantly observed in older males (Ferrada2021Somatic; van2022Adultonset).

In contrast, XL-SMA is a rare form of spinal muscular atrophy caused by mutations in the UBA1 gene, characterized by muscle weakness, motor neuron loss, and congenital contractures. These mutations cluster in exon 15 of the UBA1 gene and are thought to impair its function, potentially through altered methylation patterns (Groen2015UBA1:).

Alterations in UBA1 expression levels have also been implicated in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), where downregulation of UBA1 is associated with hematologic abnormalities and activation of inflammatory pathways (Wei2024Downregulation).

## Interactions
UBA1, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is recruited to DNA by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), which facilitates the formation of ATR-signaling complexes essential for the phosphorylation of replication protein A and checkpoint kinase 1 by the ATR kinase (Kumbhar2018Recruitment). UBA1 binds directly to poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) chains, a process influenced by specific amino acid residues within a positively charged patch on UBA1. This interaction is critical for UBA1's recruitment to DNA and subsequent signaling processes (Kumbhar2018Recruitment).

UBA1 is also involved in the formation of ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIFs), necessary for the recruitment of DNA damage response factors like 53BP1. Although UBA1 is localized mainly in the nucleus, it does not accumulate at DNA damage sites, unlike other components of the ubiquitylation pathway (Moudry2012Ubiquitinactivating). The enzyme's activity is crucial for ubiquitylation-dependent recruitment of repair factors to double-strand break sites, highlighting its selective requirement in the DDR (Moudry2012Ubiquitinactivating). These interactions underscore UBA1's pivotal role in maintaining genomic integrity and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
