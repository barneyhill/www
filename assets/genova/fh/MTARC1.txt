# MTARC1

## Overview
MTARC1, or mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 1, is a gene that encodes a molybdenum-containing enzyme localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane. This enzyme is a key player in the reduction of N-hydroxylated compounds, contributing to drug metabolism and detoxification processes. The MTARC1 protein is characterized by its MOSC (molybdenum cofactor sulfurase C-terminal) domains, which are essential for its catalytic activity and interaction with other mitochondrial proteins. It functions as part of an electron transfer chain, working alongside cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase to facilitate the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO), a process crucial for various physiological functions such as vascular regulation and immune response (SparacinoWatkins2014Nitrite). The gene has been implicated in liver health, with certain variants offering protective effects against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and related conditions (Kalinowski2022MTARC1; Caddeo2024Precision).

## Structure
The MTARC1 protein is a molybdenum-containing enzyme anchored on the outer mitochondrial membrane. It features two MOSC (molybdenum cofactor sulfurase C-terminal) domains: the MOSC_C domain, which contains the catalytic site with a Mo-molybdopterin cofactor at its center, and the MOSC_N domain, which is proposed to play a role in substrate recognition or in regulating interactions with cofactors like cytochrome b5 type B (CYB5B) and cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3) (Smagris2024Divergent). The MOSC_N domain includes β-strands and helices, while the MOSC domain comprises additional β-strands and helices, forming a structure that tightly binds the molybdenum cofactor (Kubitza2018Crystal).

The protein's active site is composed of several conserved residues, including C273, which is crucial for molybdenum binding and catalytic activity (SparacinoWatkins2014Nitrite; Kubitza2018Crystal). The MTARC1 protein also contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence and a hydrophobic domain that anchors it to the mitochondrial membrane (Hou2023Biochemical). The p.A165T missense variant, located in the MOSC_N domain, affects protein stability and localization, leading to reduced hepatic expression (Smagris2024Divergent).

## Function
MTARC1 encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the reduction of N-hydroxylated compounds, playing a crucial role in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. The protein is part of the mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC) system, which includes mARC-1 and mARC-2, and is involved in the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) under hypoxic conditions. This process is significant for NO production, which is essential for vascular function, neurotransmission, and immune response (SparacinoWatkins2014Nitrite).

MTARC1 functions as part of an electron transfer chain with NADH, cytochrome b5, and cytochrome b5 reductase, facilitating the reduction of nitrite to NO. This pathway is distinct from the nitric oxide synthase-dependent pathway and the inorganic nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway, as it is oxygen-independent and reductive (SparacinoWatkins2014Nitrite). The enzyme's active site contains a molybdenum cofactor, coordinated by a cysteine residue, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (SparacinoWatkins2014Nitrite).

MTARC1 is also involved in the detoxification of N-hydroxylated nucleobases and nucleosides, preventing the accumulation of mutagenic substances in cells. It plays a role in the activation of amidoxime prodrugs, enhancing their pharmacological efficacy (Ott2014The). The protein is localized in mitochondria and is expressed in various tissues, indicating its widespread role in human physiology (Kubitza2018Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MTARC1 gene, particularly the rs2642438 variant, have been associated with a protective effect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis. This variant, which results in an alanine to threonine substitution (p.A165T), is linked to lower hepatic triglyceride content, reduced lobular inflammation, and decreased serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, and cholesterol (Kalinowski2022MTARC1; Caddeo2024Precision). The MTARC1 p.A165T variant is also associated with a distinctive plasma lipid profile characterized by elevated triglycerides, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and ApoB levels, without increasing cardiovascular risk (Schneider2021A).

The protective effects of the MTARC1 variant are particularly pronounced in individuals with obesity, type 2 diabetes, or those carrying the PNPLA3 rs738409 risk variant (Schneider2021A). The variant is also linked to reduced liver-related mortality, especially among obese and diabetic individuals (Schneider2021A). These findings suggest that MTARC1 plays a significant role in modulating liver disease risk and progression.

## Interactions
MTARC1, the mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 1, is involved in several protein interactions that facilitate its enzymatic functions. It is part of a three-protein amidoxime reducing chain, interacting with cytochrome b5 (CYB5) and cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R). These interactions are crucial for the electron transfer from NADH to MTARC1, enabling the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) (SparacinoWatkins2014Nitrite). The active site of MTARC1 contains a molybdenum cofactor, which is essential for its catalytic activity. Mutations in the active site cysteine residue (Cys-273) disrupt this interaction, abolishing NO formation and highlighting the importance of this site for its function (SparacinoWatkins2014Nitrite).

MTARC1 is also involved in the reduction of N-hydroxylated prodrugs and N-oxygenated compounds, processes that are facilitated by its interactions with other mitochondrial proteins (Kalinowski2022MTARC1). These interactions suggest that MTARC1 plays a significant role in mitochondrial electron transfer processes and detoxification pathways, contributing to its physiological functions in the liver and other tissues (Schneider2021A).
