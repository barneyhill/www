# NPNT

## Overview
Nephronectin (NPNT) is a gene that encodes the nephronectin protein, a key component of the extracellular matrix involved in cell adhesion, differentiation, and tissue development. The nephronectin protein is categorized as a basement membrane protein and is characterized by its complex structure, which includes epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin-binding motif, and a C-terminal MAM domain. These structural features facilitate its interaction with integrins, particularly integrin α8β1, playing a crucial role in kidney development and osteoblast differentiation (Sun2017The; Huang2005Identification). Nephronectin is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, lung, brain, and placenta, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes. The gene's expression is regulated by factors such as TNF-α and TGF-β, which modulate its activity in tissue homeostasis and repair (Sun2017The). Mutations in NPNT have been linked to congenital kidney anomalies and cancer progression, underscoring its clinical significance (AlHamed2022Missense; Sarfstein2020Identification).

## Structure
Nephronectin (NPNT) is a basement membrane protein characterized by a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide, five epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin-binding motif, and a C-terminal meprin-A5 protein-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase μ (MAM) domain (Sato2013Nephronectin; Huang2005Identification). The EGF-like repeats, three of which are EGF-Ca domains, are involved in protein-protein interactions and calcium binding, which are crucial for maintaining protein conformation and function (Huang2005Identification).

The MAM domain, approximately 170 amino acids in length, features a 10-stranded β-sandwich fold with jelly-roll topology, similar to the ligand-binding site of carbohydrate-binding module family 4 (CBM4) (Sato2013Nephronectin). This domain is essential for binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) such as agrin and perlecan, facilitated by basic amino acid residues in its loop regions (Sato2013Nephronectin).

Nephronectin undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which affects its molecular weight and sorting into small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) (Toraskar2019A). Two human isoforms, NPNTa and NPNTb, have been identified, with NPNTb containing an additional 17 amino acid insertion (Huang2005Identification). These structural features enable nephronectin to interact with various molecules, influencing cell adhesion and signaling.

## Function
Nephronectin (NPNT) is a crucial extracellular matrix protein involved in various molecular processes that support cell adhesion, differentiation, and tissue development. It is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like superfamily and contains several structural domains, including EGF-like repeat domains, a MAM domain, and an RGD motif, which are essential for its function in cell adhesion and differentiation (Sun2017The; Huang2005Identification).

NPNT interacts with integrins, particularly integrin α8β1, through its RGD motif, influencing integrin-mediated signaling pathways. This interaction is vital for kidney development, as it mediates the function of integrin α8β1 in the developing kidney, contributing to processes such as ureteric bud growth and morphogenesis (Brandenberger2001Identification; Sun2017The). NPNT is also involved in osteoblast differentiation and bone homeostasis, where it promotes osteoblast activity and mineralization, playing a role in bone remodeling (Sun2017The).

In addition to its role in kidney and bone development, NPNT is expressed in various tissues, including the lung, brain, and placenta, indicating its involvement in broader developmental and physiological processes (Huang2005Identification). Its expression is regulated by factors such as TNF-α, TGF-β, and BMP2, which modulate its activity in tissue homeostasis and repair (Sun2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPNT gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), a homozygous missense variant in NPNT (c.56C>G; p.Ala19Gly) has been associated with severe cystic dysplasia of the kidneys, leading to intrauterine fetal death. This variant is predicted to disrupt the signal peptide site, which is crucial for proper protein function, highlighting its clinical significance in kidney development disorders (AlHamed2022Missense).

In cancer biology, NPNT expression is linked to cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer, where it promotes adhesion and growth, correlating with metastatic potential. NPNT is positively regulated by IGF1, with higher levels observed in malignant cells. Silencing NPNT in breast cancer cells reduces cell viability and affects the ERK1/2 pathway, suggesting its role in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Sarfstein2020Identification). Additionally, NPNT expression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, as it facilitates metastasis through its integrin-binding motifs (Steigedal2018Nephronectin).

In glomerular diseases, NPNT expression is regulated by miR-378a-3p, which, when upregulated, leads to decreased NPNT levels, contributing to podocyte dysfunction and proteinuria. This mechanism is significant in diseases like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis (MüllerDeile2017Podocytes).

## Interactions
Nephronectin (NPNT) is known to interact with several integrins, particularly integrin α8β1, facilitating cell-matrix adhesion. This interaction is crucial for kidney morphogenesis and is mediated by the RGD sequence present in nephronectin, which is essential for binding to integrins. The binding of integrin α8β1 to nephronectin is RGD-dependent, as demonstrated by inhibition experiments using the GRGDSP peptide (Brandenberger2001Identification).

Nephronectin also interacts with other integrins such as αVβ3, αVβ5, αVβ6, and α4β7, which bind strongly to nephronectin in the presence of Mn2+, an integrin activator. However, integrins like α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, and α4β1 do not show significant binding to nephronectin, indicating selective interaction with certain RGD-binding integrins (Brandenberger2001Identification).

In addition to integrin interactions, nephronectin is involved in signaling pathways. It mediates p38 MAPK-induced cell viability through its integrin-binding enhancer motif, promoting cell survival and proliferation. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer biology, where nephronectin's role in cell viability and signaling pathways is being explored (Toraskar2018Nephronectin).
