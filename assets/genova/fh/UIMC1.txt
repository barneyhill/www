# UIMC1

## Overview
UIMC1, also known as RAP80, is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin interaction motif containing 1 protein, which plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response pathway. This protein is characterized by its tandem ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and zinc finger-like motifs, which are essential for its function in recognizing ubiquitin chains and facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair complexes to sites of damage. UIMC1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with key proteins such as BRCA1, contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability through its involvement in homologous recombination and cell cycle regulation. The protein's ability to undergo post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation and phosphorylation, further regulates its activity in DNA repair processes. Mutations in the UIMC1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular integrity (AlHakim2010The; da2020Germline; Yan2007Ubiquitininteraction).

## Structure
UIMC1, also known as RAP80, is a nuclear protein characterized by specific structural features that are crucial for its function. The primary structure of UIMC1 includes two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) located at its amino terminus, specifically between amino acids 79-96 and 104-121, which are essential for binding ubiquitin and facilitating its role in DNA damage response (Yan2007The; Yan2007Ubiquitininteraction). Additionally, UIMC1 contains two zinc finger-like motifs at its carboxyl terminus, spanning amino acids 505-582, which contribute to its structural integrity (Yan2007The).

The tertiary structure of UIMC1 involves the overall 3D folding necessary for its interaction with other proteins, such as BRCA1, in DNA damage repair complexes (Yan2007The). UIMC1 forms part of a protein complex with BRCA1, BARD1, and BRCC36, indicating its involvement in quaternary structures essential for DNA damage response (Sobhian2007RAP80).

Post-translational modifications of UIMC1 include sumoylation, as it interacts with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9, and phosphorylation by ATM protein kinase, which may regulate its function in DNA repair (Yan2007The; Yan2007RAP80). UIMC1 also exhibits alternative splice variants, with some isoforms predominantly expressed in testis, suggesting tissue-specific roles (Shebzukhov2007RAP80UIMC1).

## Function
UIMC1, also known as RAP80, is a protein that plays a critical role in the DNA damage response in healthy human cells. It functions primarily by recruiting repair proteins to sites of DNA double-strand breaks, a process essential for maintaining genomic stability. UIMC1 contains tandem ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that are crucial for its role in the DNA repair pathway. These motifs specifically recognize ubiquitin chains, facilitating the recruitment of the BRCA1 complex to damaged chromatin, which is vital for the DNA damage response and repair processes (AlHakim2010The).

UIMC1 is active in the nucleus, where it influences cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It acts upstream of BRCA1, a tumor suppressor, and is required for the accumulation of BRCA1 at sites of DNA breaks, particularly in the context of homologous recombination. This function is crucial for maintaining chromosomal stability and cellular proliferation (Pontikakis2016Predictive). The protein's role in DNA repair is significant, as it helps ensure the proper response to DNA damage, thereby preventing genomic instability that could lead to tumorigenesis (Tarnathummanan2024Plasma).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UIMC1 gene, also known as RAP80, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In the context of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), UIMC1 is part of the BRCA1-A complex, which is essential for recruiting BRCA1 to DNA double-strand break sites. Variants in UIMC1, such as p.Pro435Leu, have been identified in HBOC cohorts, although this specific variant is classified as benign due to its high frequency in population databases (da2020Germline).

UIMC1 has also been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). A study identified UIMC1 as one of the genes enriched for de novo mutations, suggesting its potential significance in NDDs (Wang2020Largescale). The gene's role in DNA repair and its interaction with ubiquitin are crucial for maintaining genomic stability, and disruptions in these processes can contribute to disease development.

In cancer, UIMC1 has been studied as a cancer-associated antigen, with specific antibodies found in a subset of cancer patients. Its splice variants can elicit immune responses, particularly in colon, breast, and ovarian cancers, although no significant differences in expression between normal and tumor tissues have been observed (Shebzukhov2007RAP80UIMC1).

## Interactions
UIMC1, also known as RAP80, is a protein that plays a significant role in the DNA damage response through its interactions with various proteins. It contains ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that are crucial for its function. UIMC1 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1, forming a complex that is essential for BRCA1's translocation to DNA damage foci following irradiation. This interaction is mediated through the BRCT repeats of BRCA1, although the UIMs of UIMC1 are not required for this interaction (Yan2007The).

UIMC1 also interacts with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9, which enhances its mono-sumoylation and induces multi-sumoylation. This interaction is critical for UIMC1's function in the regulation of estrogen receptor alpha and DNA damage response signaling (Yan2007RAP80). The protein is a target for SUMO-1 modification and can be conjugated to SUMO-3 efficiently, although it is a weak substrate for SUMO-2 (Yan2007RAP80).

UIMC1's UIMs are essential for its translocation to ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) after DNA damage, as they bind K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, facilitating recruitment to these sites (Yan2007The). The interaction landscape of UIMC1 also includes selective recognition of K63 diubiquitin linkages, which is critical for its role in DNA damage response (Zhang2017An).
