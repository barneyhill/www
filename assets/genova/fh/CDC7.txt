# CDC7

## Overview
The CDC7 gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase known as cell division cycle 7 (CDC7), which is pivotal in the regulation of DNA replication initiation. This kinase is a crucial component of the Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) complex, formed through its interaction with the regulatory subunit DBF4. The CDC7 protein is characterized by a unique kinase catalytic domain and a bilobed tertiary structure, which facilitates its role in phosphorylating key substrates involved in DNA replication, such as the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex (Cheng2022Structural; Jiang1999Mammalian). CDC7's activity is tightly regulated throughout the cell cycle, with its function being essential for the G1/S transition and ensuring that DNA replication occurs once per cell cycle (Jiang1999Mammalian). Beyond its fundamental role in cell cycle progression, CDC7 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Liachko2013CDC7; Kulkarni2009Cdc7).

## Structure
The CDC7 protein in humans is a serine/threonine kinase essential for initiating DNA replication. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 58,250 or 56,000, depending on the initiation site used during translation (Patterson1986Molecular). The protein contains a kinase catalytic domain, which is crucial for its function. This domain is organized uniquely compared to other kinases, with key residues conserved in protein serine-threonine kinases (Bahman1988Characterisation).

The secondary structure of CDC7 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of protein kinases, with the catalytic core primarily composed of helical structures responsible for peptide binding and catalysis (Hollingsworth1992Molecular). The tertiary structure features a bilobed configuration, with the active site located in a cleft between the N- and C-lobes, a common feature among serine/threonine kinases (Cheng2022Structural).

CDC7 forms a complex with Dbf4, which is necessary for its activation. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization and activation of the kinase, with Dbf4 motifs interacting with CDC7 to maintain kinase insertions in stretched conformations (Cheng2022Structural). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity (Cheng2022Structural).

## Function
The CDC7 gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the initiation of DNA replication in human cells. The CDC7 protein, often referred to as HsCdc7 in humans, forms a complex with a regulatory subunit known as HsDbf4. This complex is essential for the activation of DNA replication, particularly during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (Jiang1999Mammalian). The kinase activity of CDC7 is regulated throughout the cell cycle, with low activity during the G1 phase and increased activity during the S phase, which is achieved through its association with HsDbf4 (Jiang1997Identification; Jiang1999Mammalian).

CDC7 phosphorylates components of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, specifically targeting the MCM2 subunit, which is a key component of the pre-replication complexes at DNA replication origins (Jiang1999Mammalian). This phosphorylation is necessary for the initiation of DNA replication, ensuring that replication occurs once per cell cycle (Sato1997Human). The CDC7 protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it remains throughout interphase, indicating its involvement in chromosomal replication (Sato1997Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the CDC7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In epithelial ovarian carcinoma, increased CDC7 expression is associated with advanced tumor stage, genomic instability, and poor patient survival, making it a potential therapeutic target (Kulkarni2009Cdc7). Similarly, in melanoma, CDC7 overexpression contributes to resistance against the BRAF V600E-specific inhibitor Vemurafenib, suggesting that targeting CDC7 could overcome drug resistance (Gad2019Targeting).

In neurodegenerative diseases, CDC7 plays a role in the phosphorylation of TDP-43, a protein linked to conditions such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD). CDC7-mediated phosphorylation of TDP-43 at serines 409 and 410 increases its toxicity, contributing to neurodegeneration. Inhibition of CDC7 has been shown to reduce TDP-43 phosphorylation and improve neurodegenerative symptoms, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in TDP-43 proteinopathies (Liachko2013CDC7).

CDC7 is also involved in neuroendocrine transformation in lung and prostate tumors, where its upregulation is linked to mutations in TP53 and RB1. Inhibition of CDC7 can prevent this transformation, highlighting its role in tumor progression and as a target for therapeutic intervention (QuintanalVillalonga2024CDC7).

## Interactions
CDC7, a serine/threonine kinase, is a key player in the initiation of DNA replication through its interactions with various proteins. It forms a complex with its regulatory subunit DBF4, known as the Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) complex, which is essential for its kinase activity. This complex interacts with the MCM2-7 helicase, specifically targeting the Mcm2, Mcm4, and Mcm6 subunits for phosphorylation, which is crucial for DNA unwinding and replication fork progression (Saleh2022The).

CDC7 also interacts with the Scc2-Scc4 complex, which is involved in chromatin association and cohesin loading. This interaction is more pronounced with the Cdc7-Drf1 complex, highlighting the importance of regulatory subunits in CDC7's function (Takahashi2008Cdc7–Drf1). The presence of Scc2-Scc4 is crucial for the interaction between CDC7 and cohesin components like Rad21, indicating a role in chromosome cohesion (Takahashi2008Cdc7–Drf1).

In addition, CDC7-mediated phosphorylation of MCM4 facilitates its interaction with CDC45 on chromatin, a critical step for the initiation of DNA replication (Masai2006Phosphorylation). These interactions underscore CDC7's central role in coordinating the initiation of DNA replication and maintaining genomic stability.
