# EGLN2

## Overview
EGLN2, also known as prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 1 (PHD1), is a gene that encodes a member of the egl-9 family of prolyl hydroxylases. The protein product of EGLN2, PHD1, is a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to oxygen levels by regulating hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). As a prolyl hydroxylase, PHD1 hydroxylates specific proline residues on HIF alpha subunits, targeting them for degradation under normoxic conditions, thereby maintaining oxygen homeostasis. Unlike other members of the EGLN family, PHD1 is unique in its regulation, being inducible by estrogen rather than hypoxia. The enzyme is involved in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis and metabolism, and interacts with multiple proteins, influencing pathways related to cancer and other diseases (Zheng2014Prolyl; Ivan2017The).

## Structure
EGLN2, also known as PHD1, is a prolyl hydroxylase enzyme involved in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). The primary structure of EGLN2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes a catalytic domain essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain binds iron and 2-oxoglutarate, which are crucial for its function as a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (Ivan2017The).

The secondary structure of EGLN2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure is characterized by a double-stranded beta-helix fold, a common feature among 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, which facilitates its catalytic activity (Ivan2017The).

EGLN2 may also form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that could be important for its biological function. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, potentially influencing its activity and interactions with other proteins (Ivan2017The).

Splice variants of EGLN2 may exist, which could alter its functional properties and contribute to its diverse roles in cellular processes (Ivan2017The).

## Function
EGLN2, also known as PHD1, is a prolyl hydroxylase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the cellular response to oxygen levels. It is part of the oxygen-sensing system that regulates the stability of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) by hydroxylating specific proline residues on HIF alpha subunits, marking them for degradation under normoxic conditions. This process is essential for maintaining oxygen homeostasis and allows cells to adapt to varying oxygen levels (Ivan2017The).

EGLN2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes such as angiogenesis and metabolism. It is involved in the hydroxylation of non-HIF targets, including FOXO3a, which affects protein stability and cellular signaling pathways (Ivan2017The). Unlike other EGLN enzymes, EGLN2 is estrogen-inducible and not upregulated by hypoxia, indicating a unique regulatory mechanism (Ivan2017The).

The enzyme's activity is characterized by a relatively low affinity for oxygen, a common trait among oxygen sensors, which allows it to effectively modulate cellular responses to changes in oxygen availability (Ivan2017The).

## Clinical Significance
EGLN2, also known as PHD1, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in the hypoxia response pathway. Alterations in EGLN2 expression and DNA methylation have been linked to cancer progression and prognosis. In early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), hypermethylation of EGLN2 is associated with downregulation of its expression, leading to increased HIF1A expression and poor survival outcomes. This suggests that EGLN2 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its interaction with HIF1A could serve as a prognostic marker for LUAD (Zhang2019EGLN2).

In pancreatic cancer, EGLN2 is negatively associated with cancer progression. It is involved in regulating aerobic glycolysis through the EGLN2/HIF-1α axis. Overexpression of EGLN2 decreases cell viability and inhibits glycolysis, indicating its role as a negative regulator of proliferation and glycolysis in pancreatic cancer (Xiang2018TCF7L2).

EGLN2 genetic variants also influence smoking behavior and related disease risks. The SNP rs3733829 in EGLN2 is associated with cigarette consumption and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggesting a mechanism related to hypoxia rather than nicotine metabolism (Bloom2013Variants).

## Interactions
EGLN2, also known as PHD1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the transcription factor FOXO3a. EGLN2 hydroxylates FOXO3a at specific prolyl residues, which disrupts its interaction with the USP9x deubiquitinase. This disruption leads to increased ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of FOXO3a, affecting its stability and function in cell proliferation and cancer pathways (Zheng2014Prolyl).

EGLN2 also interacts with the tumor suppressor SPOP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. SPOP targets EGLN2 for ubiquitination and degradation, a process that is crucial in regulating prostate cancer cell growth. This interaction is mediated by specific degrons in the N-terminal of EGLN2, which are essential for SPOP-mediated degradation (Zhang2017Tumor).

Additionally, EGLN2 is known to hydroxylate other substrates such as CEP192 and IKBKB, which are involved in various cellular processes (Zhang2017Tumor). These interactions highlight EGLN2's role in modulating protein stability and function through hydroxylation and ubiquitination pathways, impacting cancer cell proliferation and other physiological signals.
