# HTN3

## Overview
The HTN3 gene encodes histatin 3, a histidine-rich cationic antimicrobial peptide predominantly found in human saliva. Histatin 3 is part of the histatin family, which plays a vital role in oral health by exhibiting antimicrobial properties that help maintain oral homeostasis. This peptide is characterized by its ability to bind metal ions, such as zinc and copper, which enhances its antimicrobial efficacy. Histatin 3 is involved in various biological processes, including antifungal activity, wound healing, and modulation of cell signaling pathways. The gene has also been implicated in the formation of the HTN3-MSANTD3 fusion gene, a recurrent genetic event in acinic cell carcinoma of the salivary gland, although its exact role in oncogenesis remains to be fully elucidated (Aboulfotoh2024Impact; Andreasen2019The; Melino2013Histatins:).

## Structure
Histatin 3, encoded by the HTN3 gene, is a histidine-rich peptide found in human saliva. The primary structure of histatin 3 consists of 32 amino acid residues, with a sequence provided as "DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGYRSNYLYDN" (Melino2013Histatins:). This sequence is rich in histidine, which contributes to its metal-binding properties, particularly with zinc and copper ions (Melino2013Histatins:).

The secondary structure of histatin 3 includes helical conformations, especially in hydrophobic environments, which are stabilized by metal coordination, particularly with Zn(II) and Ni(II) (Melino2013Histatins:). The presence of an ATCUN motif at the N-terminus facilitates metal ion binding, enhancing its antimicrobial activity (Xiuli2009Kinetics).

Histatin 3 does not exhibit complex tertiary or quaternary structures, as it primarily functions as a linear peptide. However, its structure is crucial for its biological activities, including antifungal and wound-healing properties. The C-terminal region is particularly important for wound closure activity, which is absent in histatin 5 (Xiuli2009Kinetics). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific details are not extensively documented in the provided context.

## Function
HTN3 encodes histatin 3, a salivary protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health through its antimicrobial properties. Histatin 3 is primarily active in the oral cavity, where it contributes to oral homeostasis by inhibiting the growth of fungi and bacteria, thus preventing dental decay and fungal infections (Aboulfotoh2024Impact). This protein is part of a family of histidine-rich cationic antimicrobial peptides found in human saliva, known for their protective roles in the oral cavity, including digestion, lubrication, protection, and immune defense (JENWANICHKUL2024IN).

Histatin 3, along with other histatins, is involved in cellular processes beyond its antimicrobial activity, such as influencing cellular proliferation, differentiation, and wound-healing processes. It also modulates cell signaling pathways, potentially impacting cell growth (JENWANICHKUL2024IN). The protein's ability to maintain oral homeostasis is essential for preventing infections and promoting healing in the oral environment. In healthy human cells, histatin 3's antimicrobial activity and involvement in cellular processes underscore its importance in maintaining the integrity and health of the oral cavity.

## Clinical Significance
The HTN3 gene, encoding histatin 3, is primarily associated with its role in the HTN3-MSANTD3 fusion gene, which is a recurrent genetic event in acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) of the salivary gland. This fusion gene is identified in a subset of AciCC cases, characterized by serous tumor cells and predominantly found in the parotid gland. The presence of the HTN3-MSANTD3 fusion is linked to a subset of AciCC with prominent serous differentiation and an indolent clinical course, suggesting its specificity to this type of carcinoma (Andreasen2019The). 

The HTN3-MSANTD3 fusion leads to the overexpression of the MSANTD3 gene, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of AciCC, although the exact oncogenic mechanisms remain unclear (Barasch2017Recurrent). Despite its potential role in oncogenesis, the HTN3-MSANTD3 fusion has not been described in other tumors, and no targeted therapies are currently available for this gene fusion (Lassche2019Advances). The clinical impact of identifying this fusion gene is considered limited due to the generally indolent nature of AciCC (Andreasen2019The).

## Interactions
Histatin 3 (HTN3) is a salivary protein known for its antimicrobial properties, particularly its ability to interact with microbial proteins and contribute to oral defense. HTN3 is characterized by its positive net charge, which facilitates electrostatic interactions with negatively charged bacterial cell membranes. This interaction leads to membrane destabilization and thinning, crucial for its antibacterial activity (Melino2013Histatins:). HTN3, along with other histatins, has been shown to be effective against various bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant strains (Melino2013Histatins:).

HTN3 also exhibits metal-binding properties, particularly with zinc (Zn(II)) and copper (Cu(II)) ions. These interactions are significant for its biological activity, as the Zn(II)-HTN3 complex can induce membrane fusion and hydrolysis of nucleic acids, contributing to its antibacterial action (Melino2013Histatins:). The Cu(II)-HTN3 complex is associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can disrupt cell structures and induce DNA damage (Melino2013Histatins:). These metal-binding interactions suggest potential applications in chelation therapies and antimicrobial treatments.
