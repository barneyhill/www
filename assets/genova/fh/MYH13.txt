# MYH13

## Overview
MYH13 is a gene that encodes the myosin heavy chain 13 protein, a specialized component of the myosin II complex, which is integral to muscle contraction. This protein is categorized as a motor protein due to its role in converting chemical energy into mechanical work, primarily through its ATPase activity. Myosin heavy chain 13 is predominantly expressed in extraocular muscles, where it facilitates rapid and precise eye movements, underscoring its importance in specialized muscle functions (Schiaffino2018Muscle). The gene is part of a unique evolutionary lineage among mammalian striated myosin heavy chains, characterized by its early divergence and specialization (Schachat2002Phylogenetic). MYH13's involvement in the actomyosin system is critical for various cellular activities, including cytokinesis and intracellular transport (Betapudi2017Nonmuscle). Additionally, MYH13 has been implicated in genetic studies related to isolated clubfoot and is significantly upregulated in certain pathological conditions, such as thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Weymouth2011Variants; Wu2020Integrative).

## Structure


## Function
MYH13 encodes the myosin heavy chain 13 protein, which is a component of the myosin II complex involved in muscle contraction. This protein is primarily expressed in extraocular muscles, where it plays a crucial role in facilitating rapid and precise eye movements (Schiaffino2018Muscle). The myosin heavy chain 13 protein contributes to the structural integrity and function of these muscles, which are essential for maintaining proper eye alignment and movement.

In terms of molecular processes, MYH13 is involved in the actomyosin system, which is critical for various cellular activities such as cytokinesis and intracellular transport. The protein's ATPase activity allows it to convert chemical energy into mechanical work, enabling muscle contraction and other cellular functions (Betapudi2017Nonmuscle). The myosin heavy chain 13 protein interacts with actin filaments, forming a complex that is vital for the contractile properties of muscle fibers.

The presence of MYH13 in extraocular muscles highlights its importance in specialized muscle functions, particularly those requiring rapid and coordinated movements. This specificity underscores the gene's role in maintaining the unique functional properties of these muscles, which are distinct from other muscle types in the body (Schiaffino2018Muscle).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MYH13, a gene encoding a superfast myosin heavy chain, is primarily expressed in extraocular and laryngeal muscles. It is part of a unique evolutionary lineage among mammalian striated myosin heavy chains, characterized by its early divergence and specialization. MYH13 exhibits distinctive transcriptional features, including multiple transcription initiation sites and alternative splicing of the 5′-UTR sequences, which are uncommon among striated muscle MYH genes. This suggests a specialized network of transcriptional activators regulating MYH13, differing from the typical myogenic factors that regulate other MYH genes (Schachat2002Phylogenetic).

In the context of genetic studies, MYH13 has been associated with the risk of isolated clubfoot, with evidence of altered transmission in both Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic populations. The study identified potential gene interactions involving MYH13, such as with TPM1, although the same SNPs were not involved in both datasets. These interactions suggest that MYH13 may play a role in the genetic architecture of clubfoot through its interactions with other muscle contraction genes (Weymouth2011Variants).

MYH13 is also significantly upregulated in extraocular muscles from patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, indicating its involvement in pathways related to tight junctions and cell adhesion molecules (Wu2020Integrative).
