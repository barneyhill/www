# EOLA1

## Overview
EOLA1, also known as endothelial-overexpressed LPS-associated factor 1, is a gene that encodes the protein endothelium and lymphocyte associated ASCH domain 1. This protein is characterized by its ASCH domain, which is structurally similar to the PUA domain known for RNA-binding roles, suggesting a potential involvement in RNA metabolism (Kim2019Crystal). EOLA1 is primarily expressed in various tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney, and plays a significant role in modulating inflammatory responses, particularly in endothelial cells (Liu2014EOLA1). The protein functions as a negative regulator of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced responses, inhibiting IL-6 production and apoptosis, thereby protecting endothelial cells from injury during inflammation (Liu2014EOLA1). Additionally, EOLA1 is involved in immune modulation through its role in cytokine production by regulatory B cells (Fukasawa2021Singlecelllevel). Despite its established functions, further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms and interactions of EOLA1 in cellular processes.

## Structure
The EOLA1 protein, also known as CXorf40A, consists of 158 amino acids and is characterized by the presence of an ASCH domain, which is structurally similar to the PUA domain known for RNA-binding roles (Kim2019Crystal). The crystal structure of EOLA1 was determined at a resolution of 1.71 Å, revealing a β-barrel fold surrounded by α-helices, with a core cavity and a positively charged cleft that may facilitate RNA binding (Kim2019Crystal). The protein structure includes four α-helices (α1-α4), two 3_10-helices (η1 and η2), and six β-strands (β1-β6) forming the β-barrel structure (Kim2019Crystal).

EOLA1 features a conserved 'GxKxxExR' motif within its cavity structure, which is important for its potential interaction with nucleotide molecules (Kim2019Crystal). The protein's tertiary structure includes an aromatic cage formed by residues Phe8, Tyr12, and Trp48, which is analogous to the aromatic cage in YTH domains, suggesting a role in substrate recognition (Kim2019Crystal). EOLA1 lacks nucleolytic activity but may bind nucleic acids, implicating it in RNA metabolism (Kim2019Crystal). The protein is classified under subclass 4 of the ASCH family, with variations in sequences and topologies except in the core cavity region (Kim2019Crystal).

## Function
EOLA1, also known as endothelial-overexpressed LPS-associated factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in signal transduction and regulation of inflammatory responses in endothelial cells. It is primarily expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and placenta, with notable expression in the spleen, colon, and small intestine, and is almost absent in the brain, thymus, lung, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Liu2014EOLA1). The protein is localized in the nucleus and matrix of ECV304 cells and can inhibit the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Liu2014EOLA1).

EOLA1 plays a crucial role in modulating the cellular response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure by inhibiting LPS-induced IL-6 production and apoptosis in HUVECs. This regulation is mediated through the expression of metallothionein 2a (MT2a), which is involved in inflammation (Liu2014EOLA1). EOLA1 functions as a negative regulator for LPS response, suggesting its protective role in preventing endothelial cell injury or dysfunction during inflammatory responses (Liu2014EOLA1). Additionally, EOLA1 is implicated in the production of IL-35 by regulatory B cells, which inhibits IL-6 signaling, indicating its involvement in modulating immune responses (Fukasawa2021Singlecelllevel).

## Clinical Significance
The EOLA1 gene, also known as endothelial-overexpressed LPS-associated factor 1, has been implicated in various inflammatory and immune responses, particularly in endothelial cells. Alterations in EOLA1 expression have been associated with the regulation of IL-6 production and apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. The gene's expression is induced by LPS, and its depletion leads to increased IL-6 production and apoptosis, suggesting a protective role against LPS-induced inflammatory responses (Liu2014EOLA1).

In the context of liver transplantation, EOLA1 expression has been studied in rat models, where it was found to be significantly higher in grafts showing tolerance compared to those undergoing acute rejection. This suggests that EOLA1 expression may serve as a marker for graft tolerance and the severity of rejection, indicating its potential role in modulating immune responses during transplantation (Ran2008Changes).

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of EOLA1 in managing inflammatory responses and endothelial cell survival, which could be relevant in conditions like sepsis and organ transplantation where endothelial dysfunction and immune regulation are critical.

## Interactions
EOLA1, encoded by the CXorf40A gene, is implicated in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. Structurally, EOLA1 contains a basic cleft and patch that suggest potential binding to nucleic acids, particularly RNA. This is supported by the presence of a conserved 'GxKxxExR' motif, which may interact with metal ions coordinating a nucleotide, indicating a possible role in RNA binding and processing (Kim2019Crystal). 

EOLA1 is also reported to interact with metallothionein-2A (MT2A), a metal-binding protein. This interaction has been demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting a role in regulating inflammatory responses in endothelial cells by modulating MT2A activity (Liu2014EOLA1; Kim2019Crystal). 

In the context of autoimmune diseases, EOLA1 is involved in the regulation of cytokine production by B cells. It mediates the production of IL-35 by regulatory B cells, which inhibits IL-6 signaling, highlighting its role in immune modulation (Fukasawa2021Singlecelllevel). Despite these findings, the precise mechanisms and full range of EOLA1's interactions remain to be fully elucidated.
