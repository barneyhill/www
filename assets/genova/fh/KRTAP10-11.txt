# KRTAP10-11

## Overview
KRTAP10-11 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 10-11, which is part of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, contributing to the formation and strength of keratin fibers. The KRTAP10-11 gene is involved in the regulation of keratin filament assembly, playing a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. While the specific functions of the keratin-associated protein 10-11 remain under investigation, its expression has been linked to various physiological and pathological processes, including responses to antipsychotic treatment and potential implications in cancer biology (Kumarasinghe2013Gene; Albawardi2021Copy; Maggisano2024RNA).

## Clinical Significance
The KRTAP10-11 gene, part of the keratin-associated protein family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts due to its altered expression levels. In schizophrenia patients, KRTAP10-11 expression is significantly up-regulated following antipsychotic treatment, with a fold change of 3.43, suggesting its potential role in the response to medication (Kumarasinghe2013Gene). This alteration in expression may indicate a broader involvement in neurological conditions, although specific diseases directly resulting from mutations in KRTAP10-11 have not been detailed.

In the context of cancer, KRTAP10-11 is mentioned in studies examining RNA profiles of exosomes from thyroid cells, though its specific clinical significance in thyroid cancer remains unclear (Maggisano2024RNA). The gene is also noted in prostate cancer research, where amplifications in the keratin-associated protein 10 family, including KRTAP10-11, are observed in individuals of African ancestry. However, the clinical implications of these amplifications are not fully understood (Albawardi2021Copy).

Overall, while KRTAP10-11 is associated with changes in expression in certain conditions, further research is needed to elucidate its precise role and potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in specific diseases.
