# PRRT2

## Overview
The PRRT2 gene encodes the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2, a type II transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in neuronal excitability and synaptic function. This protein is characterized by its proline-rich domain and two transmembrane domains, which contribute to its localization on the plasma membrane. PRRT2 is involved in modulating voltage-gated sodium channels and interacts with various proteins, including the SNARE complex and Na+/K+ ATPase, to regulate synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. Mutations in the PRRT2 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, such as paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia and benign familial infantile seizures, highlighting its clinical significance in synaptic regulation and neuronal signaling (Landolfi2021The; Fruscione2018PRRT2; Sterlini2021An).

## Structure
The PRRT2 protein is composed of 340 amino acids and is characterized by a proline-rich domain located in the N-terminal extracellular region, spanning amino acids 131-216 (Liu2022Clinical). The protein includes two transmembrane domains, with the first spanning amino acids 268-289 and the second spanning 318-338, contributing to its classification as a type II transmembrane protein (Li2021PRRT2; Liu2022Clinical). The secondary structure of PRRT2 is predominantly composed of random coils (67.65%) and alpha helices (23.24%) (Li2021PRRT2).

The tertiary structure prediction of PRRT2 using homologous modeling has been challenging due to low template coverage and prediction values, indicating that the precise 3D structure remains unresolved (Li2021PRRT2). PRRT2 is primarily located on the plasma membrane, with its N-terminus intracellularly and the C-terminus extracellularly (Tsai2019PRRT2; Li2021PRRT2).

PRRT2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at 77 sites, which may influence its interactions and functions (Li2021PRRT2). The protein is involved in synaptic functions, interacting with proteins such as SNAP25 and VAMP2, and plays a role in synaptic vesicle fusion (Landolfi2021The; Liu2022Clinical).

## Function
The PRRT2 gene encodes a proline-rich transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic function. In healthy human cells, PRRT2 acts as a negative modulator of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6, by decreasing their membrane exposure and sodium current, which reduces neuronal excitability (Fruscione2018PRRT2). This modulation is achieved by favoring the internalization of these channels and altering their biophysical properties, such as inducing a negative shift in the voltage-dependence of inactivation and slowing down recovery from inactivation (Fruscione2018PRRT2).

PRRT2 also interacts with the Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA), particularly the α3-NKA isoform, stabilizing neural network activity and preventing hyperexcitability (Sterlini2021An). It does not affect NKA expression but influences the clustering and function of α3-NKA on the plasma membrane, which is crucial during high neuronal activity (Sterlini2021An).

PRRT2 is involved in synaptic neurotransmitter release by interacting with the SNARE complex and synaptotagmin proteins, which are essential for synaptic vesicle fusion and synaptic plasticity (Li2021PRRT2; Sterlini2021An). It is enriched in the presynaptic membrane of neurons in various brain regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, highlighting its role in maintaining neuronal excitability and synaptic function (Li2021PRRT2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRRT2 gene are linked to a range of neurological disorders, primarily characterized by paroxysmal movement disturbances and seizures. Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is one of the most common conditions associated with PRRT2 mutations. It is characterized by brief, recurrent attacks of involuntary movements triggered by sudden voluntary movements (Landolfi2021The; Ono2012Mutations). Benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS), also known as benign familial infantile epilepsy, are another condition linked to PRRT2 mutations. This disorder typically manifests in infancy and resolves by age two (Heron2012PRRT2; Landolfi2021The).

PRRT2 mutations are also implicated in hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia, and complex neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in cases with biallelic mutations (Landolfi2021The; Fruscione2018PRRT2). The c.649dupC mutation is notably prevalent, accounting for a significant proportion of cases (Döring2020The). These mutations often lead to haploinsufficiency, resulting in synaptic deregulation and neuronal hyperexcitability (Fruscione2018PRRT2; Méneret2013PRRT2). The PRRT2 gene's role in synaptic function has shifted the understanding of these disorders from channelopathies to synaptopathies (Landolfi2021The).

## Interactions
PRRT2 (proline rich transmembrane protein 2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic function. PRRT2 interacts with P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), specifically the Cav2.1 subunit, enhancing their surface expression and modulating presynaptic calcium influx. This interaction is vital for proper synaptic transmission and is disrupted in PRRT2-deficient neurons, leading to synaptic impairment (Ferrante2021PRRT2).

PRRT2 also interacts with Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA) subunits, particularly α3-NKA and α1-NKA, which are important for maintaining neuronal excitability. This interaction is confirmed through biochemical assays and colocalization studies, suggesting that PRRT2 plays a role in modulating NKA function and distribution on the neuronal plasma membrane (Sterlini2021An).

Additionally, PRRT2 interacts with sodium channels Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6, reducing their membrane exposure and modulating their activity. This interaction is crucial for controlling neuronal excitability, as PRRT2 deficiency leads to increased Na+ currents and hyperexcitability (Fruscione2018PRRT2).

These interactions highlight PRRT2's role as a regulatory hub in neuronal signaling networks, influencing various pathways involved in synaptic plasticity and excitability.
