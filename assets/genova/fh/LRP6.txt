# LRP6

## Overview
The LRP6 gene encodes the LDL receptor-related protein 6, a crucial component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This single-pass transmembrane protein functions as a co-receptor, interacting with Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors to facilitate the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, thereby influencing the transcription of Wnt target genes. LRP6 is characterized by its complex extracellular domain, which includes multiple β-propeller and EGF-like domains, and an intracellular domain with conserved PPPSPxS motifs essential for its signaling activity. The protein is expressed in various tissues and plays significant roles in embryonic development, neural tube patterning, bone formation, and metabolic processes. Dysregulation or mutations in LRP6 are associated with several diseases, including neural tube defects, tooth agenesis, various cancers, and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions (Wang2017Harnessing; Ren2021LRP5; Alrefaei2022LRP6).

## Structure
The LRP6 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. It is composed of 1613 amino acids and features a complex extracellular domain (ECD) that includes four YWTD β-propeller domains, each followed by an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and three LDL receptor type A repeats (Joiner2013LRP5; Alrefaei2022LRP6). The β-propeller domains are labeled E1 to E4, with E1 and E3 being key binding sites for Wnt proteins and inhibitors (Joiner2013LRP5). The ECD adopts a flexible, skewed planar horseshoe-like structure, with E1, E2, and E3 being coplanar and E4 forming a short arm (Joiner2013LRP5).

The intracellular domain of LRP6 contains five reiterated PPPSPxS motifs, which are crucial for binding Axin and are essential for LRP6 signaling (Ren2021LRP5). These motifs are highly conserved and contribute to the protein's signaling activity (MacDonald2011Dissecting). LRP6 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which enhances its signaling capacity (MacDonald2011Dissecting).

LRP6 also has several isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and interactions within the Wnt signaling pathway (Kim2020Sclerostin).

## Function
The human gene LRP6 encodes a protein that functions as a co-receptor in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. LRP6 is a single-pass transmembrane protein that interacts with Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors to form a complex that stabilizes β-catenin by inhibiting its phosphorylation and degradation. This stabilization allows β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus, where it activates TCF/LEF transcription factors, leading to the expression of Wnt target genes (Wang2017Harnessing; Ren2021LRP5).

LRP6 is expressed in various human tissues, including the heart, brain, pancreas, and ovaries, and plays a significant role in embryonic development, neural tube patterning, and bone formation (Ren2021LRP5; Alrefaei2022LRP6). It is also involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, contributing to metabolic health (Alrefaei2022LRP6). LRP6's activity is regulated by proteins such as Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk1) and Sclerostin, which modulate its interaction with Wnt ligands (Wang2017Harnessing). The protein's role in these pathways highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions (Ren2021LRP5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the LRP6 gene are associated with a variety of diseases and conditions. LRP6 mutations have been linked to neural tube defects (NTDs), which are significant congenital abnormalities resulting from the failure of neural tube closure during early gestation. Specific mutations, such as Y505C and P1427Q, affect WNT signaling pathways crucial for neural tube development (Shi2017Novel).

In the context of dental anomalies, LRP6 mutations are implicated in tooth agenesis (TA), a condition characterized by the congenital absence of teeth. Studies have identified various mutations in LRP6 that contribute to TA, often in combination with other craniofacial abnormalities (Chu2021Synergistic; Ockeloen2016Novel).

LRP6 is also associated with several types of cancer, including non-small-cell lung, bladder, breast, and colorectal cancers. Mutations and high expression levels of LRP6 have been linked to increased or decreased risks of these cancers (Alrefaei2022LRP6).

Additionally, LRP6 mutations have been connected to cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly in normolipidemic families. These mutations can impair endothelial cell functions and disrupt Wnt signaling pathways, contributing to the development of CAD (Guo2016Mutant). LRP6 variants have also been associated with low bone mineral density, suggesting a role in early-onset osteoporosis (Puente2022An).

## Interactions
LRP6 interacts with various proteins that play significant roles in the Wnt signaling pathway. It forms a ternary complex with Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors, which is essential for the activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Alrefaei2022LRP6). LRP6 also interacts with Axin and Dishevelled (Dvl), facilitating the assembly of the Wnt signalosome and inhibiting the Axin degradasome, which is crucial for β-catenin accumulation (Gammons2018Multiprotein). 

The protein is involved in endocytosis and interacts with the ESCRT machinery, including proteins such as Hrs/Hgs, Stam1/2, CHMP4, Vps28, Vps37, and Tsg101, which are recruited near the LRP6 receptor shortly after Wnt stimulation (Colozza2020Wntinducible). LRP6 also interacts with the Trk-fused gene (TFG), which is necessary for Wnt signaling and localizes to endosomal vesicles (Colozza2020Wntinducible).

LRP6 is regulated by inhibitory interactions with proteins like DKK1 and Sclerostin (SOST). DKK1 forms a complex with Kremen1/2 and LRP6, leading to its internalization and inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Jeong2021Regulation). SOST inhibits Wnt signaling by binding to the LRP6 E1 and E2 domains, with specific motifs and residues enhancing this interaction (Kim2020Sclerostin).
