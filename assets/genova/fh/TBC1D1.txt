# TBC1D1

## Overview
TBC1D1 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 1, which functions as a Rab GTPase-activating protein (Rab-GAP). This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells by modulating the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell surface, a process crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Hook2020TBC1D1; Peck2009Insulinstimulated). TBC1D1 is involved in both insulin- and exercise-stimulated glucose uptake, acting as a convergence point between these signaling pathways (Hatakeyama2019Cooperative). The protein's interactions with various signaling molecules and its regulation by phosphorylation highlight its importance in cellular processes related to glucose and lipid metabolism. Mutations and altered expression of TBC1D1 have been linked to metabolic disorders and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Roach2007Substrate; Song2024Novel).

## Structure


## Function
The TBC1D1 gene encodes a Rab GTPase-activating protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells. It is primarily involved in the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell surface in response to insulin stimulation, a process essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Hook2020TBC1D1; Peck2009Insulinstimulated). TBC1D1 functions by maintaining Rab proteins in an inactive GDP-bound state under basal conditions, thereby acting as a brake on GLUT4 translocation. Upon insulin stimulation, TBC1D1 is phosphorylated by Akt, which suppresses its GAP activity, allowing Rab proteins to transition to their active GTP state. This transition facilitates the docking and fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane, increasing glucose uptake (Peck2009Insulinstimulated; Sakamoto2008Emerging).

TBC1D1 also interacts with various proteins involved in GLUT4 trafficking, such as VPS13A and VPS13C, through its phosphotyrosine binding domains, linking signaling with trafficking steps to facilitate glucose uptake (Hook2020TBC1D1). The protein is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and is involved in both insulin- and exercise-stimulated glucose uptake, acting as a convergence point between these signaling pathways (Hatakeyama2019Cooperative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TBC1D1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. High expression of TBC1D1 is associated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance in gliomas, particularly in the context of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. This overexpression correlates with unfavorable outcomes and reduced therapy efficacy in glioma patients, and is linked to a higher frequency of IDH1 gene mutations (Song2024Novel). TBC1D1 is also involved in immunotherapy resistance in gliomas, where its high expression in M2-like macrophages within the tumor microenvironment is associated with immunosuppressive functions, increased macrophage infiltration, and decreased T cell infiltration, contributing to an immunosuppressive environment that promotes tumor progression (Song2024Novel).

In metabolic disorders, a specific mutation in TBC1D1, where arginine 125 is replaced by tryptophan (R125W), has been linked to obesity susceptibility. This mutation affects the protein's role in GLUT4 translocation, a process critical for glucose uptake, although it does not affect the protein's stability (Roach2007Substrate; Peck2009Insulinstimulated). Additionally, genetic variations in TBC1D1, such as the SNP rs2279028, are associated with the risk of lean non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), potentially through mechanisms involving high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (Wu2023Genetic).

## Interactions
TBC1D1 is a Rab-GTPase-Activating Protein (Rab-GAP) that interacts with various proteins to regulate glucose transporter translocation, particularly GLUT4, in muscle cells. It binds with 14-3-3 proteins at specific phosphorylated sites, such as Thr596 and Ser237, which are crucial for its function in response to different stimuli like IGF1 and AMPK activation (Chen2007Complementary). TBC1D1 also interacts with VPS13A and VPS13C, which are involved in maintaining GLUT4 homeostasis in C2C12 myotubes. These interactions are mediated through TBC1D1's phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains and are not significantly affected by AMPK activation (Hook2020TBC1D1).

In addition to its role in glucose metabolism, TBC1D1 interacts with PPARγ, influencing its protein stability and function. This interaction is part of the AMPK-TBC1D1 axis, which regulates lipid storage gene expression and triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes (Chen2022Rab2A). TBC1D1's interactions with these proteins highlight its multifaceted role in cellular processes related to glucose and lipid metabolism.
