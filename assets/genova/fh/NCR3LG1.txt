# NCR3LG1

## Overview
NCR3LG1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as natural killer cell cytotoxicity receptor 3 ligand 1, or B7-H6. This protein is a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the B7 family, characterized by its role in immune regulation. B7-H6 serves as a ligand for the NKp30 receptor on natural killer (NK) cells, playing a pivotal role in the immune system by activating NK cells to target and eliminate infected or cancerous cells (Matta2013Induction; GutierrezFranco2018Characterization). The protein is typically expressed on the surface of stressed or transformed cells, and its expression can be induced under inflammatory conditions. B7-H6 is also present in soluble forms during pregnancy, suggesting a role in maternal-fetal immunoprotection (GutierrezFranco2018Characterization). The gene's expression and its protein product's interactions are significant in the context of cancer and autoimmune diseases, making NCR3LG1 a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Sheffer2021Genomescale; Dufva2022Singlecell).

## Structure
NCR3LG1, also known as B7-H6, is a type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the B7 family. The primary structure of NCR3LG1 includes a signal peptide, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular region is characterized by two immunoglobulin-like domains, which are common features in proteins involved in immune regulation (West2019Considering). These domains are likely to adopt the immunoglobulin fold, a structure stabilized by anti-parallel beta strands forming a hydrophobic core and a disulfide bond, typical of the IgV domain involved in receptor and counter-receptor binding (West2019Considering).

The protein's tertiary structure is not explicitly detailed in the available context, but the presence of immunoglobulin-like domains suggests a compact, globular conformation typical of such proteins. Post-translational modifications of NCR3LG1 may include glycosylation, which is common in transmembrane proteins and can affect protein folding, stability, and interactions (Iona2024Proteogenomic). The context does not provide specific information on quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms of NCR3LG1.

## Function
NCR3LG1, also known as B7-H6, is a ligand for the natural killer (NK) cell activating receptor NKp30. This protein plays a significant role in the immune response by activating NK cells, which are crucial for identifying and eliminating infected or cancerous cells. B7-H6 is typically expressed on the surface of stressed or transformed cells, facilitating immune surveillance and contributing to the body's defense mechanisms (GutierrezFranco2018Characterization).

During normal human pregnancy, B7-H6 is present in two soluble isoforms, approximately 37 kDa and 30 kDa, which are released into the serum through exosome-dependent and independent mechanisms. These isoforms are consistently found throughout pregnancy, with the heavier isoform being more prevalent (GutierrezFranco2018Characterization). The presence of these isoforms suggests a role in maternal-fetal immunoprotection, potentially impacting NK cell function via the NKp30 receptor and affecting immune tolerance during pregnancy (GutierrezFranco2018Characterization).

The molecular weight differences between the isoforms are attributed to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, with the light isoform containing significant N-glycans (GutierrezFranco2018Characterization). This glycosylation may influence the protein's activity and interactions within the immune system.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NCR3LG1 gene, also known as B7-H6, have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and autoimmune diseases. In cancer, NCR3LG1 is frequently upregulated in tumor cells, enhancing their sensitivity to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity. High expression levels of NCR3LG1 are associated with increased NK cell sensitivity in various cancers, including myeloid leukemias and B-cell lymphomas (Dufva2022Singlecell). This upregulation can make tumors more susceptible to NK cell-based immunotherapies, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sheffer2021Genomescale).

In autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), genetic variants of NCR3LG1 have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. A frameshift indel variant of NCR3LG1 was identified in RA patients, suggesting a role in inflammation associated with the disease (Li2017Identification). This variant may contribute to the autoimmune response by affecting the interaction between NK cells and their targets, highlighting the gene's involvement in both cancer and autoimmune conditions. The expression and genetic alterations of NCR3LG1 thus play a crucial role in modulating immune responses in various pathological contexts.

## Interactions
The NCR3LG1 gene encodes the B7-H6 protein, which is a ligand for the NKp30 receptor on natural killer (NK) cells. This interaction is crucial for the activation of NK cells, enabling them to recognize and destroy tumor cells. B7-H6 is typically expressed on tumor cells and is absent from normal tissues, making it a target for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Matta2013Induction; Kaifu2011B7H6NKp30). 

B7-H6 can also be induced in non-transformed cells under inflammatory conditions, where it is expressed on proinflammatory monocytes and neutrophils. This expression is stimulated by Toll-like receptor ligands and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1b and tumor necrosis factor a (Matta2013Induction). 

In addition to its membrane-bound form, a soluble form of B7-H6 (sB7-H6) is produced, which can impair NK cell activation by interacting with NKp30. This soluble form is associated with exosomes and is found in the sera of patients with conditions like sepsis (Matta2013Induction). 

B7-H6 does not interact with the CTLA4 receptor, indicating a specific interaction with NKp30 (Bjørnsen2018B7H6). The interaction between B7-H6 and NKp30 is conserved across various species, including humans, rats, and cattle (Bjørnsen2018B7H6).
