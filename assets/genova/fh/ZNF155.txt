# ZNF155

## Overview
ZNF155 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 155, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function. The protein encoded by ZNF155 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription, and has been studied for its potential role in cancer biology. Alterations in the expression or mutation of ZNF155 have been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, such as breast and colorectal cancer, highlighting its significance in oncogenic pathways (Li2014Expression; Leary2008Integrated). Further research is necessary to fully understand the diverse roles of ZNF155 in cellular physiology and its implications in disease.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF155 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer. A study identified ZNF155 as associated with breast cancer risk loci, suggesting a potential link between alterations in ZNF155 expression and breast cancer. This association was supported by a significant P-value of 0.00342 and an FDR of 0.0731, indicating that changes in ZNF155 expression may contribute to breast cancer pathogenesis (Li2014Expression).

In the context of colorectal cancer, ZNF155 has been noted for having one homozygous deletion and one point mutation, with a probability of 0.01, suggesting its involvement in cancer development (Leary2008Integrated). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from ZNF155 mutations or expression alterations beyond its mention in cancer research are not detailed in the provided context.

The role of ZNF155 in other conditions, such as neurological disorders, is not covered in the available context. The focus remains on its potential involvement in cancer, particularly through genetic alterations that may disrupt normal cellular processes and contribute to disease pathogenesis. Further research is needed to elucidate the full clinical significance of ZNF155 mutations and expression changes.
