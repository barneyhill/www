# PSMD9

## Overview
PSMD9 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 9, a crucial component of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome complex. This protein functions as a proteasomal chaperone, playing a significant role in the assembly and regulation of the proteasome, which is essential for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and maintenance of cellular protein homeostasis. The PSMD9 protein contains a PDZ domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, particularly with C-terminal residues of target proteins, influencing various cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation and mRNA processing (Ud2021PSMD9; Sangith2014Discovery). PSMD9 is highly conserved across species, underscoring its structural and functional importance (Zhang2024The). It is involved in maintaining nucleolar architecture and has been implicated in several diseases, including type 2 diabetes and various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Su2024PSMD9; Hao2015T2D).

## Structure
PSMD9, also known as proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 9, is a component of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome complex. The protein is composed of 212 amino acids and includes a PDZ domain, which is located between amino acids 106-185 (Zhang2024The). This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly recognizing and binding to C-terminal residues of target proteins (Sangith2014Discovery). The PDZ domain's flexibility allows it to accommodate various peptide ligands, and specific mutations in this domain can affect its binding capabilities (Sangith2014Discovery).

The PSMD9 protein is highly conserved across different species, indicating its structural importance (Zhang2024The). It plays a crucial role in maintaining nucleolar architecture by interacting with ribosomal proteins, which is essential for the structural integrity of the nucleolus (Ud2021PSMD9). PSMD9 is also involved in the assembly of the 19S regulatory subunit, facilitating the correct positioning of subunits to prevent non-productive complexes (Venkatraman2016Assembly). The protein's interactions and functions are regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity within the proteasome complex.

## Function
PSMD9, also known as proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 9, is a proteasomal chaperone involved in the assembly of the 19S regulatory subunit, which is essential for forming the active 26S proteasome. This complex is crucial for the regulated degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating various signaling pathways (Venkatraman2016Assembly; Sangith2014Discovery).

PSMD9 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the removal of damaged or misfolded proteins and the regulation of transcription factors. It interacts with multiple ribosomal proteins, including RPL24 and RPS14, suggesting a role in ribosomal assembly and function, as well as maintaining nucleolar architecture (Ud2021PSMD9). The protein also plays a role in trafficking ribosomal proteins into the nucleolus, which is important for protecting cells from nucleolar stress and ensuring normal cell cycle progression (Ud2021PSMD9).

PSMD9's PDZ domain facilitates interactions with various proteins, influencing processes such as transcriptional regulation, mRNA processing, and protein translation (Sangith2014Discovery).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PSMD9 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PSMD9, such as rs74421874, rs3825172, and rs14259, are associated with T2D and its complications, including macrovascular pathology like coronary artery disease and stroke (Gragnoli2011Proteasomea; Hao2015T2D). These SNPs are also linked to psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, and conditions like insomnia, which is a risk factor for T2D (Hao2015T2D).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PSMD9 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes tumor progression by enhancing EGFR signaling, which contributes to cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Su2024PSMD9). Knockdown of PSMD9 in HCC cells leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Su2024PSMD9).

In cervical cancer, PSMD9 overexpression correlates with increased recurrence after radiotherapy, indicating its potential role as a tumor marker and predictor of radiation sensitivity (Köster2020PSMD9). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PSMD9 in various diseases through its involvement in inflammatory and signaling pathways.

## Interactions
PSMD9, a proteasomal chaperone, is involved in various protein interactions primarily through its PDZ domain. It interacts with C-terminal peptides from the human proteome, with specific peptides such as SCGF showing high affinity for PSMD9. Full-length proteins like hnRNPA1, GH, and E12 have been confirmed to interact with PSMD9, highlighting the importance of C-terminal residues in these interactions (Sangith2014Discovery). PSMD9 also interacts with the S14 ribosomal protein and the IL-6 receptor, as demonstrated through in vitro pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells (Sangith2014Discovery).

PSMD9 plays a role in the degradation process of certain proteins by the proteasome, such as recruiting IκBα for degradation and potentially influencing p53 stability through interactions with S14 and MDM2 (Sangith2014Discovery). It is also involved in mRNA nuclear export and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay through its interaction with UPF2 (Sangith2014Discovery).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, PSMD9 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, inhibiting its expression and reducing EGFR ubiquitination. This interaction stabilizes EGFR, enhancing its signaling and promoting malignant progression (Su2024PSMD9). PSMD9's interaction with ribosomal proteins is crucial for maintaining nucleolar architecture and regulating p53 levels, particularly under stress conditions (Ud2021PSMD9).
