# SEPHS2

## Overview
SEPHS2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme selenophosphate synthetase 2, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of selenoproteins. These proteins are integral to various cellular processes, including antioxidant defense and redox regulation. The SEPHS2 gene is responsible for the production of selenophosphate synthetase 2, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of selenide and ATP into selenophosphate, a critical selenium donor for selenocysteine synthesis (Minich2022Selenium; FradejasVillar2018Consequences). As a selenoprotein itself, selenophosphate synthetase 2 is involved in a feedback mechanism that may regulate its own biosynthesis and that of other selenoproteins (FradejasVillar2018Consequences). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Nunziata2019Structural).

## Structure
The SEPHS2 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes distinct domains and secondary structural elements. The primary structure of SEPHS2, identified by UniProt code Q99611, consists of a specific amino acid composition, including 27 prolines and 48 glycines, with a balance of charged residues (Nunziata2019Structural). The secondary structure of SEPHS2 is predicted to contain 15 α-helices and 12 β-strands, with disordered regions particularly at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends (Nunziata2019Structural). 

The tertiary structure of SEPHS2 has been modeled to reveal an N-terminal domain with an α-helix and a long disordered loop, a central core with an α-β 2-layer sandwich architecture, and a disordered C-terminal domain (Nunziata2019Structural). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the protein exhibits greater compactness and stability at acidic pH, a condition relevant to cancer tissues (Nunziata2019Structural). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, sulfation, and glycosylation are noted, which may influence the protein's conformation and function (Nunziata2019Structural). The structural analysis also highlights the presence of key residues that contribute to the protein's stability and function, particularly under varying pH conditions (Nunziata2019Structural).

## Function
Selenophosphate synthetase 2 (SEPHS2) is a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of selenoproteins, which incorporate the amino acid selenocysteine. This process is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance and proper function of selenoproteins, which play roles in antioxidant defense and redox regulation. SEPHS2 catalyzes the conversion of selenide and ATP into selenophosphate, a selenium donor necessary for the synthesis of selenocysteine (Minich2022Selenium; FradejasVillar2018Consequences). 

The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the multi-stage process of selenoprotein biosynthesis. This includes the synthesis of selenocysteine directly on a specific tRNA, tRNA (Ser)Sec, and the conversion of phosphoseryl tRNA (Ser)Sec into Sec tRNA (Ser)Sec, which is then used in the translation of selenoprotein mRNA (Minich2022Selenium). SEPHS2 itself is a selenoprotein, suggesting it may have a regulatory role in its own biosynthesis and that of other selenoproteins (FradejasVillar2018Consequences).

In healthy human cells, SEPHS2 is essential for the synthesis of selenoproteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including protection against oxidative stress and regulation of redox homeostasis (Nunziata2019Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SEPHS2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SEPHS2 is overexpressed, correlating with tumor aggressiveness and higher malignant grades. This overexpression suggests that SEPHS2 could serve as a prognostic marker or therapeutic target for TNBC, as higher levels are associated with poor overall survival in patients (Nunziata2019Structural).

Conversely, SEPHS2 expression is decreased in gastric cancer and BRCA1-linked breast cancer, indicating its varied role in different cancer types (Nunziata2019Structural). Mutations in SEPHS2 can lead to a multisystem selenoprotein deficiency disorder, characterized by muscle involvement similar to rigid spine muscular dystrophy, increased oxidative stress, and impaired immune function. These mutations result in reduced expression of antioxidant selenoenzymes, leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage (Schoenmakers2010Mutations).

The regulation of SEPHS2 by miR-185 in response to selenium availability also highlights its role in cellular processes. In selenium-deficient conditions, miR-185 levels decrease, leading to increased SEPHS2 expression, which may impact oxidative stress and mitochondrial function (Maciel‐Dominguez2013Selenium).

## Interactions
SEPHS2, or selenophosphate synthetase 2, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the selenocysteine biosynthesis pathway. In humans, SEPHS2 interacts with selenocysteine synthase (SepSecS) and SEPHS1, which are crucial for selenoprotein metabolism (Nunziata2019Structural). These interactions are important for the synthesis of selenophosphate, a precursor for selenocysteine incorporation into selenoproteins.

In Trypanosoma brucei, SEPHS2 forms a binary hetero-complex with selenocysteine lyase (TbSCLY), as confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). This interaction involves the N-terminal region of SEPHS2 and is similar to interactions observed in E. coli (da2020Trypanosomatid). Despite this interaction, SEPHS2 and SCLY do not co-purify with higher-order complexes of the selenocysteine pathway, suggesting that their interaction may occur independently of other pathway components (da2020Trypanosomatid).

SEPHS2 is also involved in the oxidative stress response and ER stress protection in T. brucei, interacting with selenocysteine lyase and selenocysteine synthase to protect cells from selenium toxicity through direct inter-enzyme product/substrate transfer (da2020Trypanosomatid). These interactions highlight the role of SEPHS2 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress responses.
