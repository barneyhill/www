# WWC1

## Overview
The WWC1 gene encodes the protein WW and C2 domain containing 1, commonly referred to as KIBRA, which is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. KIBRA is characterized by its structural domains, including WW domains and a C2-like domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and phospholipid binding (Höffken2021WWC). As a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, KIBRA regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue growth by interacting with large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2) and influencing the activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP) (Wang2019Low). Predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in memory-related regions, KIBRA is implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory formation, interacting with proteins such as dendrin and protein kinase C zeta (PKC-ζ) (Papassotiropoulos2006Common; Corneveaux2010Evidence). The protein's involvement in both cognitive functions and cellular regulation underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on cancer progression when dysregulated (Höffken2021WWC).

## Structure
The WWC1 protein, also known as KIBRA, is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes several distinct domains. It contains two amino-terminal WW domains, a C2-like domain, coiled-coil domains, an atypical protein kinase C-binding motif, and a PDZ-binding motif (Höffken2021WWC). The WW domains are small globular structures that mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich sequences, specifically recognizing the PPxY motif (Kremerskothen2003Characterization). These domains are approximately 35 to 40 amino acids long and contain two conserved tryptophan residues, crucial for domain stability and ligand binding (Kremerskothen2003Characterization; Kwok2019Intrinsic).

The C2-like domain is involved in phospholipid binding, aiding in the localization of the protein to specific membrane structures and cellular vesicles (Höffken2021WWC). Unique to WWC1 is a poly glutamic acid stretch, although its function remains unknown (Höffken2021WWC). The WWC1 protein can form homo- and heterodimeric complexes, providing a platform for large multiprotein assemblies (Höffken2021WWC). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at specific serine and threonine residues, regulate its activity in cell migration and proliferation (Höffken2021WWC). The WW2 domain of KIBRA is atypical, with an isoleucine substitution leading to a primarily disordered structure, although it can adopt a canonical structure when bound to specific peptides (Kwok2019Intrinsic).

## Function
The WWC1 gene, also known as KIBRA, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in several cellular processes, particularly in the brain. It is predominantly expressed in memory-related brain structures such as the hippocampus and temporal lobe, where it is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Papassotiropoulos2006Common; Piras2017Whole). KIBRA interacts with proteins like dendrin and protein kinase C zeta (PKC-ζ), which are crucial for memory formation and long-term potentiation, suggesting its involvement in synaptic neurotransmission and neuronal plasticity (Porter2018KIBRA; Corneveaux2010Evidence).

In addition to its role in the brain, WWC1 is involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue growth. It interacts with large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2) to control the activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP), thereby influencing cell size and proliferation (Zhang2017WWC2; Wang2019Low). This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumor progression in healthy cells (Wang2019Low). The protein's activity in these pathways underscores its importance in both cognitive functions and cellular regulation.

## Clinical Significance
The WWC1 gene, also known as KIBRA, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), low expression of WWC1 is linked to poor prognosis, with the gene locus often deleted (Höffken2021WWC). In colorectal cancer, a fusion gene involving WWC1, such as FAM174A-WWC1, increases oncogenic capacity and metastasis (Kim2019Identification). In melanoma, WWC1 mutations are associated with tumor heterogeneity and progression, particularly in Lentigo malignant melanoma (Kamer2022In).

WWC1 expression is epigenetically silenced in renal cancer and correlates with increased invasiveness in gastric cancer (Höffken2021WWC). In osteosarcoma, WWC1 is inhibited by Sox2, enhancing YAP activity and promoting tumorigenesis (Höffken2021WWC). In hematopoietic cancers like acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), WWC1 is often methylated, leading to low expression and poor outcomes (Höffken2021WWC). In lung adenocarcinoma, elevated levels of microRNA-21 inhibit WWC1 synthesis, contributing to tumor progression (Höffken2021WWC). These alterations in WWC1 expression and interactions highlight its critical role in cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
WWC1, also known as KIBRA, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with LATS1/2 kinases, enhancing their phosphorylation and activity, which leads to increased phosphorylation of YAP, preventing its nuclear entry and reducing the transcription of pro-proliferative genes (Höffken2021WWC; Wang2014Defining). WWC1 also forms complexes with angiomotin (AMOT) proteins and PTPN14, which are known regulators of YAP1, indicating its role in the Hippo signaling pathway (Wang2014Defining).

In breast cancer, WWC1 interacts with discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) to form a trimeric complex that suppresses MAPK/ERK signaling, crucial for controlling cell proliferation (Höffken2021WWC). The interaction with DDR1 is significant, as its phosphorylation can lead to the dissociation of this complex, enhancing MAPK/ERK signaling and promoting tumor formation (Höffken2021WWC).

WWC1 also interacts with CIT, a rho-interacting serine/threonine kinase, through its WW domains. This interaction is essential for regulating the Hippo pathway, as CIT can suppress the activation of the pathway by competing with LATS1/2 for binding to WWC1 (Wang2014Defining). These interactions highlight WWC1's role as a signal integrator in the Hippo pathway, influencing cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
