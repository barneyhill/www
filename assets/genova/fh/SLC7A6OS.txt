# SLC7A6OS

## Overview
The SLC7A6OS gene encodes a protein known as solute carrier family 7 member 6 opposite strand (SLC7A6OS), which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the context of the R2TP/PFDL complex and the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). This protein is implicated in the recycling of the U5 snRNP, a critical component of the spliceosome, rather than its initial assembly, highlighting its role in RNA processing (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). The SLC7A6OS gene is expressed in the central nervous system during development, as evidenced by studies in zebrafish, where it is essential for the expression of key CNS markers (Benini2015slc7a6os). Clinically, alterations in the SLC7A6OS gene have been associated with several disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, suggesting its involvement in both neurological and psychiatric conditions (Erady2021Novel; Zhu2020Shared). Additionally, the gene has been identified as a candidate in the study of Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, although its specific role remains to be fully elucidated (Conroy2014Towards).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC7A6OS gene have been implicated in several disorders. In the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and depressive disorder (DD), the SLC7A6OS gene was identified with a significant single nucleotide variant (SNV), rs8063446, associated with IBS in Chinese patients. This suggests a potential role in the pathophysiology of IBS, possibly through mechanisms involving calcium ion binding and extracellular matrix structural constituents (Zhu2020Shared).

The SLC7A6OS gene is also associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). It is linked to an SCZ-associated locus and a BD-associated SNP locus, indicating that disruptions in its function could contribute to these conditions. The gene's association with both SCZ and BD suggests a genetic commonality that may explain phenotypic similarities between the disorders (Erady2021Novel).

In the study of Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS), SLC7A6OS was identified as a prioritized candidate gene, although the specific clinical implications in LKS remain unclear (Conroy2014Towards). Additionally, there is partial evidence suggesting that SLC7A6OS may be targeted to mitochondria, potentially influencing mitochondrial gene expression (Ali2019Nuclear).

## Interactions
The SLC7A6OS protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the context of the R2TP/PFDL complex and the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). SLC7A6OS is more tightly associated with the U5 snRNP than with nuclear RNA polymerases, which is notable given its orthologous relationship to yeast Iwr1, a known import factor for RNA polymerases (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). The interaction of SLC7A6OS with the U5 snRNP suggests a role in the recycling of this ribonucleoprotein complex rather than its de novo biogenesis. This interaction network includes other proteins such as ZNHIT2, which may act as a bridging factor between the R2TP/PFDL complex and the U5 snRNP (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike).

In zebrafish, the SLC7A6OS gene is expressed throughout development, particularly in the central nervous system, and is crucial for proper CNS development. Knockdown experiments in zebrafish have shown that SLC7A6OS is essential for the expression of CNS markers such as pax2a and neurod, indicating its role in regulating key gene expressions in the CNS (Benini2015slc7a6os).
