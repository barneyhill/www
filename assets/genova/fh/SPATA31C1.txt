# SPATA31C1

## Overview
SPATA31C1 is a gene that encodes the protein SPATA31 subfamily C member 1, which is part of a family of proteins involved in various cellular processes. Although the specific functional category of the SPATA31 subfamily C member 1 protein is not well-defined, it is implicated in pathways related to UV response and DNA repair, which are crucial in maintaining genomic stability and preventing carcinogenesis (Carron2021Pseudogene). The gene is notably recognized as a pseudogene, which means it is a non-functional segment of DNA that resembles a gene but has lost its protein-coding ability or is otherwise inactive in the genome (Carron2021Pseudogene). Despite its classification as a pseudogene, SPATA31C1 has been associated with cancer-related processes, particularly in head and neck cancer, where it is considered a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Carron2021Pseudogene). Further research is required to elucidate the precise biological roles and clinical implications of SPATA31C1 in various disease contexts.

## Clinical Significance
SPATA31C1 has been implicated in head and neck cancer (HNC) as one of the most deregulated pseudogenes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Its expression is associated with patient survival, indicating a possible prognostic value in HNC (Carron2021Pseudogene). The gene is involved in pathways related to UV response and DNA repair, which are critical in cancer biology (Carron2021Pseudogene). However, specific clinical outcomes or diseases directly linked to SPATA31C1 mutations are not detailed in the available literature (Carron2021Pseudogene).

In colorectal cancer, SPATA31C1 is identified as an upregulated gene in patients with unfavorable prognosis, although it is noted as unrelated to cancer in this context (Mini2019RNA). In nonsmall-cell lung cancer, SPATA31C1 is mentioned in gene expression studies, but its clinical significance or association with specific diseases is not elaborated (Li2019Penalized).

Overall, while SPATA31C1 is associated with cancer-related processes, the direct clinical implications of its mutations or expression alterations remain underexplored, necessitating further research to clarify its role in disease contexts.
