# C21orf91

## Overview
C21orf91, also known as EURL, is a gene located on human chromosome 21 that encodes the protein chromosome 21 open reading frame 91. This protein is involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of neurogenesis and brain development. It plays a significant role in modulating β-catenin signaling, which is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. The protein interacts with other cellular components, such as the coiled-coil domain-containing protein CCDC85B, to influence these pathways. Additionally, C21orf91 is expressed in oligodendroglial cells, implicating it in oligodendrogenesis and myelination processes. Beyond its role in normal brain function, C21orf91 is also associated with pathological conditions, including Down syndrome and certain cancers, where its expression and interactions contribute to disease phenotypes (Li2016The; Reiche2021C21orf91; Polubothu2021Inherited).

## Function
C21orf91, also known as EURL, is a gene located on chromosome 21 that plays a significant role in neurogenesis and brain development. In healthy human cells, C21orf91 is highly expressed in various brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, where it is involved in the regulation of neuroprogenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. The gene modulates β-catenin signaling, a crucial pathway for cell proliferation and neurogenesis, by interacting with the coiled-coil domain-containing protein CCDC85B. This interaction influences β-catenin levels, which are essential for the development of cortical projection neurons and the proper positioning and dendritic spine densities of these neurons (Li2016The).

C21orf91 is also expressed in oligodendroglial cells, such as cortical myelinating oligodendrocytes and hippocampal astrocytes, and is associated with genes involved in oligodendrogenesis and myelination. This suggests a role in the development and function of oligodendrocytes and the myelination process in the human brain (Reiche2021C21orf91). The gene's expression pattern, which changes throughout development, indicates its critical involvement in both neurogenesis and myelination, processes essential for normal brain function and development (Li2016The).

## Clinical Significance
The C21orf91 gene, also known as EURL, is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression or interactions. In Down syndrome, which results from trisomy 21, C21orf91 is overexpressed, contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disabilities. This overexpression affects oligodendroglial differentiation and myelination, leading to hypomyelination and cognitive deficits. The gene's dysregulation may also cause a shift towards astrocytic lineage, contributing to the imbalance of glial cell populations in Down syndrome brains (Li2016The; Reiche2021C21orf91).

C21orf91 is also involved in melanoma, where its expression is increased due to the overexpression of PPP2R3B. This leads to a pro-proliferative phenotype in melanoma cells, independent of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). The gene acts as a hub controlling pigment cell phenotype switching and is critical for melanoma cell proliferation. Knockdown of C21orf91 can reverse the increased proliferation and decreased migration associated with PPP2R3B expression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in melanoma (Polubothu2021Inherited).

These findings underscore the significance of C21orf91 in both neurodevelopmental and oncological contexts, suggesting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in related conditions.

## Interactions
C21orf91, also known as EURL, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the coiled-coil domain-containing protein CCDC85B, which is important for modulating β-catenin signaling. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that while CCDC85B reduces β-catenin levels, C21orf91 increases them, suggesting a regulatory role in β-catenin signaling pathways (Li2016The).

In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), C21orf91 is co-regulated by the long non-coding RNA Lnc-BTG3-7:1 and the transcription factor JUND. This regulation occurs through a cis-acting SE-lncRNA mechanism, with Lnc-BTG3-7:1 and JUND co-localizing in the nucleus to influence C21orf91 transcription. This interaction affects downstream signaling pathways, including the GRB2-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and GRB2-PI3K-AKT-GSK3β-β-catenin pathways, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival (Dan2021Long).

C21orf91 is also implicated in melanoma, where it is part of a pro-proliferative anti-invasive transcriptomic signature. It acts as a hub in protein networks around the Ras-MAPK/PI3K pathways, influencing cell phenotype determination and proliferation (Polubothu2021Inherited).
