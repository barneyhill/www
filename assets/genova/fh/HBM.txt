# HBM

## Overview
The HBM gene encodes the hemoglobin subunit mu, a protein that is part of the hemoglobin family, which plays a crucial role in oxygen transport in the blood. Hemoglobin subunit mu is categorized as a globin protein, which is a type of protein involved in binding and transporting oxygen molecules. This gene is expressed in specific tissues and contributes to the overall function of hemoglobin in maintaining oxygen homeostasis within the body. The study of HBM and its encoded protein is significant for understanding various physiological processes and potential implications in clinical conditions related to hemoglobin function.
