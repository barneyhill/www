# PLS1

## Overview
The PLS1 gene encodes plastin 1, an actin-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural organization of cellular components such as microvilli and stereocilia. Plastin 1 is categorized as an actin-bundling protein, characterized by its ability to stabilize and organize actin filaments within the cytoskeleton. It is predominantly expressed in the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells and the brush border microvilli of the intestinal epithelium, where it contributes to cellular stability and integrity (GrimmGünter2009Plastin; Morgan2019Mutations). The protein's function is regulated by calcium ions, which modulate its actin-bundling activity through its EF-hand motifs (Schwebach2017The). Mutations in the PLS1 gene have been associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance in auditory function (Morgan2019Mutations).

## Structure
Plastin 1 (PLS1) is an actin-binding protein encoded by the PLS1 gene, primarily expressed in the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells. The protein consists of 629 amino acids and includes two calponin-homology (CH) domains, CH1 and CH2, which are crucial for actin binding (Morgan2019Mutations). These CH domains form a tightly packed actin-binding domain (ABD) through polar and apolar interactions, with a salt bridge between E269 and K235 ensuring strong electrostatic interaction, contributing to the stability of the ABD (Morgan2019Mutations).

PLS1 also features an N-terminal Ca2+-binding regulatory headpiece domain, which includes two EF-hand motifs known for their calcium-binding capacities. These motifs play a role in the calcium-dependent regulation of actin filament bundling (Schwebach2017The). The protein's structure is unique, with two tandem actin-binding domains, ABD1 and ABD2, each consisting of two calponin-homology domains (Schwebach2017The). The bundling of actin filaments by PLS1 is negatively regulated by calcium ions, with the EF-hands binding to a sequence homologous to calmodulin-binding peptides (Schwebach2017The). The complete three-dimensional structure of PLS1 is currently unknown (Morgan2019Mutations).

## Function
Plastin 1 (PLS1) is an actin-bundling protein that plays a critical role in the structural organization and stability of the brush border microvilli in the intestinal epithelium. It is particularly enriched in the terminal web, where it interacts with keratin 19, linking the actin cytoskeleton to the keratin network. This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the intestinal epithelium (GrimmGünter2009Plastin).

In PLS1-deficient mice, microvilli are shorter and lack proper rootlets, leading to increased fragility of the epithelial cells. This deficiency results in significant alterations in the terminal web, with reduced amounts of stabilizing components such as myosin II, spectrin, and tropomyosin, which are crucial for the stability and interconnection of actin rootlets (GrimmGünter2009Plastin).

PLS1 is also involved in maintaining intestinal epithelial stability, as its absence increases sensitivity to colitis and results in higher epithelial turnover rates, suggesting a compensatory response to increased fragility (GrimmGünter2009Plastin). Despite these structural roles, PLS1 deficiency does not lead to overt physiological defects, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms (GrimmGünter2009Plastin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLS1 gene, which encodes the protein fimbrin, have been linked to autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). This condition is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss that is stable across different frequencies and does not progress over time. The study identified specific missense mutations in the PLS1 gene, such as c.805G>A (p.E269K), c.713G>T (p.L238R), and c.383T>C (p.F128S), in affected individuals from three unrelated families. These mutations are believed to destabilize the actin-binding domain of fimbrin, impairing its ability to bind F-actin, which is crucial for the function of cochlear hair cells (Morgan2019Mutations).

The PLS1 gene was identified as a strong candidate for causing NSHL due to its low observed/expected missense ratio and low RVIS score, indicating high constraint. Protein-protein interaction analyses have shown that PLS1 is involved in a network enriched for actin binding, supporting its role in hearing loss (Morgan2019Mutations). The clinical significance of PLS1 mutations is underscored by studies in Pls1 -/- mice, which exhibit a hearing loss phenotype similar to that observed in human patients, further validating the gene's role in auditory function (Morgan2019Mutations).

## Interactions
PLS1 (plastin 1) is an actin-binding protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in cellular structures such as microvilli and stereocilia. It is involved in a network functionally enriched for actin binding and actin filament binding, as confirmed by protein-protein interaction analyses using STRING. This analysis revealed that PLS1 interacts with ten different proteins, which are involved in functional groups such as regulation of cellular component size, cytoskeletal protein binding, and structural constituent of the cytoskeleton (Morgan2019Mutations).

PLS1's interaction with actin filaments is regulated by calcium ions (Ca2+). The protein has two actin-binding domains (ABD1 and ABD2), with ABD1 being the primary site for actin binding, unaffected by Ca2+ concentrations. In contrast, ABD2's ability to bind actin filaments is reduced in the presence of Ca2+, which affects the overall actin-bundling ability of PLS1 (Schwebach2017The). This regulation is crucial for the protein's function in cellular structures like microvilli and stereocilia, where it acts as a major calcium-responsive element (Schwebach2017The).
