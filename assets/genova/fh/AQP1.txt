# AQP1

## Overview
Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is a gene that encodes the aquaporin 1 protein, a crucial component of the cellular machinery responsible for water transport across cell membranes. The AQP1 protein, also known as the Colton blood group antigen, is a transmembrane water channel that facilitates rapid and selective water movement, playing a vital role in maintaining water homeostasis in various tissues. Structurally, AQP1 forms a homotetramer, with each monomer containing a water-selective pore, characterized by conserved Asn-Pro-Ala motifs that ensure high specificity for water molecules (Murata2000Structural; Gonen2006The). Functionally, AQP1 is expressed in several tissues, including the kidneys, brain, and lungs, where it contributes to processes such as urine concentration, cerebrospinal fluid formation, and fluid management in the respiratory system (Mobasheri2004Expression; Benga2012The). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various pathological conditions, including renal diseases, cerebral edema, and certain cancers, where its expression levels and functional interactions can influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Magni2008AQP1; Smith2019Reduced).

## Structure
The AQP1 protein is a homotetramer, with each monomer consisting of six transmembrane alpha-helices arranged in a right-handed bundle. These helices form a central cavity that serves as the water-selective pore (Murata2000Structural; Gonen2006The). The monomers are organized in two tandem repeats, each containing three helices, connected by loops A to E. The N- and C-termini are located on the cytoplasmic side (Murata2000Structural; Gonen2006The).

The structure is characterized by two conserved Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs located in loops B and E, which are crucial for the protein's function as a water channel. These motifs form part of the pore and are involved in hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions that stabilize the loops (Murata2000Structural; Gonen2006The). The pore is lined with hydrophobic residues and has a narrowest diameter of approximately 3 Å, slightly larger than a water molecule, ensuring selectivity for water transport (Murata2000Structural; Gonen2006The).

The tetrameric structure is stabilized by interactions between helices and loops of adjacent monomers, forming coiled-coil interactions and a network of hydrogen bonds (Walz1997The; Murata2000Structural). The AQP1 protein is glycosylated at Asn42 on loop A, indicating its extracellular location (Gonen2006The).

## Function
Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is a water channel protein that plays a crucial role in facilitating the movement of water across cell membranes, maintaining water homeostasis in various tissues. AQP1 is a tetrameric protein, with each monomer containing a single aqueous pore that allows water to pass through the cell membrane. This structure is highly specific, allowing for a high flux of water while preventing the passage of protons and other charged molecules (Agre2006The; Heymann1998Progress).

In the kidneys, AQP1 is abundantly expressed in the apical and basolateral membranes of renal proximal tubules and descending thin limbs, where it plays a key role in the counter-current multiplication system, essential for urine concentration and water reabsorption (Mobasheri2004Expression; Benga2012The). AQP1 is also involved in cerebrospinal fluid formation in the brain and helps maintain corneal transparency and regulate intraocular pressure in the eye (Mobasheri2004Expression; Benga2012The).

AQP1's function extends to the respiratory system, where it is localized in the capillary endothelium of the lung, facilitating fluid management and contributing to processes like angiogenesis and endothelial permeability (Agre2006The; Benga2012The). Additionally, AQP1 is involved in water transport in the liver, contributing to bile secretion and microvascular resistance (Benga2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the AQP1 gene are implicated in various clinical conditions. In renal diseases, AQP1 expression is significantly increased in glomerular endothelium and tubules, which is thought to be an adaptive response to renal injury. AQP1-null individuals, who lack Co blood-group antigens due to a polymorphism in AQP1, exhibit impaired urinary-concentrating capacity, which can be clinically significant during conditions requiring maximal urinary concentration (Magni2008AQP1; Agre2003Aquaporin).

In the central nervous system, AQP1 is involved in brain water balance and is implicated in cerebral edema. Increased AQP1 levels are observed in conditions such as multiple sclerosis and cerebral infarction, suggesting its role in maintaining water homeostasis under pathological conditions (Magni2008AQP1).

AQP1 is also associated with various cancers. It is involved in tumor angiogenesis and cell migration, with altered expression observed in glioma, lung cancer, and colorectal carcinoma. In colorectal carcinoma, AQP1 expression is significantly reduced due to promoter hypermethylation, although levels increase with advanced disease stages and correlate with decreased overall survival (Magni2008AQP1; Smith2019Reduced).

In pulmonary conditions, AQP1 plays a role in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH). AQP1 deficiency in mice reduces pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular remodeling, indicating its involvement in the pathogenesis of HPH (Liu2019Aqp1).

## Interactions
Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in water transport and cellular processes. AQP1 interacts with the LIN-7 homolog (Lin7), ß-catenin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which are important for cytoskeleton rearrangement, cell adhesion, and migration. These interactions facilitate increased ion transport at the leading cell edge, leading to water entry through AQP1, cell swelling, and actin polymerization. Silencing AQP1 disrupts cytoskeleton organization and leads to the degradation of Lin7 and ß-catenin (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight).

AQP1 also interacts with Carbonic Anhydrase II (CAII) in the kidney, where CAII enhances water flux through AQP1. This interaction is mediated by acidic motifs in the cytosolic C-terminus of AQP1, which are homologous to known CAII binding sequences. The presence of CAII increases AQP1 activity, as demonstrated in experiments with coexpressed AQP1 and CAII in oocytes and HEK293 cells (Vilas2015Increased).

In Alzheimer's disease, AQP1 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), reducing amyloid-beta production by inhibiting the binding between ß-secretase (BACE1) and APP, which may influence brain water homeostasis and cell motility (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight).
