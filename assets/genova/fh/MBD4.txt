# MBD4

## Overview
MBD4 (methyl-CpG binding domain 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in DNA repair and epigenetic regulation. The protein, known as methyl-CpG binding domain 4, DNA glycosylase, is a member of the DNA glycosylase family and plays a pivotal role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. It is characterized by its ability to recognize and excise mismatched thymine and uracil bases that arise from the deamination of 5-methylcytosine and cytosine, particularly at CpG sites, thereby preventing C:G to T:A transition mutations that are prevalent in various cancers (Bellacosa2001Role; Petronzelli2000Biphasic). The protein comprises an N-terminal methyl-CpG binding domain and a C-terminal glycosylase domain, which facilitate its binding to methylated DNA and its enzymatic activity, respectively (Fatemi2006MBD; Sjolund2013MBD4). Beyond its role in DNA repair, MBD4 is also implicated in transcriptional regulation and apoptotic signaling, highlighting its multifaceted functions in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression (Kondo2005The; Sjolund2013MBD4).

## Structure
MBD4 is a DNA glycosylase that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and epigenetic regulation. The protein consists of two main domains: an N-terminal methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) and a C-terminal glycosylase domain. The MBD domain spans residues 82-147 and includes four anti-parallel beta-sheets that interact with the major groove of DNA, facilitating binding to methylated DNA (Sjolund2013MBD4). The glycosylase domain, part of the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) DNA glycosylase superfamily, contains ten alpha helices forming a cleft for DNA binding. This domain binds DNA via the minor groove and bends it at the damaged base, enabling a base flipping mechanism (Manvilla2012Crystal; Sjolund2013MBD4).

The MBD4 glycosylase domain is the smallest HhH enzyme structurally characterized to date and lacks an iron-sulfur cluster domain, distinguishing it from other HhH enzymes like MutY and MIG (Manvilla2012Crystal). MBD4 can undergo post-translational modifications, which may influence its substrate specificity and function (Sjolund2013MBD4). The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its interactions and functional roles in DNA repair processes (Walavalkar2014Solution).

## Function
MBD4 (methyl-CpG binding domain 4, DNA glycosylase) is a crucial component of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, primarily involved in maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA mismatches. It specifically targets and excises thymine and uracil bases that are mismatched with guanine, often arising from the deamination of 5-methylcytosine and cytosine at CpG sites (Bellacosa2001Role; Petronzelli2000Biphasic). This activity prevents C:G to T:A transition mutations, which are common in human cancers (Sjolund2013MBD4).

MBD4 contains an N-terminal methyl-CpG binding domain and a C-terminal glycosylase domain, allowing it to recognize methylated CpG dinucleotides and perform its enzymatic functions (Fatemi2006MBD; Sjolund2013MBD4). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other DNA repair proteins, such as MLH1, suggesting a role in both base excision repair and mismatch repair pathways (Bellacosa2001Role; Kondo2005The).

MBD4's function extends to transcriptional regulation, where it can repress transcription by binding to hypermethylated promoters, indicating a broader role in epigenetic silencing and gene regulation (Kondo2005The). Its activity is essential for preventing mutations and maintaining DNA integrity in healthy human cells (Zhu20005Methylcytosine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MBD4 gene are clinically significant due to their association with several diseases. Biallelic germline loss-of-function (LOF) variants in MBD4 are linked to a Mendelian recessive syndrome characterized by adenomatous colorectal polyposis and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This condition, termed MBD4-associated neoplasia syndrome (MANS), results from the accumulation of somatic mutations, particularly CpG>TpG transitions, due to the absence of functional MBD4 (Palles2021Germline). 

MBD4 mutations are also implicated in uveal melanoma (UM), with a significant predisposition observed in individuals carrying these mutations. The relative risk of UM is notably increased in those with MBD4 mutations, although there is no strong evidence of familial aggregation or early-onset UM (Derrien2020Germline). 

In MBD4-deficient tumors, a high mutation burden is observed, which is predictive of a response to immune checkpoint inhibitors like PD1 inhibitors. This has been demonstrated in cases of UM where patients with MBD4 mutations showed a dramatic response to pembrolizumab, a PD1 inhibitor (Rodrigues2018Outlier). 

Overall, MBD4 mutations contribute to genomic instability and increased mutability, which are critical factors in tumorigenesis (Millar2002Enhanced).

## Interactions
MBD4 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. It binds to the mismatch repair (MMR) protein MLH1, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. This interaction is part of a complex that includes other proteins like PMS2, and it is suggested that MBD4 stabilizes MLH1, coordinating base excision repair (BER) and MMR to rectify mismatches (Grigera2013Complex; Sjolund2013MBD4).

MBD4 also interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and Sin3A, forming a complex that represses transcription. This interaction is mediated through specific regions of MBD4 and is crucial for its role in transcriptional repression, particularly at hypermethylated promoters of genes such as p16 INK4a and hMLH1 (Kondo2005The).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, MBD4 is involved in apoptotic signaling through its interaction with the proapoptotic Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. These interactions suggest a role for MBD4 in regulating apoptosis induced by DNA damage and other stress signals (Sjolund2013MBD4).
