# ARHGEF10

## Overview
ARHGEF10 is a gene that encodes the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10, a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This protein is characterized by its involvement in the regulation of the RhoA signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including mitotic spindle formation, centrosome duplication, and vesicle trafficking (Aoki2009Regulation; Shibata2016ARHGEF10). The ARHGEF10 protein contains tandem Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which facilitate its role as a GEF by enhancing guanine nucleotide exchange on target GTPases (Aoki2009Regulation). Additionally, ARHGEF10 is implicated in the establishment of myelin sheaths in the peripheral nervous system, highlighting its significance in Schwann cell myelination (Shibata2016ARHGEF10). Mutations in the ARHGEF10 gene have been associated with neurological conditions such as slowed nerve conduction velocities and inherited polyneuropathy, underscoring its clinical relevance (Ekenstedt2014An; Verhoeven2003Slowed).

## Structure
The ARHGEF10 protein is a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and is characterized by the presence of tandem Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. The DH domain is catalytic and enhances guanine nucleotide exchange on the target GTPase, while the PH domain is thought to modulate protein conformation and subcellular localization (Aoki2009Regulation). ARHGEF10 also contains putative transmembrane domains, with two initially predicted and an additional one identified based on sequence similarity between human and mouse (Aoki2009Regulation).

The protein is involved in the regulation of mitotic spindle formation and centrosome duplication, acting through the RhoA signaling pathway. It localizes to the centrosome during the G1/S and M phases of the cell cycle (Aoki2009Regulation). ARHGEF10 interacts with the kinesin-like motor protein KIF3B, suggesting a role in modulating the ARHGEF10-RhoA pathway (Aoki2009Regulation).

In canine models, the ARHGEF10 gene produces two alternative transcripts that either include or exclude exon 9, resulting in a longer and shorter form of the protein (Ekenstedt2014An). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific folds, or post-translational modifications of ARHGEF10 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ARHGEF10 gene encodes a Dbl-type Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that primarily acts on the RhoA subfamily of GTPases, including RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC. This protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, such as the regulation of mitotic spindle formation and centrosome duplication during cell division. In HeLa cells, ARHGEF10 localizes to the centrosome during the G1/S and M phases of the cell cycle, and its knockdown leads to the formation of multipolar spindles, indicating its role in maintaining normal bipolar spindle structure (Aoki2009Regulation).

ARHGEF10 also plays a significant role in vesicle trafficking by directing the localization of Rab8 to Rab6-positive exocytotic vesicles. This process is essential for the transport of newly synthesized secreted or membrane proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating cell movement (Shibata2016ARHGEF10). The protein's involvement in these processes suggests its importance in cell shape regulation, membrane recycling, and polarized membrane transport (Shibata2016ARHGEF10). Additionally, ARHGEF10 is implicated in the establishment of myelin sheaths in the peripheral nervous system, which is essential for Schwann cell myelination (Shibata2016ARHGEF10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARHGEF10 gene have been linked to several neurological conditions. In humans, a mutation in ARHGEF10 is associated with slowed nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) without the typical clinical features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. This mutation, identified as Thr109Ile, results in thin myelination of peripheral nerves, suggesting a role in peripheral nerve myelination and neural connectivity (Verhoeven2003Slowed). 

In dogs, a deletion in the ARHGEF10 gene is associated with juvenile-onset inherited polyneuropathy (PN) in Leonberger and Saint Bernard breeds. This mutation leads to a loss of function, resulting in severe neurological symptoms such as laryngeal paralysis and muscle atrophy. The mutation is autosomal recessive and affects the gene's role in axon ensheathment and myelination (Ekenstedt2014An).

ARHGEF10 has also been implicated in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Specific single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the gene, such as rs9657362, have been associated with protection against CIPN, highlighting its potential role in susceptibility to toxic neuropathies (Beutler2014Sequencing). Additionally, polymorphisms in ARHGEF10 have been linked to an increased risk of ischemic stroke in certain populations (Li2016ARHGEF10).

## Interactions
ARHGEF10 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is involved in the localization of Rab8 to Rab6-positive exocytotic vesicles, suggesting a role in vesicle trafficking. ARHGEF10 interacts with Rab6 and Rab8, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation assays, indicating its function as a scaffold protein in the membrane transport pathway (Shibata2016ARHGEF10). The localization of ARHGEF10 to Rab6- and Rab8-positive vesicles is controlled by Rab6a activity, and its N-terminal region inhibits localization to Rab8-positive tubular structures (Shibata2016ARHGEF10).

ARHGEF10 also interacts with the kinesin-like motor protein KIF3B, which is crucial for mitotic spindle formation. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. Both ARHGEF10 and KIF3B co-localize in centrosomes, and their interaction is essential for proper spindle pole formation, as knockdown of either protein results in multipolar spindle phenotypes (Aoki2009Regulation). These interactions highlight ARHGEF10's role in regulating the cell division cycle and maintaining proper centrosome numbers (Aoki2009Regulation).
