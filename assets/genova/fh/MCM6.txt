# MCM6

## Overview
The MCM6 gene encodes the minichromosome maintenance complex component 6, a protein that plays a pivotal role in DNA replication. As part of the MCM2-7 complex, MCM6 functions as a helicase, unwinding DNA strands at the replication fork, which is essential for the initiation and progression of DNA replication (Costa2009Structural; Miller2015Archaeal). The protein is characterized by its AAA+ ATPase domain, which is crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and a winged-helix domain that may facilitate helicase assembly or activation (Costa2009Structural; Miller2015Archaeal). MCM6 is involved in the formation of the CMG complex with CDC45 and GINS, which is critical for DNA replication initiation and elongation (Zeng2021The). Beyond its role in replication, MCM6 interacts with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Zeng2021The).

## Structure
The MCM6 protein is a component of the MCM2-7 complex, which is crucial for DNA replication. It is part of a hexameric structure that functions as a helicase, unwinding DNA at the replication fork (Costa2009Structural; Miller2015Archaeal). The primary structure of MCM6 includes amino acid sequences that form specific domains, such as the AAA+ ATPase domain, which is conserved across the MCM family and essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Costa2009Structural).

The secondary structure of MCM6 consists of alpha helices and beta strands, with slight variations between wild-type and mutant forms (Kamal2024In). The tertiary structure forms a stable 3D conformation, which is crucial for its function in DNA replication (Kamal2024In). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other MCM proteins, forming a hexameric ring that is essential for its helicase activity (Costa2009Structural).

MCM6 also contains a winged-helix (WH) domain at its C-terminus, which is connected to the core of the protein via a flexible linker, allowing for mobility and potentially playing a role in helicase assembly or activation (Miller2015Archaeal). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions (Costa2009Structural).

## Function
The MCM6 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA replication. This complex, specifically the MCM2-7 heterohexamer, functions as a helicase, unwinding DNA strands to facilitate the formation of replication forks, a critical step in the initiation of DNA replication (Takahashi2005Pumps; Neves2017In). MCM6, as part of this complex, is essential for the progression of the replication fork and the overall process of genome duplication in healthy human cells (Takahashi2005Pumps).

The MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto DNA replication origins during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and becomes active at the G1/S transition, requiring several factors for activation, including ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, GINS, and Cdc45 (Takahashi2005Pumps). MCM6 is involved in the loading of the MCM2-7 complex onto chromatin, a process that includes the formation of an ORC/CDC6/CDT1/MCM2-7 complex (Neves2017In). The activity of the MCM6 protein is ATP-driven, and it is crucial for ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once per cell cycle during the S-phase (Takahashi2005Pumps; Neves2017In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MCM6 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. De novo missense variants in MCM6, such as the p.(Cys158Tyr) zinc finger variant, are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by primary microcephaly, developmental delay, and other clinical features. These variants impair cell proliferation, increase apoptosis, and disrupt ciliogenesis, leading to conditions like congenital microcephaly and primordial dwarfism (Smits2023De). The zinc finger domain of MCM6 is crucial for DNA replication, and its disruption can lead to a loss of function similar to siRNA-mediated knockdown of MCM6 (Smits2023De).

In cancer, MCM6 expression is linked to tumor aggressiveness and prognosis. High MCM6 expression correlates with poor survival outcomes in endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Issac2019MCM2; Pouget2019Ki‐67; Hotton2017Minichromosome). MCM6 overexpression is associated with increased cell cycle progression and DNA replication, contributing to tumor malignancy (Zeng2021The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MCM6 in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
MCM6 is a component of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA replication. It interacts with other MCM proteins, including MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, and MCM7, to form a hexameric helicase complex essential for DNA unwinding during replication (Holthoff1998Human; Crevel2001Nearest). MCM6 is involved in forming the CMG complex with CDC45 and GINS, which is critical for the initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication (Zeng2021The).

MCM6 also participates in interactions beyond DNA replication. It interacts with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, such as ATM and ATR kinases, which phosphorylate MCM proteins to activate S-phase checkpoints (Zeng2021The). MCM6's interaction with RNA polymerase II suggests a role in transcriptional regulation (Zeng2021The).

In the context of chromatin, MCM6 is found in both nucleosolic and chromatin-bound forms, participating in multiprotein complexes with other MCM proteins. These interactions are dynamic, with MCM6 associating with chromatin during early S phase and dissociating later, indicating its role in chromatin remodeling (Holthoff1998Human; Crevel2001Nearest).
