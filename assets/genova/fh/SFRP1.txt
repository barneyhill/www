# SFRP1

## Overview
Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 1 (SFRP1) is a gene that encodes a glycoprotein involved in the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical regulator of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein, also known as secreted frizzled-related protein 1, functions primarily as an antagonist of Wnt signaling by binding to Wnt ligands and preventing their interaction with Frizzled receptors. This action is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive cell proliferation. SFRP1 is characterized by a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and a netrin-like domain, which are crucial for its role in inhibiting Wnt signaling (Bhat2007Structure–Function). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the endometrium, bone marrow, and heart, where it influences processes like adipogenesis and hematopoietic homeostasis (Sercan2010Expression; Guan2021Secreted). Additionally, SFRP1 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its altered expression is associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis in several cancer types (Baharudin2020Epigenetics; Surana2014Secreted).

## Structure
Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 1 (SFRP1) is a glycoprotein that plays a role as a Wnt signaling antagonist. The protein structure includes a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), and a netrin-like domain. The CRD, which spans approximately 120 amino acids, contains 10 conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide linkages, crucial for its function in Wnt signaling inhibition (Bhat2007Structure–Function). This domain shares 30-50% sequence similarity with the CRD of Frizzled receptors and is essential for the protein's antagonist activity (Bhat2007Structure–Function).

The netrin domain, located at the carboxyl-terminal, is characterized by six cysteine residues and several conserved hydrophobic segments. This domain is important for the protein's function and includes a hyaluronan-binding region responsible for heparin-binding properties, which facilitates interactions with Wnt proteins (Bhat2007Structure–Function). The secondary structure of SFRP1 is composed mainly of alpha helices (33.33%) and random coils (57.7%) (Mafakher2020Computational).

SFRP1 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional properties. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are also likely to occur, influencing the protein's stability and interactions (Mafakher2020Computational).

## Function
SFRP1 (secreted frizzled-related protein 1) is a key modulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, acting primarily as an antagonist. It binds to Wnt ligands, preventing their interaction with Frizzled receptors, thereby inhibiting the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing unchecked cell proliferation (Kawano2003Secreted; Jones2002Secreted).

In healthy human cells, SFRP1 is involved in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It plays a significant role in maintaining the quiescence of progenitor cells, particularly in the aged human subventricular zone (SVZ), where it helps regulate the balance between quiescence and activation of neural progenitors (Donega2022Singlecell). SFRP1 is also expressed in bone marrow, where it is implicated in the negative regulation of the Wnt pathway, essential for normal hematopoietic homeostasis (Sercan2010Expression).

SFRP1's expression patterns suggest its involvement in tissue-specific regulation, as it is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the endometrium, fat tissue, and heart, influencing processes like adipogenesis and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor (Jones2002Secreted; Guan2021Secreted).

## Clinical Significance
The SFRP1 gene plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway. Alterations in SFRP1 expression, often through promoter methylation, are linked to tumorigenesis in several cancer types. In breast cancer, SFRP1 is frequently downregulated, leading to increased Wnt signaling and tumor progression. Its suppression is associated with poor prognosis and is considered an early event in breast tumorigenesis (Suzuki2008Frequent; Surana2014Secreted). In colorectal cancer, SFRP1 hypermethylation is linked to poor survival and is detectable in circulation, suggesting its potential as a non-invasive biomarker (Baharudin2020Epigenetics). 

In glioma, hypermethylation of SFRP1 correlates with poor survival and higher tumor grades, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Baharudin2020Epigenetics). In hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, SFRP1 downregulation is associated with increased Wnt signaling and poor prognosis, particularly in cases with β-catenin mutations (Regel2020Downregulation). SFRP1's role in cancer is complex, as it can act as both a tumor suppressor and a potential biomarker for various cancers, with its expression and function varying across different cancer types and subtypes (Cheng2020Increased).

## Interactions
SFRP1 (secreted frizzled-related protein 1) is known to interact with Wnt proteins, acting as a modulator of Wnt signaling. It binds directly to Wnt ligands, such as the Drosophila Wg protein, and can influence Wnt signaling in a biphasic manner, enhancing or inhibiting the pathway depending on its concentration and the presence of heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (Üren2000Secreted). The netrin-related (NTR) domain of SFRP1 is crucial for its function, interacting with Wnt ligands and antagonizing their activity, particularly in the anterior neural plate (LopezRios2008The).

The cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of SFRP1, traditionally thought to bind Wnt ligands, is shown to have a less significant role in direct Wnt binding, as other domains may contribute more significantly to this interaction (Üren2000Secreted). SFRP1 can also form complexes with Frizzled (Fz) receptors, potentially modulating Wnt signaling by either sequestering Wnt ligands or forming inactive complexes with these receptors (LopezRios2008The). The interactions of SFRP1 with frizzled receptors and Wnt ligands are complex and may vary across species, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand these dynamics (Üren2000Secreted).
