# FAM111A

## Overview
FAM111A is a gene that encodes the FAM111 trypsin-like peptidase A, a serine protease involved in crucial cellular processes such as DNA replication and antiviral defense. The protein is characterized by a trypsin-like serine protease domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and function in maintaining genomic stability. FAM111A plays a significant role in protecting DNA replication forks from protein obstacles, thereby preventing replication fork stalling and ensuring proper DNA replication. It interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and binds to single-stranded DNA, facilitating the removal of protein obstacles and promoting cell survival. Mutations in the FAM111A gene are linked to genetic disorders such as Kenny-Caffey Syndrome type 2 and Gracile Bone Dysplasia, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Naicker2024Unravelling; Rosato2022Clinical; Kojima2020FAM111A).

## Structure
The FAM111A protein is characterized by a serine protease domain (SPD) located at its C-terminal region, which is similar to the trypsin-like fold typically found in the S1 serine protease family. This domain includes a conserved catalytic triad composed of His385, Asp439, and Ser541, essential for its enzymatic activity (Naicker2024Unravelling; Kojima2020FAM111A). The SPD of FAM111A forms a dimer, which is crucial for its protease activity. This dimerization is mediated by a hydrophobic coiled coil interaction between the N-terminal alpha helix (α1) of the SPDs, involving key residues such as V347 and V351 (Palani2024Dimerizationdependent).

The dimerization induces a disorder-to-order transition, stabilizing the enzyme's active site and enhancing its catalytic function (Palani2024Dimerizationdependent). The SPD features two β-barrels and a catalytic triad, with structural similarities to chymotrypsin, including an oxyanion hole and a P1 residue binding pocket (S1 pocket) that can accommodate phenylalanine (Palani2024Dimerizationdependent).

FAM111A also contains additional structural domains, such as a PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) box and two ubiquitin-like domains (UBL-1 and UBL-2), which facilitate interactions with DNA replication factors and other proteins (Naicker2024Unravelling). The protein's structure supports its roles in DNA replication and antiviral defense, although its precise role in these processes is not fully understood (Naicker2024Unravelling).

## Function
The FAM111A gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in protecting DNA replication forks from protein obstacles, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability during DNA replication. This protein contains a trypsin-like protease domain that is necessary for its function in vivo, allowing it to mitigate the effects of protein obstacles on replication forks and promote cell survival, especially after treatment with certain anti-cancer drugs like PARP inhibitors (Kojima2020FAM111A). FAM111A interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) through its PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) box, which helps tether its protease domain to replication forks, facilitating the removal of protein obstacles (Naicker2024Unravelling; Kojima2020FAM111A).

FAM111A's protease activity is crucial for eliminating DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) and preventing replication fork stalling, thereby ensuring proper DNA replication and genomic stability (Naicker2024Unravelling). The protein also binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through its central region, which is necessary for its role in replication fork protection (Kojima2020FAM111A). In addition to its role in DNA replication, FAM111A has antiviral properties, restricting viral replication by recognizing and degrading viral nucleoprotein complexes (Kojima2020FAM111A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM111A gene are associated with several genetic disorders, most notably Kenny-Caffey Syndrome type 2 (KCS2) and Gracile Bone Dysplasia, also known as osteocraniostenosis (OCS). KCS2 is characterized by features such as short stature, cortical thickening, medullary stenosis of long bones, delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle, and hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism (Cheng2020Adult; Ohmachi2023Case). OCS presents a more severe phenotype, often lethal at birth, with features like a hypomineralized skull, hypoplastic or absent spleen, and distinctive facial features (Rosato2022Clinical; Müller2021Report).

Most FAM111A variants associated with these conditions are gain-of-function mutations, leading to overactivity in the resultant protein, which can cause issues such as reduced DNA synthesis, disruption of nuclear structure, and cell death (Naicker2024Unravelling). The gene's role in regulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) is speculated to contribute to hypoparathyroidism and affect skeletal development (Rosato2022Clinical). FAM111A variants have also been implicated in cancer, with associations noted in prostate cancer predisposition, glioma, and gastric cancer (Naicker2024Unravelling).

## Interactions
FAM111A is a protein that interacts with several other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA replication and repair. It interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) through its PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) box, which is essential for its function in promoting DNA replication and maintaining genomic stability (Palani2024Dimerizationdependent; Kojima2020FAM111A). FAM111A also binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through its ssDNA-binding domain, facilitating the activation of DNA replication origins and ssDNA formation (RiosSzwed2023FAM111A).

FAM111A forms a complex with its paralog FAM111B, although they do not cleave each other, indicating a non-degradative interaction (RiosSzwed2023FAM111A). The protein is involved in preventing replication fork stalling at topoisomerase 1 cleavage complexes (TOP1cc) and trapped PARP1-DNA complexes, highlighting its role in overcoming protein obstacles during DNA replication (Palani2024Dimerizationdependent; Kojima2020FAM111A).

Dimerization of FAM111A is crucial for its function, particularly in preventing the accumulation of TOP1cc and replication fork stalling. Mutations that disrupt dimerization impair its ability to prevent these issues, underscoring the importance of dimerization for its cellular function (Palani2024Dimerizationdependent).
