# CEP295NL

## Overview
CEP295NL is a gene that encodes the protein CEP295 N-terminal like, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein, playing a crucial role in the organization and function of the centrosome, a key cellular structure involved in microtubule organization and cell cycle progression. The gene has been studied for its involvement in several diseases, including pancreatic adenocarcinomas and eosinophilic esophagitis, where it has been identified as a potential biomarker and genetic risk factor, respectively. Research has also explored its association with neurological conditions such as Tourette syndrome and ADHD, although the specific roles in these disorders remain to be fully elucidated (Kottyan2020The; Tsetsos2016MetaAnalysis; Ge2024Machine).

## Clinical Significance
The CEP295NL gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through genetic studies. In pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PAAD), CEP295NL is identified as a significant gene associated with patient survival and prognosis. It is more strongly expressed in malignant cells within the tumor microenvironment, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression (Ge2024Machine). Machine learning studies have also identified CEP295NL as a biomarker for differentiating between immunologically 'hot' and 'cold' tumors in PAAD, which may have implications for treatment strategies (Ge2024Machine).

In eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a rare allergic condition, CEP295NL is located at the 17q25.3 locus and is associated with the genetic variant rs3744790. This variant has a high risk allele frequency and is significantly associated with EoE, indicating a potential genetic predisposition linked to CEP295NL (Kottyan2020The).

Additionally, CEP295NL has been mentioned in the context of Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a non-coding exon variant, although specific clinical implications in these conditions are not detailed (Tsetsos2016MetaAnalysis).
