# UBR1

## Overview
The UBR1 gene encodes the protein ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 1, which is a crucial component of the N-end rule pathway, a proteolytic system that determines the half-life of proteins based on their N-terminal residues. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBR1 plays a significant role in protein quality control, DNA repair, and stress responses by facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins (Kwon2001Construction; Sukalo2014Mutations). The protein is characterized by its large size, comprising over 1,900 amino acids, and includes several domains such as the RING-H2 domain and UBR box domain, which are essential for its function in recognizing and binding substrates (Kwon2001Construction; Hwang2011Ubiquitin). Mutations in the UBR1 gene are linked to Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Sukalo2014Mutations; Zenker2006Genetic).

## Structure
The UBR1 protein is a ubiquitin ligase involved in the N-end rule pathway, which targets proteins for degradation based on their N-terminal residues. Structurally, UBR1 is a large protein with more than 1,900 amino acids, featuring several key domains that facilitate its function. It contains a RING-H2 domain, essential for its interaction with E2 enzymes and the ubiquitination process (Kwon2001Construction). The UBR box domain is crucial for recognizing destabilizing N-terminal residues, playing a significant role in substrate binding (Hwang2011Ubiquitin).

The protein's structure includes a large helical scaffold interspersed with domains such as Ubr-Box1, Ubr-Box2, and a winged helical domain, contributing to its sailboat-like shape (Pan2021Structural). The UBR/Leu/Cys domain acts like the mast of the 'boat,' interacting with other domains through a zinc-binding site (Pan2021Structural). UBR1 also has a cap helical domain and a RING finger domain, which are involved in interactions with Ubc2 and ubiquitin (Pan2021Structural).

Mutations in UBR1, particularly in the RING-H2 and UBR domains, can lead to Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome, affecting the protein's stability and function (Hwang2011Ubiquitin). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like ubiquitination, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. Splice variants of UBR1 can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions (Kwon2001Construction).

## Function
The UBR1 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is integral to the N-end rule pathway, a proteolytic system that determines the half-life of proteins based on their N-terminal residues. This pathway is involved in various cellular processes, including protein quality control, DNA repair, and stress responses (Kwon2001Construction; Sukalo2014Mutations). UBR1 plays a crucial role in the degradation of misfolded proteins, particularly under stress conditions, by facilitating their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the 26S proteasome (Wang2022Ubr1induced; Leng2015Implication).

In healthy human cells, UBR1 is involved in the regulation of MGMT protein turnover, which is essential for efficient DNA repair processes. It targets both alkylated and unmodified MGMT proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and enhancing DNA repair capacity (Leng2015Implication). UBR1 is also active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Sukalo2014Mutations).

UBR1's function extends to the endosomal and lysosomal pathways, where it aids in the selective autophagy of misfolded proteins, thus maintaining proteostasis and preventing cellular stress (Wang2022Ubr1induced). Its activity is crucial for the health of endosomal compartments, particularly during conditions of calcium-induced stress (Wang2022Ubr1induced).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UBR1 gene are primarily associated with Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome (JBS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. JBS is characterized by a range of congenital abnormalities, including exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, nasal wing hypoplasia or aplasia, dental anomalies, sensorineural hearing loss, and cognitive impairment (Sukalo2014Mutations; Zenker2006Genetic). The mutations in UBR1 often result in a loss of function, leading to the absence or diminished expression of the UBR1 protein. This loss of function is typically due to nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations, which result in more severe manifestations of JBS (Hwang2011Ubiquitin; Zenker2006Genetic).

Patients with biallelic truncating mutations in UBR1 often exhibit severe symptoms, including facial clefting, hearing impairment, and short stature. In contrast, nontruncating mutations, such as missense mutations, are associated with milder symptoms and some residual protein function (Sukalo2014Mutations). The clinical severity of JBS varies, with some patients experiencing milder forms of the syndrome due to single-residue changes in conserved amino acid residues (Hwang2011Ubiquitin). The minimal requirements for UBR1 function differ across tissues, with some residual function being sufficient for brain function but not for preventing pancreatic insufficiency or other symptoms (Sukalo2014Mutations).

## Interactions
UBR1, a ubiquitin ligase involved in the N-end rule pathway, participates in various protein interactions that influence its substrate specificity and function. UBR1 interacts with substrates containing destabilizing N-terminal residues, facilitating their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. It has distinct substrate-binding sites, type-1 and type-2, which recognize basic and bulky hydrophobic N-terminal residues, respectively (Xia2008Substratebinding).

UBR1 also interacts with the transcriptional repressor CUP9, targeting it for degradation. This interaction is modulated by the presence of type-1 and type-2 dipeptides, which enhance UBR1's binding to CUP9 and increase its polyubiquitylation (Xia2008Substratebinding). The interaction between UBR1 and CUP9 is influenced by macromolecular crowding and the presence of translation factor EF1A, which can restore binding specificity (Xia2008Substratebinding).

In stress conditions, UBR1's substrate specificity is reprogrammed by the SHRED regulatory cascade, involving interactions with proteins like Roq1. Cleaved Roq1, with an N-terminal arginine, interacts with UBR1's type-1 site, promoting the recognition of misfolded proteins (Szoradi2018SHRED). This interaction is crucial for enhanced protein quality control during stress (Szoradi2018SHRED).
