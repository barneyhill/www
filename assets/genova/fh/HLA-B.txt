# HLA-B

## Overview
HLA-B is a gene that encodes a protein component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are integral to the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to pathogens. The HLA-B protein is a transmembrane molecule expressed on the surface of nearly all nucleated cells, where it presents endogenous peptide antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and interacts with natural killer (NK) cells. This interaction is crucial for immune surveillance and the elimination of infected or malignant cells (Raghavan2015HLAB; Bodmer1987The). The polymorphic nature of the HLA-B gene allows for a wide diversity of antigenic peptides to be presented, enhancing the immune system's capacity to recognize a broad array of pathogens. Additionally, HLA-B plays a role in modulating immune responses through its interactions with NK cell receptors, which are influenced by specific polymorphic residues within the peptide-binding grooves (Raghavan2015HLAB).

## Structure
The HLA-B protein is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are crucial for presenting peptide antigens to CD8+ T cells. The primary structure of HLA-B involves specific amino acid sequences that vary among alleles, particularly in the α1 and α2 helices, although some sequences are conserved (Ravindranath2022Four). The secondary structure of HLA-B includes α-helices and β-pleated sheets, which contribute to its overall tertiary structure (Ravindranath2022Four).

HLA-B forms a quaternary structure as a trimer on the cell surface, consisting of a heavy chain (HC), β2-microglobulin (β2m), and a peptide. The β2m is monomorphic, while the HCs are polymorphic, contributing to antigenic diversity (Ravindranath2022Four). The heavy chain of HLA-B can also form dimers or trimers, leading to different antigenic and immunogenic properties (Ravindranath2022Four).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, occur in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, affecting the exposure of sugar residues and potentially altering antigenicity (Ravindranath2022Four). Glycosylation at the N86 position is conserved across all HLA-I allotypes and is located near the peptide-binding groove (Ravindranath2022Four).

## Function
The HLA-B gene encodes a protein that is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are crucial for immune system function. These molecules are expressed on the surface of nearly all nucleated cells and play a vital role in presenting endogenous peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and interacting with natural killer (NK) cells (Raghavan2015HLAB; Bodmer1987The). HLA-B molecules form heterodimers with β2-microglobulin and bind short peptides in their peptide-binding grooves. These peptides can be derived from self-proteins in healthy cells or from pathogens in infected cells, facilitating immune surveillance and response (Raghavan2015HLAB).

The polymorphic nature of HLA-B allows for a diverse set of antigenic peptides to be presented, enhancing the immune system's ability to recognize a wide array of pathogens (Raghavan2015HLAB). The expression of HLA-B is codominant, meaning that most individuals express multiple variants, which increases the diversity of antigens that can be presented (Raghavan2015HLAB). HLA-B molecules also interact with NK cell receptors, maintaining NK cells in a quiescent state under healthy conditions (Raghavan2015HLAB). The specific interactions between HLA-B and NK cell receptors are influenced by polymorphic residues within the peptide-binding grooves, affecting peptide binding specificity and subsequent immune responses (Raghavan2015HLAB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HLA-B gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In acquired aplastic anemia (AA), a frequent nonsense mutation in exon 1 of HLA-B alleles leads to a loss of HLA expression in leukocytes, aiding immune evasion. This mutation is prevalent in 92% of AA patients and is linked to a positive response to immunosuppressive therapy in 82% of cases (Hiroki2020A). In the context of cancer, downregulation of HLA-B expression is observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which correlates with reduced T cell and NK cell infiltration and shorter overall survival (Datar2021Spatial). Similarly, in breast cancer, high expression of HLA-B is associated with favorable outcomes, particularly in basal-like and HER2-enriched subtypes, due to its role in immune activation (NoblejasLópez2019Expression).

HLA-B is also implicated in clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIAG), where a specific variant, HLA-B 158T, is associated with lower neutrophil counts and increased risk of this adverse drug reaction (Goldstein2014Clozapineinduced). In multiple sclerosis (MS), the HLA B*44 allele is linked to reduced susceptibility and better radiologic outcomes, suggesting a protective effect (Healy2010HLA).

## Interactions
HLA-B, a major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, engages in various interactions with proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum that are crucial for its function in antigen presentation. The polymorphisms at position 116 of HLA-B significantly influence its interactions with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), tapasin, and calreticulin. For instance, a tyrosine to aspartic acid substitution at this position in HLA-B*0702 enhances its association with these proteins, suggesting that specific amino acid changes can strengthen these interactions (Turnquist2000HLAB).

HLA-B also interacts with β2-microglobulin, forming a stable complex essential for its expression on the cell surface. This interaction is consistent across various HLA-B subtypes, including those within the HLA-B15 group (Turnquist2000HLAB).

In the context of drug hypersensitivity, HLA-B*1502 directly binds to carbamazepine, a drug associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, without requiring intracellular metabolism. This interaction involves specific residues in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-B*1502, which are crucial for presenting the drug to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Wei2012Direct).

HLA-B also interacts with killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on natural killer cells. The interaction between KIR3DS1 and HLA-B alleles with the Bw4-80Ile epitope is associated with delayed progression to AIDS in HIV-1 infected individuals, highlighting the role of HLA-B in modulating immune responses (Martin2002Epistatic).
