# NDC1

## Overview
NDC1 is a gene that encodes the NDC1 transmembrane nucleoporin, a critical component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane nucleoporin due to its integral role in the assembly and maintenance of the NPC, which facilitates nucleocytoplasmic transport by allowing the exchange of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The NDC1 protein is characterized by its six transmembrane segments, which anchor it to the nuclear envelope, and a conserved C-terminal domain that interacts with other nucleoporins, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the NPC (Mansfeld2006The; Stavru2006NDC1:). NDC1 is essential for postmitotic NPC assembly and nuclear envelope formation, and its expression levels have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and cardiomyopathy, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Mansfeld2006The; Shen2023Pancancer).

## Structure
The human NDC1 protein is an integral membrane nucleoporin characterized by its involvement in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly. It contains six transmembrane segments in the N-terminal half, which are crucial for its integration into the nuclear envelope (Stavru2006NDC1:; Lau2006Topology). The C-terminal domain of NDC1 is highly conserved and is exposed to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other nucleoporins (Mansfeld2006The; Stavru2006NDC1:). This domain includes an amphipathic helix that can bind to high curvature liposomes, indicating a role in membrane curvature and organization (Amm2022New).

NDC1 is initially integrated into rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes before assembling into NPCs, and its COOH-terminal domain is localized to the NPC scaffold (Stavru2006NDC1:). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation during mitosis, which may affect its function and localization (Mansfeld2006The). NDC1 also has several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, which could influence its structural and functional properties (Amm2022New).

## Function
NDC1 is a transmembrane nucleoporin essential for the assembly and maintenance of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in human cells. It plays a critical role in nucleocytoplasmic transport by facilitating the exchange of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. NDC1 is involved in anchoring the NPC to the nuclear envelope (NE), interacting with soluble nucleoporins such as Nup93, Nup53, and Nup205, which are crucial for NPC stability and assembly (Mansfeld2006The). 

NDC1 is also vital for postmitotic NPC and NE assembly, as its depletion leads to defects in NPC assembly and stability (Mansfeld2006The). It interacts with the Nup93-53 complex, facilitating the recruitment of this complex to the assembling NPC, which is essential for the association of FG-containing nucleoporins that form the NPC channel (Mansfeld2006The). 

In addition to its role in NPC assembly, NDC1 is involved in nuclear formation and growth. It functions alongside Nup53 and membrane biogenesis to control NPC density and nuclear size, highlighting its importance in coordinating membrane recruitment and NPC assembly during NE formation (Mauro2022Ndc1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NDC1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. High expression of NDC1 is associated with poor overall survival in several cancer types, including adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), lower-grade glioma (LGG), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), and sarcoma (SARC) (Shen2023Pancancer). In pancreatic cancer, NDC1 expression is linked to chemotherapy resistance, particularly to drugs like Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, and Sorafenib, suggesting its role in drug resistance mechanisms (Shen2023Pancancer).

NDC1 is also involved in immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, which may influence cancer progression and response to immunotherapy (Shen2023Pancancer). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), overexpression of NDC1 promotes cell proliferation and migration, while its downregulation inhibits these processes and induces apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer cell survival and metastasis (Bindra2021In).

In addition to cancer, NDC1 is linked to ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, where it is upregulated and mislocalized in cardiac tissues, potentially affecting nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and nuclear organization (Bindra2021In).

## Interactions
NDC1 is a transmembrane nucleoporin that plays a crucial role in the assembly and maintenance of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). It interacts with several nucleoporins, forming essential connections within the NPC structure. NDC1 directly interacts with Nup53, a relationship that is vital for NPC assembly. This interaction occurs through the N-terminal transmembrane regions of NDC1 and is necessary for the proper formation of the nuclear envelope and NPC (Eisenhardt2013Nup53). 

In vertebrate cells, NDC1 is involved in the recruitment of the Nup93-53 complex to the assembling NPC, interacting specifically with Nup53. This interaction is crucial for the incorporation of the Nup93-53 subcomplex into the NPC, which is necessary for the association of FG-containing nucleoporins that form the NPC channel (Mansfeld2006The). 

In yeast, NDC1 interacts with nucleoporins such as Nup59, Pom152, and Pom34. These interactions are essential for maintaining NPC structure and function. The interactions between NDC1 and these nucleoporins predominantly occur on the cytosolic side of the nuclear membrane, highlighting their role in anchoring NDC1 to the NPC and ensuring its stability (Onischenko2009Role).
