# KIRREL2

## Overview
KIRREL2 is a gene that encodes the protein kirre like nephrin family adhesion molecule 2, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its role in cell adhesion processes, primarily within the pancreatic islets and the nervous system. KIRREL2 is expressed predominantly in the β cells of the pancreas, where it is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these insulin-producing cells. Additionally, it plays a role in neural development by influencing axonal identity in olfactory sensory neurons. The protein contains multiple immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain, which facilitate its function in cell-cell interactions. KIRREL2's involvement in various physiological processes underscores its significance in both endocrine and neural systems (Sun2003Kirrel2; Vaddadi2019Kirrel2).

## Structure
The KIRREL2 protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by the presence of immunoglobulin-like domains. These domains are crucial for its role in cell adhesion processes. The primary structure of KIRREL2 includes specific amino acid sequences that facilitate the formation of homodimers, which are essential for its function in neuronal wiring and axonal coalescence (Wang2021Molecular).

The secondary structure of KIRREL2 involves the immunoglobulin (IG) fold, which is a common feature among cell surface receptors involved in neuronal wiring. This structure is integral to the protein's ability to mediate homophilic adhesion, a process critical for the segregation of sensory neuron axons into distinct glomeruli (Wang2021Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, KIRREL2 forms homodimers through interactions at the N-terminal IG domains. This dimerization is facilitated by a hydrogen bonding network centered at specific residues, such as Gln52, which is crucial for maintaining the protein's structural integrity and function (Wang2021Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, influencing the protein's function and stability. The presence of alternative splice variants could result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its structural and functional properties (Wang2021Molecular).

## Function
The KIRREL2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, primarily expressed in the β cells of the pancreatic islets. This protein is involved in cell adhesion processes, which are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of pancreatic islets. The protein contains five immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain, suggesting its role in facilitating cell-cell interactions within the pancreas (Sun2003Kirrel2).

KIRREL2 is thought to play a significant role in the organization and function of β cells, which are responsible for insulin production. Its expression is highly specific to the pancreas, with some presence in other neuroendocrine tissues, indicating its importance in endocrine function (Sun2003Kirrel2). The protein's similarity to other cell adhesion molecules like NEPH1 and NPHS1, which are involved in kidney development, suggests that KIRREL2 may also contribute to maintaining proper cell-cell contact and communication in pancreatic islets (Sun2003Kirrel2).

In addition to its role in the pancreas, KIRREL2 is expressed in the nervous system, where it may influence neural development by providing axonal identity information in specific populations of olfactory sensory neurons (Vaddadi2019Kirrel2).

## Clinical Significance
KIRREL2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and mutations. In group 3 medulloblastomas (Grp 3 MB), high expression of KIRREL2 is associated with poor clinical outcomes. It serves as a prognostic marker, aiding in risk stratification and treatment planning for patients with this aggressive tumor subtype (Korshunov2022Gene). The expression of KIRREL2 in Grp 3 MB is not correlated with MYC expression but is linked to genes involved in signaling pathways related to ligase activity, tRNA metabolism, mitochondrial translation, and neurogenesis (Korshunov2022Gene).

In the context of diabetes, KIRREL2 is primarily expressed in β cells of the pancreatic islets. Its expression decreases in a mouse model of type I diabetes, suggesting a potential role in the disease's progression, although it remains unclear whether KIRREL2 actively contributes to the disease or merely serves as a marker for β cell presence (Sun2003Kirrel2).

In soft-coated wheaten terrier dogs, a mutation in KIRREL2, resulting in a proline-to-arginine substitution, has been associated with protein-losing nephropathy (PLN). This mutation occurs in a conserved region and is considered potentially damaging, although further research is needed to confirm its role in the disease (Littman2013Glomerulopathy).
