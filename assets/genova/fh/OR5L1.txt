# OR5L1

## Overview
The OR5L1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily L member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odorants, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The protein encoded by OR5L1 is a transmembrane receptor that spans the cell membrane, facilitating signal transduction upon binding to specific ligands. While its primary function is associated with olfactory processes, recent studies have suggested that OR5L1 may also be involved in various cancer-related pathways, particularly in the context of treatment resistance and disease progression in certain cancer types (Bagaria2022Discriminating; Huang2013Molecular; Katsogiannou2015The; Testa2019Cellular). Further research is necessary to fully understand the broader implications of OR5L1 in both olfactory and non-olfactory contexts.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The OR5L1 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in certain cancer types due to its mutation patterns. In rectal cancer, OR5L1 mutations were identified in patients who did not achieve a complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting a potential role in treatment resistance (Bagaria2022Discriminating). In prostate cancer, OR5L1 is frequently mutated in metastatic, castration-resistant cases, indicating its involvement in the disease's progression and genomic instability (Huang2013Molecular; Katsogiannou2015The; Testa2019Cellular). These findings highlight OR5L1's association with cancer-related pathways, although specific mechanisms and clinical implications remain under investigation. The gene's mutations are noted in highly pretreated prostate cancer patients, suggesting a potential link to treatment resistance or disease aggressiveness (Testa2019Cellular). Despite these associations, the clinical significance of OR5L1 mutations outside of cancer contexts is not well-documented, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in other diseases or conditions.
