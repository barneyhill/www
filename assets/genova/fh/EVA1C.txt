# EVA1C

## Overview
EVA1C is a gene that encodes the protein eva-1 homolog C, which is involved in various biological processes and disease pathways. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a role in cellular signaling and immune response. Research has shown that EVA1C is implicated in the progression of several diseases, including gliomas and HBV-related liver disease, where it serves as a potential prognostic biomarker (Hu2021EVA1C; Zeng2021Genomewide). The gene's expression is associated with immune-related pathways, such as antigen processing and presentation, and it has been linked to the regulation of intraocular pressure, suggesting its involvement in glaucoma (Gao2022Wholeexomea). Despite its emerging significance, the precise mechanisms by which EVA1C influences these conditions remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The EVA1C gene has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker in WHO grade II/III gliomas. Elevated expression of EVA1C is associated with poor prognosis and malignant clinicopathological features, including WHO grade, histopathological type, IDH mutation status, and 1p/19q non-codeletion. High EVA1C expression correlates with increased immune infiltration and poor overall survival in glioma patients (Hu2021EVA1C). The gene's expression is also linked to immune-related biological functions and pathways, such as antigen processing and presentation, B cell activation, and the NF-KB signaling pathway, which are involved in immune response and cancer cell metastasis (Hu2021EVA1C).

In addition to gliomas, EVA1C has been implicated in the progression of HBV-related liver disease. A specific SNP in the EVA1C gene is significantly associated with the progression from chronic hepatitis B to hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting a role in HBV-related disease progression (Zeng2021Genomewide). Furthermore, EVA1C has been associated with intraocular pressure regulation and glaucoma, with significant gene-based associations identified through whole-exome sequencing (Gao2022Wholeexomea). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of EVA1C in various diseases, although its specific roles and mechanisms require further investigation.
