# CRMP1

## Overview
CRMP1 (Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 1) is a gene that encodes a cytosolic phosphoprotein involved in various neurodevelopmental processes, including axonal guidance, cell migration, and dendritic branching. The protein, also known as collapsin response mediator protein 1, is a member of the CRMP family and is characterized by a dihydropyrimidinase-like domain. It functions primarily in the nervous system, where it interacts with signaling molecules such as Sema3A and reelin to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal signaling. CRMP1 forms homo- or hetero-tetramers, which are essential for its role in linking microtubules to subcellular structures and facilitating actin filament elongation in epithelial cells. Additionally, CRMP1 acts as a molecular chaperone, preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins, which is particularly relevant in neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease (Stroedicke2015Systematic; YuKemp2017CRMP1; Ravindran2022Monoallelic).

## Structure
CRMP1, a member of the collapsin response mediator protein family, plays a significant role in neuronal development and axonal guidance. The primary structure of CRMP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a dihydropyrimidinase-like domain, which is a characteristic feature of the CRMP family (Schmidt2007The). The secondary structure of CRMP1 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall globular shape in the tertiary structure (Ponnusamy2013Insights). 

CRMP1 can form homotetramers, which is its quaternary structure, and this oligomerization is crucial for its function in axon guidance (Schmidt2007The; Ponnusamy2013Insights). The protein's oligomerization is influenced by specific residues at dimer interfaces, which are important for the formation of tetramers (Ponnusamy2013Insights). 

CRMP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions within the Sema3A signaling pathway (Schmidt2007The). Multiple splice variants of CRMP1 exist, contributing to its functional diversity and allowing for differential expression patterns in various neuronal compartments (Bretin2005Differential). These structural features enable CRMP1 to participate effectively in neuronal signaling and development.

## Function
CRMP1 (collapsin response mediator protein 1) is a cytosolic phosphoprotein that plays a crucial role in the development and function of the nervous system. It is highly expressed in neurons and is involved in neurodevelopmental processes such as cell migration, axonal outgrowth, dendritic branching, and apoptosis. These processes are mediated through interactions with extracellular signaling molecules like Sema3A, reelin, and neurotrophins (Ravindran2022Monoallelic). CRMP1 functions by forming homo- or hetero-tetramers, which are essential for linking microtubules to subcellular structures and regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, crucial for mitosis and cell cycle progression (Ravindran2022Monoallelic).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, CRMP1 is involved in actin filament elongation in epithelial cells, working with the Ena/VASP family member EVL to assemble the actin cytoskeleton. This activity is important for maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial sheets and supporting cell-cell adhesion (YuKemp2017CRMP1). CRMP1 also acts as a molecular chaperone, preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins, which is particularly relevant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease (Stroedicke2015Systematic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CRMP1 gene are associated with several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), phosphorylated CRMP1 (pThr509-CRMP1) accumulates in axonal swellings, known as spheroids, within motor neuron axons. This accumulation is linked to axonal transport dysfunction and may contribute to ALS pathogenesis by inhibiting neurite outgrowth (Kawamoto2022Phosphorylated).

CRMP1 gene variants have been identified in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, including muscular hypotonia, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These variants affect CRMP1's structure and oligomerization, impacting neurite outgrowth and contributing to the disorder's symptoms (Ravindran2022Monoallelic).

In Huntington's disease (HD), CRMP1 acts as a suppressor of huntingtin (HTT) protein misfolding and neurotoxicity. Reduced CRMP1 levels in HD brains are associated with increased HTT aggregation, suggesting a protective role for CRMP1 in modulating protein aggregation (Stroedicke2015Systematic).

Altered CRMP1 expression is also linked to psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and ASD, where it plays a role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling pathways (Hou2020The).

## Interactions
CRMP1 (collapsin response mediator protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neuronal signaling and cytoskeletal organization. CRMP1 interacts with Filamin-A, an actin-binding protein, in the context of Sema3A signaling. This interaction involves CRMP1 binding to both the actin-binding domain and the Ig24 domain of Filamin-A, which is essential for the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to Sema3A signaling (Nakamura2014Amino). Phosphorylation of CRMP1 at Ser522 enhances its interaction with Filamin-A, facilitating the Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse response (Nakamura2014Amino).

CRMP1 also interacts with EVL, a protein related to VASP and Ena, enhancing EVL's actin filament elongation activity. This interaction is crucial for actin network assembly, particularly in the apical cortex and lamellipodia (YuKemp2017CRMP1). Additionally, CRMP1 forms complexes with mutant huntingtin (mHtt) protein, modulating its aggregation and toxicity in neurons, which is significant in the context of Huntington's disease (bounab2010crmp1). These interactions highlight CRMP1's role as a molecular chaperone, preventing misfolding and aggregation of proteins like mHtt (Stroedicke2015Systematic).
