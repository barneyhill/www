# SNN

## Overview
The SNN gene encodes the stannin protein, a highly conserved transmembrane protein predominantly found in vertebrates. Stannin is characterized by its 88 amino acids and is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in mitochondrial and vesicular organelle functions. The protein's structure includes a transmembrane domain, a linker region with a conserved CXC metal-binding motif, and a cytoplasmic helix, which are essential for its role in cellular signaling pathways, such as the p38-ERK cascade and p53-dependent pathways (Billingsley2006Functional). Stannin's interactions with 14-3-3 proteins, especially the 14-3-3z isoform, suggest its involvement in phosphoinositide metabolism and cellular signaling (Pueyo2016Hemotin). The gene's expression is implicated in the regulation of cellular growth, mitochondrial responses to injury, and the modulation of inflammatory pathways, with clinical significance in conditions like retinoblastoma and organometallic-mediated cytotoxicity (Hu2020miR4913p; Pueyo2016Hemotin).

## Structure
Stannin (SNN) is a highly conserved protein consisting of 88 amino acids, primarily found in vertebrates. Its structure includes a single transmembrane domain spanning residues 10-33, which is crucial for its membrane localization (Billingsley2006Functional). The protein also features a 28-residue linker region (residues 34-60) containing a conserved CXC metal-binding motif and a putative 14-3-3x binding region, which are important for its interaction with organotins and involvement in signaling pathways (Billingsley2006Functional; Pueyo2016Hemotin). The cytoplasmic helix, comprising residues 61-79, is partially embedded in the membrane, contributing to its structural stability (Billingsley2006Functional).

Stannin's tertiary structure has been elucidated using NMR techniques, revealing its configuration in both micellar environments and lipid bilayers (Billingsley2006Functional). The protein's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, particularly the 14-3-3z isoform, suggests a role in phosphoinositide metabolism and cellular signaling (Pueyo2016Hemotin). The conservation of its structural features across species indicates a functional role in cellular processes such as phagocytosis and endosomal maturation (Pueyo2016Hemotin). There is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
Stannin (SNN) is a highly conserved protein primarily found in vertebrates, consisting of 88 amino acids. It is a membrane-bound protein localized to mitochondria and other vesicular organelles, indicating its significant role in cellular function (Billingsley2006Functional). Stannin is involved in key signaling pathways, including the p38-ERK cascade, p53-dependent pathways, and 14-3-3x protein-mediated processes. It acts as a sensor of mitochondrial damage, mediating crosstalk between mitochondrial and nuclear compartments (Billingsley2006Functional). The protein contains a transmembrane domain, a linker region with a conserved CXC metal-binding motif, and a cytoplasmic helix, which are crucial for its interactions and functions (Billingsley2006Functional).

Stannin is implicated in cellular growth, selective toxicity, and mitochondrial responses to injury. It interacts with organotins like trimethyltin, affecting its CXC region near a putative 14-3-3 binding site (Billingsley2006Functional). Inhibition of SNN expression leads to reduced endothelial cell growth and induction of COP-1, a negative regulator of p53 function (Billingsley2006Functional). The protein's conservation and lack of SNPs suggest its crucial role in cellular function (Billingsley2006Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SNN gene, also known as Stannin, have been implicated in the progression of retinoblastoma, a malignant tumor of the retina. In retinoblastoma, miR-491-3p, a microRNA that targets SNN, is downregulated, leading to the overexpression of SNN. This overexpression is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as reduced apoptosis, thereby promoting tumor progression (Hu2020miR4913p). The interaction between miR-491-3p and SNN is crucial, as miR-491-3p acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting these processes, and its effects are negated by SNN overexpression (Hu2020miR4913p).

SNN is also involved in the regulation of endosomal maturation and has been linked to organometallic-mediated cytotoxicity, particularly with compounds like trimethyltin (TMT). Alterations in SNN function can lead to toxic excesses of 14-3-3ζ-related phosphoinositide kinase activity, resulting in enlarged endolysosomal compartments and apoptosis in tissues expressing SNN (Pueyo2016Hemotin). These findings suggest that dysregulation of SNN may contribute to cellular stress responses and neurotoxic damage.

## Interactions
Stannin (SNN) is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cellular signaling pathways. One significant interaction is with the 14-3-3 protein family, specifically the 14-3-3x isoform. This interaction is facilitated by a putative 14-3-3 binding site within the stannin protein, which may influence the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (Billingsley2006Functional). The presence of a conserved CXC metal-binding motif near this binding site suggests a role in metal ion interactions, which could be crucial for its function in cellular processes (Billingsley2006Functional).

Stannin is also implicated in the regulation of TNF-responsive genes, as its expression is upregulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and trimethyltin (TMT). This upregulation affects the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response and cell-cycle regulation, indicating that stannin may play a role in modulating these pathways (Billingsley2006Functional). Although the exact mechanisms of these interactions are not fully understood, the protein's localization to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum membranes suggests it may act as a sensor of mitochondrial damage, mediating communication between mitochondrial and nuclear compartments (Billingsley2006Functional).
