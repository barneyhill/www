# CPEB3

## Overview
CPEB3, or cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation and stability, particularly within neuronal cells. The CPEB3 protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory by modulating the translation of specific mRNAs in response to synaptic activity. Structurally, CPEB3 contains a prion-like domain and RNA-binding domains, which are essential for its function in translational regulation and memory consolidation (Stephan2015The; Flores2022Structure). The protein's activity is finely regulated through post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation and ubiquitination, which influence its localization and function in neurons (Stephan2015The; Flores2022Structure). Beyond its role in the nervous system, CPEB3 has been implicated in cancer biology, acting as a tumor suppressor in various cancers by regulating pathways involved in cell proliferation and metastasis (Fang2020CPEB3; Zhang2023CPEB3).

## Structure
CPEB3 is a protein characterized by a complex structure that includes several distinct domains. The N-terminal region contains a prion-like domain, which is subdivided into three parts: PRD1, LMD, and PRD2. PRD1 is essential for prion seed formation and foci heritability, while PRD2 is crucial for foci formation. The LMD domain interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, influencing CPEB3's localization (Stephan2015The; Reselammal2021Mapping). The C-terminal region of CPEB3 includes two RNA-binding domains and a zinc finger domain, which are critical for its RNA-binding function (Flores2022Structure).

CPEB3 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. These isoforms differ in their RNA recognition motifs and zinc finger domains, affecting the protein's function and localization (Wang2009Characterization). Post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation and ubiquitination regulate CPEB3's activity and localization. In its basal state, CPEB3 is SUMOylated, repressing translation and localizing to p-bodies. Upon neuronal stimulation, it undergoes de-SUMOylation, relocates to polysomes, and promotes translation (Stephan2015The; Flores2022Structure). The protein's aggregation is also modulated by these modifications, which are crucial for its role in translational regulation and memory consolidation (Flores2022Structure).

## Function
CPEB3 is a protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory by regulating mRNA translation and stability in neurons. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it binds to specific mRNA sequences, influencing polyadenylation and translation. This regulation is essential for the synthesis of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity, such as AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits, actin, and the synaptic scaffolding protein PSD95 (Qu2020Role).

CPEB3 acts as a translational repressor in its monomeric form, localized in P-bodies. Upon neuronal stimulation, it undergoes a decrease in SUMOylation, leading to its aggregation and activation of translation of target mRNAs, which is crucial for long-term potentiation and memory formation (Kozlov2021The). The protein can switch from a repressive to an activating state through post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation and ubiquitination, which modulate its function in response to synaptic stimuli (Qu2020Role).

CPEB3 also influences neuron-specific alternative splicing and neurogenesis gene expression, impacting cell division, transcription regulation, and various signaling pathways. It modulates the splicing of genes involved in neuronal development and synaptogenesis, contributing to neurogenesis and neuronal development (Qu2020CPEB3).

## Clinical Significance
CPEB3 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In ovarian cancer, CPEB3 expression is significantly reduced in cancerous tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues. This reduction is associated with increased cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting that CPEB3 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating E-cadherin, a protein involved in cell adhesion (Zhang2023CPEB3). In colorectal cancer, CPEB3 is frequently down-regulated, which correlates with poor prognosis, including shorter survival times and increased metastasis. The gene's tumor-suppressing function is linked to its interaction with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, where it binds to the 3'UTR of JAK1 mRNA, inhibiting the pathway and thus reducing cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Fang2020CPEB3). In hepatocellular carcinoma, CPEB3 is downregulated, leading to increased expression of metastasis-promoting genes like MTDH. This downregulation is associated with higher tumor malignancy grades and worse survival outcomes, as CPEB3 normally suppresses the translation of mRNAs involved in tumor progression (Zhang2020CPEB3-mediated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CPEB3 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CPEB3 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in synaptic plasticity and memory. It binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of mRNA, regulating translation through interactions with proteins like Tob and Caf1, which accelerate mRNA decay (Tsuda2014Novel). CPEB3 is involved in polyadenylation-independent translational activation and interacts with the cell cycle regulator Tob to recruit the Caf1 de-adenylase, forming a complex that accelerates mRNA decay (Qu2020Role).

CPEB3's nuclear translocation is facilitated by karyopherins importin 5 (IPO5) and chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1), binding through the RRM1 domain, and this interaction is regulated by RanGTP and RanGDP (Qu2020Role). It also interacts with Stat5b, affecting transcription regulation (Qu2020Role). CPEB3 is localized to P-bodies, interacting with proteins like GW182 and argonaute 2 (Ago2) through the RRM1 domain, driven by SUMOylation (Qu2020Role).

CPEB3 interacts with actin, forming stable aggregates that are significant for long-term memory maintenance. This interaction is stabilized by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, involving a zipper sequence in CPEB3 (Gu2020Exploring). CPEB3 also binds to the CYFIP1-eIF4e-FMR1 complex, relevant to long-term potentiation and mRNA translation inhibition (Ford2020The).
