# GABRR2

## Overview
The GABRR2 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor subunit rho2, which is a component of the GABA-A receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor is integral to inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system, particularly influencing the flow of chloride ions across neuronal membranes, thereby modulating neuronal excitability and contributing to neural network stability. The rho2 subunit is notably active in the retina and various brain regions, playing a significant role in visual processing. Additionally, GABRR2 expression in the kidney suggests a potential role in renal function, particularly in the proximal tubules and glomeruli, where it may influence the regulation of the glomerular basement membrane and serum creatinine levels (Pattaro2010A; GarcíaMartín2010Gammaaminobutyric).

## Structure


## Function
The GABRR2 gene encodes the rho2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is a type of ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission within the central nervous system. This receptor modulates the flow of chloride ions across the cell membrane, leading to neuronal hyperpolarization and a reduction in neuronal excitability. The GABA-A receptors, including those containing the rho2 subunit, are primarily active in the retina and various brain regions, where they play a crucial role in visual processing and maintaining neural network stability (Pattaro2010A; GarcíaMartín2010Gammaaminobutyric).

In the kidney, GABA-A receptors, including subunits like GABRR2, are expressed in the proximal tubules and normal human glomeruli, suggesting a role in kidney function and possibly in the regulation of the glomerular basement membrane (Pattaro2010A). The GABRR2 gene is also involved in retinal neurotransmission, indicating its importance in neurotransmitter signaling pathways (Pattaro2010A). The expression of GABRR2 and its interaction with other proteins, such as synaptotagmin-I, may influence cellular processes at the podocyte level, contributing to the regulation of serum creatinine levels (Pattaro2010A).
