# IYD

## Overview
The IYD gene encodes the enzyme iodotyrosine deiodinase, a flavoprotein that is integral to the maintenance of iodide homeostasis in the human body. This enzyme is categorized within the nitro-FMN reductase superfamily due to its structural and functional characteristics. Iodotyrosine deiodinase is primarily active in the thyroid gland, where it facilitates the reductive deiodination of iodotyrosines, byproducts of thyroid hormone synthesis, thereby recycling iodine for reuse in hormone production. The enzyme's activity is dependent on the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor, which plays a critical role in the electron transfer mechanisms necessary for deiodination. Mutations in the IYD gene can lead to iodotyrosine dehalogenase deficiency, resulting in primary hypothyroidism, characterized by impaired thyroid hormone synthesis and associated clinical manifestations (Afink2008Molecular; Karmakar2024FlavinMediated).

## Structure
The human iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD) is a flavoprotein that plays a crucial role in iodide homeostasis. The molecular structure of IYD includes a dimeric arrangement where flavin mononucleotide (FMN) binds non-covalently at the interface of two identical subunits. Each subunit contributes to FMN binding through hydrogen bonds involving Ser-102 and Ser-128, and multiple Arg residues coordinate with the phosphate group. Arg-104 interacts with the isoalloxazine moiety of FMN in the absence of substrate (Hu2015A).

The enzyme's structure comprises an N-terminal membrane anchor, an intermediate domain, and a large C-terminal catalytic domain. This catalytic domain is homologous to flavoproteins that reduce nitroaromatics, placing IYD within the nitro-FMN reductase superfamily (Phatarphekar2014Iodotyrosine). The active site of IYD is shielded by a loop and helix-turn structure, which sequesters the substrate-FMN complex from the solvent (Hu2015A).

IYD's tertiary structure forms a specific 3D shape, with the aromatic ring of iodotyrosine stacking above FMN, aligning the C-I bond of iodotyrosine over the C4a-N5 bond of FMN, which is crucial for redox cycling (Hu2015A). The enzyme does not involve a catalytic thiol but relies on FMN for its catalytic activity (Schweizer2015New).

## Function
Iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in thyroid hormone metabolism by catalyzing the reductive deiodination of iodotyrosines, which are byproducts of thyroid hormone synthesis. This process is essential for recycling iodine, thereby maintaining iodine homeostasis and ensuring proper thyroid function (Hu2015A; Karmakar2024FlavinMediated). IYD utilizes a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor to facilitate the deiodination reaction, which involves electron transfer mechanisms that are crucial for the enzyme's activity (Hu2015A).

In human cells, IYD is primarily active in the thyroid gland, where it contributes to the regulation of iodide levels by salvaging iodine from iodotyrosines for reuse in the synthesis of thyroid hormones (Phatarphekar2014Iodotyrosine). The enzyme's activity is influenced by substrate interactions, with specific residues in the active site playing a significant role in substrate binding and catalysis (Ingavat2017Active). The enzyme's function is vital for maintaining the body's iodine pool, which is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones that regulate metabolism and other physiological processes (Karmakar2024FlavinMediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IYD gene, which encodes the enzyme iodotyrosine deiodinase, are associated with iodotyrosine dehalogenase deficiency, a condition that can lead to primary hypothyroidism. This condition is characterized by low levels of thyroid hormones, which can result in goiter and, if untreated, developmental delays and mental retardation due to thyroid hormone deficiency in early life (Afink2008Molecular). A specific mutation, c.658G>A, p.Ala220Thr, has been identified in patients with hypothyroidism, leading to a complete loss of enzymatic dehalogenase activity. This mutation results in elevated levels of monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT) in urine, indicating impaired recycling of iodide (Afink2008Molecular).

The IYD-A220T mutation is particularly significant as it results in reduced protein expression and a complete loss of enzymatic activity, which is crucial for thyroid hormone synthesis. The alanine-220 residue is highly conserved across vertebrates, underscoring its importance in the enzyme's function (Afink2008Molecular). Genetic testing for IYD mutations is important for diagnosing and managing affected families, as early detection can prevent the adverse effects associated with the condition (Afink2008Molecular).
