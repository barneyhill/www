# BCL2L15

## Overview
BCL2L15 is a gene that encodes the BCL2 like 15 protein, a member of the Bcl-2 family, which is primarily involved in the regulation of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The BCL2 like 15 protein is categorized as a pro-apoptotic factor and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial pathways by influencing membrane permeability and facilitating the release of cytochrome c, a pivotal event in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Roh2023The; Hardwick2013Multiple). This protein is predominantly expressed in normal gastrointestinal epithelial cells, indicating its potential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis within these tissues (Vivarelli2021YY1). The gene's expression and regulatory interactions are significant in the context of cancer biology, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it is implicated in tumor suppression and chemotherapeutic response (Vivarelli2021YY1).

## Function
BCL2L15, also known as Bfk, is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which are key regulators of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This protein is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it influences mitochondrial membrane permeability and regulates the release of cytochrome c, a critical step in the apoptotic pathway (Hardwick2013Multiple). BCL2L15 is categorized as a pro-apoptotic protein, similar to other family members like BAX, BAK, and BOK, and is involved in promoting apoptosis by interacting with other Bcl-2 family proteins (Roh2023The).

In healthy human cells, BCL2L15 is preferentially expressed in normal gastrointestinal epithelial cells, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis in these tissues (Vivarelli2021YY1). The protein's expression is linked to the regulation of apoptosis, contributing to the balance between cell survival and death. This function is crucial for normal cellular processes and the prevention of uncontrolled cell proliferation, which can lead to cancer (Vivarelli2021YY1). The gene's expression patterns and interactions with other proteins highlight its importance in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, which is essential for normal development and cellular turnover.

## Clinical Significance
The BCL2L15 gene has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) through its interaction with the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Silencing YY1 in CRC cells leads to downregulation of BCL2L15, which is associated with increased resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and decreased apoptosis. This suggests that BCL2L15 plays a tumor-suppressive role in CRC, particularly in cell lines such as HT-29 and SW620, which are sensitive to 5-FU treatment (Vivarelli2021YY1).

BCL2L15 expression is also modulated by specific genetic mutations in CRC. It is upregulated in samples with PIK3CA or KRAS mutations and downregulated in those with BRAF mutations. This differential expression pattern highlights its potential diagnostic relevance, especially in CRC patients with KRAS mutations (Vivarelli2021YY1).

In acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), BCL2L15 is part of the broader BCL2 family, which includes both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes. The dysregulation of these genes, including BCL2L15, is associated with altered apoptotic responses in AML, although specific details on BCL2L15's role in AML are less clear (Handschuh2021TranscriptLevel).

## Interactions
BCL2L15, a member of the BCL-2 protein family, is involved in the regulation of apoptosis. It is part of a smaller isolated component within the Bcl-2 interaction network, interacting with three BH3-only proteins: Meox2, Tead2, and Sdcbp (Kønig2019Alterations). Despite being categorized as a pro-apoptotic protein, BCL2L15's putative BH3 motifs have been deemed non-functional, suggesting it may not engage in significant interactions mediated by these motifs (Sora2022Structural).

In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, BCL2L15 expression is indirectly regulated by the transcription factor YY1. Although YY1 does not directly bind to the BCL2L15 promoter, its silencing leads to BCL2L15 downregulation, potentially involving the PROX1 transcription factor, which represses BCL2L15 (Vivarelli2021YY1). In retinoblastoma, BCL2L15 is negatively regulated by KLF16, which binds to its promoter and represses its transcription, as confirmed by luciferase reporter and ChIP assays (Zhang2020KLF16).

These interactions highlight BCL2L15's role in apoptosis and its regulation by transcription factors, although specific details on its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain limited.
