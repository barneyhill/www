# MARCHF1

## Overview
MARCHF1, or Membrane Associated Ring-CH-Type Finger 1, is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein, which is integral to the ubiquitination process. This protein is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase due to its role in facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, marking them for degradation. The MARCHF1 protein is predominantly associated with endosomal and lysosomal membranes, where it plays a pivotal role in protein trafficking and degradation pathways. By modulating the surface expression of immune receptors, MARCHF1 is crucial in regulating immune responses, ensuring that immune cells can effectively respond to pathogens while preventing excessive activation that could lead to autoimmune disorders. The gene's function in these cellular processes highlights its importance in maintaining protein homeostasis and proper immune system functioning (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
MARCHF1 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for tagging proteins for degradation. This process is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. MARCHF1 is particularly active in the endosomal and lysosomal membranes, where it influences protein trafficking and degradation pathways. By modulating the surface expression of immune receptors, MARCHF1 plays a significant role in regulating immune responses. This regulation is critical for ensuring that immune cells can respond appropriately to pathogens while avoiding excessive or inappropriate activation that could lead to autoimmunity. The activity of MARCHF1 in these cellular compartments underscores its importance in controlling the availability and turnover of proteins involved in immune signaling, thereby contributing to the proper functioning of the immune system.
