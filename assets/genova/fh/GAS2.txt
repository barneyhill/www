# GAS2

## Overview
The GAS2 gene encodes the growth arrest specific 2 protein, a cytoskeletal regulatory protein that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. This protein is characterized by its ability to interact with both actin filaments and microtubules, facilitated by its calponin homology (CH) domain and growth arrest-specific 2-related (GAR) domain, respectively. GAS2 is integral to maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell shape maintenance, intracellular transport, and cell division. It is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the liver, pancreas, and thymus, and is crucial for normal cellular function. Disruptions in GAS2 expression or function can lead to cytoskeletal abnormalities and increased apoptosis, contributing to conditions like hearing loss and chronic myeloid leukemia (Zhang2011GrowthArrestSpecific; Zhang2024A).

## Structure
The GAS2 protein, encoded by the GAS2 gene, is a cytoskeletal regulatory protein that plays a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It consists of a calponin homology (CH) domain at the N-terminus, which is crucial for actin binding, and a growth arrest-specific 2-related (GAR) domain at the C-terminus, which facilitates interactions with microtubules (Zhang2011GrowthArrestSpecific; Zhang2024A). The wild-type GAS2 protein is composed of 313 amino acids and includes five β-sheets and one α-helix in its C-terminal region (Zhang2024A).

A novel splice variant of GAS2, known as GAS2mu, results in a C-terminally truncated protein of 241 amino acids, which contains only two α-helices in the C-terminal region. This structural alteration disrupts the protein's ability to bind microtubules effectively (Zhang2024A). The retention of intron 6 in this variant leads to a new open reading frame and an in-frame stop codon, producing a protein with 205 amino acids from exons 2 to 6 and an additional 36 amino acids from intron 6 (Zhang2024A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate GAS2 activity, particularly during cell growth and arrest (Brancolini1992Gas2).

## Function
The GAS2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity by acting as a cross-linker between actin filaments and microtubules. This interaction is essential for the stability and organization of microtubules, particularly in cochlear supporting cells, where it helps maintain the stiffness properties necessary for sound wave propagation and amplification (Zhang2024A). The GAS2 protein contains a calponin homology (CH) domain and a growth arrest-specific 2-related (GAR) domain, which mediate its binding to actin filaments and microtubules, respectively (Zhang2024A). 

In healthy human cells, GAS2 is involved in regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis. It induces cell cycle arrest by suppressing the G1-to-S transition and acts as a proapoptotic factor, increasing susceptibility to p53-dependent apoptosis under stress conditions (Zhang2024A). GAS2 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, pancreas, and thymus, and is implicated in the regulation of cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, intracellular transport, and cell division (Zhang2024A). Its proper expression and function are necessary for normal cellular operations, and disruptions can lead to cytoskeletal abnormalities and increased apoptosis, contributing to conditions like hearing loss (Zhang2024A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GAS2 gene are associated with several diseases, notably autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In the context of hearing loss, a novel heterozygous pathogenic variant in the GAS2 gene, identified as c.616-2 A > G, has been linked to ADNSHL in a Chinese family. This variant results in the retention of intron 6 in the mature GAS2 mRNA, leading to a truncated protein that disrupts microtubule organization and increases apoptosis in cochlear supporting cells, ultimately causing hearing impairment (Zhang2024A). Another variant, c.723 + 1G > A, found in a Somalian family, also causes a C-terminal truncation of the GAS2 protein and is associated with hearing loss (Zhang2024A).

In CML, GAS2 is significantly upregulated in leukemic stem cells, contributing to their growth and persistence even after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This upregulation is associated with the disease's progression and relapse, making GAS2 a potential therapeutic target. Inhibition of GAS2 has been shown to reduce CML cell proliferation and increase sensitivity to treatments like imatinib (RamirezGuzman2024GAS2; Zhou2014Growth).

## Interactions
GAS2 (growth arrest specific 2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as apoptosis and cytoskeletal organization. One of the key interactions of GAS2 is with m-calpain, a Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease. GAS2 binds to m-calpain and inhibits its proteolytic activity on the p53 protein, leading to the accumulation of transcriptionally active p53 and increasing susceptibility to apoptosis (Benetti2001The). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of p53 levels and activity, particularly under genotoxic stress conditions (Benetti2001The).

GAS2 also interacts with the cytoskeleton, specifically with microtubules and F-actin. It stabilizes microtubules via its Gas2 domain and binds to polymerized F-actin through its actin-binding CH domain. This interaction is important for microtubule organization and stabilization, as demonstrated in Xenopus oocytes (Zhang2011GrowthArrestSpecific). GAS2's role in microtubule bundling and stabilization is further supported by its ability to inhibit cell division in Xenopus embryos, mimicking the effects of taxol, a microtubule-stabilizing agent (Zhang2011GrowthArrestSpecific).

These interactions highlight GAS2's involvement in both apoptosis regulation and cytoskeletal dynamics, underscoring its multifunctional role in cellular processes.
