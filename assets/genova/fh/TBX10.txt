# TBX10

## Overview
TBX10 is a gene that encodes the T-box transcription factor 10, a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, which are critical in regulating gene expression during developmental processes. The protein encoded by TBX10 is involved in the formation and differentiation of various tissues, including neural and craniofacial structures. It is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in modulating the expression of target genes. TBX10 is expressed in multiple human tissues, such as the brain, ovary, and fetal kidney, indicating its diverse biological functions (Law1998TBX10). In mice, TBX10 expression is noted in the developing hindbrain, where it contributes to the specification of interneurons, suggesting its importance in neural circuit formation (Xue2010A). Mutations in TBX10 have been linked to congenital disorders, including cleft lip and palate and microtia-atresia, underscoring its significance in craniofacial development (Fan2020WholeExome; Bush2004The).

## Function
TBX10 is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, which are involved in various developmental processes by regulating gene expression. In humans, TBX10 is expressed in several tissues, including the brain, ovary, uterus, pituitary, and fetal kidney, suggesting its involvement in diverse biological functions (Law1998TBX10). The gene is part of the TBX1 subfamily and shares high sequence similarity with TBX1, indicating potential overlapping roles in development (Law1998TBX10).

In mice, TBX10 is expressed in the developing hindbrain, where it marks a subpopulation of interneurons in the ventral pons, which are involved in local nerve circuits such as the vestibule-acoustic pathway (Xue2010A). This suggests that TBX10 may play a role in distinguishing specific groups of interneurons during development, contributing to the proper formation of neural circuits (Xue2010A). The expression pattern of TBX10 in the hindbrain is distinct, with cells expressing TBX10 not overlapping with facial motor neurons or vestibule-acoustic motor neurons, indicating a unique identity for these cells (Xue2010A).

The expression of TBX10 in female adult gonads suggests potential sex-specific functions, although its specific role in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Law1998TBX10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the TBX10 gene have been implicated in several congenital disorders and developmental abnormalities. In mice, a spontaneous mutation known as Dancer (Dc) results in cleft lip and palate (CL/P) due to a gain of function of the Tbx10 gene. This mutation involves a translocation insertion in the Tbx10 gene, leading to ectopic expression of a variant Tbx10 transcript, which is linked to the pathogenesis of CL/P (Bush2004The). In humans, TBX10 is located at chromosome 11q13, a region associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) (Ichikawa2005PAX9). 

TBX10 has also been identified as a potential high-risk candidate gene for microtia-atresia, a condition characterized by malformation of the external ear and atresia of the ear canal. A specific mutation, c.791C > T:p.P264L, in TBX10 is conserved across species and is suggested to affect the protein's function by altering its local secondary structure. This mutation may disrupt the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for craniofacial development (Fan2020WholeExome). These findings highlight the role of TBX10 in craniofacial and ear development, with mutations potentially leading to significant developmental disorders.
