# H2BC3

## Overview
H2BC3 is a gene that encodes the protein H2B clustered histone 3, which is a member of the histone family involved in the structural organization of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histones, including H2B clustered histone 3, play a critical role in the formation of nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, by interacting with other histones such as H2A, H3, and H4. This interaction facilitates the compaction of DNA and regulates gene expression. The H2BC3 gene has been implicated in various biological processes and disease states, including cancer and gestational diabetes mellitus, due to its involvement in chromosomal stability and gene regulation (Jafari2022Screening; Zhang2022Downregulation; Gan2023Identification). Mutations and expression alterations in H2BC3 have been associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, suggesting its potential role in oncogenesis and chromosomal instability (Ragusa2023Contribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the H2BC3 gene have been implicated in the development of aggressive cancer phenotypes, particularly through mechanisms involving chromosomal instability. Specifically, mutations at the acetylation site at Lys24 in H2BC3 have been reported in cases of neoplastic Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) of the skin. Although the number of patients studied was limited, these mutations were associated with particularly invasive disease, which is often linked to aneuploidy, suggesting a potential connection between H2BC3 mutations and aggressive cancer behavior (Ragusa2023Contribution).

In addition to mutations, alterations in the expression levels of H2BC3 have been observed in certain conditions. The gene is upregulated in aneuploid in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos, indicating a possible association with aneuploidy, although the clinical significance of this finding is not fully detailed (Ragusa2023Contribution). These findings suggest that both mutations and expression changes in H2BC3 may contribute to chromosomal instability and cancer progression, highlighting the gene's potential role in oncogenesis.

## Interactions
H2BC3, a histone protein, is involved in the formation of nucleosomes, which are essential for DNA packaging into chromatin. It interacts with other histones such as H2A, H3, and H4 to form the nucleosome core, playing a crucial role in DNA compaction and regulation of gene expression. In the context of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), H2BC3 was identified as a significant node in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, indicating its potential importance in cellular processes related to cancer. The PPI network analysis highlighted H2BC3 as having a high degree of interaction, suggesting its involvement in complex cellular interactions (Zhang2022Downregulation).

In pancreatic cancer research, H2BC3 was identified among histone-encoding genes that may play a role in cancer prognosis. Although specific interactions were not detailed, its inclusion in a network of differentially expressed genes suggests its involvement in cancer-related pathways (Jafari2022Screening). In studies on gestational diabetes mellitus, H2BC3 was identified as one of the hub genes, with its expression reduced in the condition, indicating its potential role in disease mechanisms (Gan2023Identification). These findings underscore the significance of H2BC3 in various biological contexts, particularly in disease states.
