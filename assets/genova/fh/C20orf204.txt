# C20orf204

## Overview
C20orf204 is a gene located on chromosome 20 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 20 open reading frame 204, or C20orf204-189AA. This protein is primarily associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is not typically expressed in normal liver tissues. C20orf204-189AA is involved in cellular processes such as ribosomal RNA transcription and cell proliferation, functioning as a cancer-specific fine tuner. It interacts with nucleolin, a protein crucial for ribosomal RNA synthesis, forming a complex that enhances rRNA transcription and stabilizes nucleolin levels, thereby promoting cell proliferation. The gene's expression is regulated by the protooncogene transcription factor Myc, and its expression levels are correlated with tumor differentiation and patient survival, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for HCC (Burbano2021C20orf204).

## Clinical Significance
The C20orf204 gene, also known as Linc00176, has been identified as having clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The gene encodes a protein, C20orf204-189AA, which is predominantly expressed in HCC and not in normal liver tissues. This protein is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and ribosomal RNA transcription, suggesting its role as a cancer-specific fine tuner (Burbano2021C20orf204). The expression levels of C20orf204-189AA correlate with tumor differentiation grade and patient survival, indicating its potential as a biomarker for HCC (Burbano2021C20orf204). The gene is activated by the protooncogene transcription factor Myc and is expressed at high levels in HCC, but at low levels or not at all in normal human liver or other organs (Burbano2021C20orf204).

C20orf204-189AA interacts with nucleolin and ribosomal RNA, stabilizing nucleolin and promoting rRNA transcription, which supports cell proliferation (Burbano2021C20orf204). This interaction is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC and potentially for developing targeted therapies (Burbano2021C20orf204). The study suggests that targeting C20orf204 could be a useful strategy for cancer therapy, as it is a cancer type-specific fine tuner involved in HCC formation (Burbano2021C20orf204).

## Interactions
The C20orf204 protein, specifically the C20orf204-189AA variant, is known to interact with nucleolin, a protein involved in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and cell proliferation. This interaction is significant in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, where C20orf204-189AA forms a trimer complex with nucleolin and rRNA, influencing cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis (Burbano2021C20orf204). The C-terminal domain of C20orf204-189AA (73-189AA) serves as the primary binding site for nucleolin, and this interaction is not RNA-mediated, as it persists even in the presence of RNAse. In contrast, the N-terminal domain (1-74AA) shows weaker, RNA-dependent binding to nucleolin (Burbano2021C20orf204).

C20orf204-189AA also stabilizes nucleolin, leading to increased nucleolin protein levels in the nucleus, which enhances rRNA transcription. This is evidenced by a 2.5-fold increase in 47S rRNA levels in cells overexpressing C20orf204-189AA compared to controls (Burbano2021C20orf204). The presence of C20orf204-189AA affects the binding of nucleolin to rRNA, as demonstrated by the detection of 28S rRNA in GST-C20orf204-189AA bound fractions (Burbano2021C20orf204). These interactions suggest that C20orf204-189AA plays a role in promoting cell proliferation and may contribute to HCC development (Burbano2021C20orf204).
