# TGOLN2

## Overview
The TGOLN2 gene encodes the trans-golgi network protein 2, which is a crucial component of the trans-Golgi network, a key subcellular structure involved in the sorting and trafficking of proteins and lipids within the cell. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the Golgi apparatus. The trans-Golgi network protein 2 is involved in the regulation of vesicular transport processes, which are essential for the proper delivery of cellular components to their designated locations. Mutations or dysregulation of TGOLN2 can have implications in various cellular dysfunctions and diseases, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and pathology (Qiu2020aarFDC).
