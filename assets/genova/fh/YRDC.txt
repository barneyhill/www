# YRDC

## Overview
The YRDC gene encodes the yrdC N6-threonylcarbamoyltransferase domain containing protein, which is integral to the biosynthesis of threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) in tRNA. This protein is categorized as a threonylcarbamoyltransferase and is essential for accurate and efficient protein translation, as it facilitates the binding of tRNAs to ribosomes. The YRDC protein is characterized by a conserved sua5-yciO-yrdC domain and an alpha/beta twisted open-sheet fold, which are crucial for its function in tRNA modification and nucleic acid binding (Chen2003Isolation; Teplova2000The). It is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with higher levels in the liver, pancreas, and certain tumor tissues, indicating its significant role in various physiological and pathological processes (Chen2003Isolation). Mutations in the YRDC gene have been linked to several disorders, including Galloway-Mowat syndrome and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal health (Arrondel2019Defects; Huang2019Modulation).

## Structure
The YRDC protein, encoded by the human YRDC gene, contains a conserved sua5-yciO-yrdC domain, which is crucial for its function in tRNA modification (Chen2003Isolation). This domain is part of a larger family known for its role in the biosynthesis of threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) in tRNA, a modification important for translation (El2009The). The YRDC protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in cellular processes (Chen2003Isolation).

Structurally, the YRDC protein features an alpha/beta twisted open-sheet fold, characterized by a positively charged concave surface that is suggestive of a nucleic-acid-binding site (Harris2011YrdC; Teplova2000The). This structure is consistent with its function in binding double-stranded RNA, including tRNA (El2009The). The protein also contains a GTP-binding elongation factor signature and a leucine zipper pattern, which may facilitate protein dimerization and nucleic acid binding (Kaczanowska2005The; Chen2003Isolation).

The YRDC protein is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with higher expression levels in the liver, pancreas, and certain tumor tissues, suggesting a role in various physiological and pathological processes (Chen2003Isolation).

## Function
The YRDC gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A), a modified nucleoside found in tRNA. This modification is essential for accurate and efficient protein translation, as it enhances the binding of tRNAs to ribosomes, thereby maintaining the reading frame during translation (El2009The; Arrondel2019Defects). The YRDC protein functions in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it participates in the synthesis of an intermediate called L-threonylcarbamoyl adenylate (TC-AMP), which is crucial for the t6A modification of tRNA (Zhou2020Molecular).

In healthy human cells, YRDC is involved in maintaining normal cellular functions, including protein synthesis and cell proliferation. It is part of the threonylcarbamoyltransferase complex, contributing to cellular protein synthesis and overall organismal growth and development (Arrondel2019Defects). The protein's activity is particularly important in highly proliferative cells, such as neuronal progenitors, which require t6A-modified tRNAs for cell-type-specific and cell-cycle-dependent processes (Arrondel2019Defects). The YRDC gene is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with higher expression levels in the liver, pancreas, and tumor tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Chen2003Isolation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the YRDC gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), YRDC is upregulated, promoting cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. High YRDC expression correlates with reduced overall survival, making it an independent prognostic factor in HCC (Huang2019Modulation). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), YRDC is also upregulated and linked to poor prognosis, with high expression associated with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival times. Silencing YRDC in NSCLC cells inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis, suggesting its role as an oncogenic factor (Shen2020YRDC).

Mutations in YRDC are linked to a developmental disorder with progeroid features, characterized by symptoms such as microcephaly, growth retardation, and premature death. These mutations result in defective tRNA modification, telomere shortening, and increased genomic instability, contributing to accelerated aging phenotypes (Schmidt2021Biallelic). YRDC mutations are also implicated in Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS), a rare neuro-renal disorder. These mutations disrupt t6A biosynthesis, leading to severe renal and neurological manifestations, including early-onset nephrotic syndrome and microcephaly (Arrondel2019Defects).

## Interactions
The YRDC protein is involved in the biosynthesis of threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) in tRNA, a modification crucial for translational accuracy and efficiency. YRDC interacts with tRNA and ATP, playing a direct role in the t6A biosynthesis pathway. It binds preferentially to modified tRNA Thr, which contains t6A, with high affinity, indicating its involvement in the modification process (El2009The). YRDC is also part of the KEOPS complex, which is essential for the t6A modification. This complex includes subunits such as GON7, LAGE3, OSGEP, TP53RK, and TPRKB. YRDC synthesizes an unstable intermediate, threonylcarbamoyl-AMP (TC-AMP), which is then used by the KEOPS complex to modify tRNA (Arrondel2019Defects).

Mutations in YRDC can lead to defects in t6A modification, impacting the stability and enzymatic activity of the KEOPS complex. These mutations are associated with Galloway-Mowat syndrome, a rare neuro-renal disorder (Arrondel2019Defects). The interaction of YRDC with the KEOPS complex and its role in tRNA modification highlight its importance in maintaining cellular function and protein synthesis.
