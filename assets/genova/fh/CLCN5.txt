# CLCN5

## Overview
The CLCN5 gene encodes the chloride voltage-gated channel 5 (ClC-5), a transmembrane protein that functions as a chloride/proton exchanger. This protein is predominantly expressed in the kidney, particularly within the proximal tubule cells, where it plays a critical role in endocytosis and the acidification of endosomes, essential for protein reabsorption from primary urine (Günther1998ClC5; Jentsch2018CLC). ClC-5 is characterized by its ability to form homo- and hetero-dimers and contains cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domains that regulate its activity (Gianesello2020From; Gianesello2020Genetic). Mutations in the CLCN5 gene are linked to Dent's disease, an X-linked recessive disorder that results in impaired renal function due to defective chloride ion transport and endosomal acidification (Gianesello2020From; Friedrich1999Mutational). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4.2 and the scaffold protein NHERF2, further underscore its importance in maintaining renal tubular cell function and its involvement in various cellular processes (Reed2010CLC5; Wellhauser2010ClC).

## Structure
The CLCN5 gene encodes the ClC-5 protein, which is a chloride channel involved in renal function. The canonical isoform of ClC-5 consists of 746 amino acids, while an alternative isoform comprises 816 amino acids, though the biological significance of the latter is not fully understood (Gianesello2020From). The secondary structure of ClC-5 includes 18 α-helices, labeled A to R. Helices B, H, I, O, P, and Q are crucial for forming the dimer interface, which is necessary for proper pore configuration. Helices D, F, N, and R contribute to the chloride selectivity filter (Gianesello2020From).

ClC-5 has a large cytoplasmic C-terminus containing two cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domains, which regulate its activity. Mutations in these domains can affect the protein's electrical activity and its targeting to the plasma membrane and early endosomes (Gianesello2020Genetic). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which is important for protein folding and oligomerization (Durán2021Novel). ClC-5 can form homo- and hetero-dimers due to sequence homology with ClC-3 and ClC-4, indicating a quaternary structure (Gianesello2020From).

## Function
The CLCN5 gene encodes the ClC-5 protein, a chloride/proton exchanger primarily expressed in the kidney, particularly in the proximal tubule cells. ClC-5 plays a crucial role in endocytosis by facilitating the acidification of endosomes, which is essential for the reabsorption of proteins from the primary urine (Günther1998ClC5; Jentsch2018CLC). This protein functions as a 2 Cl-/H+ antiporter, maintaining the balance of chloride ions and protons across the endosomal membrane, which is vital for proper endosomal acidification and function (Stauber2012Cell; Jentsch2018CLC).

ClC-5 is involved in the reabsorption of low-molecular-weight proteins and calcium, contributing to the prevention of proteinuria (Devuyst1999Intrarenal). It colocalizes with the H+-ATPase in endocytotic vesicles, providing an electrical shunt necessary for efficient vesicle acidification (Günther1998ClC5). The protein is also expressed in other tissues, such as the intestine and brain, indicating a broader role in absorptive epithelia (Jentsch2018CLC). Mutations in CLCN5 can lead to Dent's disease, characterized by impaired endocytosis and protein reabsorption, resulting in symptoms like proteinuria and hypercalciuria (Gianesello2020From; Friedrich1999Mutational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLCN5 gene are primarily associated with Dent's disease, an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by kidney dysfunction, including low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and progressive renal failure (Grand2009Novel; Lloyd1997Characterisation). Dent's disease is caused by mutations that affect the ClC-5 protein, leading to impaired chloride ion transport and endosomal acidification in renal proximal tubular cells (Gianesello2020From; MansourHendili2015Mutation). 

The CLCN5 gene mutations can be classified into different types based on their impact on protein function. Type-I mutations, such as G212A, allow the protein to reach the plasma membrane but result in reduced ion currents. Type-II mutations lead to improper glycosylation and retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, rendering it nonfunctional (Grand2009Novel). 

In addition to Dent's disease, CLCN5 mutations are linked to other hereditary disorders, including X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis and X-linked recessive hypophosphatemic rickets, which share overlapping phenotypes such as nephrocalcinosis and renal failure (Lloyd1997Characterisation; Igarashi1998Functional). These conditions are considered variants of a single disorder due to their common genetic etiology (Scheinman1998Xlinked).

## Interactions
The CLCN5 gene encodes the ClC-5 protein, which is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that regulate its function in renal tubular cells. ClC-5 interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4.2, which binds to a proline-rich PY motif in its C-terminus, promoting mono-ubiquitination and targeting ClC-5 into the endocytic pathway (Wellhauser2010ClC). It also interacts with cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing protein, which is essential for endocytosis by affecting the actin cytoskeleton and facilitating endosomal budding (Wellhauser2010ClC).

ClC-5 forms a complex with the scaffold protein NHERF2, which modulates its presence at the plasma membrane and links it to other regulatory proteins, potentially facilitating efficient endosomal acidification (Wellhauser2010ClC). The protein also interacts with KIF3B, a kinesin family member, which aids in the transport of ClC-5-containing vesicles along microtubules, crucial for plasma membrane expression and endocytosis (Reed2010CLC5).

These interactions are significant for ClC-5's role in receptor-mediated endocytosis and microtubular transport, highlighting its involvement in cellular processes related to Dent's disease (Reed2010CLC5).
