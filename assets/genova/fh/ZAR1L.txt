# ZAR1L

## Overview
ZAR1L, or Zygote Arrest 1 Like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in early embryonic development. The ZAR1L protein is implicated in crucial cellular processes, including mRNA processing and regulation, through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to colocalize with components of P-bodies and chromatoid bodies, which are involved in mRNA regulation and germline development, respectively (Hu2010Mouse). The protein's interaction with LIN28, a key regulator of developmental timing, further underscores its role in mRNA stability and degradation (Hu2010Mouse). Additionally, ZAR1L is essential for proper chromatin modification and RNA synthesis, as evidenced by the embryonic arrest observed in mouse models with a C-terminal mutant of ZAR1L, which affects chromatin-modification genes and histone methylation patterns (Hu2010Mouse).

## Structure


## Interactions
ZAR1L is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in early embryonic development. It colocalizes with P-body components such as EIF2C1 (AGO1), EIF2C2 (AGO2), DDX6, and LSM14A, as well as germline-specific chromatoid body components like PIWIL1, PIWIL2, and LIN28 in both somatic and embryonic cells (Hu2010Mouse). These interactions suggest that ZAR1L may be involved in mRNA processing and regulation.

ZAR1L also interacts with human LIN28, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis, which identified ZAR1L as a component of the 60-kD band in lysates from LIN28-Flag-EGFP immunoprecipitation (Hu2010Mouse). This interaction is further supported by Western blotting, indicating a potential role in regulating mRNA stability or degradation (Hu2010Mouse).

In mouse embryos, the ZAR1L C-terminal mutant has been shown to cause a two-cell-stage embryonic arrest, affecting chromatin modification and RNA synthesis. This mutant downregulates chromatin-modification genes such as Dppa2, Dppa4, and Piwil2, and alters histone methylation patterns, suggesting that ZAR1L interacts with chromatin and RNA synthesis machinery (Hu2010Mouse).
