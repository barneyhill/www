# FCMR

## Overview
The FCMR gene encodes the Fc mu receptor (FcμR), a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by binding the Fc region of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. This receptor is primarily expressed on B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, where it modulates immune responses and maintains B cell homeostasis. Structurally, FcμR is characterized by a V-set Ig-like domain, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail, which are essential for its function in immune signaling and IgM binding (Kubagawa2014The; Liu2019Role). The receptor's interactions with IgM are crucial for B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and the regulation of natural IgM and autoantibody production, impacting immune tolerance and responses to pathogens (Nguyen2017The; Liu2019Role). Alterations in FCMR expression have been linked to autoimmune diseases and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance in disease progression and as a potential prognostic marker (Honjo2014Enhanced; Li2011Enhanced).

## Structure
The FCMR gene encodes the FcμR (Fc mu receptor), a type I transmembrane protein involved in binding the Fc region of IgM antibodies. The primary structure of FcμR includes a 390-amino acid sequence with a 17-amino acid signal peptide, a 107-amino acid V-set Ig-like domain responsible for IgM binding, a 127-amino acid extracellular stalk region, a 21-amino acid transmembrane segment, and a 118-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (Kubagawa2014The). The transmembrane segment contains a charged histidine residue, which is crucial for anchoring the receptor in the plasma membrane (Kubagawa2023Physiological).

The secondary and tertiary structures of FcμR have not been fully detailed, but structural modeling suggests that the Ig-like domain adopts a typical immunoglobulin fold, interacting with specific residues on the Fcμ-Cμ4 domain of IgM (Li2023Immunoglobulin). The receptor is a sialoglycoprotein, with one-third of its mass being carbohydrate moieties, and it contains several O-linked glycosylation sites in the stalk region (Kubagawa2014The).

A notable splice variant of FcμR results in a soluble form, solFcμR, which is smaller than the membrane-bound form and is found in the serum of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (Kubagawa2023Physiological).

## Function
The FCMR gene encodes the Fc mu receptor (FcµR), a type I transmembrane protein that specifically binds to the Fc portion of IgM antibodies. This receptor is predominantly expressed on B cells, T cells, and NK cells in humans, and plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses (Liu2019Role). FcµR is involved in the regulation of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling by controlling the expression and transport of membrane-bound IgM (mIgM) on developing B cells. This regulation is essential for maintaining B cell homeostasis and influences B cell development and reactivity (Nguyen2017The).

In healthy human cells, FcµR interacts with both secreted and membrane forms of IgM, facilitating the binding of natural IgM to the surface of B cells and influencing IgM-BCR surface expression (Nguyen2017The). The receptor's intracellular domain contains tyrosine residues and an immunoglobulin tail tyrosine (ITT) phosphorylation motif, which can amplify BCR signals, supporting B cell survival and maturation (Wang2016Emerging). FcµR also plays a role in immune homeostasis by regulating the production of natural IgM and autoantibodies, impacting B cell tolerance and immune responses to pathogens (Liu2019Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FCMR gene, which encodes the Fc mu receptor (FcμR), have been implicated in several diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), FcμR deficiency leads to increased levels of pre-immune serum IgM and natural auto-antibodies of both IgM and IgG isotypes. This deficiency results in the earlier appearance of auto-antibodies against dsDNA or chromatin, although it does not affect the severity of renal pathology or survival in mouse models (Honjo2014Enhanced). FcμR plays a critical role in regulating auto-antibody production and B cell differentiation, suggesting its importance in maintaining immune balance (Honjo2014Enhanced).

In CLL, both membrane-bound and soluble forms of FcμR are elevated in patients compared to healthy individuals. This overexpression is associated with disease progression and may serve as a prognostic marker. Higher FCMR mRNA levels are observed in advanced stages of CLL, indicating a potential link to disease progression and survival (Hancer2011Overexpression; Li2011Enhanced). The soluble form of FcμR, resulting from an alternatively spliced transcript, is also found in the serum of CLL patients, correlating with lymphocyte counts (Kubagawa2023Physiological).

## Interactions
The Fc mu receptor (FCMR) interacts with various forms of Immunoglobulin M (IgM), including monomeric, pentameric, and hexameric IgM. FCMR is the only IgM-specific receptor in mammals and can form a 2:1 complex with monomeric IgM, which is part of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, playing a crucial role in B-cell activation (Li2023Immunoglobulin). In the case of pentameric IgM, FCMR can recruit four molecules to bind on the same side, forming an oligomer, which is significant for the retrotransport of secretory IgM (SIgM) (Li2023Immunoglobulin).

FCMR also interacts with the Fcμ-Cμ4 domain and the Fcμ-J complex, forming a 2:1 complex with the Fcμ-Cμ4 dimer and a 4:1 complex with the Fcμ-J platform (Li2023Immunoglobulin). Specific amino acid residues in FCMR, such as N66, K79-R83, and N109, are critical for IgM binding, with interactions primarily involving the Cμ4 domain of IgM (Skopnik2021Identification). These interactions are glycan-independent, as demonstrated by the binding and internalization of IgM by FCMR without the need for glycans (Lloyd2017Glycanindependent).
