# ACBD7

## Overview
The ACBD7 gene encodes the acyl-CoA binding domain containing 7 protein, which is a member of the acyl-CoA binding domain-containing family. This protein is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, playing a crucial role in the regulation of energy balance within cells. ACBD7 is particularly significant in the hypothalamus, where it influences food intake and energy expenditure by interacting with leptin-sensitive neurons. The protein can be processed into nonadecaneuropeptide (NDN), which acts as an anorexigenic signal, reducing food intake and promoting energy expenditure. Beyond its metabolic functions, ACBD7 is also implicated in neurogenesis and steroidogenesis, underscoring its importance in brain function and development (Tonon2020Endozepines; Lanfray2016Involvement).

## Function
The ACBD7 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in energy homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and neurogenesis in vertebrates, including humans. The ACBD7 protein is part of the acyl-CoA binding domain-containing family and is involved in binding acyl-CoA, a crucial molecule in lipid metabolism. This binding is essential for the regulation of energy balance within cells, contributing to the maintenance of cellular and organismal energy homeostasis (Tonon2020Endozepines).

In the hypothalamus, ACBD7 is involved in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. It is overexpressed in neurons sensitive to leptin, a hormone that suppresses appetite. The protein can be processed into a smaller molecule called nonadecaneuropeptide (NDN), which reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure, acting as an anorexigenic signal (Lanfray2016Involvement).

ACBD7 is also implicated in adult neurogenesis and steroidogenesis, highlighting its importance in brain function and development. The protein's activity is supported by evidence from expressed sequence tags (ESTs), indicating its involvement in critical physiological processes (Tonon2020Endozepines).

## Clinical Significance
The ACBD7 gene has been implicated in several metabolic and neurological conditions due to its role in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation. Alterations in ACBD7 expression or mutations may contribute to obesity, as the gene is involved in the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin pathway, which regulates food intake and energy expenditure (Lanfray2016Involvement). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACBD7 have been associated with morbid obesity in humans, suggesting a potential clinical significance in energy balance regulation (Lanfray2016Involvement).

In the context of anorexia nervosa (AN), a splicing variant in the ACBD7 gene was identified in a patient, indicating that alterations in this gene might impact feeding behavior and energy balance, which are critical in AN (donato2023genetic). Although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, these findings suggest that ACBD7 could play a role in the pathophysiology of eating disorders.

Additionally, ACBD7 expression has been studied in the context of Hürthle cell carcinoma (HCC), where it was found to be significantly upregulated compared to benign nodules, indicating its potential as a biomarker for distinguishing HCC from benign conditions (Li2018CHL1).
