# PTH1R

## Overview
The PTH1R gene encodes the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor, a critical component of the class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is integral to the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, primarily through its interactions with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). The PTH1R protein is predominantly expressed in bone and kidney tissues, where it mediates essential physiological processes such as bone remodeling and mineral ion balance. Structurally, PTH1R is characterized by a complex architecture that includes a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain with seven helices, and a carboxy-terminal tail, facilitating its role in ligand binding and signal transduction (Pioszak2008Molecular; Gardella2015International). Mutations in the PTH1R gene are linked to various skeletal disorders, underscoring its significance in bone development and mineral metabolism (Demaret2022Case; Subramanian2016PTH1R).

## Structure
The parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) is a member of the class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PTH1R consists of 593 amino acids, including a 22-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide (Gardella2015International). The receptor features a large extracellular domain (ECD) of approximately 165 amino acids, a transmembrane domain (TMD) with seven membrane-spanning helices, and a carboxy-terminal tail of about 130 amino acids (Gardella2015International).

The secondary structure of the PTH1R ECD is organized into a three-layer alpha-beta-beta-alpha fold, stabilized by three interlayer disulfide bonds: C48-C117, C108-C148, and C131-C170 (Pioszak2008Molecular). The ECD also contains two α-helices and four β-strands (Pioszak2008Molecular). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices in the transmembrane domain, forming a hydrophobic groove for ligand binding (Pioszak2008Molecular).

PTH1R undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function. The receptor can exist in different splice variant isoforms, potentially influencing its activity and signaling pathways (Gardella2015International). The receptor's structure and dynamics are crucial for its role in calcium homeostasis and bone maintenance.

## Function
The parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a critical role in regulating calcium and phosphate homeostasis in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in bone and kidney tissues, where it mediates the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (Mannstadt2020The; Goltzman2018Physiology). In bone, PTH1R activation stimulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, leading to bone matrix production and mineralization, while also promoting osteoclast activity and bone resorption (Goltzman2018Physiology). This dual action is crucial for maintaining bone remodeling and mineral ion homeostasis (Cheloha2015PTH).

In the kidneys, PTH1R is involved in the reabsorption of calcium and the excretion of phosphate. It enhances calcium reabsorption in the distal nephron and inhibits phosphate reabsorption by downregulating sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporters (Mannstadt2020The; Goltzman2018Physiology). PTH1R signaling involves the activation of the Gas/adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (PKA) and Gq/11/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways, which are essential for its calcemic and phosphaturic actions (Mannstadt2020The). These molecular processes are vital for maintaining systemic mineral ion balance and ensuring proper skeletal and renal function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTH1R gene are associated with several disorders affecting bone development and tooth eruption. Primary failure of tooth eruption (PFE) is a condition linked to PTH1R mutations, characterized by the inability of teeth, particularly posterior ones, to emerge through the gums. This results in a severe lateral open bite and growth deficiency of the alveolar process (Grippaudo2021Validating; Subramanian2016PTH1R). Over 40 mutations, including deletions and missense mutations, have been identified in PTH1R, which can disrupt G-protein signaling and affect bone remodeling (Subramanian2016PTH1R).

PTH1R mutations are also implicated in Blomstrand chondrodysplasia, a lethal condition with premature ossification, and Eiken syndrome, characterized by retarded ossification (PortalesCastillo2023Altered; Subramanian2016PTH1R). Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (JMC) is another disorder associated with PTH1R mutations, leading to dwarfism and metabolic imbalances due to constitutive receptor activity (PortalesCastillo2023Altered; Savoldi2013Prenatal).

Inactivating mutations in PTH1R can cause PTH resistance, leading to conditions such as hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, as seen in a case of a child with a homozygous PTH1R mutation (Demaret2022Case). These mutations highlight the critical role of PTH1R in maintaining normal bone and mineral metabolism.

## Interactions
The parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in signaling pathways related to calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. PTH1R interacts with Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factors (NHERF) 1 and 2 through PDZ-domain interactions. NHERF2, in particular, binds to phospholipase Cb1 and the C-terminal PDZ consensus motif of PTH1R, facilitating the activation of phospholipase Cb and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase through inhibitory G proteins (Mahon2002Na+H+). This interaction is significant for the regulation of PTH signaling in cells, especially in polarized cells expressing NHERF (Mahon2002Na+H+).

NHERF1, also known as ezrin-binding protein 50 (EBP50), interacts with PTHR through its PDZ domains, affecting receptor signaling and trafficking. NHERF1 can switch PTHR signaling from adenylyl cyclase to phospholipase C, influencing receptor activation and internalization (Vilardaga2010Molecular). The presence of NHERF1 modulates PTHR coupling to different G proteins and affects receptor desensitization, preventing PTH resistance or PTHR down-regulation (Vilardaga2010Molecular).

PTH1R also forms a multiprotein complex with PLCb1 and NHERF2, requiring intact PDZ interaction motifs, which is crucial for signaling pathways involving intracellular calcium and inositol phosphates (Mahon2002Na+H+).
