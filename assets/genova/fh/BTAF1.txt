# BTAF1

## Overview
BTAF1 is a gene that encodes the B-TFIID TATA-box binding protein associated factor 1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells. The BTAF1 protein is a member of the SNF2-like family of ATPases, characterized by its ability to interact with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form the B-TFIID complex, which is essential for RNA polymerase II transcription initiation (Pereira2003Roles; Wansleeben2011An). This protein is involved in modulating TBP's activity, including its removal from TATA-box DNA through ATP hydrolysis, thereby influencing transcriptional dynamics (Pereira2003Roles). BTAF1's structure includes distinct regions with TBP-binding domains and an ATPase domain, which are crucial for its function (Pereira2003Roles; Wansleeben2011An). The gene's expression and the protein's activity have been linked to various biological processes and diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in cellular function and potential as a therapeutic target (Xia2022Depletion; Wansleeben2011An).

## Structure
The BTAF1 protein is a member of the SNF2-like family of ATPases and plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by interacting with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (Pereira2003Roles; Wansleeben2011An). The protein is approximately 200 kDa and can be divided into three distinct regions based on homology (Pereira2003Roles). The amino-terminal third contains TBP-binding domains and putative HEAT/ARM repeat structures, which are hydrophobic sequences forming superhelical structures (Pereira2003Roles). These repeats facilitate interaction with TBP and are crucial for TBP engagement (Klejman2005Mutational).

The central region of BTAF1, consisting of about 600 amino acids, shows little homology and its function is not well understood, though it may serve as a linker or interaction domain (Pereira2003Roles). The carboxyl-terminal third is highly conserved and contains the ATPase domain, which is essential for the protein's function in mobilizing TBP from chromatin (Pereira2003Roles; Wansleeben2011An). The ATPase domain is involved in ATP-dependent interactions with TBP, and mutations in this domain can lead to protein instability and functional impairment (Wansleeben2011An).

BTAF1 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its structure and function (Wansleeben2011An).

## Function
BTAF1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of transcription in human cells. It is involved in modulating the activity of the TATA-binding protein (TBP), which is essential for the initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription. BTAF1 forms a complex with TBP, known as B-TFIID, which can bind to promoter DNA and support basal transcription in vitro (Pereira2003Roles; Klejman2005Mutational). This complex is distinct from the canonical TFIID complex and is involved in the dynamic regulation of TBP function, including the removal of TBP from TATA-box DNA through ATP hydrolysis (Pereira2003Roles).

BTAF1 is a member of the SNF2-like family of ATPases and interacts with TBP through several regions in its N-terminal third, which coincide with predicted HEAT/ARM repeats (Klejman2005Mutational). This interaction is crucial for altering the TATA-box binding specificity of TBP, allowing it to recruit DNA-binding defective TBP mutants to both TATA-containing and TATA-less DNA (Klejman2005Mutational). BTAF1's ATPase activity is synergistically activated by the presence of both TBP and DNA, highlighting its role in transcription regulation (Pereira2003Roles).

## Clinical Significance
BTAF1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in transcription regulation. In osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, BTAF1 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with metastasis, recurrence, and lower survival rates in patients. Silencing BTAF1 in osteosarcoma cells reduces their colony-forming ability, indicating its importance in tumor growth. BTAF1 is involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process via the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor metastasis and progression. These findings suggest that BTAF1 could serve as a diagnostic marker and prognostic factor for osteosarcoma, and its depletion may offer new treatment strategies (Xia2022Depletion).

In mice, a point mutation in the Btaf1 gene leads to post-gastrulation embryonic lethality and protein instability. This mutation affects the ATPase domain of BTAF1, resulting in growth retardation and developmental delays. The mutation likely causes conformational changes that lead to protein instability, affecting transcription regulation and gene expression related to heart development and hematopoiesis (Wansleeben2011An).

## Interactions
BTAF1 interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form the B-TFIID complex, which plays a crucial role in RNA polymerase II transcription. BTAF1 binds to TBP at both the concave, DNA-binding surface and the convex side, particularly in helix 2. This interaction is essential as BTAF1 can rescue DNA-binding defective TBP mutants, enabling them to bind to both TATA-containing and TATA-less DNA (Pereira2003Roles; Klejman2005Mutational).

BTAF1 also interacts with the NC2 complex, specifically with the NC2α subunit, but not with NC2β. NC2α stimulates the ATP-dependent association of BTAF1 with TBP, enhancing the formation of a quaternary complex with TBP and DNA. This interaction is independent of DNA and does not require ATP hydrolysis or NC2α phosphorylation (Klejman2004NC2α).

BTAF1's interaction with TBP involves multiple surfaces, including the convex and concave surfaces, and specific residues on TBP such as K243, K145, K127, K133, and K138 are critical for these interactions. The amino-terminal third of BTAF1 contains HEAT/ARM repeats, providing a large interface for engaging TBP (Pereira2003Roles).
