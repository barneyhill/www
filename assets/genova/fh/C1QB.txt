# C1QB

## Overview
The C1QB gene encodes the B chain of the complement protein C1q, a critical component of the classical complement pathway involved in immune response. The C1q protein, which includes the C1qB chain, is a hexameric assembly that plays a pivotal role in recognizing and binding antibodies attached to pathogens, thereby initiating the complement cascade. This cascade is essential for immune functions such as opsonophagocytosis, inflammation, and cytolysis. Beyond its role in pathogen defense, C1q is also involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells, contributing to immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune diseases. The protein is primarily produced by macrophages and dendritic cells and is active in the extracellular space, where it modulates immune responses and maintains tissue integrity (Kouser2015Emerging; Lu2017C1).

## Structure
The C1QB gene encodes the B chain of the complement protein C1q, which is a crucial component of the classical complement pathway. The C1q protein is composed of 18 polypeptide chains, including C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC, forming a bouquet-like structure with a base stalk made from the N-terminal collagen domains of these chains (Tom2005The). The C1q molecule is a hexameric assembly, with each branch consisting of a single C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC chain, stabilized by inter- and intrachain disulfide bonds (Tom2005The).

The C-terminal globular domain of C1q, known as the gC1q domain, is crucial for ligand recognition and is composed of three modules: ghA, ghB, and ghC. These modules form a heterotrimeric structure with a jelly-roll topology, consisting of a 10-stranded beta-sandwich (Ghai2007C1q). The gC1q domain is stabilized by non-polar interactions, hydrogen bonds, and a calcium ion, contributing to its ability to bind various ligands (Ghai2007C1q). The structure of C1q includes a single calcium ion that plays a crucial role in ligand recognition and complement activation (Ghai2007C1q). The protein's structure is characterized by a high degree of structural integrity due to eight invariant residues, which are crucial for the formation or stabilization of the hydrophobic core (Tom2005The).

## Function
The C1QB gene encodes the B-chain of the complement component C1q, which is a crucial part of the classical complement pathway. C1q is a hexameric protein composed of 18 polypeptide chains, including those encoded by C1QB, and is involved in the recognition and binding of antibodies attached to pathogens. This binding initiates the complement cascade, leading to the activation of associated proteases C1r and C1s, which further triggers a series of immune responses aimed at eliminating target microorganisms through opsonophagocytosis, inflammation, and cytolysis (Bally2013Expression; Lu2017C1).

C1q also plays a significant role in the clearance of apoptotic cells, thereby preventing the accumulation of apoptotic bodies and complement components in tissues, which could otherwise lead to autoimmunity. This function is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (Kouser2015Emerging). C1q is primarily produced by macrophages and dendritic cells and is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to immune homeostasis and tissue integrity (Lu2017C1). The protein's ability to bind various ligands and receptors allows it to modulate immune responses and maintain peripheral self-tolerance (Kouser2015Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the C1QB gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Hereditary C1q deficiency (C1QDef), caused by biallelic germline mutations in C1QA, C1QB, and C1QC genes, leads to defective complement pathway activation. This condition is linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like manifestations, characterized by central nervous system involvement, mucocutaneous and renal manifestations, and a susceptibility to severe infections. Patients with C1QDef often exhibit elevated expression of interferon-stimulated genes and increased levels of interferon alpha, suggesting a potential classification as a monogenic type 1 interferonopathy (Triaille2024Hereditary).

In gastric cancer, high expression of C1QB is negatively associated with patient prognosis. The gene's expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and it is correlated with immune factors such as CD8+ T cell infiltration and immune checkpoints, indicating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Jiang2020Identification).

In Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, reduced expression of C1QB and other C1Q complex genes has been observed. This downregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease, potentially due to reduced microglial activation or expression in neurons (Lin2016Transcriptome).

## Interactions
C1QB, as part of the C1 complex, interacts with C1qA and C1qC chains to form the C1q complex, which is a crucial component of the classical complement pathway. This complex is responsible for binding to antibodies, specifically the Fc regions of IgG and IgM, facilitating the activation of the complement cascade (Kouser2015Emerging; Ghai2007C1q). The C1q complex, including C1QB, also interacts with serine proteases C1r and C1s, which are essential for the activation of the classical pathway, leading to a series of immune responses aimed at pathogen elimination (Kouser2015Emerging).

C1QB, through its involvement in the C1q complex, participates in binding to a variety of ligands, including apoptotic cells, pathogens, and altered self-components. This binding is mediated by the gC1q domain, which has a modular structure allowing for diverse interactions (Kishore2004C1q; Ghai2007C1q). The interactions of C1q with these ligands are crucial for processes such as synaptic pruning, immune complex clearance, and modulation of immune cell activity (Nayak2011Complement; Kouser2015Emerging). These interactions highlight the role of C1QB in both complement-dependent and independent pathways, contributing to immune regulation and homeostasis.
