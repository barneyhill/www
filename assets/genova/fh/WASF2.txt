# WASF2

## Overview
WASF2, also known as WAVE2, is a gene that encodes the WASP family member 2 protein, a critical component of the actin cytoskeleton pathway. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal regulatory protein and plays a pivotal role in actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization. WASF2 is integral to the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which activates the Arp2/3 complex, facilitating the formation of lamellipodia and promoting cell motility and shape changes (Kurisu2009The; Yang2022WASF2). The protein's activity is regulated through interactions with small GTPases like Rac1, which modulate actin dynamics and membrane protrusion, essential for directional cell movement (Jiang1998WASP). WASF2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including migration, adhesion, and signal transduction, and its dysregulation is associated with pathological conditions such as cancer, where it contributes to tumor progression and metastasis (Ahn2022Hypomethylationmediated; Yang2022WASF2).

## Structure
WASF2, also known as WAVE2, is a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization. It contains several key domains that contribute to its function. The primary structure of WASF2 includes a WAVE homology domain (WHD), a basic region, a proline-rich region, and a VCA domain, which consists of verprolin homology, cofilin homology, and an acidic region (Kurisu2009The; Takenawa2007The). The WHD is involved in forming a coiled-coil structure that facilitates the assembly of the WAVE regulatory complex, a pentameric heterocomplex that includes proteins such as ABI, CYFIP, and NAP1 (Takenawa2007The; Renault2013Structural).

The secondary structure of WASF2 features an amphiphilic α-helix within the C region, which is crucial for its interaction with the Arp2/3 complex, promoting actin polymerization (Kurisu2009The). The VCA domain is essential for binding to actin monomers and the Arp2/3 complex, facilitating actin filament branching (Chereau2005Actin-bound).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating WASF2's activity, influencing its ability to activate the Arp2/3 complex (Takenawa2007The). WASF2 does not have known splice variant isoforms mentioned in the provided context.

## Function
WASF2, also known as WAVE2, is a crucial component of the actin cytoskeleton pathway, playing a significant role in cell motility and shape. It is part of the WAVE regulatory complex, which activates the Arp2/3 complex, promoting actin polymerization necessary for the formation of lamellipodia, cellular structures involved in cell migration and invasion (Jiang1998WASP; Yang2022WASF2). WASF2 is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences processes such as cell migration, adhesion, and signal transduction (Yang2022WASF2).

In healthy human cells, WASF2 is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape and enabling cell movement (Yang2022WASF2). The protein forms a multiprotein complex that links receptor kinases and actin, playing a central role in transducing signals that involve changes in cell shape, motility, or function (Yang2022WASF2). WASF2's activity is mediated by its interaction with Rac, a small GTPase, which regulates actin dynamics and membrane protrusion, facilitating directional cell movement (Jiang1998WASP). This function is critical for various cellular processes, including migration and invasion, which are vital for normal cellular function and development (Yang2022WASF2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WASF2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), WASF2 is overexpressed due to hypomethylation of its promoter region, which correlates with poor clinical outcomes. This overexpression is associated with increased cell viability, proliferation, and metastatic potential, contributing to the aggressive nature of HCC. Knockdown of WASF2 in HCC cells results in cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, and reduced metastatic potential, highlighting its role as a potential therapeutic target (Ahn2022Hypomethylationmediated).

WASF2 is also implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis. Its knockdown increases the expression of epithelial markers and decreases mesenchymal markers, thereby reducing cell motility and invasion (Ahn2022Hypomethylationmediated). In vivo studies demonstrate that WASF2 suppression leads to reduced tumor growth and metastasis, further underscoring its oncogenic role in HCC (Ahn2022Hypomethylationmediated).

Beyond HCC, WASF2 is overexpressed in various cancers, including ovarian cancer, where it is linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity, suggesting its involvement in the tumor microenvironment and potential impact on treatment outcomes (Yang2022WASF2).

## Interactions
WASF2, also known as WAVE2, is a key component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which is crucial for actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization. This complex includes several proteins such as ABI1, HSPC300, NCKAP1, and CYFIP1 (also known as SRA1/PIR121) (Padrick2010Physical). WASF2 interacts with the small GTPase Rac1, which is essential for the activation of the WRC and subsequent actin filament branching through the ARP2/3 complex (Takenawa2007The). 

IRSp53 is another significant interaction partner of WASF2, acting as a linker molecule that binds to both Rac and WASF2, enhancing its activity in the presence of Rac and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (Takenawa2007The). Although IRSp53 can bind to other WAVE proteins, its affinity for WASF2 is notably stronger (Takenawa2007The).

In the context of cancer, WASF2 forms a multiprotein complex that links receptor kinases to actin, facilitating cell migration and invasion, particularly in ovarian cancer (Yang2022WASF2). This complex involves the ARP2/3 complex, indicating WASF2's role in influencing cell shape and motility (Yang2022WASF2).
