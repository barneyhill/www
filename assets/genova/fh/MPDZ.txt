# MPDZ

## Overview
MPDZ, or multiple PDZ domain crumbs cell polarity complex component, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein known for its involvement in cellular junction formation and intracellular signaling. The protein, often referred to as MUPP1, is characterized by its 13 PDZ domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for maintaining cell polarity and signal transduction (Elkins2007Structure; Ullmer1998Cloning). As a scaffold protein, MPDZ plays a significant role in organizing macromolecular assemblies at cell junctions, contributing to the structural integrity and function of epithelial and endothelial tissues (Simpson1999Identification). It is particularly important in the brain's ventricular system, where it helps maintain the barrier function of ependymal cells, thus preventing conditions such as hydrocephalus (SaugierVeber2017Hydrocephalus; Feldner2017Loss). Additionally, MPDZ is involved in various signaling pathways, including Notch signaling during angiogenesis, and acts as a tumor suppressor in the context of lung cancer by interacting with components of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway (Liu2021MPDZ; Tetzlaff2018MPDZ).

## Structure
The MPDZ protein, also known as MUPP1, is characterized by its multiple PDZ domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. It contains 13 PDZ domains, which are highly conserved and share structural characteristics typical of PDZ motifs, important for target binding (Elkins2007Structure; Ullmer1998Cloning). These domains are involved in cellular junction formation and intracellular signaling events (Simpson1999Identification). The PDZ domains of MPDZ allow it to function as a scaffold, facilitating the formation of macromolecular assemblies at cell junctions (Elkins2007Structure).

The tertiary structure of MPDZ includes unique binding interactions, such as the SLGI sequence in the 12th PDZ domain, which forms specific hydrogen bonds, differing from typical PDZ domains (Elkins2007Structure). The protein's quaternary structure involves interactions with various binding partners, including the NMDA receptor and CaMKII, enhancing signaling efficiency by bringing intracellular signaling molecules into proximity with cell surface receptors (Donaldson2016The).

MPDZ is involved in maintaining cell polarity and signaling, and it may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation. It also has several splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
The MPDZ gene encodes a protein with multiple PDZ domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and play a significant role in maintaining cell polarity and signal transduction. In healthy human cells, MPDZ is involved in enhancing Notch signaling during angiogenesis by interacting with Notch ligands DLL1 and DLL4. This interaction promotes the recruitment of these ligands to adherens junctions, facilitating their cell surface presentation and subsequent activation of Notch receptors, which is essential for proper blood vessel formation and function (Tetzlaff2018MPDZ).

MPDZ also acts as a scaffold protein at tight junctions, interacting with components such as claudin-1 and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). These interactions are vital for maintaining the integrity of epithelial cell sheets, particularly in the brain's ventricular system, where MPDZ helps preserve the barrier function of ependymal cells, preventing conditions like hydrocephalus (SaugierVeber2017Hydrocephalus; Feldner2017Loss).

The protein is active at cell membranes and within the cytosol, where it co-localizes with synaptic markers and tight junctions, contributing to cell adhesion and communication, which are critical for tissue organization and integrity (AlJezawi2018Compound).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MPDZ gene are linked to several clinical conditions, most notably congenital hydrocephalus. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential neurological impairments. MPDZ mutations can cause both syndromic and non-syndromic forms of hydrocephalus, often inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. These mutations can lead to severe structural brain changes, such as ventricular dilatation and thinning of the cerebral mantle, due to multiple ependymal malformations (SaugierVeber2017Hydrocephalus).

In mice, the loss of MPDZ impairs ependymal cell integrity, leading to perinatal-onset hydrocephalus. This impairment is associated with increased RhoA activity, ependymal denudation, and aqueductal stenosis, which obstructs cerebrospinal fluid flow (Feldner2017Loss). In humans, compound heterozygous variants in MPDZ have been identified in cases of mild non-progressive communicating hydrocephalus, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining proper cerebrospinal fluid dynamics (AlJezawi2018Compound).

MPDZ mutations have also been implicated in other conditions, such as isolated bilateral macular coloboma, where novel compound heterozygous variations in the gene were identified in a Chinese family (Zhang2022Novel).

## Interactions
MPDZ, a multi-PDZ domain protein, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell signaling and structural organization. MPDZ interacts with Notch ligands DLL1 and DLL4, promoting their cell surface localization and facilitating their interaction with the adherens junction protein Nectin-2. This interaction is essential for Notch signaling during angiogenesis, as it stabilizes the presentation of DLL1 and DLL4 on the cell surface, thereby enhancing Notch receptor activation (Tetzlaff2018MPDZ).

MPDZ also interacts with DAPLE, an unconventional activator of heterotrimeric G-proteins, at apical junctions in neuroepithelial cells. This interaction is necessary for DAPLE-mediated apical cell constriction during neurodevelopment. MPDZ binds directly to the PDZ3 domain of DAPLE, and their cooperative function is crucial for proper tissue remodeling (Marivin2019DAPLE).

In the context of lung cancer, MPDZ acts as a tumor suppressor by interacting with LATS1, a core component of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. This interaction stabilizes MST1 and promotes the phosphorylation of YAP, inhibiting its activity and thus suppressing tumor growth and progression (Liu2021MPDZ).
