# SLC26A4

## Overview
The SLC26A4 gene encodes the protein pendrin, a transmembrane anion exchanger that plays a critical role in ion transport across cell membranes. Pendrin is involved in the exchange of chloride, iodide, and bicarbonate ions, and is expressed in various tissues, including the thyroid, inner ear, and kidney. Its function is essential for maintaining ion balance, pH regulation, and fluid homeostasis. In the thyroid, pendrin facilitates iodide transport necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis, while in the inner ear, it regulates the ionic composition of the endolymph, crucial for hearing and balance. In the kidney, pendrin contributes to acid-base balance by mediating chloride absorption and bicarbonate secretion. Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene are linked to Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic hearing loss with enlarged vestibular aqueduct, highlighting its clinical significance in auditory and endocrine health (Matulevičius2022Molecular; Campbell2001Pendred; Wall2015The).

## Structure
The SLC26A4 gene encodes the pendrin protein, which is a multifunctional anion exchanger. Pendrin is composed of 780 amino acids and is characterized by a highly hydrophobic structure, typical of transmembrane proteins (Honda2021Genetic; Hasnain2020Computational). The protein is predicted to contain 12 to 14 transmembrane segments, with a core domain formed by transmembrane segments TM1-TM4 and TM8-TM11, and a gate domain formed by TM5-TM7 and TM12-TM14 (Bassot2017Mapping; Danilchenko2022Selection). 

Pendrin's structure includes a central cavity important for its function as an anion exchanger, with a pseudo-symmetrical arrangement of transmembrane segments (Bassot2017Mapping). The protein also contains a STAS (Sulphate Transporter and AntiSigma factor antagonist) domain at the C-terminus, which is involved in interactions with other proteins and potentially in nucleotide binding (Mount2004The; Danilchenko2022Selection). 

Post-translational modifications of pendrin include glycosylation at sites N167 and N172, located on an extracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 (Bassot2017Mapping). These structural features are crucial for pendrin's role in ion transport and its involvement in conditions such as Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic hearing loss.

## Function
The SLC26A4 gene encodes the protein pendrin, which functions as an anion exchanger involved in the transport of chloride, iodide, and bicarbonate ions. In healthy human cells, pendrin is expressed in the thyroid, inner ear, and kidney, playing a crucial role in maintaining ion balance and pH regulation. In the kidney, pendrin is localized to the apical membrane of type B and non-A, non-B intercalated cells in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) and connecting tubule (CNT). It facilitates the exchange of Cl− and HCO3−, contributing to chloride absorption and bicarbonate secretion, which are essential for maintaining acid-base balance and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis (Amlal2010Deletion; Wall2015The).

In the inner ear, pendrin is expressed in the cochlea, vestibular labyrinth, and endolymphatic sac, where it regulates the ion composition, pH, and volume of the endolymph. This function is critical for normal hearing and balance, as pendrin's activity helps maintain the proper ionic environment necessary for sensory function (Li2013SLC26A4; Matulevičius2022Molecular). In the thyroid, pendrin is involved in iodide transport, which is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis (Matulevičius2022Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene are associated with several hearing-related conditions, primarily Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic hearing loss with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA). Pendred syndrome is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and thyroid dysfunction, often presenting as goiter. This condition is linked to temporal bone abnormalities, such as dilated vestibular aqueduct and Mondini dysplasia (Campbell2001Pendred; Honda2021Genetic). Nonsyndromic hearing loss associated with EVA, also known as DFNB4, involves sensorineural hearing loss without thyroid enlargement but may include other inner ear malformations (Tawalbeh2022SLC26A4; Danilchenko2022Selection).

The phenotypic manifestations of SLC26A4 mutations are diverse, with variability in onset, severity, and progression of hearing loss. Some mutations lead to reduced cellular expression levels of the pendrin protein, affecting its function and contributing to hearing impairment (de2016Reduction). Despite the high prevalence of SLC26A4 mutations in these conditions, establishing clear genotype-phenotype correlations remains challenging, as the phenotype cannot always be predicted from the genotype (Tawalbeh2022SLC26A4; Miyagawa2014Mutation). Genetic testing is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of these conditions (Danilchenko2022Selection).

## Interactions
The SLC26A4 protein, also known as pendrin, participates in several significant interactions with other proteins, influencing its function in ion transport. One of the primary interactions is with IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), a scaffolding protein involved in signal transduction and cytoskeleton regulation. This interaction was identified using yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy. IQGAP1 co-localizes with pendrin on the apical membrane of B-intercalated cells in the kidney's cortical collecting duct, enhancing the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger activity of SLC26A4 and potentially influencing its distribution and function (Xu2022Identification).

SLC26A4 also interacts with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in airway epithelial cells, where both proteins are activated by interleukins IL-4 and IL-13. This interaction is significant in the context of cystic fibrosis, as CFTR mutations can affect pH regulation through SLC26A4 modulation (Lee2024ChlorideMultiple). Additionally, SLC26A4 interacts with other ion channels and transporters, such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC), which are involved in regulating blood pressure (Lee2024ChlorideMultiple).
