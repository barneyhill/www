# NPHS1

## Overview
The NPHS1 gene encodes nephrin, a transmembrane protein that is a crucial component of the kidney's glomerular filtration barrier. Nephrin belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and functions as a cell adhesion molecule, playing a vital role in the structural integrity and signaling of the slit diaphragm, a specialized junction between podocyte foot processes in the kidney glomeruli (Verma2003Fyn; Kestilä1998Positionally). The protein's extracellular domain facilitates homophilic interactions essential for maintaining the filtration barrier, while its intracellular domain is involved in signaling pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton (Zhu2008Nephrin; Wartiovaara2004Nephrin). Mutations in NPHS1 can lead to congenital nephrotic syndrome and other renal pathologies, underscoring its significance in kidney function and disease (Santín2009Nephrin; Wartiovaara2004Nephrin).

## Structure
The NPHS1 gene encodes nephrin, a transmembrane protein essential for the kidney's filtration barrier. Nephrin's primary structure is determined by the sequence of amino acids encoded by the NPHS1 gene, which spans 26 kilobases and includes 29 exons (Beltcheva2001Mutation). The protein features a large extracellular domain, approximately 35 nm long, containing eight immunoglobulin-like domains and a fibronectin type III-like domain (Patrakka2007Nephrin). Each immunoglobulin-like domain includes two cysteine residues forming disulfide bridges, contributing to a globular or ellipsoid structure (Patrakka2007Nephrin).

The secondary structure of nephrin likely involves the folding of these immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin domains (Beltcheva2001Mutation). The tertiary structure is the overall 3D conformation of nephrin, which is crucial for its function in the kidney (Beltcheva2001Mutation). Nephrin's quaternary structure involves homophilic interactions, forming a zipper-like structure in the slit diaphragm, essential for maintaining the integrity of the glomerular ultrafilter (Patrakka2007Nephrin).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation at nine of its ten potential sites, are critical for nephrin's proper folding and membrane localization (Patrakka2007Nephrin). Nephrin also interacts with other proteins like Neph1, Neph2, and FAT1, which are involved in the slit diaphragm's function (Patrakka2007Nephrin).

## Function
The NPHS1 gene encodes nephrin, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the kidney's glomerular filtration barrier. Nephrin is primarily expressed in podocytes, which are specialized cells in the kidney glomeruli. It is a key component of the slit diaphragm, a structure that spans the filtration slits between podocyte foot processes and acts as a size-selective barrier, preventing the passage of large proteins and cells into the urine (Kestilä1998Positionally; Wartiovaara2004Nephrin).

Nephrin belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and functions as a cell adhesion molecule, contributing to the structural integrity of the slit diaphragm through homophilic interactions of its extracellular domains (Verma2003Fyn; Wartiovaara2004Nephrin). It also plays a role in intracellular signaling pathways. Nephrin is phosphorylated by Src family kinases, such as Fyn, which enhances its interaction with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). This interaction is crucial for actin cytoskeletal reorganization, maintaining podocyte structure and function (Verma2003Fyn; Zhu2008Nephrin).

The absence or dysfunction of nephrin leads to the loss of the slit diaphragm structure, resulting in proteinuria and kidney dysfunction, as seen in congenital nephrotic syndrome (Kestilä1998Positionally; Wartiovaara2004Nephrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPHS1 gene, which encodes the protein nephrin, are primarily associated with congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS), particularly the Finnish type. This condition is characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, often presenting at birth or within the first three months of life (Kestilä1998Positionally; Jalanko2007Congenital). The most common mutations in Finnish patients are the Fin major mutation, a frameshift deletion in exon 2, and the Fin minor mutation, a nonsense mutation in exon 26 (Kestilä1998Positionally; Beltcheva2001Mutation). These mutations disrupt nephrin's function in the glomerular filtration barrier, leading to the clinical manifestations of CNS (Liu2001Defective).

NPHS1 mutations have also been implicated in other renal conditions, such as childhood-onset steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in both children and adults (Santín2009Nephrin). Patients with NPHS1 mutations typically do not respond to steroid or immunosuppressive therapy, although kidney transplantation is a viable treatment option with a low recurrence rate (Rong2021Genetic). The genetic complexity of these conditions underscores the importance of NPHS1 in renal pathophysiology (Santín2009Nephrin).

## Interactions
Nephrin, encoded by the NPHS1 gene, is a critical component of the slit diaphragm in kidney podocytes, where it engages in various protein-protein interactions essential for maintaining the filtration barrier. Nephrin interacts with podocin (NPHS2), forming a complex that is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the slit diaphragm. This interaction is significantly upregulated during podocyte development, highlighting its importance in podocyte maturation (Warsow2013PodNet).

Nephrin also interacts with NEPH1, another protein involved in the slit diaphragm, through a conserved amino acid sequence. This interaction is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is essential for nephrin's signaling role. The interaction between nephrin and NEPH1 is inhibited by Src and Tec kinases, suggesting a regulatory mechanism involving phosphorylation (Sellin2002NEPH1).

Mutations in NPHS1, such as A419T and C623F, affect nephrin's localization and phosphorylation, impairing its function and signaling capabilities. These mutations lead to reduced surface expression and mislocalization of nephrin, impacting its ability to maintain the filtration barrier (Cooper2018Characterization).
