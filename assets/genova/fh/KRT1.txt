# KRT1

## Overview
The KRT1 gene encodes keratin 1, a type II cytokeratin that is integral to the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells, particularly within the epidermis. As a member of the intermediate filament protein family, keratin 1 forms heterodimers with type I keratins, such as keratin 10, to create a robust cytoskeletal network in suprabasal keratinocytes. This network is essential for maintaining skin resilience and integrity, contributing to the formation of the epidermal barrier that protects against environmental damage and prevents water loss (Roth2012Keratin; Ho2022Update). Beyond its structural role, keratin 1 is involved in regulating immune responses and inflammation within the skin, influencing the secretion of cytokines and antimicrobial peptides (Roth2012Keratin). Mutations in the KRT1 gene are linked to various skin disorders, including epidermolytic ichthyosis and palmoplantar keratoderma, underscoring its clinical significance in dermatological health (Hatsell2001Novel; TerronKwiatkowski2002Two).

## Structure
Keratin 1 (KRT1) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. The primary structure of KRT1 consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains (Bray2015Complete). The rod domain is characterized by coiled-coil motifs, which are essential for the dimerization and assembly of intermediate filaments (Bray2015Complete). The secondary structure of KRT1 includes these coiled-coil motifs, organized in a heptad pattern that facilitates the formation of dimeric structures (Ho2022Update).

The tertiary structure of KRT1 involves interactions that stabilize its filamentous form, with the head domain potentially acting as an anchor for filament assembly and the tail domain contributing to the alignment of rod domains (Bray2015Complete). The quaternary structure includes heterodimerization with type I keratins, such as keratin 10 (KRT10), forming antiparallel tetramers that are the basic building blocks for higher-order assemblies (Ho2022Update).

Post-translational modifications of KRT1 include phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell. The head and tail domains of KRT1 are noted for their structural variability and potential roles in elasticity and filament assembly (Bray2015Complete).

## Function
Keratin 1 (KRT1) is a type II keratin that plays a crucial role in maintaining skin integrity and function. It forms heterodimers with keratin 10 (KRT10) to create the intermediate filament cytoskeleton in suprabasal keratinocytes of the epidermis, which is essential for providing structural support and resilience to epithelial cells (Roth2012Keratin; Ho2022Update). KRT1 is involved in the formation of the cornified/lipid envelope, a critical component of the epidermal barrier that prevents water loss and protects against environmental insults (Roth2012Keratin).

KRT1 also participates in an inflammatory network within the skin by regulating the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-18 (IL-18) and antimicrobial peptides, which are important for immune responses and inflammation control (Roth2012Keratin). The absence of KRT1 leads to increased levels of IL-18 and S100A8/A9 proteins, resulting in barrier defects and inflammation, highlighting its role in skin homeostasis and immune regulation (Roth2012Keratin). KRT1's function extends beyond structural support, influencing immune responses and maintaining the balance between skin integrity and inflammation (Roth2012Keratin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT1 gene are associated with several skin disorders, primarily affecting the structural integrity of the epidermis. Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI) is a notable condition caused by KRT1 mutations, characterized by skin erosions, hyperkeratosis, and barrier defects. These mutations disrupt the keratin network, leading to increased levels of inflammatory proteins such as interleukin-18 (IL-18) and S100A8/A9, which contribute to skin barrier defects and perinatal lethality (Roth2012Keratin).

KRT1 mutations are also linked to palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), a condition marked by thickening of the skin on the palms and soles. Variability in clinical presentation is observed, with severe cases often involving point mutations in helix motifs, while milder cases may involve mutations outside these regions (TerronKwiatkowski2002Two). Specific mutations, such as a splice site mutation in exon 6, result in mild epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK) (Hatsell2001Novel).

Additionally, KRT1 mutations can cause Ichthyosis Curth-Macklin (ICM), characterized by severe palmoplantar keratoderma and verrucous plaques. A novel mutation, c.1577delG, affects the variable domain of KRT1, leading to a truncated protein and severe phenotype (Fonseca2013A). These mutations highlight the diverse phenotypic outcomes associated with KRT1 gene alterations.

## Interactions
Keratin 1 (KRT1) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells by forming intermediate filaments. It primarily interacts with keratin 10 (KRT10) to form a heterodimer, which is essential for the assembly of the cytoskeletal structure in suprabasal layers of the epidermis (Ho2022Update; Terrinoni2018Role). This interaction is vital for maintaining skin integrity and is involved in the pathogenesis of certain skin disorders when disrupted (Terrinoni2018Role).

KRT1 also interacts with other proteins such as the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and serves as a receptor for fatty acid-binding protein 4, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes beyond structural support (Luo2017Polymorphism). These interactions suggest that KRT1 may have roles in signaling pathways and cellular responses to environmental stimuli.

The expression of KRT1 is regulated by retinoids, which can influence its interaction with other proteins. Retinoids affect keratin expression through complex mechanisms involving nuclear receptors and signaling pathways like AP-1 and NFκB, although KRT1 does not have identified retinoid response elements, suggesting indirect regulation (Törmä2011Regulation).
