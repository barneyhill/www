# UQCC4

## Overview
UQCC4, or ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the assembly and stability of mitochondrial complex III, a crucial component of the electron transport chain (ETC) in human cells. The protein encoded by UQCC4 is essential for the proper formation and function of the cytochrome bc1 complex, facilitating interactions with components such as MT-CYB and other assembly factors. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration and energy production by ensuring efficient electron transfer and ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. The activity of UQCC4 is therefore integral to maintaining cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal energy homeostasis (Zhang2024Computing).

## Function
UQCC4, or ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor 4, plays a critical role in the assembly and stability of mitochondrial complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex. This complex is a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), which is essential for cellular respiration and energy production in healthy human cells (Zhang2024Computing). UQCC4 specifically interacts with the complex III component MT-CYB and the complex III assembly factor, facilitating the proper formation and function of complex III within the mitochondria (Zhang2024Computing).

The ETC is responsible for generating ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, a process that is crucial for meeting the energy demands of the cell. By aiding in the assembly of complex III, UQCC4 ensures efficient electron transfer and ATP production, thereby supporting cellular energy metabolism. The proper functioning of UQCC4 is therefore integral to maintaining the energy balance and metabolic health of cells, impacting overall organismal energy homeostasis (Zhang2024Computing).

## Interactions
UQCC4, or ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor 4, is involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. It interacts with MT-CYB, a component of complex III, as part of the mitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain (ETC). This interaction is crucial for the assembly of mitochondrial complexes, highlighting UQCC4's role in facilitating the proper assembly and function of the cytochrome bc1 complex, which is essential for cellular respiration (Zhang2024Computing).

The study by Zhang et al. also emphasizes the importance of UQCC4 in the broader context of mitochondrial protein interactions, although specific additional interactions involving UQCC4 are not detailed in the provided excerpts (Zhang2024Computing). The research underscores the significance of UQCC4 in the assembly of mitochondrial complexes, which is vital for maintaining efficient electron transport and energy production within cells. While the context does not provide further details on other specific protein interactions involving UQCC4, its role in the assembly of complex III suggests it may interact with other assembly factors and components within the mitochondrial ETC.
