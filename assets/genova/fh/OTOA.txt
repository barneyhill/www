# OTOA

## Overview
The OTOA gene encodes the protein otoancorin, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein predominantly expressed in the inner ear. Otoancorin plays a critical role in auditory function by facilitating the attachment of the tectorial membrane to the sensory epithelia, which is essential for the mechanotransduction process involved in hearing. This protein is categorized as a non-collagenous glycoprotein and is located at the interface between the apical surface of epithelial cells and the overlying acellular gels of the inner ear. Mutations in the OTOA gene can lead to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically DFNB22, due to the disruption of the structural integrity necessary for proper auditory function (Sugiyama2019MidFrequency; Kim2019Clarification; Zwaenepoel2002Otoancorin).

## Structure
OTOA, or otoancorin, is a protein encoded by the OTOA gene, primarily expressed in the inner ear. The protein is involved in stabilizing the tectorial membrane on top of sensory hair cells, which is essential for mechanotransduction (Lee2012Novel). Otoancorin is a non-collagenous glycoprotein located at the interface between the apical surface of epithelial cells and the overlying acellular gels of the inner ear (Ortore2021Compound). 

The molecular structure of otoancorin is not fully elucidated, but it is predicted to have an ARM-type superhelical structure with small helical segments (Lee2012Novel). The protein includes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which attaches it to the plasma membrane, and sequences downstream from the 589th amino acid are critical for this anchorage (Kim2019Clarification). The GPI-anchor is crucial for the protein's function, and its disruption is linked to hearing deficits (Kim2019Clarification).

Mutations in the OTOA gene can lead to truncated proteins lacking the GPI-anchor, resulting in constitutive secretion rather than membrane tethering (Kim2019Clarification). The protein has multiple isoforms, with the longest containing 1153 amino acids (Ortore2021Compound).

## Function
The OTOA gene encodes the protein otoancorin, which is specifically expressed in the inner ear and plays a crucial role in auditory function. Otoancorin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein located at the interface between the apical surface of sensory epithelia and the overlying acellular gels in the inner ear. This anchorage is essential for the proper localization and function of the protein, as it ensures the correct attachment and interaction between the sensory epithelia and the acellular gels, which is necessary for the mechanotransduction process involved in hearing and balance (Kim2019Clarification; Zwaenepoel2002Otoancorin).

In the cochlea, otoancorin is found at the attachment zones of the tectorial membrane, facilitating the transmission of sound waves by anchoring the tectorial membrane to the spiral limbus. This structural organization is critical for the stimulation of inner hair cells, which are vital for hearing (Sugiyama2019MidFrequency; Zwaenepoel2002Otoancorin). The GPI anchorage of otoancorin is crucial for its function, as mutations disrupting this anchorage can lead to hearing impairments, highlighting the importance of the protein in maintaining normal auditory function (Kim2019Clarification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OTOA gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically DFNB22. This condition is characterized by prelingual, sensorineural hearing impairment. The OTOA gene encodes otoancorin, a protein crucial for the proper attachment of the tectorial membrane in the inner ear, which is essential for normal hearing function (Sugiyama2019MidFrequency; Zwaenepoel2002Otoancorin).

Several mutations in the OTOA gene have been identified in different populations. In Pakistani families, novel mutations such as c.1352G>A (p.Gly451Asp) and c.1879C>T (p.Pro627Ser) have been linked to hearing impairment, with bioinformatics analyses predicting them to be pathogenic (Lee2012Novel). In a Palestinian family, a mutation at the exon 12/intron 12 junction (IVS12+2T>C) affects the donor splice site, potentially leading to aberrant splicing and hearing impairment (Zwaenepoel2002Otoancorin).

In an Italian family, compound heterozygosity involving a truncating variant and a microdeletion in the OTOA gene was found to cause sensorineural hearing loss, highlighting the genetic complexity of hearing loss associated with this gene (Ortore2021Compound). Additionally, copy number variations in the OTOA gene have been identified as a significant cause of hearing loss in Japanese patients, with a prevalence of 0.3% among those with autosomal recessive sensorineural hearing loss (Sugiyama2019MidFrequency).

## Interactions
Otoancorin, encoded by the OTOA gene, is a protein specifically expressed in the inner ear, where it plays a crucial role in the attachment of the tectorial membrane (TM) to the spiral limbus. Although the specific protein interactions of otoancorin are not fully elucidated, it is suggested that otoancorin may interact with Tecta, a component of the TM, as a likely partner in mediating the adhesion of the TM to the spiral limbus (Lukashkin2012A). Otoancorin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein located at the interface between the apical surface of sensory epithelia and their overlying acellular gels, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity necessary for proper auditory function (Zwaenepoel2002Otoancorin).

The absence of otoancorin leads to the detachment of the TM from the spiral limbus, although it remains close to the sensory epithelium, suggesting that other proteins may mediate the adhesion of outer hair cell stereocilia to the TM (Lukashkin2012A). Despite the structural changes caused by the lack of otoancorin, cochlear amplification remains largely unaffected, indicating that otoancorin's primary role is in the structural attachment rather than direct interaction with outer hair cells (Lukashkin2012A).
