# CKMT1A

## Overview
CKMT1A is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial creatine kinase, mitochondrial 1A, a crucial enzyme involved in cellular energy metabolism. This enzyme belongs to the kinase category and is primarily responsible for the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to creatine, forming phosphocreatine, which serves as a high-energy reservoir. The protein encoded by CKMT1A is located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and plays a significant role in maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high and fluctuating energy demands such as the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (Bonilla2021Metabolic; Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). CKMT1A forms part of proteolipid complexes and interacts with components like adenine nucleotide translocase and voltage-dependent anion channels, facilitating efficient ATP/ADP exchange and phosphocreatine synthesis (Wallimann2011The). The enzyme's activity is essential for various cellular processes, including muscle contraction and signal transduction, and it also contributes to neuroprotection by reducing reactive oxygen species production and preserving mitochondrial membrane potential (Wallimann1992Intracellular).

## Structure
The CKMT1A gene encodes a mitochondrial creatine kinase that plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism. The protein structure consists of a monomeric unit with a small all-α N-terminal domain (residues 1-100) and a larger α + β C-terminal domain (residues 113-end), connected by a long linker region (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). The C-terminal domain features an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by seven α-helices, forming the enzyme's active site in the cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

CKMT1A forms dimers, which are the minimal structural units, and these dimers can further associate into octamers. The octameric structure is stabilized by interactions with mitochondrial membranes, particularly cardiolipin and voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). The octameric form has a central channel and exposes the C-termini on its top and bottom faces, facilitating membrane interactions (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

Post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, have been studied in CKMT1A, indicating their significance in the protein's function (Kurmi2018Tyrosine). These modifications may affect the protein's activity and interactions, although specific details on their structural impact are not provided.

## Function
CKMT1A encodes a mitochondrial creatine kinase enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism. This enzyme is involved in the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to creatine, forming phosphocreatine (PCr), which acts as a high-energy reservoir. This process is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high and fluctuating energy demands, such as the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (Bonilla2021Metabolic; Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

CKMT1A is located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and forms part of proteolipid complexes, interacting with components like adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) and voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC). These interactions facilitate efficient ATP/ADP exchange and the synthesis of PCr, which is crucial for maintaining a high ATP/ADP ratio and enhancing the thermodynamic efficiency of ATP hydrolysis (Wallimann2011The; Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

The enzyme's activity supports cellular processes such as muscle contraction, cell motility, and signal transduction by ensuring a continuous supply of ATP. It also plays a role in reducing reactive oxygen species production and preserving mitochondrial membrane potential, contributing to its neuroprotective properties (Wallimann2011The; Wallimann1992Intracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CKMT1A gene have been implicated in various cancers. Missense mutations such as L334R/V are notably prevalent in endometrial carcinoma and pleural mesothelioma, occurring with a frequency of about 1%. These mutations can disrupt the protein's function, potentially influencing cancer progression (Yang2022An). In non-small cell lung cancer, genetic alterations in CKMT1A are associated with poorer overall survival, although they do not affect progression-free survival (Yang2022An).

CKMT1A expression levels also play a significant role in cancer prognosis. High expression is linked to a poor prognosis in thyroid carcinoma and lung cancer, while it is associated with a good prognosis in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma and brain lower grade glioma (Yang2022An). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CKMT1A is upregulated by the lncRNA n335586, which enhances cell migration and invasion, contributing to cancer progression. This regulation occurs through the lncRNA n335586/miR-924/CKMT1A axis, where n335586 acts as a 'miRNA sponge' to modulate CKMT1A expression (Fan2018LncRNA).

CKMT1A is also involved in immune escape mechanisms, as its expression negatively correlates with the infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and CD8+ T-cells in various cancers (Yang2022An).

## Interactions
CKMT1A, a mitochondrial creatine kinase, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in energy metabolism. It forms high molecular weight complexes with voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) in the mitochondrial outer membrane. This interaction is facilitated by electrostatic forces involving specific residues of CKMT1A and is further strengthened by physiological concentrations of calcium. All three VDAC isoforms (Vdac1, Vdac2, Vdac3) participate in these complexes (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

CKMT1A also interacts with cardiolipin (CL), a phospholipid in the mitochondrial membrane, which mediates its co-localization with adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in CL-rich membrane patches. Although no direct interaction between CKMT1A and ANT has been detected, they are found in the same complexes, likely due to their mutual affinity for cardiolipin (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer, CKMT1A interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). This interaction is mediated by the Dbl homology domain 2 (DH2) of CKMT1A and the N-and C-terminal regions of CDK4. CKMT1A regulates the localization of CDK4 to mitochondria, influencing cell cycle progression (Yang2023Mitochondrial).
