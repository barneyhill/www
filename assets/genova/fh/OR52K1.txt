# OR52K1

## Overview
The OR52K1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily K member 1, which is part of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The protein encoded by OR52K1 is a transmembrane receptor, characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of GPCRs. This structure allows the receptor to traverse the cell membrane and interact with odorant molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in olfactory perception. While the primary function of OR52K1 is related to olfaction, emerging research suggests potential implications in various physiological and pathological processes, warranting further investigation into its broader biological roles (Alshabeeb2023Impact; Xie2014A).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR52K1 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, is not extensively documented. However, some studies suggest potential associations with certain conditions. In the context of sickle cell disease (SCD), genetic variations in OR52K1 have been linked to an increased risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) and stroke. A study identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in OR52K1 with significant p-values, indicating a potential link between this gene and thromboembolic risk in SCD patients (Alshabeeb2023Impact). The study also suggests that mutations in olfactory receptor genes, including OR52K1, may influence TEEs by modulating chromatin structure and gene-receptor interactions, potentially affecting the expression of other genes (Alshabeeb2023Impact).

Additionally, the OR52K1 gene has been mentioned in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research, although detailed information on its direct involvement in ALS is not provided (Xie2014A). Overall, while there are indications of OR52K1's involvement in certain conditions, further research is needed to establish clear clinical associations and understand the gene's role in disease mechanisms.
