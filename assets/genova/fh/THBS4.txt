# THBS4

## Overview
Thrombospondin-4 (THBS4) is a gene that encodes the thrombospondin 4 protein, a member of the thrombospondin family of matricellular proteins. These proteins are known for their roles in modulating cell-matrix interactions and tissue remodeling. Thrombospondin 4 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple domains that facilitate interactions with various extracellular matrix components and cell surface receptors. It is involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including cardiovascular function, skeletal muscle integrity, and neural development. The protein's ability to form pentamers allows it to engage in diverse interactions, influencing processes such as wound healing, synaptic function, and cellular signaling. Alterations in THBS4 expression or function have been linked to several pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Genaro2024Pathophysiological; Lawler1993Identification; SteninaAdognravi2019Thrombospondin4).

## Structure
Thrombospondin-4 (THBS4) is a member of the thrombospondin family, characterized by a unique molecular structure. The primary structure of THBS4 includes an open reading frame of 931 amino acids, with a signal sequence comprising the first 24 amino acids (Lawler1993Identification). The protein features four type 2 repeats and several type 3 repeats, with specific cysteine residues marking these repeats. The type 3 repeats of THBS4 are 61.4% identical to those of human thrombospondin-1, and the COOH-terminal domain shows 60.8% identity with human thrombospondin-1 (Lawler1993Identification).

THBS4's tertiary structure includes a coiled-coil domain for oligomerization, an EGF-like repeat domain, a type III repeat (T3R) domain, and a L-type lectin (TSP-C) domain, which are part of the C-terminal Ca2+-binding signature domain (Brody2016Dissection). The protein also contains an N-terminal laminin G-like (LamG) domain that facilitates interactions with extracellular matrix proteins (Brody2016Dissection).

In terms of quaternary structure, THBS4 forms pentamers, allowing it to engage in multiple interactions with cells and ECM proteins through various binding domains (SteninaAdognravi2019Thrombospondin4). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including potential sites for N-linked glycosylation and hydroxylation (Lawler1993Identification).

## Function
Thrombospondin-4 (THBS4) is a matricellular protein involved in various physiological processes, particularly in tissue remodeling and the regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In the cardiovascular system, THBS4 is expressed by endothelial and smooth muscle cells, contributing to the structural support and stiffness of the myocardium. It plays a crucial role in ECM remodeling by regulating collagen production and assembly, and it is involved in wound healing and scar formation (SteninaAdognravi2019Thrombospondin4).

In skeletal muscle, THBS4 is essential for the assembly and function of motor units, interacting with integrins and organizing laminin localization. It stabilizes muscle membranes and cellular attachments, maintaining muscle integrity and function. Its deficiency can lead to dystrophic changes and impaired metabolism in red muscles (SteninaAdognravi2019Thrombospondin4).

THBS4 also plays a significant role in the nervous system, where it promotes neurite outgrowth and is involved in signaling at the neuromuscular junction. It is expressed in synapse-rich structures, such as the cerebellum and retina, and supports neural signaling in both developing and adult nervous systems (Arber1995Thrombospondin4).

In skin regeneration and wound healing, THBS4 enhances fibroblast migration and keratinocyte proliferation, crucial for skin repair processes. It acts through β-catenin-dependent signaling pathways and is upregulated in regenerating skin (Klaas2021Thrombospondin4).

## Clinical Significance
Thrombospondin-4 (THBS4) is implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), THBS4 acts as a putative tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is often silenced by methylation of its promoter region, which is associated with age and the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) status of tumors. This methylation is linked to the progression of CIMP-positive CRC, and forced overexpression of THBS4 in cancer cell lines significantly suppresses tumor growth (Greco2010Thrombospondin4).

In cardiovascular diseases, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in THBS4, where proline is present at position 387 instead of alanine, is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. This SNP enhances calcium binding affinity, contributing to cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure and hypertension (Eba2023STRUCTURAL; SteninaAdognravi2019Thrombospondin4).

THBS4 is also involved in cancer progression, particularly in breast and bladder cancers, where it promotes angiogenesis and cell migration. Its expression is increased in response to hyperglycemia, contributing to cancer growth and inflammation (Genaro2024Pathophysiological). Additionally, THBS4 is implicated in osteoarthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, where its altered expression correlates with disease severity (Genaro2024Pathophysiological).

## Interactions
Thrombospondin-4 (THBS4) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in tissue remodeling and cellular functions. It interacts with integrins, such as αMβ2 and αvβ3, which facilitate cell adhesion and migration. The interaction with αMβ2 is particularly important for leukocyte recognition of THBS4 (SteninaAdognravi2019Thrombospondin4). THBS4 also binds to the non-integrin receptor α2δ-1, which is blocked by gabapentin, highlighting its role in synaptic function and neural interactions (Genaro2024Pathophysiological; SteninaAdognravi2019Thrombospondin4).

In the extracellular matrix (ECM), THBS4 interacts with collagens I, II, III, and V, as well as non-collagenous proteins like laminin-1, fibronectin, and matrilin-2. These interactions are regulated by divalent cations, with Zn2+ enhancing binding to collagens (SteninaAdognravi2019Thrombospondin4). THBS4 also plays a role in the ER stress response by interacting with activating transcription factor 6α (Atf6α) and BiP, modulating ER stress pathways and vesicular expansion in cardiomyocytes (Brody2016Dissection).

THBS4's interactions extend to influencing signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is activated in fibroblasts to promote migration and proliferation during wound healing (Klaas2021Thrombospondin4). These diverse interactions underscore THBS4's multifaceted role in cellular and tissue dynamics.
