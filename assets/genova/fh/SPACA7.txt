# SPACA7

## Overview
SPACA7 is a gene located on chromosome 13 (13q34) that encodes the sperm acrosome-associated protein 7, which plays a pivotal role in the acrosome reaction during fertilization. This protein is integral to the acrosome, a specialized organelle in sperm cells that facilitates the penetration of the egg's outer layers, thereby enabling sperm-egg fusion (Prabhakara2024Uncovering). SPACA7 is exclusively expressed in the testis and is involved in the early stages of acrosome formation, initially localizing to the Golgi apparatus before binding to the acrosome. The protein's interaction with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) suggests a regulatory role in the sperm-acrosome reaction, which is crucial for successful fertilization (Prabhakara2024Uncovering). Additionally, a splice variant of SPACA7 lacking a critical iron-sulfur binding domain has been identified, which may impact electron transport and protein function (Prabhakara2024Uncovering). The potential interaction of SPACA7 with bacterial proteins, such as Neisserial adhesin NadA, indicates a broader biological significance that warrants further investigation (Scietti2016Exploring).

## Structure
The SPACA7 protein, encoded by the SPACA7 gene located on chromosome 13 (13q34), consists of 195 amino acids and is involved in sperm function, particularly in the acrosome reaction essential for egg-sperm fusion (Prabhakara2024Uncovering). The gene comprises seven exons, and a splice variant has been identified that lacks exon 3, which includes nucleotide bases 291 to 398. This region encodes the 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-type iron-sulfur binding domain, crucial for electron transport within the cell. The absence of this domain in the variant may impair electron transport (Prabhakara2024Uncovering).

SPACA7 is exclusively expressed in the testis and is involved in the biosynthesis of the acrosome in sperm cells. During early stages, it is localized to the Golgi apparatus, and in later stages, it is bound to the acrosome (Prabhakara2024Uncovering). The protein interacts with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), suggesting a role in regulating the sperm-acrosome reaction (Prabhakara2024Uncovering). The specific molecular structure details, such as secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The SPACA7 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the acrosome reaction, an essential process for fertilization. This protein is associated with the acrosome, a cap-like structure on the head of sperm, which is responsible for releasing enzymes that facilitate the penetration of the egg's outer layers, enabling sperm-egg fusion (Prabhakara2024Uncovering). SPACA7 is exclusively expressed in the testis and is involved in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. During the early stages of acrosome formation, SPACA7 is localized to the Golgi apparatus and eventually binds to the acrosome itself (Prabhakara2024Uncovering).

A newly identified splice variant of SPACA7 lacks a specific exon that includes the 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-type iron-sulfur binding region, which may affect electron transport within the cell. This variant is suggested to interact with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) during the initial stages of acrosome formation, potentially playing a role in regulating the sperm-acrosome reaction (Prabhakara2024Uncovering). The interaction between SPACA7 and iNOS is significant in the context of sperm-oocyte fusion and acrosome reactions, highlighting its importance in reproductive biology (Prabhakara2024Uncovering).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
SPACA7, a sperm acrosome-associated protein, interacts with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the human testis. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation methods. SPACA7 is localized in the acrosome of sperm and plays a role in the acrosome reaction, which is crucial for egg-sperm fusion. The study found that both iNOS and SPACA7 are localized in the cytosol, with iNOS eventually localizing to the perinuclear region, particularly the Golgi region. A new splice variant of SPACA7, missing exon 3, was identified, which may affect electron transport due to the absence of the 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-type iron-sulfur binding region. This variant might interact with iNOS during the early stages of acrosome formation in the Golgi, potentially regulating the sperm-acrosome reaction (Prabhakara2024Uncovering).

SPACA7 was also identified as a putative interactor with the Neisserial adhesin NadA in a large-scale protein microarray screening. This suggests a potential role in bacterial adhesion and invasion processes, although further validation is necessary to confirm this interaction (Scietti2016Exploring).
