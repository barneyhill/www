# MYH1

## Overview
The MYH1 gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 1 protein, a crucial component of type IIx skeletal muscle fibers, which are predominantly involved in rapid and forceful muscle contractions. This protein is categorized as a motor protein due to its role in converting chemical energy from ATP into mechanical force, facilitating muscle contraction through its interaction with actin filaments. The myosin heavy chain 1 protein is integral to the structure and function of fast-twitch muscle fibers, contributing to activities that require quick bursts of strength and speed, such as sprinting and weightlifting (Stuart2016Myosin; Schiaffino2018Muscle). The gene's expression is modulated by various physiological factors, including neural and hormonal signals, which influence muscle fiber composition and performance (Hoh2023Developmental). Mutations in MYH1 have been linked to muscle-related disorders in both humans and animals, underscoring its clinical significance (Finno2018A; Alsaif2021MYH1).

## Structure
The MYH1 gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 1 protein, which is a component of type II skeletal muscle fibers. The protein is a hexamer composed of two myosin heavy-chain subunits and four myosin light-chain subunits (England2012Heavy). The primary structure of MYH1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, particularly in the coiled-coil tail region, which is crucial for dimerization and assembly into thick filaments (Hoh2023Developmental).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of the protein into a three-dimensional shape, with the N-terminal region forming a globular head that contains ATPase and actin-binding sites. This head region is known as the motor domain, which is essential for muscle contraction (England2012Heavy). The quaternary structure of MYH1 involves the assembly of myosin molecules into thick filaments, with the heads acting as cross-bridges that interact with actin filaments during muscle contraction (Hoh2023Developmental).

MYH1 also contains specific domains such as the motor domain and the regulatory domain, which are involved in the protein's function and regulation. The regulatory domain is influenced by Ca2+-mediated phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification that affects muscle contraction (England2012Heavy). Splice variants of MYH1 may result in isoforms with different functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
The MYH1 gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 1 protein, which is a critical component of type IIx skeletal muscle fibers. This protein plays a significant role in muscle contraction by interacting with actin filaments and utilizing ATP to generate force and movement. MYH1 is predominantly expressed in fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are responsible for rapid and powerful muscle contractions (Stuart2016Myosin; Schiaffino2018Muscle).

In terms of molecular processes, MYH1 is involved in the cross-bridge cycle, where it binds to actin filaments and undergoes conformational changes to produce muscle contraction. The kinetic properties of MYH1, such as its speed and power, are characterized by the force-velocity relationship and Vmax, which are linked to the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin and the rate of ADP release during the cross-bridge cycle (Hoh2023Developmental).

MYH1 is primarily active in the sarcomeres of muscle cells, where it contributes to the contractile function of fast-twitch fibers. These fibers are essential for activities requiring quick bursts of strength and speed, such as sprinting and weightlifting (Stuart2016Myosin). The expression of MYH1 is regulated by various factors, including neural impulses and hormonal changes, which influence muscle fiber type composition and function (Hoh2023Developmental).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYH1 gene, particularly the E321G variant, have been associated with several muscle-related conditions. In horses, this mutation is linked to equine immune-mediated myositis (IMM) and non-exertional rhabdomyolysis, conditions characterized by muscle inflammation, atrophy, and weakness (Finno2018A; Gianino2019Prevalence). The E321G mutation results in a substitution of a charged glutamic acid for a non-polar glycine at position 321 in the myosin heavy chain, affecting protein stability and function (Finno2018A). This mutation is particularly prevalent in certain performance subgroups of American Quarter Horses, such as reining and working cow horses, suggesting a link between genetic predisposition and performance-related selection (Gianino2019Prevalence).

In humans, MYH1 mutations have been implicated in recurrent rhabdomyolysis, a condition marked by muscle injury and weakness. A novel missense variant in the MYH1 gene was identified in a patient with recurrent episodes of muscle pain and weakness, suggesting that MYH1 mutations could be a cause of this condition (Alsaif2021MYH1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MYH1 mutations in both equine and human muscle disorders.
