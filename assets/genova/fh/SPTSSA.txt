# SPTSSA

## Overview
The SPTSSA gene encodes the serine palmitoyltransferase small subunit A, a critical component of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, which are essential components of cell membranes and are involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly within the nervous system. As an activating subunit, SPTSSA enhances the enzymatic activity of the SPT complex, facilitating the condensation of L-serine with acyl-CoA to form sphingoid bases, the precursors of sphingolipids. The regulation of SPT activity by SPTSSA is crucial for maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis, with dysregulation linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (Srivastava2023SPTSSA).

## Function
The SPTSSA gene encodes a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex, which is crucial for sphingolipid synthesis in human cells. SPTSSA acts as an activating subunit of SPT, catalyzing the rate-limiting step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. This process involves the condensation of L-serine with an acyl-CoA to form a sphingoid base, which is essential for the production of sphingolipids, key components of cell membranes and important in cellular signaling, particularly in the nervous system (Srivastava2023SPTSSA).

In healthy human cells, SPTSSA enhances the enzymatic activity of the SPTLC1/SPTLC2 heterodimer, ensuring adequate sphingolipid synthesis necessary for normal cellular function (Srivastava2023SPTSSA). The activity of SPT is tightly regulated by ORMDL proteins, which provide feedback inhibition to prevent excessive sphingolipid accumulation, which can be cytotoxic (Srivastava2023SPTSSA). SPTSSA interacts with ORMDL proteins to facilitate this regulation, maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis (Srivastava2023SPTSSA). Proper function of SPTSSA is critical for maintaining normal sphingolipid levels and preventing neurodegenerative diseases (Srivastava2023SPTSSA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPTSSA gene are associated with complex hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a group of disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness, particularly in the lower extremities. Specific variants such as T51I and 58fs have been identified in patients with HSP, leading to alterations in sphingolipid metabolism. These mutations result in clinical features including spastic gait, intellectual disability, and various neurological and systemic symptoms (Srivastava2023SPTSSA). The T51I variant is a de novo dominant mutation that disrupts the regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) by ORMDL proteins, leading to increased sphingolipid synthesis and associated neurodegeneration (Srivastava2023SPTSSA). The 58fs variant, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, results in lower SPT activity due to reduced expression and stability of the mutant protein (Srivastava2023SPTSSA).

These SPTSSA variants impair the regulation of SPT activity, leading to excessive sphingolipid synthesis, which is linked to neurological defects such as motor impairment, cognitive decline, and sensorineural hearing loss (Srivastava2023SPTSSA). The dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism due to SPTSSA mutations is implicated in the pathogenesis of hereditary spastic paraplegia and other neurodegenerative conditions (Mohassel2024Serine; Pan2023Sphingolipids).

## Interactions
SPTSSA is a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex, which is essential for sphingolipid synthesis. It interacts with other subunits, specifically SPTLC1 and SPTLC2, to form a functional heterotrimeric enzyme complex. This complex catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of sphingolipid biosynthesis, which involves the condensation of serine with an acyl-CoA to produce the sphingoid base, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (3-KDS) (Srivastava2023SPTSSA).

SPTSSA also interacts with ORMDL proteins, which are known to regulate SPT activity through feedback inhibition. This interaction is crucial for maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis. Variants in SPTSSA, such as T51I and 58fs, have been shown to impair ORMDL-mediated inhibition, leading to increased SPT activity and elevated sphingolipid levels. The T51I variant, in particular, disrupts the negative feedback regulation by ORMDL proteins, resulting in unregulated sphingolipid synthesis (Srivastava2023SPTSSA).

The C-terminal region of SPTSSA is important for its interaction with ORMDL proteins, as deletion of this region affects the response to ORMDL3, further highlighting the significance of these interactions in regulating SPT activity (Srivastava2023SPTSSA).
