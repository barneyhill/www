# EDC3

## Overview
EDC3 is a gene that encodes the protein enhancer of mRNA decapping 3, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mRNA decay, a critical process for maintaining proper gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The EDC3 protein is categorized as a decapping factor and is involved in the removal of the 5' cap from mRNA molecules, thereby marking them for degradation. This function is essential for mRNA turnover and stability, influencing protein synthesis and cellular responses (Ahmed2015Mutations; Scheller2018Integrative). EDC3 is characterized by distinct domains, including an LSm domain, a central FDF domain, and a YjeF-N domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization to processing bodies (P-bodies) where mRNA degradation occurs (Walters2014Edc3; Zhang2021Insight). Mutations in the EDC3 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental processes (Scheller2018Integrative; Ahmed2015Mutations).

## Structure
The EDC3 protein, known as the enhancer of mRNA decapping 3, is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in mRNA decay. It contains an N-terminal LSm domain, a central FDF (Phe-Asp-Phe) domain, and a C-terminal YjeF-N domain. The LSm domain is crucial for binding to DCP1 and localizing to processing bodies (P-bodies), which are involved in mRNA decapping and decay (Zhang2021Insight; Scheller2018Integrative). The FDF domain interacts with RNA helicases such as Dhh1p in yeast and DDX6 in humans, playing a role in mRNA decapping (Zhang2021Insight). The YjeF-N domain is involved in RNA binding and dimerization, and it has a putative binding site for NAD(H)-related compounds, which influences Edc3's function and localization (Walters2014Edc3).

The interaction of EDC3 with other proteins, such as Dcp2, is facilitated by its domains, with the YjeF-N domain playing a significant role in enhancing these interactions (He2015Control). EDC3's ability to form complexes with other proteins suggests a quaternary structure, although specific details on its primary, secondary, and tertiary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The EDC3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in mRNA decay, a fundamental process for regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. EDC3 functions as an enhancer of mRNA decapping, facilitating the removal of the 5' cap from mRNA molecules, which marks them for degradation. This process is essential for mRNA turnover and stability, impacting protein synthesis and cellular responses (Ahmed2015Mutations; Scheller2018Integrative).

EDC3 interacts with the decapping enzyme DCP2, enhancing its activity to promote efficient mRNA decapping. This interaction is particularly important for mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs), as EDC3 works in conjunction with the RNA-binding protein Tristetraprolin (TTP) to target these mRNAs for decay (Ahmed2015Mutations; Scheller2018Integrative). The protein also plays a scaffolding role in the assembly of processing bodies (P-bodies), cytoplasmic structures where mRNA degradation occurs (Walters2014Edc3).

In addition to its role in mRNA decay, EDC3 is involved in linking cellular metabolism to posttranscriptional gene regulation through its interaction with NAD(H)-related molecules. This interaction is thought to modulate EDC3's function, potentially influencing cellular energetics and mRNA regulation (Walters2014Edc3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EDC3 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive intellectual disability. A specific mutation, p.Phe54Ser, disrupts the LSm domain structure, impairing the interaction between EDC3 and DCP2, which is crucial for mRNA decapping. This disruption leads to the accumulation of certain mRNAs, potentially affecting neural function and contributing to intellectual disability (Ahmed2015Mutations). Individuals with EDC3 mutations typically present with a milder form of intellectual disability compared to those with mutations in other decapping-related genes, such as DCPS (Ahmed2015Mutations).

Research has shown that EDC3 mutations can lead to large-scale transcriptional dysregulation, particularly affecting genes with AU-rich elements (AREs), which are associated with mRNA stability and decay. This dysregulation is linked to synaptic and cell cycle-related processes, suggesting that EDC3 plays a significant role in neuronal function (Scheller2018Integrative). The impairment of EDC3 function may contribute to intellectual disability through the dysregulation of long transcripts and synaptic pathways, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Scheller2018Integrative).

## Interactions
EDC3, a protein involved in mRNA decapping, participates in several interactions with other proteins. In Caenorhabditis elegans, EDC3 interacts with the RNA helicase CGH-1. This interaction is mediated by the EDC-3 FDF-FEK motif binding to the CGH-1 RecA2 domain through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Key residues involved include Phe 247, Phe 249, and Asp 246 of EDC-3, which interact with His 269, Lys 277, and Gln 266 of CGH-1. Mutations in these residues significantly weaken the binding affinity, highlighting their importance (Zhang2021Insight).

In yeast, EDC3 interacts with the decapping enzyme Dcp2 and the N-terminal domain of Upf1. This interaction is crucial for mediating the connection between Dcp2 and Upf1, as mutations in Dcp2 that disrupt its interaction with EDC3 also reduce its interaction with Upf1. The Edc3 binding site on Upf1 overlaps with a predicted Upf2 binding site, indicating a complex interplay between these proteins (Swisher2011Interactions).

These interactions suggest that EDC3 plays a significant role in mRNA decapping and decay processes, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and potentially impacting neurodevelopmental processes in humans (Zhang2021Insight).
