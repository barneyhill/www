# KLHL7

## Overview
KLHL7 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 7, which is a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, functioning as part of a Cullin 3 (CUL3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by its BTB, BACK, and Kelch domains, which facilitate its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation, crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Oh2019Novel; Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin). The KLHL7 protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with significant expression in the heart, central nervous system, and endocrine tissues, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Jeffries2019Two). Mutations in the KLHL7 gene are linked to several genetic disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa 42 and syndromes resembling Crisponi syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Oh2019Novel; Cheraghi2020A).

## Structure
The KLHL7 protein is characterized by three functional domains: the BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, the BACK (BTB and C-terminal Kelch) domain, and multiple Kelch repeats. The BTB domain is crucial for dimerization and interaction with Cullin3 (CUL3) to form a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin; Jeffries2019Two). The BACK domain, which bridges the BTB and Kelch domains, contains a structural motif known as the 3-box motif, forming a cleft that plays a crucial role in the formation of the Cullin-KLHL E3 ligase complex (Oh2019Novel). The Kelch domain consists of six Kelch repeats, forming the 'blades' of a β-propeller structure, which is important for substrate recognition and specificity (Oh2019Novel).

KLHL7 encodes two protein isoforms with 564 and 586 residues, resulting from distinct 5' exons (Friedman2009Mutations). These isoforms contain BTB, BACK, and Kelch functional domains, with the BTB domain similar to that of B cell lymphoma 6, the BACK domain to Kbtbd4, and the Kelch domain to KLHL12 (Friedman2009Mutations). The protein's quaternary structure involves homodimerization, primarily through the BTB domain, with the BACK domain enhancing dimerization efficiency (Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin).

## Function
The KLHL7 gene encodes a protein that functions as part of a Cullin 3 (Cul3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial for the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation in cells (Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin). This protein complex facilitates the ubiquitination of specific substrates, marking them for degradation by the proteasome, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin). KLHL7 interacts with Cul3 through its BTB and BACK domains, forming homodimers primarily through the BTB domain, with the BACK domain enhancing dimerization efficiency (Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin).

In healthy human cells, KLHL7 is involved in the ubiquitination of target proteins, specifically mediating the linkage of Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are processed by the proteasome (Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in humans, with high levels in the heart muscle, central nervous system, and endocrine tissues, indicating its importance in various cellular activities, including proliferation, differentiation, and maintenance of cytoskeletal structure (Jeffries2019Two). KLHL7's role in these processes underscores its significance in cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KLHL7 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the retina and other systems. Autosomal dominant mutations in the KLHL7 gene, particularly in the BACK domain, are linked to retinitis pigmentosa 42 (RP42), a form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa characterized by progressive vision loss due to retinal degeneration (Oh2019Novel; Heng2019New). These mutations disrupt the formation of the Cullin-KLHL E3 ligase complex, leading to retinal degeneration (Oh2019Novel).

In contrast, autosomal recessive mutations in KLHL7 are associated with syndromes resembling Crisponi syndrome (CS) or cold-induced sweating syndrome type 1 (CISS1), and Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOS)-like features. These conditions are characterized by developmental delays, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and other systemic abnormalities (Cheraghi2020A; Jeffries2019Two; Bruel2017Expanding). Recessive mutations often result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or truncated proteins, contributing to the clinical manifestations (Cheraghi2020A).

The phenotypic spectrum of KLHL7-related disorders is broad, with variability in clinical presentation even among individuals with similar genetic mutations, suggesting potential influences from modifier genes (Jeffries2019Two).

## Interactions
KLHL7 is known to interact with Cullin 3 (CUL3) to form a CUL3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is mediated by the BTB and BACK domains of KLHL7, which facilitate the binding to CUL3 and the enzymatic core Rbx1/Roc1, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process (Cheraghi2020A; Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin). The Kelch domain of KLHL7 is responsible for substrate recognition and ubiquitination, which is essential for targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation (Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin; Angius2016Biallelic).

Mutations in KLHL7 can affect its interaction with CUL3, as seen with certain mutations that disrupt the structural conformation necessary for forming the CUL3-KLHL7 E3 ligase complex. For instance, mutations in the BACK domain, such as A153T and A153V, impair the interaction with CUL3, thereby attenuating the E3 ligase activity (Oh2019Novel; Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin). Despite these mutations, KLHL7 can still form dimers, indicating that dimerization is not affected, although the overall ubiquitination process may be compromised (Kigoshi2011Ubiquitin). These interactions highlight the importance of KLHL7 in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis through its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
