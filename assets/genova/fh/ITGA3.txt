# ITGA3

## Overview
The ITGA3 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 3, a critical component of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion and signaling. Integrin subunit alpha 3, when paired with beta subunits, forms the α3β1 integrin receptor, which plays a pivotal role in cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). This receptor is involved in various physiological processes, including cell survival, migration, and wound healing, by interacting with ECM proteins such as laminin and fibronectin. The α3β1 integrin is particularly significant in epithelial cell proliferation and survival, influencing pathways like MEK/ERK and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling (Manohar2004α3β1; DiPersio2016Integrinmediated). Mutations in ITGA3 can lead to severe disorders, including nephrotic syndrome and interstitial lung disease, underscoring its clinical importance (Nicolaou2012Gain). The gene's role in cancer progression, particularly in processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Bijnsdorp2013Exosomal; Zhang2020ITGA3).

## Structure
The ITGA3 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 3, which is a component of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of ITGA3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the integrin alpha 3 subunit. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of ITGA3 is characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail, which are typical features of integrin proteins (Nazir2023Mutation).

In terms of quaternary structure, ITGA3 forms heterodimers with beta subunits, most commonly with integrin beta 1, to create functional integrin receptors. This heterodimerization is crucial for the integrin's role in cell-matrix interactions (Nazir2023Mutation). ITGA3 contains specific domains, such as the Integrin_alpha-2 domain, which spans amino acids 462-916 and is conserved across the integrin family (Nazir2023Mutation).

Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, play a significant role in the function and stability of ITGA3. Mutations that affect glycosylation can disrupt the protein's structure and function, leading to diseases such as nephrotic syndrome (Nicolaou2012Gain).

## Function
The ITGA3 gene encodes the integrin alpha 3 subunit, which pairs with beta subunits to form the α3β1 integrin receptor. This receptor is crucial for cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly laminin-5, and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In keratinocytes, α3β1 integrin is essential for cell survival by activating the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell survival (Manohar2004α3β1). The integrin also activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is vital for signal transduction and cell survival (Manohar2004α3β1).

In the context of wound healing, α3β1 integrin is involved in maintaining basement membrane integrity and promoting keratinocyte migration and survival at the wound edge (Manohar2004α3β1; DiPersio2016Integrinmediated). It also regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and pro-angiogenic factors, influencing fibroblast function and angiogenesis (DiPersio2016Integrinmediated). The α3β1 integrin's interaction with laminin-5 is also linked to epithelial cell proliferation through the MAPK signaling pathway, highlighting its role in cell growth and adhesion (Gonzales1999A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITGA3 gene, which encodes the integrin α3 subunit, are associated with several severe disorders. A notable mutation, A349S, results in a gain of glycosylation that disrupts the biosynthesis of integrin α3β1. This mutation impairs the heterodimerization of the α3 subunit with β1, leading to the degradation of the misfolded α3 precursor and accumulation of the β1 precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum. This disruption causes severe multiorgan disorders, including interstitial lung disease and congenital nephrotic syndrome (Nicolaou2012Gain).

The A349S mutation introduces an N-glycosylation motif, leading to hyperglycosylation and preventing proper integrin function. This mutation is linked to severe kidney and lung abnormalities, such as aberrant glomerular morphology and interstitial fibrosis in the kidneys, and widened alveolar septa in the lungs (Nicolaou2012Gain).

ILNEB syndrome, characterized by interstitial lung disease, nephrotic syndrome, and epidermolysis bullosa, is also associated with ITGA3 mutations. This syndrome can result from both missense and intronic mutations, leading to complex splicing errors and abnormal integrin α3 expression (Alstrup2021First; He2016Intronic). The clinical manifestations of ITGA3 mutations can vary significantly, with some patients exhibiting a broader range of symptoms and surviving into adulthood (Alstrup2021First).

## Interactions
ITGA3, or integrin subunit alpha 3, is known to form the α3β1 integrin complex by pairing with the beta 1 subunit. This complex interacts with various extracellular matrix proteins, including laminin and fibronectin, facilitating cell adhesion and migration (Hiroshima2020Novel; Morini2000The). In breast cancer cells, ITGA3 interacts with vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which is crucial for regulating cell stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (Zhang2020ITGA3). 

In prostate cancer, ITGA3 is found in exosomes and interacts with ITGB1, playing a significant role in cell migration and invasion. These interactions are crucial for the metastatic behavior of prostate cancer cells (Bijnsdorp2013Exosomal). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, ITGA3 is regulated by the miR-199 family, which binds to its mRNA, affecting cell migration and invasion by modulating downstream signaling pathways involving AKT, ERK1/2, and FAK (Koshizuka2017Regulation). These interactions highlight ITGA3's role in various cancer-related processes, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.
