# TREML4

## Overview
TREML4, or triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells like 4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein involved in the immune response. The TREML4 protein is predominantly expressed on myeloid cells, where it plays a crucial role in modulating inflammatory processes and immune cell signaling. This receptor is implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and cardiovascular conditions, particularly atherosclerosis, due to its influence on leukocyte activity and inflammatory pathways (Duarte2019TREML4; GonzalezCotto2020TREML4). Variations in the TREML4 gene, such as specific polymorphisms, can affect the expression and function of the receptor, thereby impacting disease progression and severity (Duarte2022TREML4). As a result, TREML4 is being studied for its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases.

## Clinical Significance
TREML4 is implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular conditions. Alterations in TREML4 expression, particularly due to specific polymorphisms such as rs2803495 and rs2803496, are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. These polymorphisms are located in regulatory regions of the gene, affecting mRNA splicing, stability, and translation, leading to higher TREML4 expression in blood leukocytes (Duarte2022TREML4; GonzalezCotto2020TREML4). Increased TREML4 expression is linked to more severe coronary artery lesions and may serve as a biomarker for coronary lesion extent in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients (Duarte2019TREML4).

TREML4 expression is also associated with coronary arterial calcification and is higher in patients with high CAC scores, suggesting a role in exacerbating atherosclerosis by increasing lesion burden and vulnerability features of advanced lesions (GonzalezCotto2020TREML4). The gene's expression is linked to inflammatory responses and pathways related to lipid regulation and carbohydrate metabolism, which may influence the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and plaque stability (Duarte2022TREML4; GonzalezCotto2020TREML4). These findings highlight TREML4's potential as a biomarker for assessing atherosclerotic lesions and its role in cardiovascular diseases.
