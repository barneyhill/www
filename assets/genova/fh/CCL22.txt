# CCL22

## Overview
CCL22, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 22, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CC chemokine family, which plays a pivotal role in immune system regulation. The protein product of CCL22 is a chemokine that primarily functions in mediating immune cell interactions, particularly between dendritic cells and regulatory T cells, through its interaction with the CCR4 receptor. This interaction is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune responses. CCL22 is constitutively expressed in lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes and the thymus, and its expression can be modulated in response to inflammatory stimuli. The protein is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune tolerance, inflammation, and cancer progression, making it a significant focus of research in immunology and therapeutic development (Bonecchi2004Differential; Berin2001Production; Rapp2019CCL22).

## Structure
CCL22, a member of the CC chemokine family, is characterized by its primary structure, which includes a specific sequence of amino acids forming a compact, globular protein. The secondary structure of CCL22 typically comprises alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure is defined by a conserved fold consisting of a flexible N-terminus, a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, and a C-terminal α-helix, stabilized by disulfide bridges formed by conserved cysteine residues (Miller2017Chemokines).

In terms of quaternary structure, CC chemokines like CCL22 often form oligomers, primarily dimers. These dimers are elongated and form through interactions between short N-terminal β-strands, with the C-terminal helices running almost perpendicular to each other (Miller2017Chemokines). The oligomerization of chemokines is dynamic, influenced by amino acid composition and inter-subunit interfaces, which can be affected by solution conditions (Miller2017Chemokines).

CCL22 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for functional diversity in immune responses.

## Function
CCL22, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 22, is a chemokine that plays a crucial role in immune regulation by mediating interactions between dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in lymphoid organs. It is constitutively expressed at high levels in lymph nodes and the thymus, where it facilitates the formation of DC-Treg contacts, essential for maintaining immune homeostasis (Piseddu2020Constitutive; Rapp2019CCL22). CCL22 attracts Tregs via the CCR4 receptor, promoting their retention in lymph nodes and enhancing their immunosuppressive functions (Hao2016Critical; Rapp2019CCL22).

In the spleen, CCL22 is involved in maintaining tolerance during apoptotic cell clearance by recruiting CCR4+ Tregs, which helps create an immunosuppressive environment (Hao2016Critical). In the intestinal epithelium, CCL22 is constitutively produced and can be upregulated in response to proinflammatory cytokines, playing a role in attracting Th2 cells and modulating the local cytokine environment (Berin2001Production). This chemokine is crucial for controlling the balance of immune responses, preventing excessive immune activation, and maintaining immune homeostasis in healthy human cells (Rapp2019CCL22).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL22 gene are implicated in various diseases and conditions. Elevated serum levels of CCL22 have been observed in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), where they are associated with more severe symptoms and cognitive impairments (Laurikainen2020Elevated). In cancer, CCL22 expression by tumor cells and macrophages can lead to the migration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) into tumors, suppressing anti-tumor immunity and worsening prognosis. This is particularly noted in colorectal cancer, where high CCL22 expression is linked to poorer survival outcomes and an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (Wang2022Identification). 

In autoimmune diseases, CCL22 can have protective effects by activating Tregs, although results are mixed (Laurikainen2020Elevated). In Sjögren’s syndrome, CCL22-producing macrophages enhance T cell responses, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis (Ushio2018CCL22-Producing). In inflammatory conditions like asthma and atopic dermatitis, CCL22 is involved in Th2-mediated mechanisms, exacerbating inflammation (Laurikainen2020Elevated). The CCL22-CCR4 axis is also considered a potential target for treating central nervous system autoimmune diseases (Scheu2017The).

## Interactions
CCL22, also known as macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), primarily interacts with the CCR4 receptor on T cells, influencing their migration and activation. This interaction is crucial for the communication between regulatory T cells (T regs) and dendritic cells (DCs) in lymph nodes, facilitating immune regulation (Rapp2019CCL22). CCL22 binds to CCR4 with higher affinity compared to CCL17, enhancing T reg communication with DCs (Rapp2019CCL22).

CCL22 is also efficiently scavenged by the D6 decoy receptor, which binds CCL22 with high affinity, leading to its inactivation and degradation. This interaction does not induce typical receptor activation, such as calcium flux or cell migration, indicating a unique role for D6 in modulating chemotactic activity (Bonecchi2004Differential). The D6 receptor internalizes independently of ligand binding, unlike CCR4, which shows decreased surface expression upon CCL22 binding (Bonecchi2004Differential).

CCL22 also acts as a partial agonist for atypical chemokine receptor 4 (ACKR4), inducing β-arrestin-1 recruitment, although with less potency compared to other ligands like CCL19 (Meyrath2020Systematic). These interactions highlight CCL22's role in immune homeostasis and regulation.
