# TRIM66

## Overview
TRIM66 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 66, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its PHD-Bromodomain, which allows it to function as a chromatin reader, recognizing specific histone modifications. TRIM66 plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability, particularly in embryonic stem cells, by regulating the DNA damage response (DDR) through interactions with histone modifications and other nuclear proteins (Chen2019TRIM66). It is involved in recruiting histone deacetylase Sirt6 to chromatin, facilitating the deacetylation of H3K56ac, which is crucial for DNA repair processes (Chen2019TRIM66). Beyond its role in genomic stability, TRIM66 is implicated in various cancers, where it influences signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and JAK/STAT, promoting oncogenic properties (Fan2019TRIM66; Cao2020TRIM66). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to developmental disorders and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Mielnicka2024Trim66’s; Cao2020TRIM66).

## Structure


## Function
TRIM66 is a crucial protein in maintaining genomic stability in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by regulating the DNA damage response (DDR). It functions as a chromatin reader, recognizing specific histone modifications such as unmodified H3R2, H3K4, and acetylated H3K56ac. This recognition is mediated through its PHD-Bromodomain, which is essential for binding acetylated peptides and facilitating DDR processes (Chen2019TRIM66).

TRIM66 plays a significant role in recruiting the histone deacetylase Sirt6 to chromatin, which is necessary for the deacetylation of H3K56ac at DNA damage sites. This deacetylation is critical for the recruitment of DNA repair machinery, ensuring efficient DNA repair and maintaining genomic integrity (Chen2019TRIM66). The absence of TRIM66 leads to increased levels of DNA damage markers such as γ-H2AX, resulting in genomic instability characterized by chromosomal breakage and fusion (Chen2019TRIM66).

TRIM66 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin and other nuclear proteins to modulate transcriptional activity. Its role in DDR and chromatin remodeling highlights its importance in safeguarding genomic stability, particularly in ESCs (Chen2019TRIM66).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in TRIM66 expression or mutations in the gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In reproductive biology, TRIM66 deficiency in male mice leads to a paternal effect phenotype, causing intrauterine overgrowth in offspring. This condition is characterized by offspring being overweight at birth, a phenotype not observed when the mutation is maternally inherited, suggesting a unique paternal influence (Mielnicka2024Trim66’s).

In cancer research, TRIM66 has been implicated in the progression of several types of cancer. In prostate cancer, TRIM66 is upregulated and promotes malignant progression through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role in oncogenesis (Cao2020TRIM66). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma, TRIM66 enhances tumorigenicity by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, with its overexpression leading to increased tumor growth and invasiveness (Fan2019TRIM66).

TRIM66 also plays a role in genomic stability. In embryonic stem cells, it is crucial for the DNA damage response, and its depletion leads to increased DNA damage and genomic instability, highlighting its protective role in maintaining genomic integrity (Chen2019TRIM66). These findings suggest that TRIM66 is a potential therapeutic target in cancer and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
TRIM66 interacts with several proteins and histone modifications, playing a significant role in DNA damage response and genomic stability. In embryonic stem cells, TRIM66 specifically recognizes unmodified histone H3R2 and H3K4 through its PHD-Bromodomain, and it also binds to the acetylated H3K56 (H3K56ac) peptide. This interaction is facilitated by the ZA and BC loops of the TRIM66 Bromodomain, which are crucial for binding acetylated peptides (Chen2019TRIM66).

TRIM66 also interacts with Sirt6, a histone deacetylase, to facilitate the deacetylation of H3K56ac at DNA damage sites. This interaction is essential for recruiting DNA repair proteins and maintaining genomic integrity. The F2 region of TRIM66 is particularly important for its association with Sirt6 (Chen2019TRIM66).

In the context of cancer, TRIM66 has been shown to interact with components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. It regulates the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and β-catenin, influencing cell proliferation and invasion. TRIM66's interaction with GSK-3β is crucial for its role in promoting oncogenic properties through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Fan2019TRIM66).
