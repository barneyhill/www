# AUTS2

## Overview
The AUTS2 gene encodes the activator of transcription and developmental regulator AUTS2 protein, which plays a pivotal role in neurodevelopmental processes. Located on human chromosome 7q11.22, the AUTS2 gene is involved in transcriptional regulation and cytoskeletal dynamics, influencing gene expression critical for brain development (Hori2021AUTS2; Biel2022AUTS2). The protein is characterized by intrinsically disordered regions and low complexity sequences, typical of RNA-binding proteins, and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing (Biel2022AUTS2). Functionally, AUTS2 interacts with the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and other proteins to modulate transcription and cytoskeletal rearrangements, impacting neuronal migration and synapse balance (Pang2021Untangle; Hori2021AUTS2). Clinically, mutations in the AUTS2 gene are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, highlighting its significance in cognitive and behavioral outcomes (Oksenberg2013The; Hori2021AUTS2).

## Structure
The AUTS2 protein is encoded by a gene located on human chromosome 7q11.22 and consists of 1,259 amino acids in its full-length form (AUTS2-FL) (Hori2021AUTS2; Biel2022AUTS2). The protein includes several structural features, such as two proline-rich regions (PR1 and PR2), a PY motif, and eight histidine repeats, which suggest nuclear localization (Hori2014Cytoskeletal; Hori2021AUTS2). The AUTS2 protein is characterized by a high content of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and low complexity sequences (LCSs), typical of RNA-binding proteins, covering approximately 74.2% of the full-length isoform (Biel2022AUTS2).

The protein has multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including a shorter C-terminal isoform (AUTS2-C) of 711 amino acids, which lacks discrete nuclear localization sequences but still localizes to the nucleus (Hori2021AUTS2; Biel2022AUTS2). The AUTS2 domain, a conserved sequence across the gene family, is present in both isoforms (Biel2022AUTS2). The protein interacts with other proteins through a PY motif, present in the full-length isoform but absent in the C-terminal isoform (Biel2022AUTS2). The AUTS2 protein is involved in transcriptional regulation and cytoskeletal dynamics, with its structure facilitating interactions with other proteins and DNA (Biel2022AUTS2).

## Function
The AUTS2 gene plays a crucial role in neurodevelopmental processes by regulating transcriptional networks and epigenetic mechanisms. In healthy human cells, AUTS2 functions as a transcriptional regulator within the nucleus, where it influences gene expression critical for brain development (Pang2021Untangle; Hori2021AUTS2). It interacts with the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), converting it from a repressor to an activator of transcription by recruiting casein kinase 2 (CK2) and histone acetyltransferase P300/CBP, which acetylates histone H3 to promote transcription (Hori2021AUTS2; Biel2022AUTS2).

AUTS2 is involved in balancing excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the brain, which is essential for maintaining proper neural circuit function. Loss of AUTS2 results in an increase in excitatory synapses, leading to an imbalance associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (Pang2021Untangle; Hori2021AUTS2). In the cytoplasm, AUTS2 regulates neuronal migration and neuritogenesis by controlling cytoskeletal rearrangements through interactions with Rho family GTPases, affecting lamellipodia and filopodia formation (Pang2021Untangle; Hori2021AUTS2). These functions highlight AUTS2's significant role in neurodevelopment and its impact on cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
The AUTS2 gene is associated with a wide range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Mutations or structural variants in AUTS2 have been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay (DD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Oksenberg2013The; Hori2021AUTS2). Patients with AUTS2 mutations often exhibit additional symptoms such as microcephaly, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and short stature, collectively referred to as "AUTS2 syndrome" (Hori2021AUTS2; Biel2022AUTS2).

The gene is also implicated in various psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression (Hori2021AUTS2). A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within AUTS2, rs6943555, is associated with alcohol consumption, with increased expression in carriers of the minor A allele (Oksenberg2013The). In individuals with heroin dependence, AUTS2 expression is significantly lower, and the AA genotype of rs6943555 is over-represented (Oksenberg2013The).

Non-neurologically, AUTS2 has been linked to conditions such as childhood hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia and early-onset androgenetic alopecia (Oksenberg2013The). Despite these associations, disruptions in AUTS2 are most commonly linked to neurological phenotypes (Oksenberg2013The).

## Interactions
The AUTS2 protein is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in neurodevelopmental processes. It interacts with components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), such as PCGF3 and PCGF5, converting PRC1 from a repressor to an activator of transcription by recruiting the histone acetyltransferase P300 (MondererRothkoff2019AUTS2; Biel2022AUTS2). AUTS2 also associates with non-canonical forms of PRC1, which include PCGF3/5, RING1A/B, and RYBP/YAF2, but lack CBX proteins (Biel2022AUTS2).

In the developing cerebral cortex, AUTS2 interacts with multiple RNA-binding proteins, including NONO, SFPQ, SRSF3, SRSF7, DDX5, and DDX7, suggesting a role in RNA metabolism (Biel2022AUTS2). It is also part of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex with DOCK1 and ELMO2, leading to the activation of Rac1, which is involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and neurite elongation (Biel2022AUTS2).

The long isoform of AUTS2 interacts with polycomb group proteins PCGF3 and PCGF5, while both long and short isoforms interact with the splicing factor SF3B1 (MondererRothkoff2019AUTS2). These interactions are crucial for understanding the functional roles of AUTS2 in transcription regulation and neuronal differentiation.
