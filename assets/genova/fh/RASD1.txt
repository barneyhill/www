# RASD1

## Overview
RASD1, or Ras dexamethasone-induced 1, is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein belonging to the Ras superfamily. This protein, also referred to as Dexras1, is characterized by its involvement in various cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to cyclic AMP (cAMP) and MAPK signaling. Unlike typical Ras proteins, RASD1 has a unique structural feature, including an extended C-terminal cationic variable domain and a C-terminal CAAX box, which undergoes post-translational modifications influencing its localization and function (Tan2011Rasd1; Tan2024Functional). Functionally, RASD1 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and is involved in modulating transcriptional activities, growth arrest, and apoptosis, thereby playing roles in tumor suppression and other cellular processes (Tan2024Functional). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as NonO and Ear2, further underscore its regulatory capacity in diverse biological contexts (Ong2011Rasd1; Tan2024Functional).

## Structure
RASD1, also known as Dexras1, is a small GTPase protein that belongs to the Ras superfamily. It is characterized by a GTP-binding domain, which includes conserved motifs necessary for GTP binding and hydrolysis, such as the G1, G3, G4, and G5 boxes (Tan2011Rasd1; Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). The protein has a unique extended C-terminal cationic variable domain, contributing to its higher molecular weight of 34 kDa compared to typical Ras proteins (Tan2024Functional). 

RASD1 features a C-terminal CAAX box, which undergoes post-translational isoprenylation, influencing its subcellular localization and function (Tan2011Rasd1). This protein is distinct from other Ras family members due to its highly basic net isoelectric point and its ability to exist in both cytosolic and membrane-associated forms (Tan2024Functional). 

Structurally, RASD1 has deviations in its G1 and G3 motifs, leading to impaired GTP hydrolysis and GAP insensitivity, resulting in a constitutively active state (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). The N-terminal region of RASD1 is also noted for its potential role in modulating N-type calcium channels (Verma2019IN).

## Function
RASD1, also known as Ras dexamethasone-induced 1, is a small GTPase protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the regulation of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway, where it interacts with NonO to modulate transcriptional activities. RASD1 represses CREB-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect is enhanced by NonO, which also facilitates the nuclear localization of RASD1 (Ong2011Rasd1).

RASD1 functions as a GPCR-independent activator of G proteins and acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for both monomeric and heteromeric Gα i/o proteins. It selectively transduces signals to the p42/p44 MAPK pathway, leading to transcriptional activation of downstream target genes. RASD1 also inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity, reducing cAMP production, and plays a role in growth arrest or apoptosis, thereby preventing tumor development (Tan2024Functional).

In the context of renin transcription, RASD1 interacts with Ear2 (NR2F6), alleviating Ear2-mediated transcriptional repression of the renin promoter. This interaction involves the translocation of Ear2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, allowing other stimulatory factors to bind to the renin enhancer (Tan2011Rasd1; Tan2024Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RASD1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In schizophrenia, rare variants of the RASD1 gene, specifically c.722A>T and c*31G>A, have been identified in affected individuals, suggesting a potential role in the disorder's etiopathogenesis due to RASD1's interaction with NMDAR-related proteins (Durmaz2022Genetic). In the context of Cushing's disease, a novel somatic mutation in RASD1 was identified in a corticotroph adenoma, indicating its involvement in the pathogenesis of ACTH-secreting tumors (Uzilov2017Identification).

In cancer, RASD1 expression levels have been associated with varying outcomes. High RASD1 transcript levels in adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients correlate with poor survival, as RASD1 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and chemotherapy resistance (Wang2019High). Conversely, in glioma, RASD1 overexpression inhibits cell migration and invasion, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Gao2017Overexpression). In gastric cancer, RASD1 functions as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation linked to increased tumor progression (Ren2024KIAA1429). These findings highlight the complex role of RASD1 in various diseases, where its expression and mutations can lead to diverse clinical outcomes.

## Interactions
RASD1, also known as Rasd1, is involved in several protein interactions that modulate various signaling pathways. It interacts with NonO, a multifunctional protein, to modulate the cAMP pathway. This interaction occurs at the cAMP response element (CRE) sites, where RASD1 changes NonO from a co-activator to a co-repressor, suppressing the transcription of CRE-containing genes such as NR4A1 and NR4A2 (Ong2011Rasd1). The interaction between RASD1 and NonO is dependent on the GTP-hydrolysis activity of RASD1 (Ong2011Rasd1).

RASD1 also interacts with Ear2 (NR2F6), a negative regulator of renin transcription. This interaction alleviates Ear2-mediated repression of renin transcription, suggesting a role for RASD1 in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system. The interaction involves the ligand binding domain of Ear2 and results in the translocation of Ear2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Tan2011Rasd1; Tan2024Functional).

Additionally, RASD1 forms a ternary complex with CAPON and nNOS, which can be activated by s-nitrosylation, although this interaction is not necessary for RASD1's inhibition of cAMP pathways (Greenwood2016Rasd1).
