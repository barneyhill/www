# NKIRAS2

## Overview
NKIRAS2 is a gene that encodes the protein NFKB inhibitor interacting Ras-like 2, which plays a critical role in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This protein functions as a negative regulator, modulating the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, a key factor in immune response, inflammation, and cell survival (Xu2019EpsteinBarr). As a regulatory protein, NKIRAS2 interacts with IκB proteins to maintain NF-κB in an inactive state, thereby influencing cellular processes such as apoptosis and stress responses (Sarais2020Characterisation). The protein's activity is further modulated by microRNAs, including miR-BART13 and miR-125b, which affect its expression and function in various disease contexts, such as cancer and inflammation (Xu2019EpsteinBarr; Haemmig2014miR125b). The expression level of NKIRAS2 can determine its role in either promoting or suppressing oncogenic transformation, indicating its context-dependent function (Tago2021K15).

## Function
NKIRAS2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for immune response, inflammation, and cell survival. The NKIRAS2 protein functions as a negative regulator of NF-κB activity, modulating transcriptional activity and impacting processes such as apoptosis and cellular stress responses (Xu2019EpsteinBarr). In healthy cells, NKIRAS2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with components of the NF-κB pathway to influence the localization and activity of NF-κB (Sarais2020Characterisation).

NKIRAS2 affects the phosphorylation of Akt, a process linked to mTORC2 activity, suggesting its role in regulating cellular metabolism and growth pathways (Tago2021K15). The protein's expression level can influence its function, with moderate expression potentially enhancing oncogenic transformation, while excess expression leads to a tumor suppressive phenotype (Tago2021K15). This indicates that NKIRAS2's function may be context-dependent, influenced by its expression level and the cellular environment. The protein's role in modulating NF-κB activity is conserved across vertebrates, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal inflammatory responses and preventing aberrant cell growth (Sarais2020Characterisation).

## Clinical Significance
NKIRAS2 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded miR-BART13 targets NKIRAS2, leading to its downregulation. This suppression activates the NF-κB pathway, promoting NPC cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis (Xu2019EpsteinBarr). Overexpression of NKIRAS2 in NPC cells can reverse these effects, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2019EpsteinBarr).

In glioblastomas (GBM), miR-125b targets NKIRAS2, contributing to apoptosis resistance and chemoresistance to temozolomide (TMZ). This interaction enhances NF-κB activity, promoting cell survival and drug resistance, making miR-125b a potential target for adjuvant therapy in GBM (Haemmig2014miR125b).

NKIRAS2 also plays a role in inflammation regulation. In bovine mammary epithelial cells, miR-125b downregulates NKIRAS2, leading to increased NF-κB activity and inflammation. This suggests that NKIRAS2 is involved in inflammatory responses and could be a target for managing conditions like mastitis (Luoreng2021MiR125b). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NKIRAS2 in cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
NKIRAS2, a protein involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to modulate cellular processes. It is known to interact with IκB proteins, such as IκBα and IκBβ, preventing their degradation and thereby maintaining NF-κB in an inactive state (Sarais2020Characterisation). This interaction is crucial for controlling NF-κB activity, which is a key factor in immune response regulation (Sarais2020Characterisation).

NKIRAS2 is also targeted by microRNAs, such as miR-BART13 and miR-125b, which influence its expression and activity. miR-BART13, encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus, directly targets NKIRAS2, leading to the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell growth and metastasis (Xu2019EpsteinBarr). Similarly, miR-125b targets NKIRAS2 in glioblastomas, enhancing NF-κB signaling and contributing to drug resistance (Haemmig2014miR125b). In bovine mammary epithelial cells, miR-125b binds to the 3′ UTR of NKIRAS2, inhibiting its expression and affecting the inflammatory response (Luoreng2021MiR125b).

These interactions highlight the role of NKIRAS2 in modulating NF-κB activity through both protein-protein interactions and regulation by microRNAs, impacting various cellular processes and disease states.
