# IL17RA

## Overview
The IL17RA gene encodes the interleukin 17 receptor A, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is a crucial component of the immune system. This receptor is part of the IL-17 receptor family and is primarily involved in mediating responses to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F. The IL17RA protein forms a heterodimeric complex with IL-17RC, facilitating the activation of key signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK, which are essential for the regulation of inflammatory responses (Gaffen2009Structure; Liu2019Structural). Expressed in a variety of cell types, including epithelial and immune cells, IL17RA plays a pivotal role in maintaining mucosal barriers and orchestrating the body's defense against pathogens (Kutwin2021An). Dysregulation of IL17RA has been implicated in several diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (Yan2019IL‐17R; Maher2024Impact).

## Structure
The IL17RA protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. Its extracellular domain (ECD) comprises two fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains connected by a short α-helical linker, which are crucial for binding with IL-17 cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-17F, and the IL-17A/F heterodimer (Ely2009Structural; Liu2019Structural). The ECD is heavily glycosylated, with glycosylation playing a role in its structural stability and function (Ely2009Structural).

The intracellular portion of IL17RA contains the SEFIR domain, which is essential for downstream signaling. This domain is involved in recruiting the adaptor protein Act1, facilitating the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways (Liu2015IL17RA; Zhang2014Structure). The SEFIR domain features a unique α-helical structure that is critical for its interaction with Act1 (Zhang2014Structure).

IL17RA forms heterodimeric receptor complexes with other IL-17 receptor family members, such as IL-17RC, on the cell surface, which is essential for its function in cytokine signaling (Gaffen2009Structure; Liu2019Structural). The receptor's structure and interactions are distinct from other cytokine receptor families, highlighting its unique role in immune response (Zhang2011Structure).

## Function
IL17RA (interleukin 17 receptor A) is a critical component of the IL-17 receptor complex, which plays a significant role in mediating the immune response. It is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein receptor that forms a heterodimer with IL-17RC to bind IL-17A and IL-17F cytokines, facilitating the activation of several signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and NF-κB via TRAF-6 (Li2019IL-17; Shabgah2014Interleukin17). These pathways lead to the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1, which are crucial for immune responses (Shabgah2014Interleukin17).

IL17RA is expressed in various cell types, including epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells, and is essential for maintaining mucosal barriers and promoting inflammation in response to infections (Kutwin2021An). It is involved in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, playing a vital role in the body's defense against fungal and bacterial pathogens (Mills2022IL17; McGeachy2019The). The receptor's interaction with adaptor proteins like Act1 is crucial for the transcriptional and post-transcriptional activation of gene expression, contributing to the organism's ability to respond to cellular stressors and maintain tissue integrity (Li2019IL-17).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL17RA gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the deletion of IL17RA is linked to high-grade tumors and poor clinical outcomes. This deletion is prevalent across different stages of CRC and is associated with reduced expression of A20, a key regulator of inflammatory pathways. The loss of IL17RA expression leads to enhanced tumor cell proliferation and activation of oncogenic pathways, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker in CRC (Yan2019IL‐17R).

In asthma, genetic variations in IL17RA, such as the rs4819554 SNP, have been linked to increased susceptibility, particularly in certain populations. The AA genotype of this SNP is associated with higher IL17RA expression and a greater predisposition to asthma (Maher2024Impact). Other IL17RA variants are implicated in autoimmune diseases like psoriasis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and ankylosing spondylitis. These variants can alter IL17RA expression and activity, influencing inflammatory responses and disease severity (Nititham2018Candidate; Maher2024Impact).

Overall, IL17RA plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, and its dysregulation can contribute to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

## Interactions
IL17RA interacts with several proteins to mediate its signaling functions. It forms a receptor complex with IL-17RC, which is essential for IL-17A and IL-17F signaling. This complex facilitates the recruitment of the adaptor protein Act1, which is crucial for downstream signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK activation (Ely2009Structural; Gu2013IL17). Act1 interacts with IL17RA through a conserved SEFIR domain, and this interaction is mediated by the CC′ loop region of Act1. Mutations in this region can disrupt the interaction and inhibit IL-17 and IL-25 signaling (Liu2011A).

IL17RA also interacts with TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), including TRAF6, which is recruited by Act1 to the receptor complex. This interaction is necessary for the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways (Li2019IL-17; Gu2013IL17). TRAF4 and TRAF3 act as negative regulators by competing with TRAF6 for binding, thereby modulating the signaling output (Gu2013IL17). Additionally, deubiquitinating enzymes such as A20 and USP25 regulate the ubiquitination status of TRAF6, influencing the inflammatory response (Li2019IL-17; Gu2013IL17).
