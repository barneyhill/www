# ERP29

## Overview
ERP29 is a gene that encodes the endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29), a non-classical molecular chaperone primarily located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ERp29 is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, although it lacks the typical redox-active double cysteine motif found in classical PDIs, which precludes it from having a PDI-like redox function (Ying2010Endoplasmic; Sargsyan2002Genomic). Instead, ERp29 is involved in the folding and processing of secretory and transmembrane proteins, playing a crucial role in their biosynthesis and trafficking. It facilitates the transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and is implicated in the unfolded protein response (UPR), particularly during ER stress (Brecker2020The). The protein forms a homodimer, which is essential for its function, and interacts with other ER chaperones to maintain cellular homeostasis (Brecker2020The). Alterations in ERP29 expression have been linked to various diseases, including certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Huang2021ERp29; Carron2020Role).

## Structure
ERp29 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is part of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family. It is composed of two main domains: an N-terminal domain that resembles the thioredoxin-like domain of PDI and a unique C-terminal domain with an all-helical fold (Ying2010Endoplasmic; Sargsyan2002Genomic). The N-terminal domain adopts a typical thioredoxin fold but lacks the characteristic double cysteine motif, which precludes a PDI-like redox function (Sargsyan2002Genomic). 

ERp29 forms a homodimer through interactions at the N-terminal domain, which is essential for its function as a chaperone in the ER (Ying2010Endoplasmic; Brecker2020The). This dimerization contributes to its quaternary structure, forming a tightly bound, non-globular structure (Brecker2020The). The protein contains a single conserved cysteine residue, Cysteine157, which is crucial for its function and is located at the base of the D-domain, essential for client binding and processing (Brecker2020The). The structure of ERp29 is further characterized by increased domain mobility due to a longer linker between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains in humans compared to other species (Brecker2020The).

## Function
ERp29 is a non-classical molecular chaperone located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, where it plays a critical role in the folding and processing of secretory and transmembrane proteins. It is involved in the biosynthesis and trafficking of proteins such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), thyroglobulin, connexin 43 hemichannels, and proinsulin (Brecker2020The). ERp29 facilitates the transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus by promoting their inclusion in COP II vesicles, often interacting with the KDEL receptor (KDEL-R) to regulate this process (Brecker2020The).

ERp29 stabilizes immature proteins, preventing premature oligomerization, and increases the intracellular abundance of certain proteins, such as proinsulin, by promoting its cleavage into insulin and C-peptide (Brecker2020The). It forms complexes with other ER chaperones, such as BiP/GRP78 and GRP94, to assist in protein folding and trafficking, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Brecker2020The). ERp29 is also implicated in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and is upregulated during ER stress, suggesting a role in managing cellular stress conditions (Brecker2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ERP29 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), a single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the ERP29 gene, specifically rs7114, has been associated with an increased risk of cancer. The variant allele G creates a binding site for microRNA-4421, leading to decreased ERP29 expression and increased cancer risk. Individuals with the GG genotype have a significantly higher risk of developing OPSCC compared to those with other genotypes (Carron2020Role).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ERP29 is involved in a feedback loop with miR-135a-5p, influencing tumor progression. ERP29 overexpression in CRC cells inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation and migration, contributing to cancer progression (Huang2021ERp29).

ERP29 also plays a role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), where its overexpression is linked to radioresistance. High levels of ERP29 in NPC cells are associated with increased resistance to radiation therapy, potentially through the upregulation of Hsp27, a protein that protects against apoptosis (Qi2011Inhibiting).

These findings suggest that ERP29 is a significant factor in the development and progression of certain cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ERp29 is involved in various interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are crucial for its function as a chaperone protein. It forms part of the thyroglobulin (Tg) folding complex, associating with other ER chaperones such as BiP, GRP94, calnexin, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and ERp72. These interactions facilitate the maturation of Tg in thyroid epithelial cells (Sargsyan2002Identification). ERp29 binds to denatured Tg and histone affinity resins, indicating a preference for denatured proteins, and co-localizes with Tg in FRTL-5 cells (Sargsyan2002Identification).

ERp29 also interacts with the KDEL receptor (KDEL-R), which is involved in protein trafficking between the ER and the Golgi apparatus. This interaction is crucial for the biogenesis of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), as ERp29 facilitates their transport through COP II vesicles (Brecker2020The). Additionally, ERp29 associates with PERK, a key protein in the unfolded protein response (UPR), suggesting a role in regulating UPR pathways during ER stress (Brecker2020The). These interactions highlight ERp29's role in protein folding, trafficking, and stress response within the ER.
