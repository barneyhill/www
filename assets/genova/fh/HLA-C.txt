# HLA-C

## Overview
HLA-C is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I family, specifically the class I, C molecule. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by presenting peptide antigens derived from intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and interacting with natural killer (NK) cells. The HLA-C protein is a transmembrane molecule characterized by a heavy chain that associates with β2-microglobulin, forming a complex essential for its stability and function (Snary1977Molecular). The polymorphic nature of HLA-C allows for a diverse range of immune responses, influencing susceptibility to various diseases, including viral infections and autoimmune disorders (Vollmers2021The). HLA-C is also involved in immune regulation through its interactions with killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on NK cells, which can modulate immune responses by either activating or inhibiting NK cell activity (Hilton2017Missing). The expression levels and allelic variations of HLA-C have significant clinical implications, affecting disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes (Apps2013Influence; Velastegui2023“HLAC:).

## Structure
The HLA-C protein, encoded by the HLA-C gene, is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule involved in presenting peptide antigens to T cells. The primary structure of HLA-C consists of a heavy chain that is non-covalently associated with β2-microglobulin, a light chain (Snary1977Molecular). The heavy chain is glycosylated, contributing to its molecular weight and structural heterogeneity (Snary1977Molecular).

The secondary structure of HLA-C includes α-helices and β-sheets, which form the peptide-binding groove typical of MHC class I molecules (Mobbs2017The). The tertiary structure of HLA-C features a deep peptide-binding groove, with specific pockets that accommodate anchor residues of bound peptides. For instance, the B and E pockets of HLA-C*06:02 are electronegative, favoring the binding of peptides with arginine residues at specific positions (Mobbs2017The).

In terms of quaternary structure, HLA-C is associated with β2-microglobulin, which is essential for its stability and function (Snary1977Molecular). The glycosylation of the HLA-C heavy chain is a common post-translational modification, affecting its behavior in biochemical assays (Snary1977Molecular). The structural plasticity of HLA-C allows it to accommodate various peptides, which is crucial for its role in immune surveillance (Mobbs2017The).

## Function
The HLA-C gene encodes a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that plays a crucial role in the immune system by presenting intracellular peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. This presentation is essential for distinguishing between 'self' and 'non-self' or altered-self, thereby facilitating immune surveillance and response to infections (Vollmers2021The).

HLA-C molecules serve as ligands for killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on NK cells, which can be either activating or inhibitory. This interaction is vital for the functional maturation and education of NK cells, enabling them to recognize and respond to infected or transformed cells while maintaining tolerance to healthy cells (Vollmers2021The; Falk1997HLAC). The polymorphic nature of HLA-C and its interaction with KIRs allows for a diverse range of immune responses, influencing susceptibility to various diseases, including viral infections (Vollmers2021The).

HLA-C is expressed at lower levels on the cell surface compared to other class I molecules like HLA-A and HLA-B, due to distinct regulatory elements that affect its transcription and translation (Vollmers2021The). Despite this, HLA-C plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly in the context of NK cell function and the immune response to viral infections (Falk1997HLAC).

## Clinical Significance
The HLA-C gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its interactions. Mutations in HLA-C are associated with autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, where the C*06:02 allele is linked to psoriasis vulgaris, while alleles like C*05, C*07, and C*15 may offer protection (Velastegui2023“HLAC:). Psoriatic arthritis is associated with C*12, C*02, and C*06 alleles (Velastegui2023“HLAC:). In Graves' disease, C*03 and C*16 alleles are protective, whereas C*07 increases susceptibility (Velastegui2023“HLAC:). 

Alterations in HLA-C expression levels are linked to various conditions. High expression levels are associated with better control of HIV due to enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, but they also increase the risk of Crohn's disease (Apps2013Influence; Dendrou2018HLA). Low expression levels are linked to diseases like cystic fibrosis and acute allograft rejection (Johansson2022HLA). 

HLA-C interactions with natural killer (NK) cells and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are crucial in immune regulation. These interactions can influence the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases and affect responses to therapies (Siegel2019HLA‐C:).

## Interactions
HLA-C is a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein that interacts with killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on natural killer (NK) cells, playing a crucial role in immune regulation. These interactions are highly polymorphic and involve both inhibitory and activating KIRs, which bind to the upper face of the HLA-C molecule over the C-terminal end of the bound peptide (Hilton2017Missing). The recognition of HLA-C by KIRs is determined by specific polymorphisms within the α1 helix of the HLA molecule, defining major epitopes such as C1 and C2 (Hilton2017Missing).

KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 are inhibitory receptors that recognize the C1 epitope of HLA-C, with KIR2DL2 generally exhibiting stronger binding than KIR2DL3 (Moesta2008Synergistic). These interactions are influenced by the structural plasticity of KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3, which allows for different docking geometries atop HLA-C, affecting the recognition of various HLA-C allotypes (Moradi2021Structural). The binding of KIR2DL2 to HLA-C*07:02 involves specific contacts, such as the KIR D1 domain over the HLA α1-helix, bound via three KIR2DL2 loops (Moradi2021Structural).

The interactions between HLA-C and KIRs are significant for immune responses, as they can modulate NK cell activation or inhibition, influencing susceptibility to diseases and reproductive success (Hilton2017Missing).
