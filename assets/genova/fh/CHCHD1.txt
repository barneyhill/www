# CHCHD1

## Overview
The CHCHD1 gene encodes the protein coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 1, which is a mitochondrial-specific ribosomal protein, also known as MRPS37. This protein is integral to the mitochondrial ribosome's small subunit and plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, which is essential for mitochondrial function and energy production (Koc2013Identification). CHCHD1 is crucial for the synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins, such as those involved in the electron transport chain, while not affecting nuclear-encoded proteins (Koc2013Identification). Its function is vital for maintaining the efficiency of mitochondrial translation and biogenesis, highlighting its significance in cellular energy metabolism (Koc2013Identification).

## Function
CHCHD1 is a protein primarily associated with the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is involved in the mitochondrial translational machinery, contributing to the synthesis of proteins necessary for mitochondrial function and energy production (Koc2013Identification). Knock-down experiments in HEK293 cells have shown that reducing CHCHD1 levels leads to a significant decrease in mitochondrial protein synthesis, specifically affecting the steady state levels of mitochondrially encoded proteins like the subunit of Complex IV, COII, while nuclear-encoded subunits remain unchanged (Koc2013Identification). This indicates that CHCHD1 is essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis, likely as a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, but not for ribosome assembly or RNA processing (Koc2013Identification).

CHCHD1 is also identified as a mitochondrial-specific ribosomal protein, designated as MRPS37, and is thought to be involved in mitochondrial translation and biogenesis (Koc2013Identification). The protein's localization and function within the mitochondrial ribosome underscore its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy production.
