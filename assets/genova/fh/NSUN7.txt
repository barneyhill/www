# NSUN7

## Overview
The NSUN7 gene encodes the NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member 7, a protein that plays a critical role in RNA methylation processes. As a member of the NOP2/Sun domain family, NSUN7 is categorized as a 5-methylcytosine RNA methyltransferase, which is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA molecules. This modification is essential for RNA stability, processing, and translation, particularly in the context of mitochondrial rRNA processing in spermatozoa, which is crucial for sperm motility and male fertility (Harris2007Sperm; Khosronezhad2015T26248Gtransversion). Mutations in the NSUN7 gene can lead to structural and functional alterations in the protein, impacting its role in reproductive biology and contributing to conditions such as asthenospermia (Khosronezhad2015T26248Gtransversion). Additionally, NSUN7 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its epigenetic inactivation is associated with altered RNA stability and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic).

## Structure
The NSUN7 protein is a member of the NOP2/Sun domain family of putative RNA methyltransferases, involved in RNA methylation processes. It contains a Sun domain, which is homologous to domains found in tRNA and rRNA cytosine-C5-methylases, and includes a smaller eukaryotic nucleolar NOL1/NOP2/Sun subfamily motif (Harris2007Sperm). The NSUN7 protein is predicted to be 718 amino acids long and is involved in mitochondrial rRNA processing in post-meiotic spermatozoa (Khosronezhad2015T26248Gtransversion). 

Mutations in the NSUN7 gene can significantly alter the protein's structure and function. For instance, the T26248G transversion mutation in exon 7 results in a serine to alanine substitution, affecting the protein's secondary structure, including changes in the helix, strand, and coil configurations (Khosronezhad2015T26248Gtransversion). This mutation also increases the protein's hydrophobicity and alters its molecular weight and isoelectric point, impacting protein folding and stability (Khosronezhad2015T26248Gtransversion). 

The NSUN7 protein's structure is crucial for its function, particularly in sperm motility, and mutations can lead to defects in this process, contributing to infertility (Khosronezhad2015T26248Gtransversion).

## Function
The NSUN7 gene encodes a 5-methylcytosine RNA methyltransferase, which is part of the NOP2/Sun domain family. This enzyme is involved in the methylation of RNA molecules, specifically catalyzing the addition of methyl groups to cytosine residues in RNA. This post-transcriptional modification is crucial for RNA stability, processing, translation, and export (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic). In healthy human cells, NSUN7 plays a significant role in mitochondrial rRNA processing, which is essential for the translation of mRNA and proteins necessary for sperm motility. The protein's activity is linked to the motility of the sperm flagellum, a key factor in male fertility (Khosronezhad2015The).

NSUN7 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression and protein synthesis. Its function is critical for maintaining RNA stability and ensuring proper protein folding and function, which are vital for cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and spermatogenesis (Khosronezhad2015The). The NSUN7 protein's methyltransferase activity is essential for the proper function of sperm flagella, highlighting its importance in reproductive biology (Harris2007Sperm).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NSUN7 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly affecting male fertility and cancer progression. In the context of male infertility, mutations in the NSUN7 gene, such as the T26248G transversion in exon 7, have been associated with reduced sperm motility, a condition known as asthenospermia. This mutation results in a serine to alanine substitution, altering the protein's structure and its interaction with ligands, which impairs sperm motility and contributes to infertility (Khosronezhad2015T26248Gtransversion). Another mutation, the A11337-deletion in exon 4, leads to a premature stop codon, resulting in an abortive protein product that further impairs sperm motility (Khosronezhad2015The).

In cancer, particularly liver cancer, NSUN7 undergoes epigenetic inactivation through promoter CpG island hypermethylation, leading to transcriptional silencing. This inactivation is associated with poor clinical outcomes and increased sensitivity to certain therapeutic agents, such as bromodomain inhibitors. The loss of NSUN7 affects RNA stability and processing, contributing to cancer progression and offering potential therapeutic targets (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic).

## Interactions
NSUN7, a member of the NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In liver cancer, NSUN7 interacts with the coiled-coil domain containing 9B (CCDC9B) protein, which is part of several protein and RNA remodeling complexes. This interaction is significant as it stabilizes CCDC9B mRNA, facilitating its interaction with the Influenza Virus NS1A Binding Protein (IVNS1ABP), a MYC regulator. This interaction affects MYC expression, with NSUN7 deletion leading to MYC overexpression and its restoration reducing MYC levels (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic).

The epigenetic inactivation of NSUN7 in liver cancer is associated with decreased stability and expression of CCDC9B mRNA and higher levels of MYC mRNA and protein. This inactivation sensitizes liver cancer cells to bromodomain inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic vulnerability mediated through the CCDC9B-IVNS1ABP-MYC axis (OrtizBarahona2023Epigenetic). NSUN7's role in these interactions highlights its importance in RNA stability and its potential impact on cancer progression and treatment response.
