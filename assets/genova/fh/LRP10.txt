# LRP10

## Overview
The LRP10 gene encodes the LDL receptor related protein 10, a single-pass transmembrane protein that is part of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in intracellular vesicle trafficking and is predominantly expressed in non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes and cells of the neurovasculature in the adult human brain (Grochowska2021LRP10). LRP10 plays a crucial role in the trafficking and processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), acting as a sorting receptor that influences APP's intracellular distribution and reduces amyloidogenic processing, which is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Brodeur2012LDLRrelated). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as SORL1 and α-synuclein, further underscore its potential involvement in neurodegenerative disease processes (Grochowska2021LRP10; Mascaro2023Interactome). Mutations in the LRP10 gene have been associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, highlighting its clinical significance (Carreras2024LRP10; Vergouw2019LRP10).

## Structure
The LRP10 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein and a distant relative of the LDL-receptor family. It has a predicted molecular weight of 76 kDa, but Western blotting often detects it at approximately 100 kDa, likely due to posttranslational modifications such as N-glycosylation and phosphorylation (Grochowska2021LRP10). The protein structure includes an extracellular/luminal domain (amino acids 1-440) and an intracellular/cytosolic domain (amino acids 463-713). These domains feature a complement C1R/C1S, urchin EGF, BMP1 domain, a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain, a transmembrane domain, an arginine-rich domain, a proline-rich domain, and a YXXΦ motif (Grochowska2021LRP10).

LRP10 is part of a subfamily of orphan LRPs with relatively small extracellular regions containing LDL ligand-binding domains (LBDs) and C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1 (CUB) domains (Russell2023Lrp10). The presence of shorter LRP10 isoforms or posttranslational processing is suggested by additional signals detected in the range of 35-50 kDa, which are absent in LRP10 knockout clones (Grochowska2021LRP10). These isoforms possibly lack the epitope detected by the LRP10-NT antibody (Grochowska2021LRP10). Further studies are needed to understand whether LRP10 undergoes proteolytic cleavage and the physiological functions of its processed fragments (Grochowska2021LRP10).

## Function
LRP10 (LDL receptor related protein 10) is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and is primarily expressed in non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes and cells of the neurovasculature in the adult human brain (Grochowska2021LRP10). It localizes to various subcellular compartments, including the trans-Golgi network, early endosomes, retromer, and lysosomes, indicating its role in intracellular trafficking pathways (Grochowska2021LRP10). LRP10 interacts with the sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1), suggesting a role in vesicle trafficking pathways (Grochowska2021LRP10).

In healthy human cells, LRP10 is involved in the trafficking and processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). It acts as a sorting receptor that regulates APP's intracellular distribution, primarily retaining it in the trans-Golgi network and reducing its presence at the cell surface (Brodeur2012LDLRrelated). This retention decreases the amyloidogenic processing of APP, which is significant for reducing amyloid-beta production, a process implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Brodeur2012LDLRrelated). LRP10's function in APP trafficking is similar to that of other LDL receptor family members, such as SorLA, which also helps in reducing amyloidogenic processing (Brodeur2012LDLRrelated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRP10 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Studies have identified specific LRP10 variants, such as p.Arg151Cys, p.Arg263His, and p.Tyr307Asn, which are considered possibly pathogenic and have been found in patients with these conditions but not in unaffected controls (Vergouw2019LRP10). The p.Tyr307Asn variant, in particular, has been associated with a common founder in genealogically linked patients, suggesting a hereditary component (Vergouw2019LRP10).

LRP10 is also involved in the modulation of α-synuclein, a protein central to the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. Variants in LRP10 can affect α-synuclein levels and distribution, potentially contributing to disease progression (Carreras2024LRP10). The c.1424 + 5G > A variant has been noted for its impact on LRP10's function and its dominant negative effect on α-synuclein modulation (Carreras2024LRP10).

In addition to PD and DLB, LRP10 mutations have been linked to other neurodegenerative conditions such as progressive supranuclear palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, indicating a broader role in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis (Grochowska2021LRP10).

## Interactions
LRP10 is involved in various protein interactions that are significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. It interacts with the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62, suggesting a role in modulating autophagic function. This interaction is particularly evident in LRP10-overexpressing cells, where LRP10 levels and secretion are dependent on autophagic function (Mascaro2023Interactome). LRP10 also interacts with NDFIP1, a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and α-synuclein degradation. This interaction has been validated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating LRP10's involvement in α-synuclein secretion and the secretory pathway (Mascaro2023Interactome).

LRP10 forms a protein complex with SORL1, another member of the LDL-receptor family, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. This interaction suggests that LRP10 may function as a sorting receptor involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking pathways (Grochowska2021LRP10). Additionally, LRP10 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), primarily through its ectodomain, affecting APP's intracellular distribution and processing. This interaction is relevant to Alzheimer's disease, as LRP10 regulates APP trafficking and processing (Brodeur2012LDLRrelated). These interactions highlight LRP10's potential role in neurodegenerative disease processes through its involvement in protein trafficking and degradation pathways.
