# WFDC13

## Overview
The WFDC13 gene encodes the WAP four-disulfide core domain 13 protein, which is a member of the whey acidic protein (WAP) family. This family is characterized by the presence of a WAP domain, known for its role in protease inhibition and structural stability due to its conserved cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds (Small2016The; Wen2024Versatile). Located on chromosome 20 in humans, WFDC13 is part of a gene cluster associated with various biological processes, including immune response and cancer pathogenesis (Wen2024Versatile). The protein's expression is influenced by cytokines and is notably altered in certain cancers, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis (Wen2024Versatile; Xu2020An). Despite its recognized involvement in cancer, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of WFDC13 remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further research into its role in health and disease.

## Structure
The WFDC13 gene encodes a protein that is part of the whey acidic protein (WAP) four-disulfide core domain family, characterized by the presence of a WAP domain. This domain typically consists of approximately 40-50 amino acids and includes eight conserved cysteine residues that form four disulfide bonds, contributing to a stable and compact structure (Small2016The; Wen2024Versatile). The WAP domain is known for its role in protease inhibition, which is a common function among proteins in this family (Small2016The).

In humans, the WFDC13 gene is located on chromosome 20 within a cluster of WFDC genes, specifically in the telomeric sublocus (Wen2024Versatile). The molecular structure of the WFDC13 protein in humans includes a complete WAP domain, unlike its mouse counterpart, which is truncated and lacks the last two exons present in the human gene (Clauss2005The). The human WFDC13 protein may also be subject to post-translational modifications typical of secreted proteins, although specific modifications for WFDC13 are not detailed in the available literature. The protein's expression is modulated by cytokines and can be aberrantly expressed in tumor cells, indicating potential roles in disease pathogenesis (Wen2024Versatile).

## Clinical Significance
WFDC13 has been implicated in various cancers, although its specific role and clinical significance remain under investigation. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), WFDC13 is identified as part of a group of differentially expressed mRNAs that could potentially predict patient prognosis. However, the precise biological function of WFDC13 in tumor progression, including ccRCC, is not well-defined, necessitating further research to elucidate its role in cancer (Xu2020An).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), WFDC13 is part of a prognostic risk model that combines differentially methylated and expressed genes. This model, which includes WFDC13, S100P, and LY6D, has demonstrated robustness in predicting patient outcomes, with high-risk scores correlating with significantly worse overall survival. The study highlights the potential of WFDC13 as a prognostic marker and suggests its clinical significance in PAAD prognosis (Cao2023Bioinformaticsbased).

Additionally, WFDC13 is involved in a fusion gene, ZBTB46-WFDC13, identified in ovarian cancer. Such fusions can alter gene expression and impact the cancer transcriptome, although the specific effects of the ZBTB46-WFDC13 fusion in ovarian cancer are not detailed (Lu2021Fusion).
