# UCKL1

## Overview
UCKL1 (uridine-cytidine kinase 1 like 1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme uridine-cytidine kinase 1 like 1, which is a key player in nucleotide metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a kinase due to its role in the phosphorylation of nucleosides, specifically uridine and cytidine, within the pyrimidine salvage pathway. The activity of UCKL1 is crucial for maintaining the nucleotide pool necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis, thereby supporting essential cellular processes such as replication and transcription (Ambrose2009Downregulation). UCKL1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression is often upregulated, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis (Kovalevska2023Differential; Kovalevska2023DIFFERENTIAL). Additionally, UCKL1 interacts with the Natural Killer Lytic-Associated Molecule (NKLAM), influencing tumor cell survival and immune evasion (Lawrence2020Natural).

## Function
UCKL1 (uridine-cytidine kinase 1 like 1) is involved in the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine, which are essential components of nucleotide metabolism. This enzyme plays a critical role in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, contributing to the synthesis of RNA and DNA by converting uridine to uridine monophosphate (UMP) (Ambrose2009Downregulation). UCKL1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain nucleotide balance within cells, ensuring the availability of nucleotides for various cellular processes (Ambrose2009Downregulation).

While the specific function of UCKL1 in healthy human cells is not directly addressed in the study, its role in nucleotide metabolism suggests it is crucial for normal cellular function and proliferation. The enzyme's activity in the pyrimidine salvage pathway indicates its importance in maintaining the nucleotide pool necessary for DNA replication and repair, as well as RNA transcription. This function is vital for cell division and the overall maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The study primarily focuses on the role of UCKL1 in cancer cell lines, highlighting its potential involvement in tumorigenesis and its upregulation in tumor cells, but does not provide detailed insights into its function in non-cancerous cells (Ambrose2009Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
UCKL1 (uridine-cytidine kinase 1 like 1) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In prostate cancer, UCKL1 is significantly overexpressed at the mRNA level in the blood sera of patients compared to healthy donors. This overexpression is particularly pronounced in patients with a Gleason score greater than 9, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression and its utility as a prognostic biomarker (Kovalevska2023DIFFERENTIAL). Despite the marked increase in expression, no significant differences were observed between different Gleason score groups, indicating that while UCKL1 is overexpressed, its expression does not vary significantly with tumor grade (Kovalevska2023DIFFERENTIAL).

In breast cancer, UCKL1 is also overexpressed, with the highest levels observed in luminal A and HER2 subtypes. This overexpression may contribute to the development of resistance to chemotherapy, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for refining breast cancer molecular subtypes and guiding therapeutic approaches (Kovalevska2023Differential). The gene's elevated levels and enhanced activity in various cancers, including colon tumors and hepatocellular carcinomas, further underscore its role in tumorigenesis and its potential impact on disease progression (Kovalevska2023Differential).

## Interactions
UCKL1 (uridine-cytidine kinase 1 like 1) is known to interact with the Natural Killer Lytic-Associated Molecule (NKLAM), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of UCKL1. NKLAM, found in the cytolytic granules of natural killer (NK) cells, targets UCKL1 for degradation, impacting tumor cell survival by reducing cell proliferation and increasing susceptibility to apoptosis (Ambrose2009Downregulation; Lawrence2020Natural). The interaction between UCKL1 and NKLAM has been confirmed through co-transfection studies in HEK293 cells, demonstrating that NKLAM's RING domain is crucial for binding UCKL1 and facilitating its ubiquitination (Lawrence2020Natural).

UCKL1 is also involved in the pyrimidine salvage pathway and is often upregulated in cancer cells, making it a potential biomarker for various cancer types. The downregulation of UCKL1 in tumor cells has been shown to slow proliferation, induce apoptosis, and enhance susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis, while overexpression of UCKL1 can protect tumor cells from NK cell killing (Lawrence2020Natural). These interactions suggest that UCKL1 plays a significant role in tumor cell survival and immune evasion.
