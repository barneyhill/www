# MKRN2

## Overview
MKRN2 is a gene that encodes the makorin ring finger protein 2, which is a member of the RING zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation of various cellular processes. The MKRN2 protein is characterized by its distinctive zinc finger domains, including a C3HC4 RING zinc finger, which are essential for its function in inhibiting neurogenesis and regulating signaling pathways such as the PI3K/Akt pathway (Cheung2010Identification; Yang2008Makorin2). MKRN2 is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses by targeting the p65 subunit of NF-κB for degradation, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis (Shin2017MKRN2). Additionally, it plays a significant role in male fertility, particularly in testis development and spermatogenesis (Qian2016Deficiency). The protein's interactions with other cellular components also suggest its involvement in cancer biology and viral mRNA export, highlighting its multifaceted roles in cellular homeostasis and disease (Bonazza2024Identifying; Jia2020Ubiquitination).

## Structure
The MKRN2 protein is a member of the makorin RING zinc finger gene family, characterized by its distinctive array of zinc finger domains. It contains four C3H zinc fingers and a signature C3HC4 RING zinc finger domain. The protein structure is organized with three consecutive C3H zinc fingers in the N-terminal region, followed by a Cys-His motif and the C3HC4 RING zinc finger, with the fourth C3H zinc finger located at the C-terminal end (Cheung2010Identification). The MKRN2 protein in Xenopus shares 63% sequence identity with the human MKRN2, indicating a high level of conservation across species (Cheung2010Identification).

The third C3H zinc finger, Cys-His motif, and C3HC4 RING zinc finger are essential for the protein's function in inhibiting neurogenesis, as demonstrated by truncation mutants that retain these domains and still exhibit anti-neurogenic activity (Cheung2010Identification). The fourth C3H zinc finger is not required for this function, as mutants lacking this domain still display neurogenesis inhibition (Cheung2010Identification). The MKRN2 protein is involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, acting downstream of PI3K and Akt and upstream of GSK-3β (Yang2008Makorin2).

## Function
MKRN2 (makorin ring finger protein 2) functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of inflammatory responses and spermatogenesis. MKRN2 targets the p65 subunit of NF-κB, a transcription factor involved in inflammatory responses, for polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. This action suppresses p65-mediated NF-κB transactivation, thereby negatively regulating inflammatory responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Shin2017MKRN2).

In the context of male fertility, MKRN2 is highly expressed in the testis, particularly in Sertoli cells and spermatids, indicating its importance in testis development and spermatogenesis. It is crucial for the proper functioning of the ectoplasmic specialization in the testes, which is vital for spermiogenesis and spermiation. The absence of MKRN2 leads to sterility, characterized by low sperm count and poor motility, similar to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia in humans (Qian2016Deficiency).

MKRN2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular homeostasis by regulating protein degradation and transcriptional activities (Shin2017MKRN2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MKRN2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MKRN2 is expressed at low levels, which correlates with poor prognosis. High MKRN2 levels are associated with higher survival rates in NSCLC patients, as MKRN2 inhibits the migration and invasion of cancer cells by negatively regulating the PI3K/Akt pathway (Jiang2018MKRN2).

MKRN2 also plays a significant role in male fertility. Studies using MKRN2 knockout mice have shown that the absence of this gene leads to male infertility, characterized by abnormal sperm morphology, reduced motility, and lower sperm count. This condition is similar to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) in humans. The knockout mice exhibited impaired spermiogenesis and spermiation, with decreased expression of proteins crucial for sperm development, such as Odf2 (Qian2016Deficiency).

Additionally, MKRN2 acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase targeting the p65 subunit of NF-κB, a transcription factor involved in inflammatory responses. Alterations in MKRN2 expression can lead to dysregulated inflammatory responses, potentially impacting conditions characterized by excessive inflammation (Shin2017MKRN2).

## Interactions
MKRN2 is involved in several protein-protein interactions and plays a role in various cellular processes. It functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, targeting the p65 subunit of NF-κB for polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. This interaction is crucial for negatively regulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses, and MKRN2 works synergistically with another ubiquitin E3 ligase, PDLIM2, to enhance p65 polyubiquitination (Shin2017MKRN2).

MKRN2 also interacts with IGF2BP3, an RNA-binding protein, in human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells. This interaction regulates the proliferation and migration of these cells, suggesting a role for MKRN2 in cancer biology (Jia2020Ubiquitination).

In the context of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, MKRN2 acts as an RNA-binding protein that associates with viral mRNAs, facilitating their nuclear export. It interacts with several proteins involved in RNA transport, such as GLE1, and components of the exon junction complex, including MAGOH and SAP18. These interactions suggest that MKRN2 may serve as an mRNA export adapter protein, recruiting export machinery to ensure efficient viral mRNA export (Bonazza2024Identifying).
