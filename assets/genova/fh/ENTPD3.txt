# ENTPD3

## Overview
ENTPD3 is a gene that encodes the protein ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 3, an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides, such as ATP and ADP, into AMP. This protein is categorized as an ectonucleotidase and plays a pivotal role in purinergic signaling, which is essential for numerous physiological processes, including neurotransmission, inflammation, and thromboregulation. ENTPD3 is predominantly expressed on the cell surface in the nervous system and immune cells, where it modulates extracellular ATP levels and influences various homeostatic systems. The gene's expression and regulation have been linked to several diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, colorectal cancer, and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Luo2024Exploring; Yegutkin2008Nucleotide-; Ansoleaga2015Deregulation).

## Function
ENTPD3, also known as ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 3, is an enzyme that plays a significant role in purinergic signaling by hydrolyzing extracellular nucleotides such as ATP and ADP into AMP. This enzymatic activity is crucial for regulating the availability and activity of purines, which are important for various physiological processes. ENTPD3 is primarily active on the cell surface, particularly in the nervous system and immune cells, where it modulates neurotransmission, inflammation, and thromboregulation (Yegutkin2008Nucleotide-).

In the brain, ENTPD3 is associated with axon-like neuronal structures and acts as a pre-synaptic regulator of extracellular ATP levels. It coordinates multiple homeostatic systems, including feeding and sleep-wake behaviors, by modulating purinergic signaling pathways (Yegutkin2008Nucleotide-). In the murine urinary bladder, ENTPD3 is expressed in the urothelium and is the major soluble ectonucleotidase released into the bladder lumen during bladder filling. It shows a substrate preference for ATP over ADP, contributing to the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and regulating purine availability in the lamina propria (Aresta2023Spatial). This regulation is essential for maintaining the balance of purine signaling in various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ENTPD3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC), ENTPD3 is significantly downregulated, which is associated with malignant progression and poor prognosis. Lower ENTPD3 expression correlates with shorter survival in CRC patients and higher glycosylated hemoglobin levels in T2DM patients, indicating poor glycemic control. This downregulation is also observed in colorectal adenomas, with further decreases as adenomas progress to adenocarcinomas, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Luo2024Exploring).

ENTPD3 expression is linked to immune cell infiltration in CRC, with positive correlations to natural killer cells and dendritic cells, and negative correlations to neutrophils and gamma delta T cells. This suggests that ENTPD3 may influence immune responses in these diseases (Luo2024Exploring). In Alzheimer's disease, ENTPD3 shows significant downregulation in the entorhinal cortex during later stages, indicating a potential association with disease progression (Ansoleaga2015Deregulation).

In gastric cancer, ENTPD3 is identified as a characteristic gene with high diagnostic efficiency, suggesting its potential role in influencing immune invasion and as a therapeutic target (Jiang2023Study). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ENTPD3 in various diseases.
