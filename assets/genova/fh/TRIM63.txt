# TRIM63

## Overview
TRIM63, also known as the gene encoding the protein tripartite motif containing 63 or MuRF1, is a critical component of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, which is characterized by a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. The protein encoded by TRIM63 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it plays a pivotal role in muscle protein turnover and homeostasis. MuRF1 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, targeting myofibrillar proteins for degradation, which is essential for muscle adaptation during catabolic states and stress responses (Meroni2022Cellular; PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63). The protein's interactions with sarcomeric proteins and its regulatory role in cardiac hypertrophy and skeletal muscle atrophy underscore its significance in muscle physiology and pathology (Khan2013Role; PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63). Mutations in TRIM63 have been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy, highlighting its clinical relevance (Andreeva2022Case; SalazarMendiguchía2020Mutations).

## Structure
TRIM63, also known as MuRF1, is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins, characterized by a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. The protein structure includes a RING-B-box-coiled-coil (RBCC) motif at the N-terminal, which is conserved across evolution. The RING domain, although not crystallized, is believed to have a conserved docking region for E2-ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, providing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63).

The B-box type 2 (Bb2) domain contains three loops and coordinates two zinc ions in a cross-brace structure, stabilized by self-assembly events and zinc binding. The coiled-coil domain is subdivided into three portions (HD1, HD2, and HD3), with the C-terminal of HD1 forming a tetrameric palindromic structure (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63). The C-terminal region of TRIM63 includes a COS-box and an acidic tail motif (AT), which is predicted to be unstructured (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63).

TRIM63 has a MuRF family-specific motif (MFC), a 35-residue motif involved in interactions with substrates like troponin I, c-Jun, and titin (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63). The protein also forms homodimers and interacts with other TRIM proteins such as TRIM54 and TRIM55 (Hatakeyama2017TRIM).

## Function
TRIM63, also known as MuRF1, is a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the regulation of muscle mass and protein turnover. It is primarily active in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it targets myofibrillar proteins such as myosin heavy chain for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63). This activity is crucial for maintaining muscle homeostasis, particularly during catabolic states that lead to muscle atrophy (Meroni2022Cellular).

In cardiac muscle, TRIM63 is involved in regulating cardiac hypertrophy by modulating the activity of proteins like Calcineurin A and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) pathway, which are associated with cardiac stress responses (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63). It also interacts with titin, a structural protein, to maintain the integrity of the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle contraction (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63).

In skeletal muscle, TRIM63 is essential for the autophagic turnover of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, particularly during muscle atrophy, by interacting with autophagic markers and facilitating their degradation (Khan2013Role). This function underscores its role in muscle protein stability and energy metabolism (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIM63 gene, which encodes the muscle-specific RING-finger protein 1 (MuRF1), are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common inherited cardiac disorder. These mutations can lead to an autosomal-recessive form of HCM characterized by concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and a high rate of left ventricular dysfunction (SalazarMendiguchía2020Mutations). TRIM63 mutations are rare and typically manifest in individuals with homozygous or compound heterozygous variants, while heterozygous carriers are generally healthy (SalazarMendiguchía2020Mutations). The Q247X variant is a recurrent mutation found in several probands with HCM (Hespe2024ClinGen).

TRIM63 mutations can also contribute to skeletal myopathy, particularly when combined with mutations in other MuRF genes, such as MuRF3 (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63). In some cases, individuals with TRIM63 mutations exhibit both cardiac and skeletal muscle abnormalities, suggesting a broader impact on muscle physiology (Andreeva2022Case). The gene's role in muscle atrophy and cardiac hypertrophy protection is significant, as it regulates the degradation of sarcomeric proteins, including myosin heavy chains, through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63).

## Interactions
TRIM63, also known as MuRF1, is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in muscle protein turnover and autophagy. It interacts with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRN) in skeletal muscle, facilitating their degradation through selective autophagy. This process involves interactions with SQSTM1, a selective autophagy receptor, and SH3GLB1, an autophagy-related protein, suggesting that TRIM63 acts as a linker between CHRN and the autophagic machinery (Khan2013Role).

TRIM63 also interacts with several sarcomeric proteins, including myosin heavy chain (MHC), myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C), and troponin I, affecting their ubiquitination and stability. These interactions are significant in the context of muscle atrophy, where TRIM63 coordinates the degradation of these proteins (PerisMoreno2020MuRF1TRIM63).

In cardiac muscle, TRIM63 interacts with titin, particularly the COOH-terminal Ig domains A168-170, which is crucial for maintaining the stability of the M-line region and thick filaments. This interaction is essential for sarcomeric organization during myofibrillogenesis and turnover (McElhinny2002Musclespecific).

TRIM63's interactions extend to nuclear functions, where it interacts with GMEB1, a nuclear transcriptional regulator, suggesting a role in modulating transcription in response to glucocorticoid levels (McElhinny2002Musclespecific).
