# SYT16

## Overview
SYT16 is a gene that encodes the protein synaptotagmin 16, which is a member of the synaptotagmin family of proteins. Synaptotagmin 16 is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion processes (Chen2020SYT16). The SYT16 gene is expressed in various tissues, with significant implications for neurological function and development. Research has highlighted its involvement in several neurological disorders, including autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia-11 (SCAR11) and its potential role in psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (Kim2019Heritability; Chen2020SYT16). Additionally, synaptotagmin 16 has been studied in the context of cancer, particularly in lower-grade glioma, where its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis and tumor progression (Chen2020SYT16).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SYT16 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders. Specifically, mutations in SYT16 are linked to autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia-11 (SCAR11), a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement and coordination (Chen2020SYT16). Additionally, SYT16 is implicated in neurological development abnormalities due to a chromosomal translocation at (1;3) (Chen2020SYT16).

In the context of cancer, SYT16 expression levels have been studied in relation to lower-grade glioma (LGG), a type of brain tumor. Increased expression of SYT16 is associated with a better prognosis in LGG patients and is negatively correlated with the infiltration levels of various immune cells, suggesting a potential role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Chen2020SYT16). The expression of SYT16 decreases with increasing tumor grade, indicating its potential involvement in tumor progression (Chen2020SYT16).

Furthermore, a genetic variant located between the SYT16 and KCNH5 genes, rs35543418, has been associated with psychological distress symptoms, including an increased risk of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (Kim2019Heritability). These findings suggest that SYT16 may play a role in both neurological and psychiatric conditions.
