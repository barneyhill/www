# LOX

## Overview
The LOX gene encodes the lysyl oxidase protein, a copper-dependent amine oxidase that plays a pivotal role in the formation and stabilization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by catalyzing the cross-linking of collagen and elastin. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical properties of tissues, such as elasticity and tensile strength (Barker2012The; Wang2021An). The lysyl oxidase protein is characterized by a highly conserved C-terminal catalytic domain, which includes a copper-binding motif and the lysyl tyrosine quinone (LTQ) cofactor, essential for its function (Yang2020Lysyl). LOX is secreted as an inactive pro-enzyme and activated through proteolytic processing, allowing it to participate in tissue remodeling and cellular processes (Barker2012The). Mutations in the LOX gene are linked to various cardiovascular diseases, including thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, and alterations in its expression are implicated in connective tissue disorders, fibrotic diseases, and cancer (Lee2016Loss; Payne2007Paradoxical).

## Structure
The lysyl oxidase (LOX) protein is characterized by a highly conserved C-terminal region that includes a catalytic domain essential for its enzymatic function. This domain contains a copper-binding motif, the lysyl tyrosine quinone (LTQ) cofactor, and a cytokine receptor-like domain, which are crucial for the oxidative deamination of lysine and hydroxylysine residues (Yang2020Lysyl). The N-terminal region of LOX includes a propeptide, which is cleaved to activate the enzyme. This propeptide is intrinsically disordered, with over 80% of its residues predicted to be disordered, although it contains some structured regions at the termini (Vallet2018Insights).

LOX undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which affects its molecular weight and structure. The propeptide is glycosylated, contributing to its higher apparent molecular weight compared to its theoretical mass (Vallet2018Insights). The mature LOX enzyme functions as a monomer, with no quaternary structure reported (Vallet2018Insights). The enzyme's structure and dynamics are crucial for its interactions with various extracellular matrix components, influencing processes such as collagen cross-linking and tissue integrity (Vallet2018Insights).

## Function
Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a copper-dependent amine oxidase that plays a critical role in the formation and stabilization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by catalyzing the cross-linking of collagen and elastin. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining the tensile strength and structural integrity of various tissues, contributing to the mechanical properties of tissues such as elasticity and strength (Barker2012The; Wang2021An). LOX achieves this by oxidizing lysine residues in collagen and elastin, facilitating the formation of covalent bonds that are crucial for ECM stability (Barker2012The).

In healthy human cells, LOX is secreted as an inactive pro-enzyme and is activated by proteolytic processing, which allows it to interact with the ECM and participate in tissue remodeling (Barker2012The). The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in the aorta, lung, kidney, and pancreas, and its expression decreases with age, correlating with reduced levels of tropoelastin and collagen I (Barker2012The). LOX activity is also involved in maintaining chromosome stability and regulating chromosome condensation through the oxidation of residues in proteins with basic isoelectric points, such as histones (Barker2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LOX gene are associated with several cardiovascular diseases, particularly thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD). A specific missense mutation, c.893T > G encoding p.Met298Arg, has been identified in individuals with TAAD, leading to insufficient cross-linking of elastin and collagen, which weakens vessel walls and predisposes carriers to vascular diseases (Lee2016Loss). This mutation affects the enzymatic activity of LOX without reducing its expression, resulting in severe vascular abnormalities (Lee2016Loss).

LOX mutations can also lead to haploinsufficiency, disrupting the enzyme's catalytic activity and contributing to aortic root aneurysms and dissections. These mutations result in decreased lysyl oxidase activity, essential for maintaining aortic integrity, and are linked to features overlapping with Marfan syndrome (Guo2016LOX).

Alterations in LOX expression are implicated in various pathologies. Decreased LOX activity is associated with connective tissue disorders like cutis laxa and Menkes' syndrome, while increased activity is linked to fibrotic diseases such as atherosclerosis and scleroderma (Payne2007Paradoxical). In cancer, LOX exhibits dual roles, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a metastasis promoter, with aberrant expression observed in several cancer types (Payne2007Paradoxical).

## Interactions
Lysyl oxidase (LOX) interacts with a variety of proteins and plays a significant role in cellular processes. LOX is known to interact with receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase kappa (RPTP-κ), which is involved in the regulation of β-catenin, a protein that can function in cell adhesion or as a transcriptional coactivator. In lung cancer cells, the lysyl oxidase propeptide (LOX-PP) derived from LOX interacts with RPTP-κ, leading to decreased nuclear levels of β-catenin and its relocalization to the plasma membrane. This interaction results in reduced β-catenin-driven transcriptional activity and decreased expression of β-catenin target genes such as c-MYC, EGFR, and FRA-1 (SánchezMorgan2011The).

LOX-PP also interacts with various extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagen I, fibromodulin, and fibronectin, indicating its involvement in ECM assembly and dynamics. It binds to glycosaminoglycans such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronan, suggesting roles in cell-matrix interactions (Vallet2018Insights). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of LOX in modulating cellular signaling pathways and ECM organization.
