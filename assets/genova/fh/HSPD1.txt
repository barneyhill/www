# HSPD1

## Overview
The HSPD1 gene encodes the mitochondrial chaperonin protein known as heat shock protein family D (Hsp60) member 1, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the proper folding and assembly of proteins within the mitochondrial matrix. As a chaperonin, Hsp60 is essential for the refolding of misfolded proteins and the folding of newly synthesized proteins, working in concert with its co-chaperonin, Hsp10. This protein complex is vital for mitochondrial function, operating through ATP-dependent cycles to ensure protein stability and prevent aggregation. Hsp60 is involved in various cellular processes, including mitochondrial dynamics, apoptosis regulation, and the protection of mitochondrial enzymes. Mutations in the HSPD1 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative and hypomyelinating disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and cellular health (Bross2016DiseaseAssociated; Magen2008Mitochondrial; Miyamoto2015Hypomyelinating).

## Structure
The HSPD1 gene encodes the mitochondrial heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), a chaperonin involved in protein folding. The primary structure of Hsp60 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form its functional domains. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function.

The tertiary structure of Hsp60 forms a barrel-like shape, which is crucial for its role in protein folding. This structure is organized into three main domains: the equatorial domain, which is involved in nucleotide binding and intra-ring communication; the intermediate domain; and the apical domain, where substrate proteins interact and enter the inner cavity (Rodriguez2020Complex).

In terms of quaternary structure, Hsp60 typically forms a tetradecamer, composed of two stacked heptameric rings. This arrangement is essential for its chaperoning function, allowing it to encapsulate and fold client proteins within its central cavity (Vilasi2018Chaperonin; Rodriguez2020Complex).

Hsp60 undergoes post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. The protein also shares structural similarities with the bacterial GroEL, including a GroEL-like domain, which is indicative of its evolutionary conservation and functional mechanisms.

## Function
The HSPD1 gene encodes the mitochondrial heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), a chaperonin essential for protein folding and assembly within the mitochondrial matrix. Hsp60, in conjunction with its cochaperonin Hsp10, forms a complex that facilitates the proper folding of newly synthesized and imported proteins, as well as the refolding of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis (Magen2008Mitochondrial; Parnas2009The). This protein complex operates through cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis, which are crucial for its chaperone activity (Bross2016DiseaseAssociated).

Hsp60 is involved in several cellular processes, including the protection of mitochondrial respiratory-chain enzymes from damage and the correct folding of enzymes like short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) (Bross2006Singlenucleotide; Magen2008Mitochondrial). It also plays a role in apoptosis regulation, with its activity varying based on cellular localization (Parnas2009The). In healthy human cells, Hsp60 is crucial for the assembly and function of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and its absence leads to severe mitochondrial dysfunction (Magen2008Mitochondrial). The protein's function is vital for cellular stress responses and energy production, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSPD1 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial chaperone protein HSP60, are associated with several neurodegenerative and hypomyelinating disorders. One such condition is hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD), specifically HLD4, which is linked to both recessive and dominant mutations in HSPD1. The recessive form, known as MitCHAP60 disease, is caused by the p.Asp29Gly mutation and is characterized by severe neurological impairment and early lethality (Bross2016DiseaseAssociated; Miyamoto2015Hypomyelinating). A dominant form of HLD is associated with the p.Leu47Val mutation, which affects mitochondrial dynamics and protein function, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders (Cömert2020A).

HSPD1 mutations are also implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegia type 13 (SPG13), with the p.Val98Ile mutation causing a dominantly inherited form of the disease. This mutation results in impaired ATPase activity and protein folding, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Bross2016DiseaseAssociated; Vitale2020Missense). These mutations disrupt the normal function of the HSP60/HSP10 chaperonin complex, leading to altered mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, which are critical for cellular health (Bross2016DiseaseAssociated).

## Interactions
HSPD1, also known as Hsp60, is a mitochondrial chaperonin that forms a complex with the co-chaperonin Hsp10 to assist in the proper folding of mitochondrial proteins. This complex is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within the mitochondrial matrix. The Hsp60/Hsp10 complex operates through a cycle involving ATP binding, hydrolysis, and ADP release, which facilitates the folding of client proteins into their native conformations (Bross2016DiseaseAssociated).

HSPD1 interacts with various proteins, including those involved in mitochondrial dynamics, such as Drp1 and Fis1, which are associated with mitochondrial fission, and Mfn1 and Mfn2, which are involved in fusion. These interactions are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Miyamoto2015Hypomyelinating). In the context of sperm maturation, HSPD1 is involved in surface remodeling and interacts with other chaperones like HSPE1 and CCT/TRiC, as well as the putative zona pellucida receptor ADAMTS10, which is important for gamete adhesion and fusion processes (Bromfield2013The).

HSPD1 also plays a role in the biogenesis of alpha-synuclein, where it assists in the folding, transport, and localization of proteins, preventing their aggregation, which is significant in the context of diseases like Parkinson's (Hernandez2020ProteinProtein).
