# F2RL3

## Overview
F2RL3, also known as Protease-Activated Receptor 4 (PAR4), is a gene that encodes a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically categorized as a receptor involved in thrombin and trypsin signaling. The protein product of F2RL3, PAR4, plays a pivotal role in platelet activation and aggregation, which are essential processes in hemostasis and thrombosis. This receptor is activated through proteolytic cleavage, which exposes a tethered ligand that initiates intracellular signaling pathways. Beyond its role in hemostasis, F2RL3 is expressed in various cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, where it contributes to inflammatory responses and is implicated in processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in cancer. The gene's expression and methylation status have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and it is influenced by environmental factors such as smoking and exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Breitling2012Smoking; Alhamdow2018DNA; Zhang2014F2RL3methylation).

## Structure
F2RL3, also known as PAR4, is a member of the rhodopsin family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a conserved seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain structure. The receptor is 385 amino acids long and exhibits a predicted disorder rate of 21.0%, with long, mostly disordered N- and C-terminal regions (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The N-terminal domain is crucial for activation, as it is cleaved by thrombin, trypsin, and cathepsin-G at the R47//G48 site, exposing the tethered ligand sequence G48YPGQV, which initiates signaling (Chandrabalan2021Molecular).

The receptor's structure includes three extracellular loops, three intracellular loops, and an intracellular C-terminal domain, stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (Chandrabalan2021Molecular). The C-terminal domain contains fewer phosphorylation sites compared to other PARs, suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism (Chandrabalan2021Molecular). F2RL3 is involved in platelet activation and aggregation, with specific residues in the tethered ligand sequence playing key roles in these processes (Chandrabalan2021Molecular). The receptor's activation and signaling are influenced by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which affect its interaction with G proteins and β-arrestins (Chandrabalan2021Molecular).

## Function
The F2RL3 gene encodes the protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family. PAR4 is primarily involved in platelet activation and aggregation, playing a crucial role in hemostasis and thrombosis. It is activated by proteolytic cleavage, which triggers intracellular signaling pathways that lead to platelet shape change, granule secretion, and aggregation, essential processes for blood clot formation (Deng2024STING).

In addition to its role in platelets, F2RL3 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, where it contributes to inflammatory responses. The receptor is involved in proinflammatory reactions, particularly in response to cytokines such as IL-1α and TNF-α, which increase its expression in endothelial cells. This suggests a role in modulating vascular inflammation and endothelial function (Deng2024STING).

F2RL3 is also implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis in gastric cancer cells through the Rap1/MAPK signaling pathway. This involves the modulation of cell activity, metastasis, and invasion, indicating its broader role in cell biology beyond hemostasis (Ma2024F2RL3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and methylation of the F2RL3 gene have significant clinical implications. Hypomethylation of F2RL3 is strongly associated with increased mortality from all causes, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, even after adjusting for risk factors such as smoking (Zhang2014F2RL3methylation). This hypomethylation is linked to smoking exposure and may lead to upregulation of the thrombin protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR-4), contributing to cardiovascular and malignant pathologies (Zhang2014F2RL3methylation). 

In the context of pulmonary hypertension (PH), F2RL3 is upregulated in endothelial cells, and its expression is regulated by the STING-NF-κB axis. Alterations in F2RL3 expression can impact PH progression by modulating BMPR2 signaling, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in PH treatment (Deng2024STING). 

F2RL3 hypomethylation is also associated with occupational exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which increases the risk of lung cancer. This hypomethylation may lead to increased expression of F2RL3, contributing to lung carcinogenesis (Alhamdow2018DNA). The gene's methylation status serves as a biomarker for smoking-related cardiovascular risk and lung cancer risk (Alhamdow2018DNA; Breitling2012Smoking).

## Interactions
F2RL3, also known as Protease-Activated Receptor 4 (PAR4), is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It is a principal receptor for thrombin-mediated platelet activation, interacting with thrombin through proteolytic cleavage to initiate signaling pathways that lead to platelet activation and inflammatory responses (Muehlschlegel2012Polymorphism). 

In the context of gastric cancer, F2RL3 interacts with components of the Rap1/MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis, processes critical for cancer progression. Knockdown experiments have shown that F2RL3 modulates the expression of proteins such as Rap1GAP, Rap1, p-ERK1/2, and p-p38 MAPK, indicating its role in regulating this pathway (Ma2024F2RL3).

F2RL3 is also involved in the STING-NF-κB signaling axis. In pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, F2RL3 expression is regulated by STING, which activates NF-κB signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed NF-κB binding to the F2RL3 promoter, and co-immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated an interaction between STING and F2RL3, suggesting that F2RL3 is a downstream regulatory gene of STING (Deng2024STING).
