# CNOT6L

## Overview
CNOT6L is a gene that encodes the protein CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 6-like, which is a critical component of the CCR4-NOT complex, a major deadenylase complex in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a deadenylase due to its role in mRNA metabolism, specifically in the deadenylation process that shortens the poly(A) tail of mRNA molecules, leading to mRNA decay and regulation of gene expression (Mittal2011The). The CNOT6L protein is characterized by its endonuclease-exonuclease-phosphatase (EEP) domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins within the complex (Zhang2016Structural). CNOT6L plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, and is implicated in clinical conditions such as cancer and reproductive health issues (Sha2018CNOT; Shirai2014Multifunctional).

## Structure
The human CNOT6L protein is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex and is characterized by its endonuclease-exonuclease-phosphatase (EEP) domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. The EEP domain is associated with ribonuclease activity, showing a strong preference for poly(A) residues. Structurally, the nuclease domain of CNOT6L forms a two-layered alpha-beta sandwich with approximate twofold internal symmetry, typical of the EEP family of deadenylases. This domain consists of two mostly antiparallel beta-sheets on the interior, flanked by two alpha-helical layers on the outside, creating a heart-shaped molecule. The active site contains two magnesium ions essential for its deadenylase activity, which are buried in a cleft that also serves as the substrate-binding site (Zhang2016Structural).

The LRR domain, composed of alternating alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forms a solenoid structure that interacts with the Caf1 subunit. In vertebrates, including humans, CNOT6L and its paralog CNOT6 cannot coexist in the same complex, suggesting distinct roles or regulatory mechanisms (Winkler2013Heterogeneity). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in mRNA metabolism, particularly in the deadenylation process.

## Function
CNOT6L is a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, a major deadenylase complex in eukaryotic cells that plays a crucial role in mRNA metabolism. It is primarily involved in the deadenylation process, which shortens the poly(A) tail of mRNA molecules, leading to mRNA decay and regulation of gene expression (Mittal2011The). In skeletal muscle cells, CNOT6L acts as a negative regulator of muscle differentiation. Its knockdown in myoblasts results in increased expression of differentiation markers and enhanced myotube formation, indicating its role in inhibiting muscle cell differentiation (Polesskaya2016Posttranscriptional). CNOT6L regulates the stability of interleukin 8 (IL-8) mRNA by binding to it and affecting its poly(A) tail length, which is crucial for skeletal muscle differentiation (Polesskaya2016Posttranscriptional).

In the context of cell proliferation and survival, CNOT6L, along with CNOT6, contributes to the prevention of cell death and senescence. Knockdown of CNOT6L leads to reduced cell proliferation and decreased cell viability, highlighting its importance in maintaining cell survival (Mittal2011The). CNOT6L is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and mRNA degradation (Mittal2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CNOT6L gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of cancer, significant copy number loss of CNOT6L has been observed in human colon adenocarcinoma samples, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Shirai2014Multifunctional). Additionally, CNOT6L expression is down-regulated in leukemia cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to normal blood cells, indicating its possible involvement in these hematological malignancies (Shirai2014Multifunctional).

In reproductive biology, CNOT6L is crucial for the degradation of maternal mRNA during oocyte maturation in mice. The absence of CNOT6L leads to defects in meiotic cell cycle progression, resulting in decreased fertility due to improper spindle assembly and activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (Sha2018CNOT). This suggests that disruptions in CNOT6L function could potentially affect fertility, although direct links to human fertility issues have not been established (Sha2018CNOT).

Overall, while the precise mechanisms and implications of CNOT6L alterations in human diseases require further investigation, current evidence highlights its significant role in both cancer biology and reproductive health.

## Interactions
CNOT6L, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions that are crucial for its role in mRNA metabolism. It interacts with the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L2, which acts as an adaptor to recruit the CCR4-NOT complex to (A+U)-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNAs, facilitating their degradation during oocyte maturation in mice (Sha2018CNOT). This interaction is essential for the selective degradation of maternal mRNAs, which is critical for meiotic cell cycle progression (Sha2018CNOT).

CNOT6L also interacts with other components of the CCR4-NOT complex, such as CNOT7, through its leucine-rich region (LRR) near the N-terminus, which mediates these interactions (Sha2018CNOT). In human cells, CNOT6L, also known as Ccr4b, is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and interacts with proteins like Caf1a/Caf1b, which are part of the same complex (Mittal2011The).

In the context of muscle differentiation, CNOT6L binds to IL-8 mRNA, regulating its stability and poly(A) tail length, which influences myoblast differentiation (Polesskaya2016Posttranscriptional). These interactions highlight CNOT6L's role in post-transcriptional regulation and its impact on cellular processes.
