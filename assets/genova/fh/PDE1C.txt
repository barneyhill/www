# PDE1C

## Overview
PDE1C is a gene that encodes the protein phosphodiesterase 1C, a member of the phosphodiesterase family of enzymes. This protein is categorized as a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase, which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling by hydrolyzing cyclic nucleotides, specifically cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP), into their inactive forms. The activity of phosphodiesterase 1C is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, which, upon binding to calmodulin, activate the enzyme. This regulation is essential for various physiological processes, including smooth muscle cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and cardiomyocyte survival. The gene and its encoded protein are implicated in several clinical conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, hearing loss, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, making PDE1C a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2018A; Cai2015Role; Brzezinska2021Phosphodiesterase).

## Function
Phosphodiesterase 1C (PDE1C) is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme that plays a significant role in regulating intracellular signaling pathways by hydrolyzing cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) into their inactive forms. In human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), PDE1C is involved in the regulation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and cAMP signaling, which are crucial for cell migration and the formation of leading-edge protrusions (LEPs) (Brzezinska2021Phosphodiesterase). PDE1C is activated by increases in intracellular calcium, often resulting from endoplasmic reticulum calcium store depletion or SOCE, and this activation is facilitated by calcium/calmodulin binding (Brzezinska2021Phosphodiesterase).

PDE1C is also implicated in the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, as its activity is necessary for maximal cell proliferation. This is achieved through the hydrolysis of cAMP, which typically inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation by activating protein kinase A (PKA) and suppressing mitogenic signaling pathways (Rybalkin2002Cyclic). In pancreatic β-cells, PDE1C modulates insulin secretion by counteracting glucose-stimulated insulin release, providing a feedback mechanism through enhanced cAMP degradation (Han1999The). These functions highlight PDE1C's role in various cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and hormone secretion, by modulating cyclic nucleotide levels in response to calcium signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PDE1C gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A dominant variant in the PDE1C gene, specifically the c.958G>T (p.A320S) missense mutation, is associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in a Chinese family. This mutation increases the hydrolytic activity of PDE1C, leading to decreased levels of cAMP and cGMP, which are crucial for auditory signaling pathways. The disruption of these pathways is implicated in hearing loss (Wang2018A).

In cardiovascular diseases, PDE1C is involved in the proliferation of human arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), a key event in atherosclerosis and restenosis. PDE1C expression is associated with proliferating SMCs and is absent in quiescent cells. Inhibition of PDE1C can suppress SMC proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in vascular diseases characterized by abnormal SMC proliferation (Rybalkin1997Calmodulinstimulated; Rybalkin2002Cyclic).

PDE1C is also implicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), where increased PDE1 activity correlates with decreased cAMP and cGMP levels in pulmonary arteries. PDE1 inhibitors have shown promise in improving hemodynamics and reducing right heart hypertrophy in PAH models (Samidurai2021Role).

## Interactions
PDE1C interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that play critical roles in various cellular processes. In vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), PDE1C associates with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) on the cell membrane. This interaction is crucial for the endocytosis and degradation of PDGFRβ, which affects SMC growth and migration (Cai2015Role). PDE1C also interacts with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), influencing PDGFRβ stability through an LRP1-dependent mechanism. This interaction modulates PDGFRβ endocytosis and lysosome-dependent degradation, impacting vascular remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia (Cai2015Role).

In cardiomyocytes, PDE1C forms a multiprotein complex with transient receptor potential-canonical (TRPC) channels and adenosine A2 receptors (A2R). This complex regulates cardiomyocyte survival by modulating cAMP signaling. The interaction between PDE1C and TRPC3 channels is particularly significant, as it affects Ca2+ influx and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. PDE1C's role in this complex is crucial for the regulation of cAMP levels and cardiomyocyte survival, especially in the context of stress-induced conditions like doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (Zhang2018Multiprotein). These interactions highlight PDE1C's involvement in both vascular and cardiac cellular processes, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in related diseases.
