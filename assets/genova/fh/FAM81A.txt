# FAM81A

## Overview
FAM81A is a gene that encodes a postsynaptic protein known as family with sequence similarity 81 member A. This protein is integral to synaptic function and neuronal network maintenance, primarily through its role in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) at the postsynaptic density (PSD). FAM81A interacts with key synaptic proteins such as PSD-95, SynGAP, and GluN2B, facilitating the formation of condensates that are crucial for synaptic plasticity and excitatory synaptic transmission (Kaizuka2024FAM81A). The protein's ability to modulate synapse size and neuronal activity underscores its importance in maintaining synaptic stability and function. Variants in the FAM81A gene have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, as well as non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Kaizuka2024FAM81A; Yamamoto2017Germline).

## Function
The FAM81A gene encodes a postsynaptic protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic function and the maintenance of neuronal networks. It is involved in the condensation of postsynaptic proteins through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), forming condensates with key synaptic proteins such as PSD-95, SynGAP, and GluN2B. These interactions are important for synaptic plasticity, which involves changes in synapse size and is essential for neuronal activity (Kaizuka2024FAM81A). FAM81A facilitates condensate formation in a dose-dependent manner, affecting the size of dendritic spines and PSD-95 puncta (Kaizuka2024FAM81A).

FAM81A is enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction of synapses, where it interacts with other synaptic proteins such as PSD-95. It is partially colocalized with NMDA receptors, indicating its involvement in synaptic signaling (Kaizuka2024FAM81A). The protein's ability to condense is attributed to specific domains within its structure, particularly the N-terminal region, which is crucial for avoiding aggregate formation and ensuring proper synaptic localization (Kaizuka2024FAM81A).

Knockdown experiments in cultured hippocampal neurons show that reducing FAM81A levels decreases the size of PSD-95 puncta and reduces neuronal firing frequency, indicating its role in stabilizing PSD-95 at synapses and maintaining excitatory synaptic transmission (Kaizuka2024FAM81A).

## Clinical Significance
The FAM81A gene is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Variants located at the 5' side of the FAM81A gene may influence its expression levels, potentially increasing the risk of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, as indicated by specific genetic markers. These variants may also be associated with alcohol dependence. FAM81A is identified as a hub gene related to susceptibility to depression, suggesting that its expression level, which may affect neuronal activity, is involved in neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression. The study highlights the role of FAM81A in the condensation of postsynaptic proteins via liquid–liquid phase separation, which could be crucial for synaptic function and structure, potentially linking it to these disorders (Kaizuka2024FAM81A).

In addition to its role in neuropsychiatric conditions, FAM81A has been associated with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Copy number variations (CNVs) in the FAM81A gene have been significantly associated with recurrence and disease progression in NMIBC. Patients with recurrence and disease progression had significantly lower FAM81A relative copy numbers compared to those without recurrence and progression, suggesting that alterations in the FAM81A gene may be linked to the progression and recurrence of NMIBC (Yamamoto2017Germline).

## Interactions
FAM81A is a postsynaptic protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic function through its interactions with other synaptic proteins. It is involved in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process that allows proteins to form dynamic, liquid-like structures. FAM81A interacts with core synaptic proteins such as PSD-95, SynGAP, and GluN2B, forming condensates that are essential for synaptic plasticity and neuronal network maintenance (Kaizuka2024FAM81A). These interactions are confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that FAM81A can directly bind to these proteins (Kaizuka2024FAM81A).

The protein undergoes LLPS to form condensates with these key synaptic proteins, which are crucial for modulating synapse size and neuronal activity. The presence of FAM81A facilitates the formation and stabilization of these condensates, as reducing its concentration leads to a decrease in condensate size (Kaizuka2024FAM81A). The region between the two coiled-coiled domains and the N-terminal domain of FAM81A is critical for LLPS, rather than the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (Kaizuka2024FAM81A). These interactions suggest that FAM81A is integral to the structural and functional organization of the postsynaptic density (PSD) (Kaizuka2024FAM81A).
