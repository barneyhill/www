# NOP16

## Overview
NOP16 is a gene located on human chromosome 5q35.2 that encodes the NOP16 nucleolar protein, a histone mimetic involved in critical cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis and chromatin regulation. The NOP16 protein is characterized by its ability to mimic histone H3, particularly in its interaction with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3, influencing histone methylation and gene repression (Takashima2023NOP16). Additionally, NOP16 plays a significant role in the maturation of ribosomal RNA, essential for ribosomal subunit assembly within the nucleolus (Tafforeau2013The). The protein's interactions with various cellular components underscore its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proliferation, with implications in cancer progression and other diseases (Mu2024NOP16; Takashima2023NOP16).

## Structure
NOP16 is a nucleolar protein encoded on human chromosome 5q35.2, consisting of 178 amino acids. It is characterized as a histone mimetic, with a sequence homologous to the region surrounding histone H3K27, specifically ARRK29AAP in NOP16 compared to AARK27SAP in histone H3. This similarity allows NOP16 to interact with components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), such as EED, EZH2, and SUZ12, as well as the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3 (Takashima2023NOP16).

The interaction with EED is mediated through the WD40 domain, with lysine residues K29, K106, and K107 playing crucial roles. Although mass spectrometry did not detect methylation at K29, it is suggested that this residue is methylated, enhancing binding to EED (Takashima2023NOP16). NOP16 also associates with ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), influencing lipid metabolism in cancer-associated fibroblasts (Takashima2023NOP16).

The protein's structure includes a bipartite binding site, allowing it to interact with ribosomal proteins Rpl8 and Rpl13, which is significant for its role in ribosome biogenesis (Sanghai2017Modular). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of NOP16 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
NOP16 is a nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) intermediates. It plays a crucial role in the maturation of ribosomal RNA, which is essential for the assembly of ribosomal subunits within the nucleolus. In healthy human cells, NOP16 is associated with the upregulation of 41S and downregulation of 30S, 21S, and 12S pre-rRNA intermediates, as well as the upregulation of 18S-E, indicating its involvement in specific stages of pre-rRNA processing (Tafforeau2013The).

NOP16 also functions as a histone mimetic, regulating histone H3K27 methylation and gene repression. It interacts with components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), such as EED, and the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3. This interaction suggests that NOP16 competes with histone H3 for binding to the methylation/demethylation machinery, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Takashima2023NOP16).

The protein is ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes. Its activity in regulating rRNA biogenesis and histone modification underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proliferation (Takashima2023NOP16).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NOP16 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly the basal subtype of triple-negative breast cancer, high NOP16 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased genomic alterations in cancer-related genes such as TP53 and MYC. Knockdown or knockout of NOP16 in breast cancer cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasivity, indicating its role in promoting malignant properties (Takashima2023NOP16). NOP16 overexpression in breast cancer models is linked to decreased global H3K27me3 levels, promoting tumor growth, while its knockdown reduces tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Takashima2023NOP16).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high NOP16 expression correlates with poor overall survival and disease-specific survival. It is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oxidative stress pathways, particularly through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway. Knockdown of NOP16 activates this pathway, reducing cell invasiveness and migration, and increasing apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in HCC (Mu2024NOP16).

Additionally, NOP16 has been linked to neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), with significant correlations found between NOP16 mutations and the disorder, suggesting a role in genetic predisposition (Zhong2021Whole‐exome).

## Interactions
NOP16 is a histone mimetic protein that interacts with several key components involved in histone modification and gene repression. It physically interacts with components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), including EZH2, SUZ12, and EED. The interaction with EED is particularly significant, as it involves the WD40 domain of EED, which is crucial for binding both NOP16 and histone H3. This interaction suggests that NOP16 competes with histone H3 for binding to the H3K27 methylation machinery, influencing histone modification and gene repression (Takashima2023NOP16).

NOP16 also interacts with the H3K27me3 demethylase JMJD3, but not with UTX, indicating a selective interaction with demethylase complexes. The methylation status of NOP16, particularly at lysine 29, affects its binding affinity to EED, with trimethylated K29 showing the highest affinity (Takashima2023NOP16).

In addition to its role in histone modification, NOP16 is involved in ribosome biosynthesis, interacting with RNA 3'-phosphocyclase (RTCD1) and playing a role in the synthesis of the large subunit of the cellular ribosome (Mu2024NOP16). These interactions highlight NOP16's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including chromatin regulation and ribosome assembly.
