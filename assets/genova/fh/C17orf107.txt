# C17orf107

## Overview
C17orf107 is a gene located on chromosome 17 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 17 open reading frame 107. This protein is currently not categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. However, it has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. Research suggests that C17orf107 may play a role in kidney health, as it is downregulated in chronic kidney disease and associated with genetic variants linked to end-stage kidney disease (Acoba2024Kidney). Additionally, while no definitive link has been established, the gene has been explored in the context of neurological conditions such as familial chronic megacolon and Alzheimer's disease (Camilleri2019Familial; Enduru2024Dissecting). Furthermore, C17orf107 is associated with oxygen saturation levels in adipose tissue and has been proposed as a potential biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma through its circRNA transcript (Matboli2018circRNAs; Cade2019Associations).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
C17orf107 has been implicated in several health conditions, although its precise role remains under investigation. In the context of kidney health, C17orf107 is one of the pathway-orphan genes that are downregulated in chronic kidney disease (CKD), suggesting a potential involvement in CKD pathogenesis (Acoba2024Kidney). A genetic variant in C17orf107, rs138572244, has been associated with end-stage kidney disease, indicating a possible clinical significance in kidney-related conditions (Acoba2024Kidney).

In neurological contexts, C17orf107 was investigated for its potential role in familial chronic megacolon, a condition related to the enteric nervous system, but no definitive association was found (Camilleri2019Familial). The gene has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease and frailty, as it was identified in a study exploring shared genetic architecture between these conditions (Enduru2024Dissecting).

C17orf107 is associated with minimum SpO2 levels in visceral omentum adipose tissue, suggesting a role in regulating oxygen saturation during sleep, although its clinical significance in sleep-related conditions is not fully detailed (Cade2019Associations). Additionally, the circRNA transcript of C17orf107, hsa_circ_000224, has been proposed as a potential biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (Matboli2018circRNAs).
