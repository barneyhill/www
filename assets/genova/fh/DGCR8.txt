# DGCR8

## Overview
The DGCR8 gene encodes the DGCR8 microprocessor complex subunit, a pivotal protein in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs). As a component of the microprocessor complex, DGCR8 collaborates with the RNase III enzyme Drosha to process primary miRNA transcripts into precursor miRNAs, a critical step in miRNA maturation (Guo2019Dgcr8; Shenoy2009Genomic). The DGCR8 protein is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, facilitated by its RNA heme-binding domain and double-stranded RNA-binding domains, which are essential for its function in miRNA processing (Nguyen2018Orientation). Beyond its canonical role in miRNA biogenesis, DGCR8 is involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA destabilization and transcriptional regulation, and has been implicated in the DNA damage response (Pong2018Noncanonical). Mutations in the DGCR8 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, including familial multinodular goiter and schwannomatosis, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Rodrigues2022DGCR8; B2020DGCR8).

## Structure
The DGCR8 protein is a critical component of the microprocessor complex involved in microRNA (miRNA) processing. It is composed of several domains, including an N-terminal nuclear localization sequence (NLS), an RNA heme-binding domain (Rhed), two double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs), and a C-terminal tail region (CTT) (Nguyen2018Orientation). The Rhed domain is multifunctional, containing dimerization, heme binding, and RNA binding capacities, which contribute to substrate binding specificity and processing efficiency (Nguyen2018Orientation).

The dimerization domain of DGCR8, located between residues 276-412, includes a WW motif that mediates dimerization through domain swapping with the C-terminal region of the partner subunit (Senturia2010Structure). This domain is embedded within a heme-binding domain, and the binding of heme enhances DGCR8's activity in miRNA processing (Senturia2010Structure).

DGCR8 forms higher-order structures with pri-miRNAs, which are crucial for the recognition and processing of these transcripts. The cooperative binding of DGCR8 to pri-miRNAs involves trimerization, facilitated by the C-terminal amphipathic helix, which is essential for the recruitment of Drosha for pri-miRNA cleavage (Faller2010DGCR8).

## Function
The DGCR8 protein is a critical component of the microprocessor complex, which is essential for the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) in human cells. This complex, composed of DGCR8 and the RNase III enzyme Drosha, processes primary miRNA transcripts into precursor miRNAs, a crucial step in miRNA maturation (Guo2019Dgcr8; Shenoy2009Genomic). DGCR8 specifically binds to the apical loop of primary miRNAs, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of Drosha-mediated cleavage, which is vital for the production of most miRNAs (Guo2019Dgcr8).

DGCR8 also plays a role in the regulation of its own expression through a feedback mechanism involving the microprocessor complex. It destabilizes its own mRNA by cleaving hairpins in the 5' untranslated region, ensuring tight homeostatic control of microprocessor levels (Triboulet2009Posttranscriptional; Shenoy2009Genomic). Beyond miRNA processing, DGCR8 is involved in mRNA destabilization, transcriptional regulation, and RNA stability, acting independently of Drosha in some cases (Guo2019Dgcr8; Pong2018Noncanonical). These functions are significant for various cellular processes, including neural progenitor maintenance and dendritic cell differentiation (Guo2019Dgcr8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DGCR8 gene, particularly the p.E518K variant, have been linked to several clinical conditions. This mutation is associated with familial multinodular goiter and schwannomatosis, a condition affecting Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The p.E518K mutation disrupts miRNA biogenesis by reducing RNA binding affinity, leading to a deficiency in mature miRNA production (B2020DGCR8). This mutation is also a somatic hotspot in Wilms' tumors and has been identified in papillary thyroid carcinomas and widely invasive follicular thyroid carcinomas, suggesting a role in tumor development (Rodrigues2022DGCR8).

In thyroid carcinoma, the DGCR8 p.E518K mutation is often accompanied by loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type allele, indicating a tumor-suppressor role for DGCR8. This mutation is linked to altered miRNA expression, which can influence tumor growth and progression (Rodrigues2024Unraveling). Additionally, DGCR8 mutations are associated with severe hypothyroidism and thyroid tissue disorganization in knockout models, highlighting their role in thyroid gland pathophysiology and tumorigenesis (Rodrigues2022DGCR8).

The DGCR8 gene is also implicated in a novel autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by familial multinodular goiter and schwannomatosis due to miRNA processing failure (B2020DGCR8). These findings underscore the significance of DGCR8 mutations in various diseases, particularly those involving disrupted miRNA processing.

## Interactions
DGCR8, a key component of the microprocessor complex, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in miRNA biogenesis. It forms a complex with Drosha, an RNase III enzyme, which is essential for processing primary miRNA transcripts into precursor miRNAs. This interaction is stabilized by DGCR8's C-terminal tail domain and its double-stranded RNA-binding domains (Pong2018Noncanonical; Han2009Posttranscriptional). DGCR8 also interacts with Nucleolin and ILF3, forming complexes that are involved in RNA processing and transportation. The interaction with Nucleolin is RNA-dependent and involves DGCR8's double-stranded RNA binding motifs (Shiohama2007Nucleolar).

DGCR8 is known to bind directly to pri-miRNAs, facilitating their recognition and processing by Drosha. It forms a cooperative complex with pri-miRNAs, which is crucial for Drosha's cleavage activity (Faller2010DGCR8). Beyond miRNA processing, DGCR8 is involved in the DNA damage response and nucleotide excision repair, independent of its RNA-processing role (Pong2018Noncanonical). DGCR8 also regulates the stability of snoRNAs and interacts with various mRNAs, influencing alternative splicing and mRNA stability (Macias2012DGCR8). These interactions highlight DGCR8's multifaceted role in RNA metabolism and cellular processes.
