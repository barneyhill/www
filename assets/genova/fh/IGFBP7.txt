# IGFBP7

## Overview
IGFBP7, or insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in various physiological and pathological processes. The protein, also referred to as IGFBP7, is a member of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein family, but it is distinct due to its unique structural features, including the absence of conserved cysteine residues in its C-terminal domain and the presence of Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domains and immunoglobulin-like C2 domains (Chen2024The). Functionally, IGFBP7 is involved in modulating growth factor signaling, particularly through its interactions with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and other extracellular matrix components, influencing processes such as angiogenesis, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (Evdokimova2012IGFBP7; Lit2024Insulinlike). Clinically, IGFBP7 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression and methylation status can act as a biomarker for tumor progression and therapeutic response (Ruan2006IGFBP7; Wajapeyee2008Oncogenic).

## Structure
IGFBP7, or insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7, is a unique member of the IGFBP family, distinguished by its molecular structure and domain composition. Unlike other IGFBPs, IGFBP7 lacks the conserved cysteine residues in its C-terminal domain, possessing only one cysteine residue, which contributes to its distinct structural and functional properties (Chen2024The). The protein includes a conserved N-terminal domain similar to other IGFBPs, but it also features distinctive Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domains and immunoglobulin-like C2 domains (Chen2024The).

The N-terminal domain of IGFBP7 is crucial for its interaction with the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), where it blocks activation by insulin-like growth factors, leading to the accumulation of inactive IGF1R on the cell surface (Evdokimova2012IGFBP7). This domain also includes a heparin-binding site, which is important for its function (Evdokimova2012IGFBP7).

IGFBP7 is not subject to glycosylation or phosphorylation, which differentiates it from other IGFBPs, and its regulation occurs at the RNA and DNA levels (Chen2024The). The protein's structure allows it to bind to various ligands, including CD93, through specific interactions involving its IB and Kazal domains (Xu2024Structural). These structural features suggest that IGFBP7 may have unique functions independent of IGF binding.

## Function
IGFBP7 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7) is a glycoprotein involved in various biological processes, particularly in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. It is expressed in several tissues, including peripheral nerves, smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells, and is predominantly localized in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Lit2024Insulinlike). IGFBP7 binds to various ECM components and growth factors, such as collagen IV, heparan sulfate, VEGF-A, and IGF, and interacts with receptors like the IGF-I receptor, integrin αvβ3, and CD93 (Lit2024Insulinlike).

In healthy human cells, IGFBP7 plays a significant role in stem and progenitor cell commitment, particularly in the differentiation of cells into adipocytes and osteogenic lineages. It enhances osteogenic differentiation through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and is crucial for the bone-forming effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) (Lit2024Insulinlike). IGFBP7 also plays a role in cardiac commitment of embryonic stem cells, regulated by the transcription factor TAp63 (Lit2024Insulinlike).

IGFBP7 exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, particularly in dysregulated wound healing, where it decreases fibroblast proliferation and induces apoptosis (Lit2024Insulinlike). In the liver, IGFBP7 is secreted by macrophages and regulates metabolism, contributing to insulin resistance (Lit2024Insulinlike).

## Clinical Significance
IGFBP7 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7) plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and methylation status having critical implications. In colorectal cancer (CRC), IGFBP7 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression is associated with DNA hypomethylation of exon 1. This overexpression correlates with favorable survival outcomes and inhibits growth, decreases colony formation, and induces apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines (Ruan2006IGFBP7). In contrast, in melanoma, IGFBP7 is often epigenetically silenced due to promoter hypermethylation, which is a critical step in melanoma development. The loss of IGFBP7 expression allows cells to escape BRAFV600E-induced senescence, contributing to tumor progression (Wajapeyee2008Oncogenic).

In lung cancer, IGFBP7 expression is reduced in primary and metastatic tumors, with DNA hypermethylation linked to its downregulation. This reduction is associated with resistance to cisplatin-based therapy (Jin2020Insulin). In hepatocellular carcinoma, lower IGFBP7 expression is associated with genomic deletions and negatively correlates with tumor grades and stages (Li2023Angiogenesis). These findings highlight the complex role of IGFBP7 in cancer progression, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the cancer type and context.

## Interactions
IGFBP7 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It binds to the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), blocking its activation by insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2). This interaction prevents IGF1R internalization, stabilizing it on the cell surface and inhibiting downstream signaling pathways such as the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which can lead to apoptosis in certain cell lines (Evdokimova2012IGFBP7).

IGFBP7 also interacts with CD93, a protein involved in endothelial cell angiogenesis. The binding occurs primarily at the interface between the IB domain of IGFBP7 and the EGF1 domain of CD93. This interaction is crucial for endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, as demonstrated by experiments showing that CD93 knockout in HUVEC cells results in slower migration, which can be restored by reintroducing wild-type CD93 (Xu2024Structural).

Additionally, IGFBP7 binds to insulin, inhibiting its action by blocking its binding to the insulin receptor (IR). This interaction involves key residues such as Arg198 and His200, which are critical for maintaining the binding energy between IGFBP7 and insulin (Ruan2016Interaction). These interactions highlight IGFBP7's role in modulating growth factor signaling and cell adhesion.
