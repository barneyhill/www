# HMCES

## Overview
HMCES is a gene that encodes the protein 5-hydroxymethylcytosine binding, ES cell specific, which plays a pivotal role in DNA repair and genomic stability. The protein is characterized by a highly conserved SOS Response Associated Peptidase (SRAP) domain, which is crucial for its function in forming DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) with abasic sites in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Halabelian2019Structurala). This interaction is essential for protecting the genome from error-prone repair pathways and maintaining integrity during DNA replication and repair processes (Wu2022HMCES). HMCES is particularly active at stalled replication forks, where it interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to facilitate DNA repair (Srivastava2020HMCES). The protein's role extends to class switch recombination in B cells, where it aids in the alternative end-joining pathway of DNA double-strand break repair (Shukla2020HMCES). Mutations in the HMCES gene can lead to genomic instability and have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer development and progression (Thompson2020New).

## Structure
The HMCES protein contains a highly conserved SRAP (SOS Response Associated Peptidase) domain, which is essential for its function in DNA repair. This domain includes a catalytic triad composed of Cys2, Glu127, and His210, which are crucial for the protein's autoproteolytic activity and its ability to form DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) with abasic sites in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Amidon2020Structural; Halabelian2019Structurala). The SRAP domain interacts with DNA through a hydrophobic shelf and a positively charged cleft, with key residues such as Trp81, Phe92, Arg98, and Arg212 playing significant roles in DNA binding (Halabelian2019Structurala).

The structure of HMCES includes a C-terminal disordered region with non-canonical PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) boxes, which facilitate interaction with PCNA, a protein involved in DNA replication and repair (Amidon2020Structural). The SRAP domain's ability to bind both 5' and 3' overhangs suggests a universal functional feature, allowing it to accommodate various DNA structures (Halabelian2019Structurala). The protein's structure is refined to 2.2Å resolution, revealing a covalent interaction between Cys2 and the abasic site, forming a thiazolidine DNA-protein crosslink (Halabelian2019Structurala).

## Function
The HMCES protein plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by interacting with abasic sites in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) during DNA replication and repair processes. It forms covalent cross-links with these abasic sites, which are generated by the action of uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) on uracils introduced by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) during somatic hypermutation (SHM) in immunoglobulin genes. This cross-linking prevents cleavage by the APE2 endonuclease, thereby protecting against double-strand breaks and subsequent deletions (Wu2022HMCES).

HMCES is particularly active at stalled replication forks, where it shields abasic sites from error-prone repair pathways, thus preventing DNA breaks and maintaining genome integrity (Halabelian2019Structural). The protein contains a highly conserved N-terminal SOS Response-Associated Peptidase (SRAP) domain, which is involved in DNA repair processes and interacts with both single-stranded and duplex DNA segments (Halabelian2019Structurala).

In addition to its role in SHM, HMCES is involved in class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells, where it facilitates the alternative end-joining pathway of DNA double-strand break repair (Shukla2020HMCES). Its function in CSR involves protecting ssDNA overhangs from excessive deletion, independent of its cross-linking activity (Wu2022HMCES).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the HMCES gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of DNA repair and genomic stability. HMCES mutations, especially those affecting the cysteine residue involved in DNA-protein crosslink (DPC) formation, result in hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and synthetic lethality with cytidine deaminase APOBEC3A, which increases abasic (AP) site formation (RuaFernandez2023Selfreversal). These mutations can impair DNA repair, leading to increased mutation frequency and genomic instability, which are critical factors in cancer development (Thompson2020New).

HMCES is also crucial in maintaining replication fork stability, particularly in homologous recombination-deficient (HRD) cells. Its deficiency can lead to the accumulation of single-stranded DNA gaps and increased reliance on error-prone repair mechanisms, contributing to genomic instability and potentially impacting cancer progression (Srivastava2020HMCES; PeñaGómez2024HMCES). In HR-deficient tumors, low HMCES expression correlates with poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (PeñaGómez2024HMCES).

Additionally, HMCES plays a role in class switch recombination in B cells, and its deficiency can lead to increased DNA double-strand breaks and hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, further highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic integrity (Shukla2020HMCES).

## Interactions
HMCES interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a key component of the DNA replication machinery. This interaction occurs at the replication fork, where HMCES binds to PCNA through its C-terminal region, which contains PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) motifs. This binding is crucial for recruiting HMCES to sites of DNA replication and repair (Shukla2020HMCES; Srivastava2020HMCES).

HMCES also forms covalent DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) with abasic sites in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This interaction is facilitated by the SRAP domain of HMCES, which covalently cross-links to abasic sites through a thiazolidine bond involving a conserved cysteine residue. This cross-linking helps protect abasic sites from error-prone repair pathways and maintains genome stability (Semlow2021The; Halabelian2019Structurala).

In the context of DNA repair, HMCES is involved in the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway during class switch recombination in B cells. It binds to ssDNA overhangs, protecting them from excessive processing by exonucleases and facilitating microhomology-directed joining (Shukla2020HMCES).
