# MSTO1

## Overview
MSTO1 is a gene that encodes the protein misato mitochondrial distribution and morphology regulator 1, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in the processes of mitochondrial fusion and morphology regulation. The MSTO1 protein is categorized as a cytoplasmic pro-mitochondrial fusion protein and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the mitochondrial network. It is characterized by the presence of tubulin/Ftz-like GTPase domains, which are essential for its function in mitochondrial dynamics (Gal2017MSTO1). The gene is located on chromosome 1 and consists of 14 exons (Liu2022Case). Pathogenic variants in MSTO1 are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to clinical manifestations such as mitochondrial myopathy and cerebellar atrophy (SchultzRogers2019Novel). The protein's interactions with other mitochondrial components underscore its importance in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (Jin2015Yeast).

## Structure
The MSTO1 protein is a cytoplasmic pro-mitochondrial fusion protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics. It is composed of 570 amino acids and contains functional domains, including the Misato segment II tubulin-like domain and the Tubulin domain, as predicted by pfam (Iwama2018Novel). The protein is soluble and not an integral mitochondrial protein, indicating its loose association with the outer mitochondrial membrane (Gal2017MSTO1). MSTO1 shares some sequence similarity with known mitochondrial fusion proteins, particularly in a 12 amino acid span with outer mitochondrial membrane fusion proteins, although this similarity is not statistically significant (Gal2017MSTO1).

The MSTO1 protein contains two tubulin/Ftz-like GTPase domains, with seven possible GTP binding sites within the first domain, as identified through in silico analysis (Gal2017MSTO1). The protein's interaction with mitochondrial fusion proteins suggests its role in regulating mitochondrial morphology and fusion processes (Gal2017MSTO1). The MSTO1 gene is located on chromosome 1 and contains 14 exons, but the detailed molecular structure of the protein and the mechanisms by which it supports mitochondrial morphogenesis remain unclear (Liu2022Case).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MSTO1 gene are associated with a range of clinical manifestations primarily related to mitochondrial dysfunction. These include mitochondrial myopathy, cerebellar atrophy, and pigmentary retinopathy. Patients with MSTO1 mutations often present with muscle weakness, hypotonia, developmental delays, and skeletal abnormalities (SchultzRogers2019Novel). The gene is linked to both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns, with compound heterozygous mutations frequently observed (Liu2022Case; Iwama2018Novel).

MSTO1 mutations can lead to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, a condition characterized by a reduction in cellular mtDNA content, which manifests as muscular dystrophy with cerebellar involvement (Donkervoort2019MSTO1). This depletion is part of a broader class of mitochondrial diseases known as mtDNA depletion syndromes (Donkervoort2019MSTO1). Clinical features often include cerebellar ataxia, congenital muscle involvement, and pigmentary retinopathy (Donkervoort2019MSTO1).

In some cases, MSTO1 mutations result in unique phenotypic features such as a hairy back and enlarged gastrocnemius, expanding the known phenotype associated with these mutations (Liu2022Case). The pathogenic mechanism involves disruption of mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, potentially leading to multi-system abnormalities, particularly in energy-demanding organs like the brain and muscles (Liu2022Case).

## Interactions
MSTO1, a protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics, participates in several interactions that are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and structure. In human cells, MSTO1 has been shown to co-precipitate with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) and mitochondrial pseudouridine tRNA synthase (PUS1) in HEK293 cells. These interactions suggest a conserved role across species, as MSTO1 is the human orthologue of the yeast protein Dml1, which is involved in similar processes (Jin2015Yeast).

The MSTO1 protein is associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane and plays a critical role in mitochondrial fusion and the formation of mitochondrial networks. Pathogenic variants in the MSTO1 gene can lead to abnormal expression of the Misato protein, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, which affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP production (Liu2022Case).

These interactions and the role of MSTO1 in mitochondrial dynamics highlight its importance in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. The protein's interactions with other mitochondrial components are essential for maintaining the integrity and function of the mitochondrial network, which is crucial for normal cellular function and energy production.
