# BBIP1

## Overview
BBIP1 is a gene that encodes the protein BBSome interacting protein 1, also known as BBS18 or BBIP10, which is a critical component of the BBSome complex. This complex is integral to the function of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells involved in various signaling pathways and cellular processes. The BBIP1 protein is the smallest subunit of the BBSome and plays a pivotal role in its assembly and stability by interacting with other subunits such as BBS4 and BBS8. These interactions are essential for the structural integrity of the BBSome, facilitating its role in the trafficking of signaling receptors to and from cilia. Mutations in the BBIP1 gene can lead to Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a ciliopathy characterized by a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, and kidney dysfunction (Scheidecker2013Exome; Klink2019Structure).

## Structure
The BBIP1 protein, also known as BBS18, is a subunit of the BBSome complex, which plays a crucial role in ciliary function. Structurally, BBIP1 is the smallest subunit of the BBSome, consisting of 93 amino acid residues. It is centrally located within the complex and is almost completely unfolded, winding through two super-helically arranged TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) domains of the BBS4 and BBS8 subunits. This configuration acts like a U-bolt, clamping the TPR domains together and forming the spine of the core BBSome complex (Klink2019Structure).

The BBIP1 protein's interaction within the BBSome is essential for its assembly and function. The structure of the BBSome complex, including BBIP1, was resolved using electron cryo-microscopy to a resolution of 3.8 Å, providing detailed insights into its architecture (Klink2019Structure). Pathogenic mutations in BBIP1, such as the null mutation p.Leu58*, have been identified and are known to disrupt its incorporation into the BBSome, leading to compromised assembly and function, as observed in Bardet-Biedl syndrome patients (Scheidecker2013Exome).

## Function
BBIP1, also known as BBIP10, is a crucial component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in the trafficking of signaling receptors to and from cilia, small hair-like structures on the surface of cells. This trafficking is essential for the proper functioning of cilia, which play a significant role in various cellular processes, including signaling pathways (Scheidecker2013Exome). The BBSome complex, which includes several other proteins such as BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS9, is responsible for the transport of key cargo within cilia, acting as an adaptor for intraflagellar transport complexes (Jenkins2015Advances).

BBIP1 is essential for the assembly of the BBSome, and its dysfunction can lead to Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), a ciliopathy characterized by symptoms such as retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, and kidney dysfunction (Scheidecker2013Exome). In healthy human cells, BBIP1 is involved in the incorporation of the BBSome subunits, as evidenced by its interaction with the BBS4 subunit, which is crucial for proper BBSome assembly and ciliary function (Scheidecker2013Exome). The BBSome's role in vesicular protein transport to the cilium is highlighted, and its components are conserved across species (Jenkins2015Advances).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BBIP1 gene are clinically significant as they are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy. BBS is characterized by a range of symptoms including retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, kidney dysfunction, post-axial polydactyly, behavioral dysfunction, and hypogonadism (Scheidecker2013Exome). A specific novel homozygous nonsense mutation, c.173T>G, p.Leu58*, in the BBIP1 gene has been identified in a BBS patient. This mutation results in the absence of the BBIP1 protein, likely due to rapid turnover or poor incorporation into the BBSome, which is crucial for its assembly (Scheidecker2013Exome). The absence of functional BBIP1 protein disrupts the BBSome complex, impairing its role in signaling receptor trafficking to and from cilia, which is essential for normal cellular function (Scheidecker2013Exome).

In zebrafish models, depletion of BBIP1 led to ciliopathy phenotypes such as cystic dilations of the pronephros, abnormalities in Kupffer's vesicle, and disorganized retinal development, indicating its role in cilium function or assembly (Scheidecker2013Exome). These findings underscore the importance of BBIP1 in maintaining normal ciliary function and its involvement in the pathogenesis of BBS and related ciliopathies.

## Interactions
BBIP1, also known as BBS18 or BBIP10, is a crucial component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in ciliary trafficking and intracellular transport. BBIP1 interacts with several other BBSome subunits, including BBS4 and BBS8, acting as a linker between them. This interaction is essential for the structural integrity and stability of the BBSome complex (Klink2020Structure; Katoh2015Architectures). BBIP1 is almost completely unfolded and winds through the TPR domains of BBS4 and BBS8, clamping them together like a U-bolt, which forms the spine of the core BBSome complex (Klink2020Structure).

BBIP1 also interacts with the GAE domain of BBS1 and a loop of BBS8, although these interactions are limited. Despite this, the interactions are crucial for the proper assembly of the BBSome, as evidenced by a disease-causing mutation (L58*) that results in the loss of the helix and severely affects BBSome assembly (Scheidecker2013Exome; Klink2020Structure). The mutation leads to reduced incorporation of BBIP1 into the BBSome, highlighting its role in the complex's assembly and function (Scheidecker2013Exome).
