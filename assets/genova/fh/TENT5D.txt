# TENT5D

## Overview
TENT5D is a gene that encodes the protein terminal nucleotidyltransferase 5D, which is part of the nucleotidyltransferase enzyme family. This protein is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA molecules, specifically through the addition of nucleotides to the 3' end of RNA, a process known as polyadenylation (Brouze2023Polyadenylation). TENT5D plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including spermatogenesis, where it is essential for the proper development of primary spermatocytes (Brouze2024TENT5mediated). The protein's function extends to potential roles in neurological conditions and cancer, as evidenced by its aberrant expression in testicular cancer and autism spectrum disorder models (Warkocki2018Terminal; Liudkovska2020Functions). Understanding the function and regulation of TENT5D is important for elucidating its contributions to both normal physiology and disease states.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TENT5D gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. TENT5D is implicated in male infertility due to its role in spermatogenesis. Knockout mutations in TENT5D lead to abnormalities in the development of primary spermatocytes, degeneration of testicular tissue, and reduced blood testosterone levels, resulting in male sterility (Brouze2023Polyadenylation; Brouze2024TENT5mediated). Disruption of TENT5D function is linked to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count, poor sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology, contributing to male infertility in humans (Brouze2024TENT5mediated).

TENT5D is also proposed to be a testis cancer antigen, with aberrant expression patterns observed in testicular cancer (Liudkovska2020Functions). Additionally, TENT5D is overexpressed in the cerebral cortex in a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder, suggesting a potential link to neurological conditions (Warkocki2018Terminal; Liudkovska2020Functions). Antibodies against TENT5D have been found exclusively in the serum of patients with testis and lung tumors, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis (Warkocki2018Terminal). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TENT5D in reproductive and neurological health, as well as its potential involvement in cancer.
