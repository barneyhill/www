# TASOR2

## Overview
TASOR2 is a gene that encodes the protein transcription activation suppressor family member 2, which is a key component of the Human Silencing Hub (HuSH) complexes, specifically forming the HuSH2 complex. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression by modulating chromatin structure and gene accessibility, particularly in the silencing of retrotransposable elements such as LINE-1 elements. Unlike its paralog TASOR, TASOR2 lacks a pseudo-PARP domain but is essential for the recruitment of the HuSH2 complex to specific genomic regions, thereby maintaining genomic stability. The protein's interaction with the HuSH subunit MPP8 is crucial for the formation and stability of the HuSH2 complex, influencing the silencing of LINE-1 elements and the regulation of gene promoters and enhancers (Lewis2024Interplay).

## Function
TASOR2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the context of the Human Silencing Hub (HuSH) complexes. TASOR2 is a paralog of TASOR and is a core component of the HuSH2 complex, which plays a role in the silencing of retrotransposable elements such as LINE-1 elements. The protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other molecular components to modulate chromatin structure and gene accessibility (Lewis2024Interplay).

TASOR2 competes with TASOR for binding with the HuSH subunit MPP8, influencing the formation and stability of the HuSH complexes. This competition affects the abundance of HuSH and HuSH2 complexes, thereby impacting the silencing of LINE-1 elements. TASOR2 is particularly associated with gene promoters and enhancers, suggesting specialized roles in genomic regulation (Lewis2024Interplay).

Although TASOR2 lacks the pseudo-PARP domain found in TASOR, it is crucial for the recruitment of the HuSH2 complex to specific genomic regions. This recruitment is evidenced by the loss of MPP8 and PPHLN1 ChIP signals in TASOR2 knockout cells, highlighting its significant role in maintaining genomic stability (Lewis2024Interplay).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TASOR2, a paralog of TASOR, is a component of the Human Silencing Hub (HuSH) complexes, specifically forming the HuSH2 complex. This complex is distinct from the original HuSH complex, which includes TASOR, MPP8, and PPHLN1. TASOR2 interacts with MPP8 and PPHLN1, but not with TASOR, indicating that TASOR2 and TASOR form mutually exclusive complexes (Lewis2024Interplay). 

The interaction between TASOR2 and MPP8 is crucial for the formation and stability of the HuSH2 complex. TASOR2 competes with TASOR for a limited pool of MPP8, affecting the abundance and function of the HuSH and HuSH2 complexes. This competition influences the silencing of LINE-1 elements, with HuSH2 showing a preference for binding to gene promoters and enhancers, unlike HuSH, which primarily associates with LINE-1 elements (Lewis2024Interplay).

TASOR2 does not contain a complete ART domain, which differentiates it from TASOR and affects its interactions and functions within the HuSH complexes (Suskiewicz2023Updated). The dynamic regulation of TASOR2 expression is suggested to fine-tune HuSH-mediated silencing, potentially playing a role during specific developmental stages or cellular contexts (Lewis2024Interplay).
