# ATP5F1B

## Overview
ATP5F1B is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase F1 subunit beta, a critical component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This complex is essential for cellular energy production, as it catalyzes the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate during oxidative phosphorylation. The ATP synthase F1 subunit beta is categorized as an enzyme subunit and plays a pivotal role in the catalytic activity of the ATP synthase complex, particularly within the F1 domain, which acts as the catalytic head. The proper function of ATP5F1B is vital for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and is involved in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and cell growth regulation (Patel2020Natural). Additionally, ATP5F1B has been implicated in clinical conditions such as dystonia and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Zhu2021Role; Tauchmannová2024Variability).

## Structure
ATP5F1B encodes the beta subunit of ATP synthase, a crucial enzyme in cellular energy production. The primary structure of ATP5F1B consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the foundation for its higher-level structures. In terms of secondary structure, ATP5F1B includes both alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of ATP5F1B results in a compact, functional unit that is essential for its role in the ATP synthase complex. 

The quaternary structure involves the assembly of ATP5F1B with other subunits to form the complete ATP synthase complex, which is vital for its enzymatic activity. This complex is responsible for synthesizing ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in ATP5F1B and may play a role in regulating its activity and interactions within the complex. These structural features and modifications are critical for the proper function of ATP synthase in energy production.

## Function
The ATP5F1B gene encodes the β subunit of the F1Fo ATP synthase complex, a critical enzyme in cellular energy production. This complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is responsible for synthesizing ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate during oxidative phosphorylation, a process essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Patel2020Natural). The F1 domain of ATP synthase, where the β subunit is a key component, acts as the catalytic head, facilitating ATP synthesis through conformational changes driven by the rotation of the c-ring in the Fo domain (Patel2020Natural).

In healthy human cells, the β subunit of ATP synthase is involved in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and regulation of cell growth and survival. It plays a role in the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which is associated with cell death pathways (Patel2020Natural). The β subunit's proper function is crucial for efficient ATP production, supporting various cellular functions and overall organismal energy homeostasis (Patel2020Natural). The regulation of ATP synthase activity, including the β subunit, is also linked to metabolic processes such as insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (Patel2020Natural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP5F1B gene, which encodes the β subunit of ATP synthase, are associated with various clinical phenotypes. Heterozygous variants such as c.1000A>C (p.Thr334Pro) and c.1445T>C (p.Val482Ala) have been linked to isolated and slowly progressive dystonia, with symptoms ranging from infancy to adolescence. These variants exhibit incomplete penetrance, as asymptomatic carriers have been identified (Tauchmannová2024Variability). The c.1000A>C variant is located at the α/β interface, while c.1445T>C is on the outer surface of the β subunit, yet both result in similar clinical presentations (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

Another variant, c.1004T>C (p.Leu335Pro), is associated with a more severe phenotype resembling Luft syndrome, characterized by hyperphagia, tachypnea, episodic hyperthermia, and failure to thrive. This variant was identified in monozygotic twins with intrauterine growth restriction and developmental delay (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

Altered expression of ATP5F1B is also implicated in cancer. High expression levels are linked to poor prognosis in colorectal cancer and uveal melanoma, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhu2021Role; Slater20231). These findings suggest ATP5F1B as a potential therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
ATP5F1B, also known as ATP synthase F1 subunit beta, is a component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, which plays a crucial role in ATP production. It interacts with other subunits within the ATP synthase complex, such as ATP5F1A (alpha subunit), to facilitate ATP synthesis. In the context of breast cancer cell metabolism, ATP5F1B has been shown to interact with Aurora kinase A (AURKA). This interaction is significant for regulating energy metabolism and cell cycle progression. The physical proximity between AURKA and ATP5F1B, as demonstrated using Förster's Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM), suggests a direct protein-protein interaction that is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP production rates (Sharma2023Auroraa; Sharma2023Aurora).

The interaction between AURKA and ATP5F1B is specific, as no significant FRET was detected between AURKA and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), indicating that ATP5F1B is a key partner in this regulatory nexus (Sharma2023Auroraa). This interaction is vital for cellular energy metabolism, and targeting the AURKA/ATP5F1A/ATP5F1B nexus could be a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment (Sharma2023Aurora).
