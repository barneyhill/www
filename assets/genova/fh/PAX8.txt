# PAX8

## Overview
PAX8 is a gene that encodes the paired box 8 (PAX8) protein, a transcription factor integral to the development and function of several organ systems, including the thyroid gland, kidneys, and the Müllerian system. The PAX8 protein is characterized by a conserved paired domain, which facilitates its DNA-binding capability, and is subject to redox regulation and post-translational modifications that influence its activity. As a transcription factor, PAX8 plays a pivotal role in regulating the expression of thyroid-specific genes, thereby contributing to thyroid hormone synthesis and organ differentiation. Mutations in the PAX8 gene are linked to congenital hypothyroidism and thyroid dysgenesis, highlighting its clinical significance in thyroid development and function (Campagnolo2007Structural; RuizLlorente2012Genomewide; Codutti2008The).

## Structure
The PAX8 protein is characterized by a conserved paired domain (Prd) that is crucial for its DNA-binding function. This domain is composed of two subdomains, PAI and RED, each featuring a helix-turn-helix motif. The PAI subdomain spans residues 1-72, while the RED subdomain covers residues 77-128 (Campagnolo2007Structural). The Prd domain's interaction with DNA involves these subdomains recognizing DNA sequences through different binding modes, with the RED subdomain being more variable among Pax proteins, contributing to specificity for various target genes (Campagnolo2007Structural).

The PAX8 protein also undergoes redox regulation, with specific cysteine residues playing a key role. Cysteines at positions 37 and 49 in the PAI subdomain and position 109 in the RED subdomain are involved in this regulation, affecting DNA binding through oxidation/reduction processes (Campagnolo2007Structural). The protein's structure includes two helix-turn-helix motifs connected by an unstructured linker region, with flexibility in the interhelical segments and the linker region, which is important for its regulatory functions (Codutti2008The).

Post-translational modifications, such as glutathionylation, influence the protein's activity, particularly in the N-terminal region, which is part of the DNA-binding site (Codutti2008The). The PAX8 protein is expressed in various tissues, including the thyroid, and plays a significant role in organ differentiation (Codutti2008The).

## Function
PAX8 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and function of the thyroid gland, kidneys, and Müllerian system. In thyroid cells, PAX8 is essential for the differentiation and maintenance of the thyroid-differentiated phenotype. It regulates the expression of thyroid-specific genes such as thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, and the sodium/iodide symporter, which are crucial for thyroid hormone synthesis (Di2003The; Nitsch2010Comparative). PAX8 operates in conjunction with other transcription factors like TTF-1 to activate transcription from thyroid-specific promoters (Zannini1992Pax8).

PAX8 is also involved in the regulation of cellular growth, senescence, and apoptosis. It influences cell survival and proliferation by modulating the expression of genes related to the cell cycle and apoptosis, such as tp53inp1, which is involved in p53-mediated apoptosis (Di2013Pax8). In the nucleus, PAX8 binds to specific DNA sequences, affecting transcriptional regulation and maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis (Thompson2020Overview).

Mutations in PAX8 can lead to congenital hypothyroidism, characterized by absent or underdeveloped thyroid glands, underscoring its importance in thyroid function and development (RuizLlorente2012Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PAX8 gene are associated with several thyroid-related disorders, primarily congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and thyroid dysgenesis (TD). These conditions often result from loss-of-function mutations that impair the gene's role in thyroid development. PAX8 mutations can lead to a range of thyroid gland abnormalities, including hypoplasia, ectopy, and agenesis, which are characterized by underdeveloped or improperly located thyroid tissue (Li2020Genetic; Montanelli2010Genetics). 

The transmission of PAX8 mutations is typically autosomal dominant, and affected individuals are usually heterozygous. However, there is significant phenotypic variability, even within the same family, suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors may influence the clinical presentation (Vilain2001Autosomal; Montanelli2010Genetics). 

Specific mutations, such as R52P and C57Y, have been identified in familial cases of early-onset non-autoimmune hypothyroidism, indicating a dominantly inherited pattern (Al2007Screening; Vilain2001Autosomal). Additionally, novel mutations like Q40P and R133W have been linked to variable expressivity, with some carriers exhibiting mild or subclinical hypothyroidism (Congdon2001A; Vincenzi2014Identification). 

Overall, PAX8 mutations disrupt the gene's transcriptional activity, affecting thyroid-specific gene expression and leading to thyroid dysgenesis and hypothyroidism (IwahashiOdano2020Congenital; Qian2019Novel).

## Interactions
PAX8 is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in thyroid-specific gene expression. PAX8 interacts with the thyroid-specific transcription factor TTF-1, and together they synergistically activate transcription of thyroid-specific genes such as thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroperoxidase (TPO) (Di2003The). This interaction is direct, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST-Pax8 fusion protein binding assays (Di2003The).

PAX8 also interacts with the WW domain binding protein WBP-2, which acts as an adaptor molecule rather than a transcriptional co-activator. This interaction occurs through a novel protein-interacting domain in the C-terminal portion of PAX8, despite PAX8 lacking a WW domain (NITSCH2004WBP2).

In addition, PAX8 is involved in complex formation with other transcription factors such as Sp1 and CTCF, which modulate its transcriptional activity. These interactions have been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and are significant for the regulation of genes like the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) (RuizLlorente2012Genomewide). PAX8's interaction with PIASy, a SUMO E3 ligase, enhances its sumoylation, which is crucial for its protein stability (de2008Pax8).
