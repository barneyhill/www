# LHFPL3

## Overview
LHFPL3 is a gene that encodes the protein LHFPL tetraspan subfamily member 3, which is part of the tetraspanin family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role in facilitating various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. The LHFPL3 protein is implicated in several biological pathways, particularly those related to cancer and neurological disorders. It has been associated with the regulation of cellular metabolism and cancer signaling pathways, especially in metastatic tissues. Additionally, LHFPL3 is involved in synaptic function and cellular communication, with alterations in its expression linked to conditions such as hearing loss and neurological disorders. The gene's clinical significance is further underscored by its involvement in specific medical conditions, such as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors and Crohn's disease, where it plays a role in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and cellular polarity (Sosnovski2023Reduced; Chen2022Case; MartínezVargas2023Main).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LHFPL3 gene have been implicated in various medical conditions. In the context of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNT), a novel fusion involving LHFPL3 and NTRK2 has been identified. This fusion retains the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK2, potentially leading to aberrant activation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, which is rare in glioneuronal tumors (Chen2022Case). 

Alterations in LHFPL3 expression have also been associated with hearing loss and neurological disorders, as the gene is involved in synaptic function and cellular communication. Disruptions in these processes can impact neural and sensory systems, although specific details on these conditions are not extensively covered in the provided context.

In Crohn's disease, the long non-coding RNA LHFPL3-AS2, associated with LHFPL3, shows reduced expression, which is linked to altered epithelial polarity and proliferation. This reduction contributes to ileal ulceration in Crohn's disease, highlighting the clinical significance of LHFPL3-AS2 in maintaining epithelial homeostasis (Sosnovski2023Reduced). The downregulation of LHFPL3-AS2 affects gene expression related to cellular polarity and proliferation, further implicating its role in disease pathogenesis (Sosnovski2023Reduced).

## Interactions
LHFPL3, a member of the tetraspanin family, is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. In the context of breast cancer, LHFPL3 has been identified as a gene with high mutual information in the gene network of first metastasis in lymph nodes. It is involved in several interactions with other proteins, such as P2RX7, EFNB2, PLK1, and CDC20B, among others. These interactions suggest that LHFPL3 may play a role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and cancer signaling pathways, particularly in metastatic tissues where there is increased activity in protein translation regulation and transport activity (MartínezVargas2023Main).

In glioma, LHFPL3 has been identified as one of the differentially methylated genes that may serve as a prognostic factor. The methylation of LHFPL3, along with other genes, is associated with neuron differentiation functions, indicating its potential involvement in glioma tumorigenesis (Wei2020Prognostic). However, specific physical interactions of LHFPL3 with other proteins or nucleic acids in glioma or other contexts are not detailed in the available sources.
