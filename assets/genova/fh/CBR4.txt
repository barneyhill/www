# CBR4

## Overview
CBR4, or carbonyl reductase 4, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically within the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) pathway. The protein product of CBR4 is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family and functions as a component of the heterotetrameric 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase complex, known as HsKAR. This complex, formed with HSD17B8, is essential for the reduction of fatty acyl CoA substrates, highlighting its role in fatty acid synthesis. CBR4 is characterized by its NADPH-dependent reductase activity, targeting specific carbonyl compounds such as ortho- and para-quinones, while exhibiting low catalytic efficiency for others like menadione. The gene is located on chromosome 4 and encodes a 237-amino acid protein, distinct in its mitochondrial localization and functional specificity (Venkatesan2014Insights; Ebert2010Regulation).

## Structure
The CBR4 protein is a component of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway, functioning as part of the heterotetrameric 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (HsKAR) complex. This complex is composed of two subunits: CBR4 and HSD17B8. CBR4 is the primary catalytic component, responsible for NADPH-dependent reduction activities (Venkatesan2014Insights). 

The quaternary structure of CBR4 involves its assembly into a heterotetramer with HSD17B8, forming a stable a2b2-tetramer. This structure is stabilized by interactions such as anti-parallel beta-strands and water-mediated hydrogen bonds, contributing to an extended continuous beta-sheet (Venkatesan2014Insights). The tertiary structure of CBR4 features a central parallel beta-sheet sandwiched between helices, a common motif in the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family (Venkatesan2014Insights).

CBR4 contains specific residues crucial for its function, including bLys169, which is key for acyl carrier protein (ACP) recognition. Mutations at this site can disrupt ACP binding and impair enzyme function (Venkatesan2014Insights). The protein also exhibits selective cofactor binding, with NADP+ binding to CBR4 subunits, facilitated by residues such as bArg12 and bArg34 (Venkatesan2014Insights).

## Function
CBR4 (carbonyl reductase 4) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the reduction of carbonyl compounds, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism. It is located on chromosome 4 and encodes a 237-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 25,301 Da. CBR4 is distinct from other carbonyl reductases due to its low sequence identity and unique subcellular localization as a tetrameric protein in the mitochondrial matrix (Ebert2010Regulation).

CBR4 exhibits NADPH-dependent reductase activity, primarily targeting ortho- and para-quinones, such as 9,10-phenanthrenequinone and 1,4-benzoquinone. However, it shows low catalytic efficiency for menadione and does not reduce DAUN, distinguishing it from CBR1 and CBR3 (Ebert2010Regulation). CBR4 is considered a quinone reductase due to its inability to reduce other carbonyl compounds like aromatic and aliphatic ketones, aldehydes, sugars, and ketosteroids (Ebert2010Regulation).

Recently, CBR4 has been identified as part of the human mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway, forming a heterotetrameric complex with 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 8 (17β-HSD8). This complex is essential for the reduction of fatty acyl CoA substrates, indicating a significant role in fatty acid synthesis rather than in the reduction of exogenous quinones (Ebert2010Regulation).

## Interactions
CBR4 (carbonyl reductase 4) is known to physically interact with HSD17B8 to form a heterotetrameric complex, which is crucial for mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS). This complex, known as HsKAR, consists of two CBR4 and two HSD17B8 subunits, forming a stable and functional assembly that is more soluble than their homotetrameric forms (Chen200917β‐Hydroxysteroid; Venkatesan2014Insights). The interaction between CBR4 and HSD17B8 is essential for the enzymatic activity of the complex, with CBR4 serving as the catalytic and acyl carrier protein (ACP)-binding component, while HSD17B8 may provide structural support (Venkatesan2014Insights).

The CBR4 subunit specifically binds NADPH, which is necessary for its catalytic function in reducing 3-ketoacyl-ACP to 3R-hydroxyacyl-ACP, a key step in the mtFAS pathway (Venkatesan2014Insights). Mutagenesis studies have shown that specific residues in CBR4 are critical for its interaction with ACP, and mutations can disrupt the function of the complex, as evidenced by yeast complementation assays (Venkatesan2014Insights). These interactions highlight the importance of CBR4 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential implications for human health (Chen200917β‐Hydroxysteroid).
