# CCDC196

## Overview
CCDC196 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain-containing protein 196, which is characterized by its structural motif known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. This protein has been implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology, where it is associated with the migratory, invasive, and metastatic behaviors of cancer cells (Zhong2020Screening). The gene's expression patterns suggest a potential role in the progression of esophageal cancer, although its precise function in this and other cancers remains to be fully elucidated (Zhong2020Screening). Beyond oncology, CCDC196 is also considered a promising target for drug development due to its expression specificity in the male reproductive tract, which could reduce the likelihood of off-target effects (Robertson2020Largescale). Further research is required to validate its clinical significance and explore its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
CCDC196, a gene encoding a coiled-coil domain-containing protein, has been implicated in various cancer-related processes. It is associated with migratory, invasive, and metastatic phenotypes of cancer cells, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression (Zhong2020Screening). Although its specific role in esophageal cancer is not fully understood, CCDC196 is one of the genes identified as differentially expressed across different esophageal cancer types, indicating its potential as a molecular target for treatment (Zhong2020Screening). However, the clinical significance of CCDC196 in esophageal cancer or other diseases has not been validated through in vivo or in vitro experiments, highlighting the need for further research to confirm its role and therapeutic potential (Zhong2020Screening).

In addition to its involvement in cancer, CCDC196 has been identified as a potential target for drug development due to its specificity to the male reproductive tract, which minimizes the risk of off-target effects in other tissues (Robertson2020Largescale). Despite these findings, the exact clinical implications of CCDC196 mutations or expression alterations remain unclear, necessitating further investigation to elucidate its role in disease pathogenesis and treatment strategies.
