# CFHR3

## Overview
The CFHR3 gene encodes the complement factor H-related protein 3 (FHR-3), which is a member of the complement system, a critical component of the innate immune response. FHR-3 is characterized by its structure comprising five short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, which are similar to those found in complement factor H (CFH) (Skerka2013Complement; Skerka2008Complement). This protein is primarily involved in modulating complement activation by interacting with components such as C3b and C3d, potentially influencing immune responses and pathogen clearance (Hellwage1999Functional; Józsi2015Factor). FHR-3 is hypothesized to act as a 'de-regulator' of the complement system, competing with CFH for binding sites, which may affect the regulation of complement activation (Pouw2016Complement). Clinically, variations in the CFHR3 gene are associated with diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and other renal pathologies, highlighting its significance in complement-mediated disease processes (Pouw2018High; Zipfel2007Deletion).

## Structure
CFHR3 is a protein composed of five short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, which are structurally similar to those found in complement factor H (CFH) (Skerka2013Complement; Skerka2008Complement). The SCRs 1-3 of CFHR3 show high amino acid identity to SCRs 6-8 of CFH, with identities of 91%, 85%, and 62%, respectively (Skerka2013Complement). SCRs 4 and 5 of CFHR3 display identities to SCRs 19 and 20 of CFH, with 64% and 37% identity, respectively (Skerka2013Complement). These domains are involved in binding to heparin, C3b, and C3d, suggesting a role in the complement pathway (Skerka2013Complement; Skerka2008Complement).

CFHR3 is detected in plasma in multiple glycosylated variants, ranging from 35 to 56 kDa, indicating post-translational modifications (Skerka2013Complement). The protein is found in several isoforms, with differences in isoelectric points, suggesting variability in post-translational modifications (AbarrateguiGarrido2009Characterization). The exact role of these modifications in CFHR3's function remains unclear, but they may influence its interaction with other components of the complement system. The protein does not have a dimerization domain, unlike some other CFHR proteins (Skerka2013Complement).

## Function
The CFHR3 gene encodes the complement factor H-related protein 3 (FHR-3), which plays a role in the regulation of the complement system, a crucial component of the immune response. FHR-3 is involved in modulating complement activation by binding to the central complement component C3b, as well as its fragment C3d, on cell surfaces (Skerka2013Complement; Hellwage1999Functional). This binding can interfere with the regulatory functions of complement factor H (FH), potentially enhancing complement activation by allowing C3b amplification to proceed (Józsi2015Factor).

FHR-3 is hypothesized to act as a 'de-regulator' of the complement system by competing with FH for binding sites, which may influence the immune response against pathogens (Pouw2016Complement). It has been shown to interact with the FH-binding protein on Neisseria meningitidis, affecting the pathogen's survival by competing with FH for binding (Medjeral‐Thomas2016The). Although FHR-3 exhibits weak cofactor activity for complement factor I, leading to the degradation of C3b, this activity is low and primarily detectable at non-physiological concentrations (Skerka2013Complement; Medjeral‐Thomas2016The). FHR-3 is primarily active in the extracellular space, influencing processes like inflammation and pathogen clearance (Józsi2015Factor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CFHR3 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The CFHR3*B allele is linked to higher levels of complement factor H-related protein 3 (FHR-3), which predisposes individuals to aHUS due to an imbalance in the local concentration of factor H and FHR-3 (Pouw2018High). The CFH(H3)-CFHR3*B-CFHR1*B haplotype is associated with increased risk of aHUS, although it may also confer protection against meningococcal disease (BernabéuHerrero2015Complement). 

Deletions involving CFHR3, such as the CFHR3-CFHR1 deletion, are also linked to aHUS. This deletion results from nonallelic homologous recombination and is found in a significant proportion of aHUS patients, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis by affecting complement regulation (Zipfel2007Deletion). 

Additionally, hybrid genes involving CFHR3, such as a CFH/CFHR3 hybrid, have been identified in familial cases of aHUS. These hybrids can impair complement regulation on cell surfaces, contributing to disease development (Francis2012A). 

CFHR3 alterations are also implicated in other renal diseases, such as C3 glomerulopathy and immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, where structural variants can lead to abnormal fusion proteins (Piras2021CFH).

## Interactions
CFHR3, a complement factor H-related protein, interacts with several components of the complement system. It binds to C3b and C3d, which are fragments of the complement component C3, and can also bind to heparin (Skerka2013Complement). CFHR3 has been shown to disrupt the interaction between C3d and complement receptor type 2 (CR2), which may affect C3d-mediated signaling in B cells (Hannan2016Mapping). This interaction suggests a potential role in modulating immune responses.

CFHR3 exhibits factor I-cofactor activity for C3b, although this activity is observed at higher concentrations than those typically found in plasma (Barnum2018Factor). It can act synergistically with complement factor H (CFH) and may compete with CFH for binding to certain self-surface markers due to the structural similarity of their short consensus repeat (SCR) domains (Skerka2013Complement; Barnum2018Factor). Despite this potential competition, the significantly lower plasma levels of CFHR3 compared to CFH may limit its competitive impact (Barnum2018Factor).

CFHR3 is detected in plasma in multiple glycosylated variants, ranging from 35 to 56 kDa, reflecting its structural diversity (Skerka2013Complement). The precise role of CFHR3 in complement activation remains unclear, but its interactions suggest a regulatory function within the complement system.
