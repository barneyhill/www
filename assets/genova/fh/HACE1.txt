# HACE1

## Overview
HACE1, or HECT domain and ankyrin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase family. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including ankyrin repeats and a catalytic HECT domain, which are essential for its function in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (Andrio2017Identification). HACE1 plays a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis by regulating processes such as Golgi membrane dynamics and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor (Daugaard2013Hace1; Tang2011The). The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including RAC1 and Rab proteins, highlight its involvement in critical cellular pathways and its potential impact on cancer progression and neurodevelopmental disorders (Düring2024Structural; Hu2024Inhibition). Mutations in the HACE1 gene have been linked to several diseases, underscoring its significance in both oncological and neurological contexts (Hariharan2018A; Slade2009Constitutional).

## Structure
HACE1 is a human protein characterized by three main domains: the amino-terminal ankyrin repeats (ANK domain), a middle region (MID domain), and the catalytic HECT domain (Andrio2017Identification). The ANK domain, located at the N-terminal, is involved in protein-protein interactions and is essential for HACE1's interaction with RAC1 (Andrio2017Identification). The MID domain, which spans residues 258-576, does not have homology to any known functional or structural domains (Andrio2017Identification). The HECT domain, spanning residues 576-909, is critical for ubiquitin transfer catalysis, with cysteine 876 being essential for this process (Andrio2017Identification).

HACE1 forms a dimeric structure in solution, which is crucial for its autoinhibition. This dimerization is mediated by the N-helix and involves hydrophobic contacts (Düring2024Structural). The dimer adopts a yin-yang-like arrangement, with the catalytic C-lobes protruding above the platforms (Düring2024Structural). The protein's quaternary structure is further stabilized by interactions between the ANK and HECT domains (Acosta2018GroupI).

HACE1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific sites such as Ser14, Thr20, and Ser385, which influence its oligomerization and activity (Düring2024Structural; Acosta2018GroupI). Splice variants of HACE1 exist, with some isoforms lacking critical N-terminal residues, potentially altering their activity and specificity (Düring2024Structural).

## Function
HACE1 is a ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating Golgi membrane dynamics and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In healthy human cells, HACE1 is targeted to the Golgi membrane through interactions with Rab proteins, particularly Rab1, and is essential for the disassembly and reassembly of the Golgi apparatus during the cell cycle. Its ubiquitin ligase activity is crucial for mitotic Golgi disassembly and postmitotic Golgi membrane fusion, processes necessary for maintaining Golgi structure and function (Tang2011The).

HACE1 also regulates ROS levels by targeting Rac1, a component of NADPH oxidase complexes, for degradation. This regulation prevents excessive ROS production, which can lead to DNA damage and contribute to tumorigenesis. In HACE1-deficient cells, increased ROS levels are observed, leading to elevated DNA damage responses and increased cell proliferation. HACE1's role in controlling ROS levels is crucial for maintaining redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress (Daugaard2013Hace1).

HACE1's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its function as a tumor suppressor, as it helps prevent abnormal cell growth and maintains cellular integrity (Daugaard2013Hace1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the HACE1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. HACE1 is recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, with its mutations linked to various cancers, including Wilms' tumor, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lymphomas. In Wilms' tumor, a pediatric kidney cancer, constitutional disruptions of HACE1, such as chromosomal translocations, have been identified as potential susceptibility factors (Slade2009Constitutional). In breast cancer, specific missense mutations in the ANK domain of HACE1 impair its ability to ubiquitylate Rac1, a GTPase involved in cell growth regulation, thereby affecting cell proliferation control (Andrio2017Identification).

HACE1 mutations are also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Loss-of-function mutations in HACE1 have been linked to a rare congenital neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delays, hypotonia, and seizures (Hariharan2018A). Additionally, biallelic pathogenic variants in HACE1 are associated with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia, a condition marked by progressive weakness and spasticity of the legs, as well as psychomotor retardation (Kovalskaia2022Previously). These findings underscore the critical role of HACE1 in both tumor suppression and neurodevelopmental processes.

## Interactions
HACE1, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the small GTPase RAC1, specifically modifying the GTP-bound form with degradative Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains, which restricts RAC1-dependent cellular functions (Düring2024Structural). HACE1 also interacts with TRIP12 in the context of esophageal cancer, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of RAC1, which may inhibit cancer progression (Hu2024Inhibition).

HACE1 is known to bind to the GTP-bound state of Rab4, a Rab-interacting protein, and colocalizes with Rab4 in the perinuclear region, likely the Golgi apparatus (Tang2011The). It also interacts with retinoic acid receptors (RARs), specifically RARβ 3, and other nuclear receptors, suggesting a regulatory role in RAR transcriptional activity (Zhao2009HACE1:).

In cardiac protection, HACE1 interacts with proteins such as Unc-45B, Hsc70, and Hsp90, which are involved in cytoskeletal organization and protein quality control, indicating its role in maintaining cytoskeletal homeostasis during stress (Zhang2014HACE1dependent). These interactions highlight HACE1's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and disease processes.
