# INO80

## Overview
The INO80 gene encodes the ATPase subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, a critical player in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. This complex is involved in essential cellular processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and replication, primarily through its ability to remodel nucleosomes and facilitate histone exchange. The INO80 protein, a member of the ATPase family, is characterized by its Snf2-like ATPase/helicase domain and helicase-SANT-associated (HSA) domain, which are vital for its ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities (Chen2011Subunit). The INO80 complex is structurally organized around a RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 AAA+ heterohexamer, which provides a scaffold for its assembly and function (Aramayo2017CryoEM). The complex's interactions with DNA and histones are crucial for its role in maintaining genomic stability and facilitating DNA repair processes, making it a significant focus of research in understanding its implications in various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders (Rhee2018Endothelial; Conaway2009The).

## Structure
The INO80 complex ATPase subunit is a key component of the human INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and transcription regulation. The INO80 protein includes several domains, such as the Snf2-like ATPase/helicase domain and the helicase-SANT-associated (HSA) domain, which are essential for its ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity (Chen2011Subunit). The HSA domain serves as a docking site for actin and actin-related proteins, facilitating the assembly of the complex (Chen2011Subunit).

Structurally, the INO80 complex is organized around a RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 AAA+ heterohexamer, which forms a core scaffold for the complex (Aramayo2017CryoEM). The RUVBL1-2 heterohexamer exhibits a pseudo 6-fold symmetry and interacts with the Ino80-I domain, Ino80-HC, and other subunits through various structural features, including the DII helical bundle and OB domains (Aramayo2017CryoEM). The Ino80-I domain is described as a spoked-wheel structure, encapsulated by the RUVBL1-2 barrel, indicating its rigid architecture (Aramayo2017CryoEM).

The INO80 complex also includes actin-related proteins Arp4, Arp5, and Arp8, as well as Ies2 and Ies6, which contribute to its structural and functional integrity (Chen2011Subunit). The complex's quaternary structure is characterized by its multi-subunit assembly, which is crucial for its chromatin remodeling functions (Aramayo2017CryoEM).

## Function
The INO80 gene encodes the ATPase subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a critical role in various chromosomal processes in human cells. This complex is involved in transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair by altering chromatin structure, facilitating the exchange of histone variants, and maintaining genomic stability (Udugama2011The; Conaway2009The). 

During the S-phase of the cell cycle, the human INO80 complex (hINO80) binds to chromatin at replication forks, promoting efficient DNA synthesis and progression through the S-phase. It is essential for stabilizing and restarting collapsed replication forks, thereby ensuring proper DNA replication (Hur2010Roles). The complex also plays a role in chromosome segregation during mitosis by associating with spindle microtubules, which is crucial for proper microtubule assembly and preventing aneuploidy (Hur2010Roles).

The INO80 complex is active in the nucleus and is recruited to sites of DNA damage, such as double-strand breaks, where it facilitates repair processes, including homologous recombination (Poli2017The; Conaway2009The). Its ATPase activity is central to its function, enabling nucleosome sliding and histone exchange, which are vital for overcoming chromatin barriers to DNA processing (Poli2017The; Conaway2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the INO80 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. In cardiovascular development, endothelial deletion of INO80 leads to ventricular non-compaction and congenital heart disease, as it is crucial for coronary angiogenesis and myocardial compaction (Rhee2018Endothelial). In the context of cancer, INO80 is implicated in breast cancer progression, particularly in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype, where its deletion is associated with a higher risk of cancer (Thang2023INO80). Although INO80 mutations alone may not be sufficient to induce breast cancer, they are linked to poorer outcomes in patients (Thang2023INO80).

In neural development, INO80 is essential for DNA repair in neural progenitor cells. Its deletion leads to impaired DNA repair, resulting in microcephaly due to p53-dependent apoptosis (Keil2020Symmetric). INO80 is also involved in the pathogenesis of recurrent miscarriage by regulating trophoblast migration and invasion, with decreased expression observed in affected patients (Xian2021INO80). These findings highlight the clinical significance of INO80 in various developmental and disease contexts.

## Interactions
The INO80 complex ATPase subunit, known as Ino80, is a key component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate chromatin remodeling. Ino80 engages with double-stranded DNA through conserved Swi2/Snf2 DNA binding motifs in its N- and C-lobes, binding at superhelical location (SHL)-6 on nucleosomes, which results in the unwrapping of approximately 15 base pairs of DNA from the nucleosome entry site (Eustermann2018Structural). This interaction is crucial for the disruption of DNA contacts with histones H2A and H2B, facilitating ATP-driven DNA translocation (Eustermann2018Structural).

The INO80 complex also includes the Arp5-Ies6 module, which plays a significant role in nucleosome recognition and sliding. This module grips DNA and anchors it to the histone octamer surface during translocation steps, coupling ATPase activity to nucleosome sliding (Eustermann2018Structural). The Arp5 subunit binds to H2A/H2B dimers, indicating a direct interaction with nucleic acids (Ayala2018Structure). The Rvb1/2 AAA+ ATPase hetero-hexamer serves as an assembly scaffold for the complex, acting as a stator for the motor and nucleosome gripping subunits (Eustermann2018Structural). These interactions highlight the complex's role in chromatin remodeling through its ATPase activity and interactions with nucleosomal DNA and histones.
