# PCNT

## Overview
The PCNT gene encodes the protein pericentrin, a pivotal component of the centrosome, which is integral to microtubule organization and cell cycle progression. Pericentrin is a large coiled-coil protein that localizes to the pericentriolar material (PCM) of centrosomes, where it plays a crucial role in anchoring microtubules and facilitating their assembly into the mitotic spindle during cell division (Doxsey1994Pericentrin). The protein's structure includes a conserved PCM targeting motif, known as the PACT domain, which is essential for its centrosomal localization (Kim2017OverProduction). Pericentrin interacts with various proteins, including γ-tubulin, to form a lattice structure necessary for microtubule nucleation (Dictenberg1998Pericentrin). Mutations in the PCNT gene are linked to disorders such as microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II) and Seckel syndrome, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Griffith2007Mutations; Rauch2008Mutations).

## Structure
Pericentrin (PCNT) is a large coiled-coil protein that plays a critical role in centrosome function and microtubule organization. The protein consists of 3336 amino acids and is characterized by a long central α-helical coiled-coil domain, which is flanked by non-coiled regions (Doxsey1994Pericentrin). This coiled-coil structure allows pericentrin to form elongated fibrils, with the C-terminus anchored near the centriole wall and the N-terminus extending outwardly across the pericentriolar material (PCM) zones (Sepulveda2018Cotranslational).

Pericentrin contains several distinct domains, including a conserved PCM targeting motif known as the PACT domain, which is crucial for its localization to the centrosome (Kim2017OverProduction). The protein is involved in forming a complex with γ-tubulin, organized into a novel lattice structure at the centrosome, which is essential for microtubule nucleation and organization (Dictenberg1998Pericentrin).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are common in pericentrin, contributing to its functional regulation (Doxsey1994Pericentrin). Multiple splice variants of PCNT exist, which may contribute to its functional diversity and adaptability in different cellular contexts.

## Function
PCNT, or pericentrin, is a critical protein involved in the organization and function of centrosomes in human cells. It plays a vital role in microtubule nucleation and organization, which are essential processes for proper cell division and maintaining genomic stability. Pericentrin is localized to the pericentriolar material (PCM) of centrosomes, where it helps anchor microtubules, facilitating their assembly and organization into the mitotic spindle during cell division (Doxsey1994Pericentrin).

During mitosis, PCNT is crucial for the association and conversion of centrioles to centrosomes, ensuring the proper recruitment of PCM proteins such as CEP215, CEP192, and γ-tubulin. This recruitment is necessary for the centrosomes to function effectively as spindle poles, which are essential for accurate chromosome segregation (Kim2019PCNT). The cleavage of PCNT by separase is required for centriole separation at the end of mitosis, a critical step for the centriole-to-centrosome conversion process (Kim2019PCNT).

PCNT also interacts with intraflagellar transport proteins and polycystin-2, forming a complex necessary for the assembly of primary cilia, which are important for cellular signaling and sensory functions (Jurczyk2004Pericentrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCNT gene are associated with several genetic disorders, most notably microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II) and Seckel syndrome. MOPD II is characterized by severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, skeletal dysplasia, and distinct facial features. It is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the PCNT gene, leading to centrosome abnormalities, spindle assembly issues, and impaired cell cycle progression (Liu2021A; Rauch2008Mutations). Patients with MOPD II may also experience cerebrovascular diseases, such as intracranial aneurysms, and other conditions like insulin resistance and thrombocytosis (Liu2021A; Li2015Identification).

Seckel syndrome, another condition linked to PCNT mutations, is characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, severe short stature, and marked microcephaly. It is associated with defective ATR-dependent DNA damage signaling, which is crucial for proper cell cycle progression and mitotic spindle assembly (Willems2009Molecular; Griffith2007Mutations). The mutations in PCNT result in the loss of pericentrin localization to the centrosome, affecting its interactions with structural and regulatory proteins (Griffith2007Mutations). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of PCNT in maintaining normal cellular functions and its involvement in various developmental disorders.

## Interactions
Pericentrin (PCNT) is a key component of the pericentriolar material and interacts with several proteins to facilitate its role in centrosome function and microtubule organization. It forms a complex with γ-tubulin, contributing to the formation of a novel lattice structure at the centrosome, which is crucial for microtubule nucleation (Dictenberg1998Pericentrin). PCNT also interacts with Syne-2 (Nesprin-2) in photoreceptors, which is essential for ciliogenesis and outer segment formation during retinal development (Falk2018Functional).

PCNT is involved in the recruitment of Chk1 to centrosomes, a process mediated by MCPH1, highlighting its role in centrosomal functions and mitotic entry (Tibelius2009Microcephalin). It interacts with Cdk5rap2, which is important for maintaining the neural progenitor pool during neurogenesis (Buchman2010Cdk5rap2). The interaction with Cep57 is crucial for centrosome biogenesis and the organization of the pericentriolar material during cell division (Watanabe2019The).

Pericentrin's nuclear import and export are mediated by interactions with importin α/β and Crm1, respectively, and are regulated by the Ran GTPase cycle (Liu2010Pericentrin). These interactions are essential for its nucleocytoplasmic trafficking during the cell cycle (Liu2010Pericentrin).
