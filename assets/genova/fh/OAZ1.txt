# OAZ1

## Overview
The OAZ1 gene encodes the protein ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1, which is a key regulator of polyamine metabolism in human cells. This protein functions as an antizyme, a category of proteins that modulate the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the enzyme responsible for the first step in polyamine biosynthesis. By inhibiting ODC and promoting its degradation, OAZ1 plays a critical role in maintaining polyamine homeostasis, which is essential for normal cell growth and function (Xiao2016Genome‐scale; Hyvönen2022Role). The regulation of OAZ1 itself is tightly controlled by a unique +1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism, allowing it to respond to changes in polyamine levels (Matsufuji1995Autoregulatory). Beyond its metabolic functions, OAZ1 is implicated in tumor suppression and has been studied for its potential role in cancer therapy, particularly in overcoming drug resistance (Sun2019Targeting).

## Structure
The OAZ1 protein, encoded by the OAZ1 gene, has a molecular formula of C1068H1680N316O321S9 and a molecular mass of 24.37 kDa (Kang2017Characterization). The primary structure of OAZ1 consists of 216 amino acids, with a notable +1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism required for translating a fully functional protein (Kang2017Characterization). The protein contains several conserved domains, including an OAZ domain from Gln47 to Phe218, an OAZ signature from Leu159 to Leu167, and an OAZ superfamily domain from Leu122 to Phe218 (Kang2017Characterization). These domains are crucial for the protein's molecular function and are conserved across species (Kang2017Characterization).

The secondary structure of OAZ1 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with such domains, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure would involve the overall 3D conformation of these domains, contributing to its function in polyamine regulation. OAZ1 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and stability. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context provided.

## Function
OAZ1, or ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1, plays a crucial role in regulating polyamine homeostasis in human cells. It functions primarily by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. OAZ1 binds to ODC, preventing its dimerization and activity, and facilitates its degradation by the 26S proteasome, thus reducing polyamine synthesis (Xiao2016Genome‐scale; Hyvönen2022Role). This regulation is essential for maintaining appropriate polyamine levels, which are vital for cell growth and function (Hyvönen2022Role).

OAZ1 also suppresses polyamine uptake, further controlling intracellular polyamine concentrations (Hyvönen2022Role). The synthesis of OAZ1 is regulated by polyamines through a +1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism, ensuring that OAZ1 is produced in response to elevated polyamine levels (Matsufuji1995Autoregulatory). This autoregulatory mechanism allows OAZ1 to maintain cellular polyamine homeostasis, preventing excessive accumulation that could lead to pathological conditions such as cancer (Hyvönen2022Role).

OAZ1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Its ability to regulate polyamine levels is crucial for normal cellular function and organismal health (Xiao2016Genome‐scale).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the OAZ1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), OAZ1 is identified as a tumor-suppressor gene whose expression is downregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells. The novel inhibitor S11 has been shown to upregulate OAZ1, thereby reversing cisplatin resistance, suggesting that OAZ1 plays a crucial role in mediating drug sensitivity and resistance in cancer therapy (Sun2019Targeting). Knockdown of OAZ1 in these cells decreases their sensitivity to cisplatin and increases their migration potential, further implicating OAZ1 in cancer progression and metastasis (Sun2019Targeting).

The relationship between OAZ1 and histone deacetylase (HDAC) is also clinically significant. Inhibiting HDAC increases the binding of acetylated histone H4 to OAZ1 promoter regions, enhancing OAZ1 expression and potentially reversing drug resistance (Sun2019Targeting). In NSCLC patient samples, higher OAZ1 expression correlates with lower HDAC1 expression, and this pattern is associated with better treatment response and survival outcomes, indicating that OAZ1, along with HDAC1, could serve as predictive biomarkers for treatment response in platinum-treated NSCLC (Sun2019Targeting).

## Interactions
OAZ1 (ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1) is known for its role in regulating polyamine metabolism through interactions with various proteins. It primarily interacts with ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), inhibiting its activity and targeting it for degradation via a ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway (Li2022Epithelial). This interaction is crucial for maintaining polyamine homeostasis, which is important for cellular proliferation and cancer development (Li2022Epithelial).

OAZ1 also interacts with antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), which can counteract its inhibitory effects on ODC, thereby modulating polyamine levels in cells (Li2022Epithelial). Additionally, OAZ1 has been shown to bind and mediate the degradation of several other proteins involved in cell proliferation and migration, such as Cyclin D1, Aurora-A, and Smad1 (Kang2017Effect; Li2022Epithelial). These interactions suggest a role for OAZ1 in tumor suppression by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis (Kang2017Effect).

In the context of cancer, OAZ1 has been identified as a substrate for histone deacetylase (HDAC) regulation, where HDAC inhibitors can upregulate OAZ1 expression, enhancing its tumor-suppressor functions (Sun2019Targeting). This interaction highlights the potential of targeting the HDAC/OAZ1 axis in therapeutic strategies for overcoming drug resistance in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (Sun2019Targeting).
