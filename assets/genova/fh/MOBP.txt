# MOBP

## Overview
The MOBP gene encodes the myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein, a crucial component of the central nervous system's myelin sheath. This protein is predominantly expressed in oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for myelination, and plays a significant role in the compaction and stabilization of myelin, which is essential for efficient nerve impulse transmission (Yoshikawa2001Myelinassociated; Holz1996Molecular). MOBP is a small, highly basic protein, and its various isoforms arise from alternative splicing, contributing to its diverse functional roles within the myelin sheath (Holz1996Molecular). Although MOBP is not essential for myelination, as evidenced by normal development in MOBP-deficient mice, it is implicated in the structural integrity and stability of compact myelin (Yool2002Phenotypic). The protein's interactions with the cytoskeleton and nucleic acids further suggest its involvement in cytoskeletal organization and translational control, highlighting its multifaceted role in maintaining myelin structure and function (Schäfer2016MOBP; Montague1998Cytoskeletal).

## Structure
The myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (MOBP) is a highly basic protein involved in the structure of central nervous system myelin. MOBP is characterized by its small size and basic nature, with several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. These isoforms share a common N-terminal sequence of 68 amino acids, which is predicted to contain a FYVE-like zinc-finger domain. This domain is involved in membrane interactions through hydrophobic and ionic interactions (Han2013Myelin‐specific; Raasakka2020Flexible).

The C-terminal regions of MOBP isoforms vary, with some containing proline-rich tandem repeats. These repeats are predicted to be disordered and flexible, contributing to the protein's role in myelin sheath stability (Han2013Myelin‐specific; Raasakka2020Flexible). MOBP is known to undergo limited post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation of specific serine residues, which may influence its function and interactions (Raasakka2020Flexible).

MOBP isoforms, such as MOBP81, are expressed during early myelin development and are involved in the maintenance of the myelin sheath. The protein is predominantly localized at the major dense line of myelin, suggesting a role in compact myelin structure (Han2013Myelin‐specific; Holz1996Molecular).

## Function
The myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (MOBP) plays a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of myelin sheaths in the central nervous system (CNS). It is specifically expressed in oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for myelination, and is involved in the compaction of the myelin sheath, which is essential for efficient nerve impulse transmission (Yoshikawa2001Myelinassociated; Holz1996Molecular). MOBP is a family of small, highly basic polypeptides that are the third most abundant myelin protein in the mammalian CNS, sharing similarities with myelin basic protein (MBP) (Yool2002Phenotypic).

MOBP is expressed through alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that localize differently within oligodendrocytes. These isoforms are thought to interact with phospholipids to mediate myelin sheath compaction, a process crucial for the structural integrity of myelin (Holz1996Molecular). MOBP is associated with the microtubular network, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal organization and possibly in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (Montague1998Cytoskeletal). Despite its significant role in myelin structure, MOBP is not essential for myelination, as MOBP-deficient mice develop normally, although it may affect the stability and arrangement of compact myelin (Yool2002Phenotypic).

## Clinical Significance
The MOBP gene, encoding the myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein, is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases through alterations in its expression and DNA methylation. In multiple system atrophy (MSA), MOBP expression is significantly downregulated, which is correlated with increased DNA methylation at its promoter region. This epigenetic modification may contribute to the pathogenesis of MSA by affecting myelin stability and oligodendrocyte function (Bettencourt2021MOBP; Murthy2024DNA). MOBP is also mislocalized into glial cytoplasmic inclusions in MSA, where it interacts with α-synuclein, potentially contributing to myelin dysfunction (Bettencourt2021MOBP).

In progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration, genetic variants in MOBP have been associated with increased disease risk, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Bettencourt2019White). Despite these associations, no significant correlation between DNA methylation and MOBP expression was found in PSP, suggesting different pathogenic mechanisms compared to MSA (Bettencourt2021MOBP).

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), studies have not found a significant association between the MOBP rs616147 polymorphism and disease risk or onset, indicating that MOBP may not play a major role in ALS pathogenesis (Liampas2021MOBP).

## Interactions
MOBP (myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein) is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in the structure and function of myelin in the central nervous system. MOBP shows significant colocalization with alpha-tubulin, suggesting a potential interaction with the cytoskeleton, which may contribute to the morphological differentiation of oligodendrocytes by increasing the number of cellular processes and their extensions (Schäfer2016MOBP).

MOBP is also involved in interactions with nucleic acids, particularly through the A2 response element (A2RE) in its mRNA. Fyn kinase, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, phosphorylates heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2), which binds to the A2RE region, enhancing the translation of MOBP mRNAs. This interaction suggests an A2RE-dependent translational control of MOBP by Fyn kinase (Schäfer2016MOBP).

In the context of multiple system atrophy (MSA), MOBP interacts with α-synuclein (SNCA) and HIP1 (Huntingtin Interacting Protein 1) within glial cytoplasmic inclusions. These interactions are implicated in the pathogenesis of MSA, with MOBP and HIP1 showing strong immunopositivity in these inclusions (Bettencourt2021MOBP).
