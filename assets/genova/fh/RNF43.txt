# RNF43

## Overview
RNF43 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 43, a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. This protein is integral to cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis by mediating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Frizzled (Fzd) receptors, thereby acting as a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Tsukiyama2020A; Lebensohn2022Receptor). The RNF43 protein contains a protease-associated (PA) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with R-spondin proteins, modulating its ligase activity and influencing Wnt signaling dynamics (Zebisch2013Structural; Chen2013The). Mutations in the RNF43 gene have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in tumorigenesis and as a potential therapeutic target (Seeber2022Comprehensive; Shang2023RNF43).

## Structure
RNF43 is a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling. The protein contains a protease-associated (PA) domain, which is structurally similar to that of GRAIL/RNF128, indicating an evolutionarily conserved domain architecture. This PA domain is composed of seven beta strands forming a twisted beta sheet and three peripheral alpha helices (Chen2013The). The interaction between RNF43 and R-spondin proteins, which are secreted agonists of Wnt signaling, is crucial for its function. R-spondin proteins inhibit the ligase activity of RNF43 by directly interacting with it, thereby modulating Wnt signaling (Zebisch2013Structural).

The RNF43 PA domain interacts with the beta-hairpin protrusion of RSPO1, fitting into a shallow binding groove on RNF43. This interaction is characterized by a network of hydrophilic interactions, including hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, involving conserved residues such as Arg66 and Gln71 from RSPO1 (Chen2013The). RNF43 does not exhibit dimerization in solution, even after binding to R-spondin, which contrasts with the behavior of its homolog ZNRF3 (Zebisch2013Structural).

RNF43 is subject to post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. The gene also has splice variant isoforms, potentially affecting its function and regulatory mechanisms.

## Function
RNF43 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway in healthy human cells. It functions by ubiquitinating Frizzled (Fzd) receptors, leading to their endo-lysosomal degradation, which negatively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, controlling cell proliferation, and preventing tumorigenesis (Tsukiyama2020A; Lebensohn2022Receptor). RNF43 acts as a negative feedback regulator, ensuring that Wnt signaling does not become excessive, which is crucial for processes like stem cell maintenance and embryonic development (Tsukiyama2020A).

The activity of RNF43 is regulated by phosphorylation, which is necessary for its function in promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of Wnt receptors (Tsukiyama2020A). This phosphorylation-dependent mechanism allows RNF43 to maintain the balance of Wnt signaling, preventing aberrant signaling that could lead to diseases such as cancer (Tsukiyama2020A). RNF43 is primarily active at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins, such as ZNRF3 and Dishevelled (DVL), to modulate Wnt receptor levels and signaling activity (Jiang2015Dishevelled; Lebensohn2022Receptor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNF43 gene are implicated in various cancers, including colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic, and gastric cancers. These mutations often lead to dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In colorectal cancer, RNF43 mutations are associated with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and high tumor mutational burden (TMB), and they are often found in right-sided tumors (Seeber2022Comprehensive; Shang2023RNF43). These mutations are also linked to better outcomes in BRAF mutant colorectal cancer, suggesting a specific prognostic effect (Shang2023RNF43).

In the context of metastatic colorectal cancer with the BRAF-V600E mutation, RNF43 mutations can predict responses to anti-BRAF/EGFR combinatory therapies, particularly in microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors (Elez2022RNF43). RNF43 mutations are also associated with increased sensitivity to Wnt pathway inhibitors, such as PORCN inhibitors, due to the increased cell surface abundance of FZD receptors (Yu2020The).

In a pan-cancer analysis, RNF43 alterations were found to be a protective factor in certain cancers, such as esophagogastric adenocarcinoma and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, while acting as a risk factor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Xu2023Pancancer).

## Interactions
RNF43 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with several proteins to regulate Wnt signaling. It forms complexes with ZNRF3, another E3 ubiquitin ligase, and R-spondin proteins, which are secreted agonists of Wnt signaling. These interactions are crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of Frizzled (FZD) receptors, thereby modulating Wnt signaling activity (Zebisch2013Structural; Jiang2015Dishevelled). RNF43 interacts with the Dishevelled (DVL) protein, which is necessary for the ubiquitination and degradation of FZD receptors. This interaction is mediated through a specific region in RNF43, termed the DVL-interaction region (DIR) (Jiang2015Dishevelled).

RNF43 also interacts with E-cadherin in lung adenocarcinoma, where it ubiquitinates phosphorylated E-cadherin, leading to its degradation. This process is facilitated by c-Src, which phosphorylates E-cadherin, making it a target for RNF43. The degradation of E-cadherin by RNF43 releases β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Zhang2019RNF43).

In the nucleus, RNF43 interacts with the heterodimer consisting of p54nrb and PSF, which are involved in nuclear events and tumorigenesis (Miyamoto2008Proteomic). These interactions highlight RNF43's role in both cytoplasmic and nuclear processes, influencing cellular signaling and gene expression.
