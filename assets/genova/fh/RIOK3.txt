# RIOK3

## Overview
RIOK3 is a gene that encodes the protein RIO kinase 3, a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of immune responses and cancer progression. The RIO kinase 3 protein is primarily known for its role in modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator in response to inflammatory stimuli such as TNFα. It achieves this by interacting with proteins like caspase-10, influencing the pathway's activation and cellular outcomes such as apoptosis and inflammation (Shan2009RIOK3). Additionally, RIO kinase 3 is implicated in the regulation of type I interferon signaling, particularly during viral infections, where it interacts with proteins like TRIM40, RIG-I, and MDA5 to modulate the antiviral response (Shen2021Riok3). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, where it plays a role in cell survival and migration (Zhang2024RIOK3; Kimmelman2008Genomic). These diverse functions underscore the importance of RIOK3 in both normal cellular physiology and disease states.

## Function
RIOK3 (RIO kinase 3) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and differentiation. In healthy human cells, RIOK3 acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB activation, particularly in response to TNFα stimulation. Overexpression of RIOK3 inhibits TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, while its down-regulation enhances this activation, indicating its role as a physiological inhibitor of the pathway (Shan2009RIOK3).

RIOK3 interacts with caspase-10, a relationship that is mediated by the RIO domain of RIOK3 and the death effector domains of caspase-10. This interaction suppresses caspase-10-mediated NF-κB activation by competing with RIP1 and NIK for binding to caspase-10 (Shan2009RIOK3). The kinase activity of RIOK3 is relevant to its function in NF-κB signaling, suggesting that it may influence the recruitment of NF-κB signaling molecules, thereby modulating NF-κB activation (Shan2009RIOK3). RIOK3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences protein synthesis and cellular stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RIOK3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and viral infections. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), RIOK3 is frequently amplified, promoting cancer cell migration and invasion through the activation of the small G protein Rac, suggesting its role as a putative oncogene (Kimmelman2008Genomic). Similarly, in colorectal cancer, RIOK3 is crucial for cell survival under glucose deprivation by maintaining NADPH production and redox balance through its interaction with HSP90α and IDH1. This adaptation is specific to cancer cells and is associated with poor prognosis in colon cancer patients (Zhang2024RIOK3).

In the context of viral infections, RIOK3 plays a role in modulating the immune response. During Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) infection, alternative splicing of RIOK3 mRNA leads to a diminished type I interferon response and an elevated NFκB-mediated inflammatory response, aiding viral evasion of the immune system (Bisom2023Alternative). RIOK3 also interacts with TRIM40 to facilitate the degradation of RIG-I and MDA5, negatively regulating the antiviral immune response and affecting type I interferon signaling (Shen2021Riok3). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both cancer progression and immune response modulation.

## Interactions
RIOK3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with TRIM40, RIG-I, and MDA5, facilitating TRIM40-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of RIG-I and MDA5. This interaction negatively regulates the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, reducing the antiviral response during RNA virus infections (Shen2021Riok3). RIOK3 also interacts with caspase-10, specifically the caspase-10g isoform, inhibiting TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. This interaction is mediated by the RIO domain of RIOK3 and the death effector domains of caspase-10 (Shan2009RIOK3).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, RIOK3 interacts with USP10 and FAK, forming a complex that stabilizes RIOK3 through deubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for activating the FAK pathway, promoting cancer cell invasion and migration (Qin2024USP10). RIOK3 acts as a bridge between USP10 and FAK, and its knockdown disrupts this interaction, highlighting its role in the malignant phenotype of PDAC cells (Qin2024USP10). These interactions underscore RIOK3's diverse regulatory roles in immune response and cancer progression.
