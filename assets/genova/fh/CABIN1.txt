# CABIN1

## Overview
CABIN1 is a gene that encodes the protein calcineurin binding protein 1, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, primarily through its function as an endogenous inhibitor of calcineurin, a calcium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. This protein is involved in regulating calcium signaling pathways, transcriptional repression, and chromatin remodeling, thereby influencing processes such as T-cell activation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation (Yu2012TissueSpecific; Kim2002Calpaindependent). Calcineurin binding protein 1 is a multifunctional protein that interacts with several other proteins, including transcription factors and histone deacetylases, to modulate gene expression and maintain cellular homeostasis (Rai2011Human; Jang2007Cabin1). Its involvement in disease contexts, such as inflammatory arthritis and cancer, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2017Downregulation; Yi2012Regulation).

## Structure
CABIN1, also known as calcineurin binding protein 1, is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein contains several domains that facilitate its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. Notably, CABIN1 has a calcineurin binding domain located within the amino acid residues 701-900, which inhibits calcineurin activity by blocking the dephosphorylation and nuclear import of NFAT, a transcription factor (Jang2007A). CABIN1 also contains a C-terminal calcineurin binding domain between amino acids 2117-2161 (Jang2007A).

CABIN1 is a component of the HIRA/UBN1/ASF1a histone chaperone complex, where it interacts with HIRA through its N-terminal region, which contains tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) essential for binding (Rai2011Human). This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of the complex, which is involved in chromatin regulation and gene expression (Tang2012Identification; Rai2011Human).

The protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. Multiple splice variants of CABIN1 exist, potentially leading to different functional isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
CABIN1, also known as calcineurin binding protein 1, functions as an endogenous inhibitor of calcineurin, a calcium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and T-cell activation (Yu2012TissueSpecific; Kim2002Calpaindependent). In healthy human cells, CABIN1 plays a critical role in regulating calcium signaling pathways by modulating calcineurin activity. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing inappropriate activation of calcineurin, which can lead to cell death (Kim2002Calpaindependent).

CABIN1 is active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional repression by interacting with transcription factors and histone deacetylases. This interaction affects processes such as T-cell activation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation (Yu2012TissueSpecific). During apoptosis, CABIN1 is cleaved by calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, which prevents it from inhibiting calcineurin. This cleavage is a key event in calcium-triggered cell death, highlighting CABIN1's role in apoptosis regulation (Kim2002Calpaindependent).

In the context of inflammatory arthritis, overexpression of CABIN1 in transgenic mice has been shown to reduce the severity of arthritis by suppressing synoviocyte activation and modulating immune signaling pathways (Yu2012TissueSpecific).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CABIN1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of inflammatory and cancerous conditions. In rheumatoid arthritis, overexpression of CABIN1 in transgenic mice has been shown to reduce inflammation and synovial hyperplasia, suggesting a protective role against joint damage by modulating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways (Yu2012TissueSpecific; Yi2012Regulation). This indicates potential therapeutic implications for CABIN1 in managing rheumatoid arthritis.

In multiple myeloma, the downregulation of microRNAs miR-15a and miR-16 leads to increased expression of CABIN1, which promotes tumor proliferation. These microRNAs normally target CABIN1 mRNA, and their reduced levels in multiple myeloma specimens correlate with higher CABIN1 expression, contributing to cancer progression (Zhang2017Downregulation).

In chronic kidney disease, increased expression of CABIN1 in podocytes has been associated with podocyte damage and proteinuria. CABIN1 interacts with p53, and its upregulation in nephrectomized rats suggests a role in regulating p53 activity, potentially contributing to kidney disease pathology (Wen2015Effect). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CABIN1 expression alterations in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CABIN1, also known as calcineurin binding protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It acts as a negative regulator of p53 by interacting with ATM and CHK2, two DNA damage checkpoint kinases. CABIN1 is phosphorylated by these kinases, which enhances its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, allowing p53 activation upon DNA damage (Choi2013Phosphorylation).

CABIN1 is also a component of the HIRA/UBN1/ASF1a histone H3.3 chaperone complex, interacting with HIRA and UBN1. This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of the complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation (Rai2011Human).

In T-cell activation, CABIN1 functions as a transcriptional repressor of the MEF2 transcription factor. It recruits histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 to mediate transcriptional repression. The interaction with SUV39H1 is calcium-dependent and enhances CABIN1's repressive potential on MEF2 activity (Jang2007Cabin1).

CABIN1 also interacts with calmodulin and 14-3-3 proteins, particularly in response to calcium signaling, which influences its nuclear export and dissociation from MEF2 (Pan2005Calmodulindependent). These interactions highlight CABIN1's role in regulating transcription and cellular responses to stress and signaling.
