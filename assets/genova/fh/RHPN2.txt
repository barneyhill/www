# RHPN2

## Overview
RHPN2 is a gene that encodes the protein rhophilin Rho GTPase binding protein 2, which is a member of the rhophilin family of Rho-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal remodeling, cell migration, and intracellular trafficking. It contains several functional domains, such as the N-terminal HR-1 domain for Rho GTPase binding, a central Bro1-like domain for endosomal recruitment, and a C-terminal PDZ domain for protein-protein interactions (Xiao2021Rhophilin2). RHPN2 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it influences pathways such as JAK2/STAT3 signaling and c-Myc stabilization (RHPN2; Yu2020&lt; Xiao2021Rhophilin2; p&gt). The gene's expression levels and interactions with microRNAs, such as miR-205, further underscore its clinical significance in cancer biology (Jiang2019Human).

## Structure
The RHPN2 protein, encoded by the RHPN2 gene, is a member of the rhophilin family of rho-binding proteins. It contains several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal HR-1 domain is responsible for binding to Rho GTPase, which is crucial for its role in actin cytoskeleton regulation and vesicular trafficking (Xiao2021Rhophilin2). The central Bro1-like domain is essential for the recruitment of RHPN2 to the late endosome, indicating its involvement in intracellular trafficking processes (Xiao2021Rhophilin2). The C-terminal PDZ domain facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as KRT18, highlighting its role in protein-protein interactions (Xiao2021Rhophilin2).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of RHPN2 are not provided, the presence of these domains suggests a complex structure that supports its functional diversity. The protein's ability to stabilize c-Myc protein and regulate glutamine synthetase expression further underscores its significance in cellular processes, particularly in the context of lung adenocarcinoma (Xiao2021Rhophilin2). Information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms is not available in the provided context.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RHPN2 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In ovarian cancer, RHPN2 is overexpressed, and this upregulation is associated with a poor prognosis. The gene promotes malignant behaviors in ovarian cancer cells by activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and migration (RHPN2; Yu2020&lt; p&gt). In hepatocellular carcinoma, RHPN2 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis, and its downregulation reduces cancer cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Yuan2020Overexpression).

In lung adenocarcinoma, RHPN2 is highly expressed and associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival. It is necessary for the proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells and confers resistance to glutamine deprivation by stabilizing c-Myc protein, which upregulates glutamine synthetase (Xiao2021Rhophilin2). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, high RHPN2 expression correlates with lower overall survival rates, and its inhibition reduces cell proliferation and increases apoptosis (Bo2020Overexpression).

RHPN2 is also a target of miR-205 in prostate cancer, where its suppression by miR-205-containing exosomes from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells impedes cancer progression (Jiang2019Human).

## Interactions
RHPN2, a member of the rhophilin family of Rho-binding proteins, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It contains several protein-interacting domains, including an N-terminal HR-1 domain that binds to Rho GTPase, a central Bro1-like domain for recruitment to the late endosome, and a C-terminal PDZ domain that mediates interactions with other proteins such as KRT18 (Xiao2021Rhophilin2). These interactions suggest a role in cytoskeletal remodeling, cell migration, and invasion.

In lung adenocarcinoma, RHPN2 stabilizes the c-Myc protein by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser62, which increases the expression of c-Myc target glutamine synthetase (GS) (Xiao2021Rhophilin2). In ovarian cancer, RHPN2 is involved in activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting JAK2 phosphorylation and STAT3 activation, although no direct protein interactions with components of this pathway have been reported (RHPN2; Yu2020&lt; p&gt).

In prostate cancer, RHPN2 is targeted by miR-205, a microRNA that binds to the 3'UTR of RHPN2, leading to decreased expression of RHPN2 mRNA and protein (Jiang2019Human). This interaction is significant in modulating cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration.
