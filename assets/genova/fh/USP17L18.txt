# USP17L18

## Overview
USP17L18 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 18, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme family. These enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thus rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The USP17L18 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. Its activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper functioning of biological pathways. Dysregulation of deubiquitinating enzymes like USP17L18 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
