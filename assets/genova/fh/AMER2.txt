# AMER2

## Overview
The AMER2 gene, also known as FAM123A, encodes the APC membrane recruitment protein 2, which is a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This protein is part of the WTX/AMER gene family, which includes AMER1 and AMER3, and is characterized by its ability to recruit the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein to the cell membrane. Unlike its family member AMER1, AMER2 does not interact with β-catenin but plays a significant role in the regulation of β-catenin levels through its interactions with the APC protein. The AMER2 protein is linked to the plasma membrane via its N-terminal domain, which interacts with phosphoinositides, highlighting its role as a membrane-associated signaling molecule. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different protein variants that may have distinct functional implications. AMER2's involvement in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration underscores its importance in development and disease, particularly in the context of cancer and other developmental disorders (Boutet2010The; Brauburger2013Adenomatous; Pfister2012Amer2).

## Structure
The human gene AMER2, also known as FAM123A, encodes a protein that is part of the WTX/AMER gene family, which includes AMER1 and AMER3. The AMER2 protein is characterized by six conserved sequence blocks, named B1 to B6, with the B2 block partially overlapping with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) similar to that found in AMER1 (Boutet2010The). The gene is encoded by a single exon, but alternative splicing within this exon can lead to different protein variants, specifically resulting in an in-frame deletion of amino acids in the N-terminal region (Boutet2010The).

AMER2 interacts with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein through conserved APC-binding regions, which are crucial for its role in the Wnt signaling pathway. Unlike AMER1, AMER2 does not interact with β-catenin but shares the ability to recruit APC to the membrane, suggesting a conserved function within the gene family (Boutet2010The; Brauburger2013Adenomatous). The protein is linked to the plasma membrane via its N-terminal domain, which interacts with PtdIns(4,5)P2, a phosphoinositide (Brauburger2013Adenomatous). The presence of these domains and interactions highlights the structural and functional roles of AMER2 in cellular signaling processes.

## Function
AMER2, also known as APC membrane recruitment protein 2, is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Although AMER2 does not share the ability to inhibit β-catenin activity like its family member WTX/AMER1, it plays a role in recruiting the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein to the cell membrane. This recruitment is considered one of the ancestral functions of the Amer gene family, suggesting a conserved role in the regulation of β-catenin levels (Boutet2010The).

AMER2 is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it influences cellular processes and development. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different protein variants, which may have functional implications in the regulation of signaling pathways (Boutet2010The). The exact role of AMER2 in embryogenesis and development remains to be fully elucidated, but its interaction with APC suggests it may have significant roles in these processes (Boutet2010The). Further functional studies are needed to determine the precise activities and organismal outcomes associated with AMER2 in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the AMER2 gene, which plays a role in the Wnt signaling pathway, have been implicated in various cancers. The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, and disruptions in this pathway can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and division, contributing to tumorigenesis. Alterations in AMER2 expression or its interactions may therefore be linked to the development of cancerous cells, as these changes can affect the normal regulatory mechanisms that prevent excessive cell proliferation.

In addition to its role in cancer, changes in AMER2 expression or function could potentially contribute to other developmental disorders. The precise mechanisms by which AMER2 mutations or dysregulation lead to these conditions are not fully understood, but they likely involve disruptions in the normal signaling pathways that govern cell growth and differentiation. As research continues, a clearer understanding of the specific diseases associated with AMER2 alterations may emerge, highlighting the importance of this gene in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing disease.

## Interactions
AMER2 (APC membrane recruitment protein 2) is involved in several interactions within the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It interacts with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein through its APC-binding domains A1 and A2, which bind to the Armadillo repeat domain of APC. This interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, where AMER2 binds to APC but not to a mutant form of APC that disrupts this interaction (Pfister2012Amer2). AMER2 recruits APC to the plasma membrane, a process dependent on the presence of the APC-binding domain A1 (Pfister2012Amer2).

AMER2 also associates with key components of the β-catenin destruction complex, such as β-catenin, axin, and conductin, via APC. This suggests its involvement in β-catenin degradation (Pfister2012Amer2). The subcellular distribution of AMER2 shows that its full-size form and an N-terminal fragment are associated with the plasma membrane, while a C-terminal fragment is found in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The membrane association is mediated by N-terminal lysine clusters, which bind to phosphatidylinositol phosphates, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Pfister2012Amer2). These interactions position AMER2 as a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, influencing the expression of Wnt target genes and cytosolic β-catenin levels (Pfister2012Amer2).
