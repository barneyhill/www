# BRK1

## Overview
BRK1 is a gene that encodes the BRICK1 protein, a vital component of the SCAR/WAVE actin nucleating complex, which is integral to the regulation of actin polymerization. The BRICK1 protein is categorized as a structural protein within the WAVE complex, where it plays a crucial role in the assembly and stabilization of the complex, facilitating actin nucleation necessary for cellular processes such as motility, shape maintenance, and signaling (Lim2018miR-181c-BRK1; Derivery2008Free). The BRICK1 protein forms homotrimers that are essential for the proper assembly of the WAVE complex, interacting with other subunits like WAVE2, ABI1, and SRA1 to promote actin-dependent processes (Lim2018miR-181c-BRK1; Derivery2008Free). Dysregulation of BRK1 expression has been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Li2014Sp1).

## Structure
The BRK1 protein, also known as BRICK1, is a component of the WAVE complex involved in actin nucleation. It is characterized by its ability to form homotrimers, which are essential precursors in the assembly of the WAVE complex (Derivery2008Free). The trimeric form of BRK1 is facilitated by a predicted coiled coil region, a structural motif that promotes trimerization and is conserved across species, highlighting its functional importance (Derivery2008Free).

BRK1's quaternary structure involves its interaction with other subunits of the WAVE complex, such as Wave2, where it binds as a single molecule rather than as a trimer, suggesting that the trimer must dissociate before incorporation into the complex (Derivery2008Free). This dissociation may occur spontaneously or require post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the available context (Derivery2008Free).

The primary structure of BRK1, its amino acid sequence, and specific domains or post-translational modifications are not detailed in the provided context. There is also no mention of splice variant isoforms for BRK1 in the context. Therefore, further structural details at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels remain unspecified.

## Function
The BRK1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the WAVE complex, which plays a significant role in actin polymerization, a process essential for various cellular functions such as cell shape, motility, and signaling. In healthy human cells, BRK1 is involved in the assembly and stability of the WAVE complex, which is crucial for actin nucleation and the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (Lim2018miR-181c-BRK1; Derivery2008Free). BRK1 exists as a homotrimer and acts as a precursor in the assembly of the functional WAVE complex, incorporating into the complex in a trimeric form (Derivery2008Free).

In T cells, BRK1 is essential for the formation of the immunological synapse and lamellipodia, both of which are actin-dependent processes. It interacts with other proteins in the WAVE complex, such as WAVE2, ABI1, and SRA1, to facilitate proper actin polymerization, which is necessary for T cell activation and spreading (Lim2018miR-181c-BRK1). The BRK1 protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it stabilizes the WAVE complex, ensuring its role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cellular processes like migration and morphogenesis (Derivery2008Free).

## Clinical Significance
BRK1, also known as BRICK1, is implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The gene is upregulated in NSCLC, and its high expression levels are associated with lymph node metastasis and poor differentiation in lung squamous cell carcinomas. This suggests that BRK1 overexpression may contribute to the aggressive behavior of certain lung cancers (Li2014Sp1). The transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) plays a crucial role in regulating BRK1 expression. Sp1 binds to a specific site in the BRK1 promoter, enhancing its transcription. Silencing Sp1 or mutating its binding site results in reduced BRK1 expression, indicating that Sp1 is a key regulator of BRK1 in NSCLC (Li2014Sp1).

While the study by Li et al. provides insights into the transcriptional regulation of BRK1 in cancer, it does not directly address the clinical significance of BRK1 gene mutations or their association with other diseases (Li2014Sp1). However, the dysregulation of BRK1 could potentially impact cell motility and morphology, contributing to cancer metastasis and possibly other conditions related to actin cytoskeleton regulation.

## Interactions
BRK1, also known as BRICK1, is a critical component of the WAVE complex, which plays a significant role in actin polymerization. BRK1 forms a tight pentameric complex with WAVE1/2/3, ABI1/2/3, SRA1, and HEM1/2. It directly interacts with WAVE, ABI, and SRA1 proteins, but not with HEM1. The assembly of the WAVE regulatory complex involves the formation of a WAVE-ABI-BRK1 heterotrimer, which binds to the SRA1-HEM1 dimer, primarily through interactions between BRK1 and SRA1 (Lim2018miR-181c-BRK1).

In Arabidopsis, BRK1 is essential for stabilizing the ARP2/3 activator SCAR2, which is crucial for actin filament nucleation. BRK1 interacts with multiple SCAR isoforms and potentially with additional WAVE-complex proteins. It plays a role in protecting the Scar/WAVE subunit from proteasome-dependent degradation, indicating its importance in maintaining the stability and function of the SCAR/WAVE complex (Djakovic2006BRICK1HSPC300; Le2006Arabidopsis).

BRK1's interactions are crucial for the stability of the WAVE2 complex in T cells, as its suppression leads to reduced expression of WAVE2, ABI1, and SRA1 proteins, highlighting its role in actin polymerization-dependent processes (Lim2018miR-181c-BRK1).
