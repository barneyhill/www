# EYS

## Overview
The EYS gene encodes the eyes shut homolog protein, a large extracellular protein crucial for the structural integrity and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and Laminin G (LamG) domains, facilitating protein-protein interactions and contributing to its role in maintaining photoreceptor architecture (Alfano2016EYS; GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). The EYS protein is involved in the organization of the connecting cilium of photoreceptors, essential for the separation of the outer and inner segments of these cells, and is implicated in Notch signaling pathways (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). Mutations in the EYS gene are associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and other retinal dystrophies, highlighting its significance in retinal health and disease (Audo2010EYS; GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting).

## Structure
The EYS gene encodes a large extracellular protein that plays a crucial role in photoreceptor cell function. The protein is characterized by a complex structure featuring multiple domains. The N-terminal region includes a signal peptide followed by epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and may participate in Notch signaling (Alfano2016EYS; GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). The C-terminal region is rich in Laminin G (LamG) domains interspersed with additional EGF-like domains, contributing to the protein's structural stability and interaction capabilities (Alfano2016EYS; GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting).

The EYS protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms with different domain compositions and structures. Isoforms 1 and 4 differ by the insertion of one exon, while isoforms 2 and 3 include the signal peptide and five EGF-like domains (Alfano2016EYS; GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). These isoforms are expressed in the retina and other tissues, potentially performing specific roles depending on the cellular context (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting).

Post-translational modifications, such as O-glycosylation, are crucial for the proper folding and secretion of the EYS protein, with defects leading to impaired function (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). The protein's structure and modifications suggest its involvement in maintaining photoreceptor structure and function through interactions with other proteins and the extracellular matrix (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting).

## Function
The EYS gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of photoreceptor cells in the human retina. The EYS protein is involved in the organization of the connecting cilium of photoreceptors, which is essential for the separation of the outer and inner segments of these cells (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). It is localized in the interphotoreceptor matrix and near the ciliary axoneme of rods and cones, indicating its role in structural maintenance and possibly in protein transport (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). The protein contains epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and Laminin G (LamG) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and may be glycosylated, contributing to proper protein folding and function (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting).

EYS is also implicated in Notch signaling, a pathway crucial for development and health, through its EGF-like domains (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). In zebrafish models, the absence of EYS leads to mislocalization of outer segment proteins and disruption of actin filaments, suggesting its role in maintaining retinal architecture and ensuring proper protein localization and transport (Lu2017Ablation). These functions are essential for photoreceptor survival and visual function, highlighting the importance of EYS in retinal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EYS gene are primarily associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP), a progressive retinal degenerative disease that leads to vision loss. This condition is characterized by night blindness, progressive constriction of the visual field, and eventual loss of central vision (Audo2010EYS; GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). EYS mutations are a significant cause of arRP in various populations, with prevalence rates ranging from 5% to 33% depending on the demographic (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). Specific mutations, such as c.9468T/A and c.6714 delT, result in premature stop codons and truncated proteins, contributing to the disease phenotype (Collin2008Identification).

The EYS gene is also implicated in other retinal conditions, including cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and macular dystrophy, although these are less common (Pierrache2019Extending). Variants in EYS have been linked to non-retinal conditions, such as exercise intolerance and statin-induced myopathy, suggesting a broader role in muscle and cardiac health (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). The variability in clinical presentations of EYS-related conditions suggests the presence of unknown modifying factors that influence disease severity and progression (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting).

## Interactions
The EYS protein is involved in several critical interactions that maintain the structural integrity of photoreceptors. It interacts with proteins such as Protocadherin23, Prominin (PROM1), and ACTIN, which are essential for the structural organization of the connecting cilium in vertebrate photoreceptors (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). EYS is known to bind to matriglycans, components of O-mannosyl glycans, through its laminin globular (LG) domains. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of EYS to the connecting cilia of photoreceptors, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to photoreceptor degeneration (Liu2020Eyes).

In zebrafish, the interaction between EYS and matriglycan is essential for photoreceptor survival, and mutations affecting this interaction result in EYS mislocalization and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration (Liu2020Eyes). The EYS protein also contains epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains that may participate in Notch signaling, a pathway important for development and health, suggesting potential interactions in signaling pathways (GarciaDelgado2021Dissecting). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of EYS in maintaining photoreceptor structure and function.
