# CYP3A43

## Overview
CYP3A43 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 43, which is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes are critical for the metabolism of a wide range of substances, including endogenous compounds and xenobiotics such as drugs and environmental toxins. The CYP3A43 protein is categorized as a monooxygenase, which facilitates the oxidation of organic substances. Although CYP3A43 is expressed in various tissues, including the prostate, liver, kidney, pancreas, and testis, its expression levels are generally lower compared to other members of the CYP3A subfamily (Gellner2001Genomic; Cauffiez2003First). The gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants, which may influence its function and expression (Gellner2001Genomic). While the specific substrates of CYP3A43 are not fully characterized, it has demonstrated activity towards testosterone, suggesting a role in steroid metabolism (Cauffiez2003First). The gene's involvement in drug metabolism and potential implications in cancer highlight its clinical significance (Wei2022Effects; Stone2005CYP3A43).

## Function
CYP3A43 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, including drugs and environmental contaminants. The gene is expressed in several tissues, with the highest expression observed in the prostate, and lower levels in the liver, kidney, pancreas, and testis (Gellner2001Genomic; Cauffiez2003First). Despite its lower expression in the liver compared to other CYP3A subfamily members, CYP3A43 can be induced by rifampicin and dexamethasone, suggesting it may have a role in drug metabolism and drug-drug interactions (Gellner2001Genomic; Cauffiez2003First).

The specific substrate specificity of CYP3A43 remains unclear, but it has shown in vitro activity toward testosterone, indicating a potential role in steroid metabolism (Cauffiez2003First). The gene undergoes alternative and aberrant splicing, resulting in multiple transcripts, which may affect the expression and function of the protein (Gellner2001Genomic). The physiological consequences of these splicing events are not fully understood, and the low expression levels in various tissues suggest a minor role in overall drug metabolism compared to other CYP3A isoforms (Krusekopf2003Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CYP3A43 gene have been associated with various cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CYP3A43 expression is negatively correlated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. Knockdown of CYP3A43 promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration, suggesting that its underexpression may contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. This effect is linked to increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, a component of the MAPK signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation and migration (Wei2022Effects).

In prostate cancer, the CYP3A43 Pro340Ala polymorphism is associated with a significantly increased risk, particularly in individuals with the Ala/Ala genotype. This risk is notably higher among African Americans and smokers. The polymorphism may decrease CYP3A43 protein activity, affecting steroid hormone metabolism and potentially contributing to cancer risk (Stone2005CYP3A43).

The CYP3A43_74_delA frameshift polymorphism is linked to poor differentiation of breast tumors, indicating a potential role in tumor aggressiveness. Carriers of this polymorphism, especially those with a heterozygous ins/del genotype, have an increased risk for high-grade tumors, although it is not associated with overall breast cancer risk (Justenhoven2010The).
