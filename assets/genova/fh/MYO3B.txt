# MYO3B

## Overview
MYO3B is a gene that encodes the protein myosin IIIB, a member of the class III myosins, which are characterized by their motor activity and kinase function. Myosin IIIB is involved in actin filament dynamics, playing a critical role in the structural integrity and function of actin-rich cellular structures such as stereocilia in the inner ear and retina. The protein is distinguished by its unique molecular structure, which includes a head domain with ATPase activity, a neck region with IQ motifs for calmodulin binding, and a tail domain that interacts with other proteins like Espin1 to facilitate actin bundling and stabilization (Liu2016Myosin; Katti2009Cloning). Myosin IIIB's kinase activity and potential for post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, further influence its function and localization within cells (Masters2016Myosins:). The gene's expression and interactions are also implicated in pathological conditions, such as cancer, where it may affect cell proliferation and migration (Zhang2024MYO3B).

## Structure
MYO3B, a class III myosin, is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes a head domain with ATPase activity, a neck region with IQ motifs for calmodulin binding, and a tail domain for cargo interaction (Katti2009Cloning). The head domain is highly conserved, sharing 90% identity between mouse and human MYO3B, and is responsible for its motor activity (Katti2009Cloning). The tail domain of MYO3B is shorter than that of MYO3A and lacks the THDII domain, which is crucial for independent localization to actin protrusion tips (Raval2016Impact; Merritt2012Myosin). 

MYO3B interacts with espin-1 (ESPN1) through its tail, which contains two strong binding sites for ESPN1, facilitating actin bundling and stabilization (Liu2016Myosin). This interaction is essential for MYO3B's function in stereocilia and other actin-rich structures (Merritt2012Myosin). MYO3B also exhibits kinase activity, similar to MYO3A, and may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and localization (Masters2016Myosins:). The protein exists in splice variant isoforms, which can affect its biochemical properties and tissue distribution (Katti2009Cloning).

## Function
MYO3B encodes a class III myosin protein that plays a crucial role in actin filament dynamics, particularly in the inner ear and retina. In healthy human cells, MYO3B is involved in the regulation of actin filament assembly and stability, primarily through its interaction with the actin-bundling protein Espin1. This interaction is essential for the formation and maintenance of higher-order actin bundles, which are critical for the structural integrity and function of cellular structures like stereocilia in hair cells (Liu2016Myosin).

MYO3B contains a tail homology I motif (THDI) that binds to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, facilitating the transport of Espin1 to the tips of actin bundle-based structures such as filopodia and stereocilia. This binding releases Espin1's auto-inhibition, enhancing its actin bundling activity, which is vital for the development and maintenance of stereocilia in hair cells (Liu2016Myosin). MYO3B's role in actin dynamics is distinct from other unconventional myosins, as it uses unstructured tail regions for its function rather than globular domains for cargo binding (Liu2016Myosin).

In the auditory system, MYO3B, along with its paralog MYO3A, contributes to the proper morphogenesis of cochlear hair bundles by limiting the growth of microvilli and stereocilia, ensuring normal hearing function (Lelli2016Class).

## Interactions
MYO3B interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to Espin1, an actin-bundling protein, through its tail homology I domain (THDI), which contains repeat sequences that independently bind to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1. This interaction is crucial for the cross-linking and stimulation of actin bundling activity, which is important for the development and maintenance of stereocilia in hair cells (Liu2016Myosin). The binding of MYO3B to Espin1 forms a 2:1 stoichiometric complex, enhancing Espin1's ability to bundle actin filaments into higher-order structures (Liu2016Myosin).

MYO3B also interacts with the calcium ion-RhoA/ROCK1 signaling pathway in endometrial cancer cells. Its expression is upregulated in these cells, promoting cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis. The knockdown of MYO3B reduces intracellular calcium levels and inhibits the RhoA/ROCK1 pathway, effects that can be reversed by calmodulin and RhoA agonists, indicating a calcium ion-dependent interaction (Zhang2024MYO3B). These interactions highlight MYO3B's role in both structural cellular functions and signal transduction pathways.
