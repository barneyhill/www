# C1orf43

## Overview
C1orf43, or chromosome 1 open reading frame 43, is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes a protein of the same name. The C1orf43 protein is currently categorized as an uncharacterized protein, with its specific biological functions and mechanisms not yet fully understood. Despite this, emerging research has implicated C1orf43 in various cellular processes and disease states. The gene has been associated with several pathologies, including autism spectrum disorder and various forms of cancer, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and liver carcinoma, suggesting its potential involvement in disease progression and prognosis (Bornstein2016IL10; Woo2009Identification; Laird2021Personalized). Further studies are required to elucidate the precise role of C1orf43 in these conditions and to explore its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
C1orf43 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), C1orf43 is part of a pool of genes identified in personalized perturbation profiles, suggesting its potential involvement in the disorder's molecular mechanisms (Laird2021Personalized). In the context of cancer, C1orf43 has been associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where it is part of an 11-gene signature linked to reduced overall survival, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and patient prognosis (Bornstein2016IL10). 

In liver carcinoma, C1orf43 was identified as a potential driver gene through genome-wide screening, with its copy number changes being specifically measured in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples (Woo2009Identification). Additionally, in bladder urothelial carcinoma, C1orf43 is upregulated, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Vastrad2020Screening). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of C1orf43 in various conditions, although its precise role and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to understand its contributions to these diseases and its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target.
