# IL1F10

## Overview
The IL1F10 gene encodes the protein interleukin 1 family member 10, also known as interleukin-38 (IL-38), which is a member of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of cytokines. This family is characterized by a conserved β-trefoil fold structure, which is crucial for their role in immune modulation. IL-38 is primarily involved in regulating immune responses and inflammation, functioning similarly to other IL-1 family members like IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-36Ra, which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties. The IL1F10 gene is located on chromosome 2, within a cluster of other IL-1 family genes, and exhibits a conserved exon structure typical of this family. IL-38 is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, heart, and immune organs, and plays a significant role in reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis (Martin2021IL1; Nicklin2002A).

## Structure
The IL1F10 protein, also known as interleukin 1 family member 10, is part of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of cytokines. Proteins in this family typically share a conserved β-trefoil fold, characterized by a single domain of 12 packed β-sheets. This structure is achieved with few invariable amino acid residues, allowing for extensive diversification of the coding sequences (Nicklin2002A). Although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of IL1F10 are not provided, it is suggested that IL1F10 may also possess this β-trefoil structure due to its classification within the IL-1 family (Nicklin2002A).

The IL1F10 gene is located within a cluster of IL-1 family genes on chromosome 2, which includes IL1A, IL1B, and IL1RN, among others (Nicklin2002A). The exon structure of IL1F10 is conserved across the IL-1 family, with three core exon sequences (CE1, CE2, and CE3) that align with the tertiary structure of IL-1 family proteins (Nicklin2002A). Splice variants of IL1F10 may exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions (Hiz2020Roles).

## Function
IL1F10, also known as interleukin-38 (IL-38), is a cytokine that plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and inflammation. It is part of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family and is structurally similar to IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-36Ra, which are known to negatively regulate innate immune signaling (Martin2021IL1). IL-38 is expressed in various human tissues, including the heart, placenta, fetal liver, spleen, thymus, tonsil, and skin, with the highest expression in the epidermis (Martin2021IL1).

In healthy human cells, IL-38 is constitutively expressed in keratinocytes and can be induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. It functions to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 by macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), suggesting an anti-inflammatory role (Martin2021IL1). IL-38 also antagonizes the activation of p38 and NF-κB pathways in keratinocytes, leading to reduced expression of pro-inflammatory markers (Martin2021IL1). The protein can exist in different forms, with the full-length form potentially having a pro-inflammatory role in certain contexts (Martin2021IL1). IL-38's activity in these pathways highlights its importance in maintaining immune balance and preventing excessive inflammation.

## Clinical Significance
The IL1F10 gene, also known as interleukin 1 family member 10, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its genetic variations and expression alterations. Genetic variants in IL1F10 have been associated with differential cytokine production, particularly IL-1β and IL-6, in response to Candida albicans, suggesting a role in immune response modulation (van2021Impact). These variations may contribute to susceptibility to infections and autoimmune diseases, as IL1F10 is subject to pathogen-driven selection, indicating its involvement in balancing immune responses (Fumagalli2009Parasites).

In the context of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a 3'UTR SNP in IL1F10 has been significantly associated with the disease in African American populations, highlighting ethnic-specific genetic susceptibility (Bensen2003Nucleotide). Although IL1F10 is not directly linked to specific human diseases, its genetic variations are influenced by pathogen richness, suggesting a role in the genetic predisposition to autoimmune conditions (Fumagalli2009Parasites).

Overall, IL1F10's genetic diversity and its regulatory role in cytokine production underscore its potential clinical significance in immune-related conditions, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its impact on specific diseases.

## Interactions
IL1F10, also known as interleukin-38, is a cytokine involved in modulating inflammatory responses. It is part of the interleukin-1 family and has been shown to interact with several receptors and proteins, influencing various signaling pathways. IL1F10 has a reported interaction with the IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1), suggesting a potential role in regulating IL-1α and IL-1β activities (Monnet2012Association). This interaction is characterized by low-affinity binding, indicating a possible modulatory function in inflammation (Nicklin2002A).

In vitro studies have demonstrated that IL1F10 can interact with the IL-36 receptor (IL-36R), although this interaction has not been confirmed in vivo (Martin2021IL1). IL1F10 also appears to influence the production of various cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17, by interacting with TIGIRR-2, a receptor involved in immune regulation (Martin2021IL1). These interactions suggest that IL1F10 plays a complex and context-dependent role in inflammation, with its effects varying based on cell type, stimuli, and cytokine concentration (Martin2021IL1).
