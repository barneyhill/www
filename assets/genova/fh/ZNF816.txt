# ZNF816

## Overview
ZNF816 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 816, a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and potentially influence gene expression. ZNF816 is particularly noted for its role in early embryonic development, where it is part of the EM7 module, a group of proteins with high expression during these stages (Shen2021Conserved). While the specific interactions and functions of zinc finger protein 816 remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in various biological processes, including those related to the cell cycle and immune regulation. The gene has been associated with several medical conditions, such as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder, and epilepsy, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Min2022Identification; Arenella2021Potential; Zhu2019Genomewide; Chen2015Concurrent).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF816 has been implicated in several medical conditions through studies examining its genetic variants and expression levels. In Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, ZNF816 was identified as having damaging variants in some patients, suggesting a potential role in the condition, although its specific contribution remains unclear (Chen2015Concurrent). 

In autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), ZNF816 has been associated with autistic traits, particularly 'social skills', and is thought to be involved in immune regulation and inflammatory processes (Arenella2021Potential). This association highlights the gene's potential involvement in the immune dysregulation observed in ASDs.

ZNF816 has also been linked to major depressive disorder (MDD), with studies showing differential expression in individuals with depression, suggesting a role in the condition's pathophysiology (Zhu2019Genomewide).

Additionally, ZNF816 has been identified in studies on epilepsy, where it was upregulated in patients resistant to valproate treatment, indicating a possible role in drug resistance mechanisms (Min2022Identification). These findings suggest that ZNF816 may be involved in various conditions through its influence on gene expression and immune processes.

## Interactions
ZNF816 is a zinc finger protein that is part of the KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which is known for its role in transcriptional regulation. ZNF816 is specifically highlighted as a member of the EM7 module, which is associated with biological processes related to the cell cycle during early embryonic development. This module is characterized by the high expression of young-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs, including ZNF816, during early development stages (Shen2021Conserved).

Although specific interaction partners for ZNF816 are not detailed in the available context, it is noted that ZNF816 can interact with some early development-related genes. However, the precise nature of these interactions, whether they involve direct binding to DNA or participation in multiprotein complexes, is not specified (Shen2021Conserved).

In the context of TRIM28 interactions, ZNF816 is mentioned among the zinc finger proteins associated with both wild-type and acetylation-mimic mutant TRIM28 (TRIM28-K304Q). However, specific interactions or functional roles of ZNF816 in this context are not detailed, leaving its precise role in these interactions unclear (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
