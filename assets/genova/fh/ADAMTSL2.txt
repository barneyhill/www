# ADAMTSL2

## Overview
ADAMTSL2 is a gene that encodes the ADAMTS-like 2 protein, a member of the ADAMTS superfamily, which is primarily involved in the organization and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Unlike other members of the ADAMTS family, ADAMTS-like 2 lacks enzymatic activity but plays a crucial role in microfibril assembly by interacting with fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, essential components of the ECM (Hubmacher2019Limb; Aviram2019Interactions). The protein is characterized by the presence of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) and other domains, such as a cysteine-rich domain and an N-glycan-rich module, which are critical for its structural integrity and function (Zhang2020OFucosylation; Ben‐Salem2013Novel). ADAMTS-like 2 is involved in modulating TGFβ signaling, impacting various cellular processes and tissue integrity (Aviram2019Interactions). Mutations in the ADAMTSL2 gene are linked to connective tissue disorders, including Geleophysic Dysplasia, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining ECM structure and function (Camarena2024ADAMTSL2).

## Structure
The ADAMTSL2 protein is a member of the ADAMTS superfamily and is characterized by the presence of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) and other domains such as a cysteine-rich domain and an N-glycan-rich module. It lacks the protease domain found in other ADAMTS proteins (Zhang2020OFucosylation; Ben‐Salem2013Novel). The protein structure includes a signal peptide, a TSR, a cysteine-rich domain, an N-glycan-rich module, followed by six additional TSRs, and a protease and lacunin domain (Ben‐Salem2013Novel).

Post-translational modifications play a crucial role in the function of ADAMTSL2. The TSRs are sites for O-fucosylation, C-mannosylation, and N-linked glycosylation. O-fucosylation occurs on serine or threonine residues within the consensus sequence C-X-X-(S/T)-C and is mediated by protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2). This modification is essential for the proper folding and secretion of the protein (Zhang2020OFucosylation). The glycosylation of TSRs is critical for maintaining the structural integrity and function of ADAMTSL2, with specific mutations affecting these modifications linked to diseases such as geleophysic dysplasia (Zhang2020OFucosylation).

## Function
The ADAMTSL2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ADAMTS-like family, which is involved in the organization and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Unlike other ADAMTS proteins, ADAMTSL2 lacks enzymatic activity but plays a crucial role in microfibril assembly by binding to fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, which are essential components of the ECM (Hubmacher2019Limb; Aviram2019Interactions). This binding is significant for regulating the formation and maintenance of microfibrils, impacting tissue integrity and elasticity (Bader2012A).

ADAMTSL2 is active in the extracellular space, where it interacts with other ECM proteins such as latent TGFβ-binding protein-1 (LTBP1) and lysyl oxidases (LOX). These interactions suggest a role in modulating TGFβ signaling, which is important for various cellular processes (Aviram2019Interactions). The protein is expressed in several tissues, including the lung, musculoskeletal tissues, brain, dermis, and myocardium, indicating its widespread role in maintaining ECM structure and function (Aviram2019Interactions).

In healthy human cells, ADAMTSL2 is involved in intracellular trafficking through the Golgi complex, ensuring its proper localization and secretion, which is crucial for its function in the ECM (Piccolo2019Geleophysic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADAMTSL2 gene are associated with several connective tissue disorders, most notably Geleophysic Dysplasia (GD), a rare autosomal recessive condition. GD is characterized by short stature, joint contractures, distinct facial features, and severe cardiac and respiratory complications. The severity of GD is influenced by specific mutations in the ADAMTSL2 gene, such as p.A165T and p.R61H, which affect protein secretion and lead to varying phenotypic outcomes (Camarena2024ADAMTSL2). 

In addition to GD, ADAMTSL2 mutations have been implicated in Musladin-Lueke Syndrome (MLS) in Beagle dogs, which shares phenotypic traits with GD, such as skin fibrosis and joint contractures. The MLS mutation results in the formation of non-functional disulfide-bonded dimers, affecting local regulatory roles in TGF-β sequestration or activation (Bader2010An).

ADAMTSL2 is also linked to connective tissue disorders in humans, including a variant associated with autosomal dominant connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This variant is characterized by joint hypermobility, skin fragility, and tissue extensibility (Steinle2020ADAMTSL2). These findings highlight the gene's role in maintaining tissue integrity and its involvement in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ADAMTSL2 is a secreted glycoprotein that interacts with several components of the extracellular matrix, playing a significant role in connective tissue integrity. It directly binds to fibrillin-1 (FBN1) and fibrillin-2 (FBN2), which are essential components of microfibrils. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of microfibril assembly, particularly in tendons, where ADAMTSL2 limits the levels of FBN1 microfibrils (Hubmacher2019Limb). 

ADAMTSL2 also interacts with latent TGFβ-binding protein 1 (LTBP1), which is involved in the storage and regulation of TGFβ within the extracellular matrix. This interaction suggests a role for ADAMTSL2 in modulating TGFβ signaling, potentially by affecting the deposition and activation of TGFβ complexes in the matrix (Rypdal2021The; Steinle2020ADAMTSL2). 

In cardiac fibroblasts, ADAMTSL2 has been shown to inhibit TGFβ signaling, reducing myofibroblast differentiation and altering the expression of extracellular matrix components. This effect is mediated through its interaction with fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, forming complexes that may inhibit TGFβ activation (Rypdal2021The). 

Mutations in ADAMTSL2, such as those causing Musladin-Lueke Syndrome in Beagle dogs, result in altered protein interactions, including the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers, which may impair its normal function (Bader2010An).
