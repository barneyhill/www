# LRRD1

## Overview
The LRRD1 gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeats and death domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, which are known for their role in protein-protein interactions, and a death domain, which is typically associated with apoptotic signaling pathways. The LRRD1 protein is implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis, contributing to its potential significance in cancer biology. Its interactions with other cellular proteins suggest a role in modulating signal transduction pathways, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Qiu2020aarFDC).
