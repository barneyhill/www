# CYP4Z1

## Overview
CYP4Z1 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily Z member 1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This protein is primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and is characterized as a monooxygenase, which catalyzes the oxidation of organic substances. CYP4Z1 is predominantly expressed in mammary tissue and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in the hydroxylation of fatty acids such as lauric and myristic acids (Nunna2017AntiCYP4Z1; Yan2017Efficient). The expression of CYP4Z1 is conditionally regulated by hormones, particularly in breast cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential role in mammary tissue physiology and pathology (Savas2005Conditional). The protein's overexpression in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers, underscores its clinical significance as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target (Alsaraireh2021Cytochrome; Alsaraireh2022Cytochrome).

## Structure
The human gene CYP4Z1 encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which is involved in the metabolism of various substrates, including fatty acids. The primary structure of CYP4Z1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. Key residues identified in the enzyme's active site include Asn381 and Arg487, which are crucial for substrate recognition and binding (Du2020Importance).

The secondary structure of CYP4Z1 likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of cytochrome P450 enzymes, although specific details are not provided in the available context. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, forming a heme-binding domain essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is characteristic of the cytochrome P450 family and is involved in the enzyme's catalytic function (Machalz2021Structural).

No information is available regarding the quaternary structure of CYP4Z1, such as the assembly of multiple subunits. The context does not provide details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for CYP4Z1. Homology models have been used to predict the structure and function of CYP4Z1 due to the lack of an experimentally solved structure (Du2020Importance; Machalz2021Structural).

## Function
CYP4Z1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, primarily expressed in mammary tissue. It is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, including the in-chain monohydroxylation of lauric and myristic acids, although it is unclear if these activities represent its major physiological function (Jarrar2019Molecular; Yan2017Efficient). The enzyme is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum within cells, where it participates in the oxidation of organic substances (Nunna2017AntiCYP4Z1).

CYP4Z1 expression is conditionally regulated by hormones such as dexamethasone and progesterone, particularly in breast cancer cell lines like T47-D and MCF-7. This regulation suggests a role in the physiological changes in mammary tissue during pregnancy, when levels of these hormones are elevated (Savas2005Conditional). However, its specific function in healthy human cells remains less defined, with its expression generally low or undetectable in normal tissues except for some breast samples (Savas2005Conditional).

The enzyme's activity in catalyzing hydroxylation and ether cleavage reactions has been expanded to include a variety of substrates, indicating a broader role in lipid metabolism (Yan2017Efficient). Despite these findings, the full extent of CYP4Z1's physiological roles in healthy human cells requires further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
CYP4Z1 is significantly overexpressed in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis in these diseases. In cervical cancer, CYP4Z1 is overexpressed in 55% of tumors and is linked to poor survival rates, tumor invasion, and lymph node metastasis. It serves as an independent prognostic marker, with its expression correlating with advanced disease stages and poor patient outcomes (Alsaraireh2021Cytochrome). In ovarian cancer, CYP4Z1 is expressed in 79% of cases and is associated with advanced-stage cancer, high invasion depth, and lower survival rates, making it a potential biomarker for prognosis and a target for novel therapies (Alsaraireh2022Cytochrome).

In breast cancer, CYP4Z1 overexpression is linked to increased angiogenesis and tumor growth, mediated by the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. This overexpression is associated with higher histological grades and lymph node metastasis, suggesting its role in malignancy and potential as a therapeutic target (Yu2012Increased; Alsaraireh2020Screening). The enzyme's expression is also linked to the regulation of fatty acids and 20-HETE, contributing to tumor progression (Yu2012Increased). These findings highlight CYP4Z1's clinical significance as a biomarker and potential target for cancer therapy.
