# CGB2

## Overview
The CGB2 gene encodes the chorionic gonadotropin subunit beta 2, a component of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, which plays a critical role in pregnancy. This gene is part of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin beta (LHB/CGB) gene cluster and is primarily expressed in the placenta and testis, albeit at lower levels compared to other CGB genes (Rull2007Finescale). The protein product of CGB2, although considered a pseudogene due to its low transcription levels and noncanonical splice sites, shares structural features with other glycoprotein hormones, including a cystine-knot motif that is crucial for its stability and function (Wu1994Structure). The beta subunit of hCG, which CGB2 contributes to, is essential for the maintenance of the corpus luteum and successful implantation during pregnancy (Rull2007Finescale). Despite its low expression, CGB2 may have regulatory roles, potentially influencing the expression of other genes within the reproductive system (Rull2007Finescale; Hallast2007The).

## Structure
The CGB2 gene encodes the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a glycoprotein hormone crucial for pregnancy. The beta subunit is distinct from the alpha subunit, which is common to other glycoprotein hormones like luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (Wu1994Structure).

The primary structure of the CGB2 protein includes a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its complex folding and function. The secondary structure is characterized by beta sheets and alpha helices, with the beta subunit containing a cystine-knot motif, a structural feature shared with other proteins such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) (Wu1994Structure).

The tertiary structure of the beta subunit involves a stable knot-like configuration formed by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's integrity. The quaternary structure of hCG is a heterodimer, with the beta subunit forming an extensive interface with the alpha subunit, including inter-chain beta-sheets and a unique disulfide-tethered 'arm' that embraces the alpha subunit (Wu1994Structure).

Post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation, play a significant role in the function and stability of the beta subunit. The beta subunit has N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites, which are important for its biological activity and interaction with receptors (Tegoni1999Crystal; Elliott1997Carbohydrate).

## Function
The CGB2 gene, part of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin beta (LHB/CGB) gene cluster, is involved in the production of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone crucial for pregnancy maintenance. Although CGB2 has been considered a pseudogene due to low transcription levels and noncanonical splice sites, it is transcribed in vivo and may undergo alternative splicing, suggesting potential functional roles (Bo1992Identification). 

CGB2 is expressed in various tissues, including the placenta, testis, and some non-trophoblastic tissues, albeit at low levels compared to other CGB genes (Rull2007Finescale). Its expression is notably higher in the testis, indicating a possible role in the male reproductive system (Rull2007Finescale). The gene's transcriptional activity is linked to hCG levels, which are essential for corpus luteum maintenance and implantation during pregnancy (Rull2007Finescale).

Despite the lack of a known protein product, the presence of CGB2 mRNA in various tissues suggests it may have regulatory roles, potentially affecting the expression of other genes (Rull2007Finescale; Hallast2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CGB2 gene have been linked to various reproductive conditions. In cases of recurrent miscarriage (RM), low levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may result from reduced expression of CGB genes, including CGB2. This reduction is potentially due to inadequate function of decidual cells and syncytiotrophoblasts, which are crucial for maintaining pregnancy (Rull2007Finescale). Conversely, in ectopic pregnancies (EP), CGB2 expression is up-regulated, leading to elevated serum hCG levels, which can serve as a diagnostic marker for this condition (Rull2007Finescale).

The CGB2 gene is also involved in gene conversion events within the LHB/CGB gene cluster, which can lead to genetic variations that may impact reproductive success. These gene conversion events can spread disease mutations, as seen in other genetic conditions, and may contribute to amino acid changes in duplicate genes (Hallast2005Segmental). Despite the low transcription levels of CGB1/CGB2, their potential regulatory role as transcribed pseudogenes suggests they might influence gene expression, although their exact clinical significance remains uncertain (Rull2007Finescale).
