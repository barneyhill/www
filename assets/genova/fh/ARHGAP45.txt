# ARHGAP45

## Overview
ARHGAP45 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 45, a critical regulator of cellular processes such as endothelial integrity and cell migration. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specifically for Rac1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, and plays a pivotal role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility. ARHGAP45 is involved in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer cell invasion and endothelial barrier function. Its activity is particularly significant under hypoxic conditions, where it influences the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, thereby affecting cancer cell invasiveness. The gene's involvement in diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and multiple myeloma underscores its clinical significance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (AmadoAzevedo2018The; Lee2024Hypoxia; Zhou2023Predicting).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ARHGAP45, also known as Rho GTPase activating protein 45, has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating endothelial integrity and cell migration. In the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), ARHGAP45 is associated with the regulation of endothelial barrier function, which is crucial in preventing choroidal neovascularization, a condition characterized by the leakage of fluid or blood into the retina (Zhou2023Predicting). 

In multiple myeloma (MM), ARHGAP45 is identified as a preferential dependency, suggesting its critical role in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility, which are essential for the survival and proliferation of MM cells (de2023Genomescale). 

Additionally, ARHGAP45 has been shown to influence endothelial permeability in response to thrombin, a process that can lead to increased vascular permeability and fluid leakage. This function is significant in maintaining endothelial barrier integrity, and its dysregulation may contribute to conditions such as edema and inflammation (AmadoAzevedo2018A). 

In cervical cancer, ARHGAP45 is upregulated in 3D cell culture models, indicating its potential role in enhancing immune signaling and contributing to tumor progression and immune evasion (Kumar2024Deciphering).

## Interactions
ARHGAP45, also known as HMHA1, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate endothelial integrity and cancer cell invasion. It primarily acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rac1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, which is crucial for maintaining endothelial barrier function and cell migration. ARHGAP45 interacts preferentially with Rac1 over RhoA or Cdc42, as demonstrated by FRET biosensor analysis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (AmadoAzevedo2018The).

In cancer cells, ARHGAP45 is implicated in enhancing invasiveness under hypoxic conditions by upregulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) activities. This process is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which recruits to specific regions of the HMHA1 gene, indicating a transcriptional regulation mechanism (Lee2024Hypoxia). The protein also interacts with components related to vesicular transport, such as RINT1, GOLGA2, and BICD2, suggesting a role in the regulation of MMP secretion (Lee2024Hypoxia).

ARHGAP45's interactions with Rac1 and its involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics are critical for its function in both endothelial cells and cancer cell invasion, highlighting its role in cellular motility and integrity (AmadoAzevedo2018The; Lee2024Hypoxia).
