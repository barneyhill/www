# MYD88

## Overview
MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88) is a gene that encodes the MYD88 protein, a pivotal adaptor molecule in the innate immune system. The MYD88 protein is categorized as an adaptor protein, playing a crucial role in signal transduction for most Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). It is essential for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways, which lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines necessary for immune responses (von2008Pyogenic). Structurally, MYD88 contains an N-terminal death domain and a C-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins to form complexes such as the Myddosome, crucial for propagating immune signals (Moncrieffe2020MyD88; Clabbers2021MyD88). Mutations in the MYD88 gene, particularly the L265P variant, are implicated in various hematological malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Ngo2010Oncogenically; Treon2012MYD88).

## Structure
The MYD88 protein is a crucial adaptor in the innate immune system, characterized by its distinct structural domains. It comprises an N-terminal death domain (DD) and a C-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, connected by an intermediate region (Moncrieffe2020MyD88). The death domain is known to oligomerize, forming helical structures that are integral to the architecture of the Myddosome complex, which includes interactions with IRAK4 and IRAK2 (Moncrieffe2020MyD88). The TIR domain, essential for signal transduction, forms higher-order assemblies through interactions with other TIR domains, such as those of the sorting adaptor Mal (Ohnishi2009Structural; Clabbers2021MyD88).

The secondary structure of the TIR domain includes a central 5-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by 4 α-helices (Ohnishi2009Structural). The BB loop within the TIR domain is particularly important for TIR-TIR interactions and is noted for its mobility (Ohnishi2009Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can modulate MYD88's activity, influencing its ability to oligomerize and activate downstream signaling pathways (Clabbers2021MyD88a). These structural features and modifications are critical for MYD88's role in immune signaling and its interactions within the TLR and IL-1R pathways.

## Function
The MYD88 gene encodes a critical adaptor protein involved in the signaling pathways of most Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs), which are essential for the innate immune response. In healthy human cells, MyD88 facilitates the activation of downstream signaling cascades, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways. This activation leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are crucial for the body's defense against a variety of pathogens (von2008Pyogenic).

MyD88 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a pivotal role in pathogen recognition and the initiation of immune defense mechanisms. It is involved in the signaling pathways of various TLRs, including TLR4, and is necessary for the activation of downstream signaling cascades that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Weller2012IgM+IgD+CD27+). The protein also interacts with other signaling molecules such as IRAK-4 and TIRAP, forming a complex that activates NF-κB and other transcription factors involved in immune responses (Weller2012IgM+IgD+CD27+).

In addition to its role in innate immunity, MyD88 is involved in the maintenance and function of specific B cell subsets, such as IgM+IgD+CD27+ B cells, which are important for adaptive immunity (Weller2012IgM+IgD+CD27+).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYD88 gene, particularly the L265P variant, are clinically significant in several hematological malignancies. This mutation is a gain-of-function alteration that leads to constitutive activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, promoting cell survival and proliferation. It is prevalent in the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where it is found in approximately 29% of cases and is associated with poor prognosis and survival outcomes (Visco2020Oncogenic; Ngo2010Oncogenically). The L265P mutation is also common in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, occurring in nearly 100% of cases, and is linked to higher response rates to BTK inhibitors like ibrutinib (Alcoceba2022MYD88; Treon2012MYD88).

In DLBCL, MYD88 mutations often co-occur with CD79B mutations, particularly in the MCD genetic subtype, which is associated with the worst outcomes among DLBCL subtypes (Visco2020Oncogenic). These mutations can influence treatment responses, as MYD88/CD79B double-mutant DLBCLs show sensitivity to BTK inhibitors, whereas MYD88-mutated/CD79B wild-type cases do not respond well (Visco2020Oncogenic; Dubois2017Biological). The presence of MYD88 mutations in primary central nervous system lymphoma and leg-type DLBCL further underscores their role in the pathogenesis of lymphomas arising in immune-privileged sites (Dubois2017Biological).

## Interactions
MYD88 is a central adaptor protein in the innate immune system, facilitating interactions with various proteins to propagate signaling pathways. It contains two main domains: the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain and the death domain (DD). The TIR domain of MYD88 is involved in interactions with other TIR domain-containing proteins, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs), to initiate signaling cascades. This domain is characterized by five parallel β-sheets and five α-helices, with conserved regions like the BB-loop playing a crucial role in TIR-TIR interactions (Chen2020Myeloid).

MYD88 forms the Myddosome complex by interacting with IRAK4 and IRAK2 through its death domain, which consists of six anti-parallel α-helices. This complex is essential for MYD88-dependent signaling, increasing the local concentration of IRAK4 and facilitating its activation (Chen2020Myeloid). MYD88 also interacts with the transcription factor IRF7, enhancing the activation of interferon-α promoters in a complex with TRAF6, a ubiquitin ligase (Kawai2004Interferonα).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, regulate MYD88's interactions and signaling functions. These modifications can either promote or inhibit MYD88's oligomerization and downstream signaling, impacting pathways like NF-κB activation (Chen2020Myeloid).
