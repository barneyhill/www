# RASL10B

## Overview
RASL10B is a gene that encodes the protein RAS like family 10 member B, which is part of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The RASL10B protein is implicated in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival, although its specific biological functions are not fully elucidated. Notably, RASL10B has been associated with cancer progression, particularly in colorectal and gastric cancers, where its expression and methylation status are altered (Akiyama2015Reduced; Inoue2014BRAF). The gene's role in these malignancies suggests it may serve as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Clinical Significance
RASL10B has been implicated in the progression of several types of cancer due to its role in gene methylation and expression alterations. In colorectal cancer, particularly in the right-sided colon, RASL10B is frequently methylated in sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/P), which are precursors to cancer. This methylation is associated with a loss of RASL10B expression, suggesting that its epigenetic silencing may contribute to the progression from aberrant crypt foci (ACF) to SSA/P and eventually to cancer (Inoue2014BRAF). 

In right-sided colon cancer, RASL10B is part of a prognostic model that includes other genes like EREG, ERFE, and GFI1. This model helps categorize patients into risk groups based on gene expression levels, with RASL10B expression being a significant factor in determining prognosis (Liang2018Distinguishable). 

In gastric cancer, RASL10B expression is reduced following the knockdown of the SET7/9 gene, a histone mono-methyltransferase, indicating its potential involvement in tumor-related processes (Akiyama2015Reduced). These findings suggest that alterations in RASL10B expression and methylation status are significant in the development and progression of certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.
