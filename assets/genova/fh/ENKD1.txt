# ENKD1

## Overview
ENKD1, or enkurin domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a centrosomal and ciliary microtubule-associated protein involved in critical cellular processes such as primary cilium assembly and Hedgehog signaling. The protein encoded by ENKD1 is integral to the polymerization, organization, and stabilization of microtubules, which are essential for the biogenesis and function of centrosomes and cilia (Tiryaki2021ENKD1). ENKD1 localizes to various cellular structures, including the centriole wall, pericentriolar material, and ciliary axoneme, where it interacts with multiple microtubule-associated proteins to regulate microtubule dynamics (Tiryaki2021ENKD1). Its role in maintaining ciliary structure and function underscores its importance in cellular signaling pathways, particularly the Hedgehog pathway, where it influences ciliary protein levels and signaling efficacy (Tiryaki2021ENKD1).

## Function
ENKD1, also known as enkurin domain containing 1, is a centrosomal and ciliary microtubule-associated protein that plays a crucial role in primary cilium assembly and Hedgehog signaling. It localizes to the centrosome, primary cilium, and microtubules, where it is involved in microtubule polymerization, organization, and stability (Tiryaki2021ENKD1). ENKD1 promotes microtubule polymerization and stabilization, which is essential for centrosome and cilium biogenesis and function (Tiryaki2021ENKD1). The protein localizes to the centriole wall, pericentriolar material, and ciliary axoneme, and its overexpression promotes microtubule polymerization and stability (Tiryaki2021ENKD1).

ENKD1 is essential for regulating cilium length and ciliary content. Depletion of ENKD1 results in shorter cilia and altered ciliary protein levels, such as reduced IFT88 and increased Arl13b (Tiryaki2021ENKD1). It also affects the Hedgehog signaling pathway, as its depletion leads to reduced ciliary concentration of Smoothened (Smo) and impaired transcriptional activation of Hedgehog target genes (Tiryaki2021ENKD1). ENKD1's role in microtubule dynamics and ciliary function highlights its importance in maintaining cellular structure and signaling (Tiryaki2021ENKD1).

## Interactions
ENKD1 is a centrosomal and ciliary microtubule-associated protein that plays a significant role in primary cilium assembly and Hedgehog signaling. It localizes to the centriole wall and ciliary axoneme, where it influences cilium assembly and ciliary content regulation. ENKD1 interacts with various microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), including CKAP2L, SKA3, CKAP2, CSPP1, MAP4, and NIN, suggesting that it may form complexes with these proteins to regulate microtubule dynamics (Tiryaki2021ENKD1). Notably, ENKD1's interaction with CEP162 and CSPP1 is highlighted for their roles in ciliary functions, with CEP162 mediating interactions between transition zone components and the axoneme, and CSPP1 regulating cilium length and Hedgehog signaling (Tiryaki2021ENKD1).

ENKD1's localization to the centrosome and primary cilium is mediated by distinct regions of the protein, with its axonemal localization depending on its interaction with microtubules. The N-terminal microtubule-binding fragment and the C-terminal enkurin domain mediate its centrosomal localization (Tiryaki2021ENKD1). ENKD1 also interacts with TRP channels through its enkurin domain, suggesting a potential role in ciliary signaling pathways (Tiryaki2021ENKD1).
