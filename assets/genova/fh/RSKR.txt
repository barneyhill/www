# RSKR

## Overview
The RSKR gene encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase related, a member of the kinase family involved in the regulation of various cellular processes. This protein plays a critical role in signal transduction pathways that control cell growth, proliferation, and survival. As a kinase, it functions by phosphorylating target proteins, thereby modulating their activity and influencing downstream signaling events. The activity of ribosomal protein S6 kinase related is essential for the proper functioning of the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which has been implicated in several cellular mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the precise role and regulation of RSKR and its encoded protein is crucial for elucidating its involvement in health and disease.
