# OR6K3

## Overview
The OR6K3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily K member 3, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure and are primarily involved in the detection of odorants, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system. The OR6K3 protein is responsible for the recognition and transduction of odorant signals through interaction with specific ligands, which initiates a cascade of intracellular events leading to the perception of smell. This gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the vast repertoire of olfactory receptors that enable the discrimination of a wide array of odor molecules (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The OR6K3 gene, encoding an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in several conditions through its altered expression or mutations. In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), OR6K3 is part of a group of olfactory receptors that show dysregulation in the frontal cortex of patients. This dysregulation occurs even in the absence of significant cognitive deficits or Lewy bodies, suggesting that changes in OR6K3 expression might be an early event in PD pathophysiology (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional). The study by Garcia-Esparcia et al. highlights the potential involvement of OR6K3 in PD, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

Additionally, OR6K3 has been identified as having mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The study by Lohr et al. found three mutations in OR6K3 across three patients, indicating its significance in the context of this type of lymphoma (Lohr2012Discovery). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from OR6K3 gene mutations or expression alterations beyond its involvement in PD and DLBCL are not well-documented in the available literature.
