# MRPS5

## Overview
The MRPS5 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S5, a vital component of the mitochondrial ribosome's small 28S subunit. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Cheong2020Expression; Gao2023A). As a part of the mitoribosome, MRPS5 is integral to oxidative phosphorylation and various metabolic pathways, contributing to cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Xing2020Polymorphisms; Gao2023A). Beyond its primary role in protein synthesis, MRPS5 is involved in cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and response to oxidative stress, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Cheong2020Expression).

## Function
MRPS5 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S5) is a critical component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically part of the small 28S subunit, and plays a vital role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It facilitates the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in cells (Cheong2020Expression; Gao2023A). MRPS5 is active within the mitochondria, contributing to cellular respiration and overall energy metabolism (Gao2023A).

In healthy human cells, MRPS5 is involved in oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic pathways, which are crucial for cellular energy production and response to oxidative stress (Xing2020Polymorphisms). It also plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function, as well as in the regulation of cardiac function and pathways during cardiac stress (Gao2023A). MRPS5 is essential for mitochondrial protein translation, and its deficiency can lead to disrupted mitochondrial structure, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and reduced activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes (Gao2023A).

MRPS5's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and overall cellular metabolism, highlighting its non-redundant functions in the mitoribosome complex (Cheong2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MRPS5 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of cardiac health, MRPS5 is crucial for mitochondrial protein translation and oxidative phosphorylation. Deficiency in MRPS5 can lead to significant cardiac issues, including developmental defects, pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure. This is due to impaired mitochondrial function and disrupted mitonuclear communication, which are essential for maintaining normal cardiac function and development (Gao2023A).

In neurological contexts, a specific mutation in MRPS5, V338Y, has been associated with mitochondrial misreading, leading to decreased oxygen consumption and ATP levels in brain mitochondria. This mutation results in a subtle neurological phenotype, including stress intolerance and anxiety-related behaviors, although it does not cause overt pathology (Shcherbakov2021Mitochondrial).

MRPS5 polymorphisms have also been linked to leprosy susceptibility in Chinese populations. A missense variant, rs200730619, was found to be associated with an increased risk of leprosy, suggesting a role for MRPS5 in the disease's pathogenesis, potentially through impaired energy metabolism in immune cells (Xing2020Polymorphisms).

Additionally, MRPS5 expression changes have been observed in various cancers, with upregulation in renal oncocytoma and downregulation in renal cell carcinoma, indicating a potential role in tumorigenic processes (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

## Interactions
MRPS5, a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit, engages in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial translation and cellular processes. It interacts with the mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt), as evidenced by cross-linking studies that show MRPS5's proximity to the IF3 mt binding site on the 28S subunit. This interaction suggests MRPS5's involvement in the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis (Haque2011Contacts).

MRPS5 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, indicating a potential role in p53-related pathways, which may influence oxidative stress responses and tumorigenic processes (Revathi2021Expression). This interaction was validated using GST pull-down assays and LC/MS/MS analysis, highlighting MRPS5's involvement in cellular signaling beyond its traditional role in mitochondrial translation.

In cardiac tissue, MRPS5 is involved in mitonuclear communication, where it regulates the expression of the transcription factor Klf15 through interactions with c-myc and L-phenylalanine. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cardiac function and metabolism, and its disruption can lead to cardiac defects (Gao2023A).
