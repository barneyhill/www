# CCDC25

## Overview
The CCDC25 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 25 protein, which is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including nucleotide metabolism, apoptosis, and DNA repair. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane receptor, particularly known for its role as an extracellular DNA sensor on the plasma membrane of cancer cells (Liu2020CCDC25:). CCDC25 is implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability and turnover, as well as in metabolic pathways such as the citrate cycle and fatty acid metabolism (Deng2022CCDC25). It interacts with key signaling molecules, influencing pathways like the Hippo pathway and the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling cascade, which are crucial for cellular proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (Tan2024CCDC25; Liu2020CCDC25:). The protein's involvement in disease contexts, such as cancer and pulmonary arterial hypertension, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2023Neutrophil; Sun2024Neutrophil). Despite its recognized roles, the full spectrum of CCDC25's biological functions in healthy cells remains to be elucidated (PHIMPHILA2024Serum).

## Function
The CCDC25 gene encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to nucleotide metabolism and apoptosis. It plays a significant role in the nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, particularly in deadenylation-dependent decay and RNA polyadenylation, which are essential for mRNA stability and turnover (Deng2022CCDC25). CCDC25 is also associated with helicase activity, ubiquitin-like protein-specific protease activity, and damaged DNA binding, indicating its involvement in DNA repair and genomic stability (Deng2022CCDC25).

In healthy human cells, CCDC25 is predicted to localize in the nucleus, where it participates in maintaining normal cellular functions by regulating cell cycle processes and promoting apoptosis (PHIMPHILA2024Serum). The protein is also implicated in metabolic pathways, including the citrate cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, suggesting a role in energy metabolism within the liver (Deng2022CCDC25). Despite its involvement in these processes, the precise biological function of CCDC25 in healthy cells remains not fully understood, as much of the research has focused on its role in disease contexts (PHIMPHILA2024Serum).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC25 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), CCDC25 is involved in the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) through its interaction with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This interaction activates the ILK/β-parvin/RAC1 pathway, leading to cytoskeletal remodeling and PASMC proliferation, which are key factors in PAH pathogenesis (Sun2024Neutrophil).

In primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL), deletions in the chromosome region containing CCDC25 have been observed. These deletions are associated with poor outcomes and suggest a potential role for CCDC25 in the disease, although its specific function in pPCL remains unclear (Mosca2012Genome‐wide).

CCDC25 is also involved in gastric cancer, where it acts as a receptor for NETs-DNA, promoting angiogenesis through the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. This process enhances tumor growth and progression, indicating that alterations in CCDC25 expression or function can contribute to cancer development (Yang2023Neutrophil).

## Interactions
CCDC25 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the YAP protein, a core effector of the Hippo pathway, promoting YAP phosphorylation and reducing its nuclear entry, which inhibits the activation of downstream genes. This interaction is facilitated by the binding of LATS1 to YAP, promoted by CCDC25, which acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (Tan2024CCDC25).

CCDC25 also functions as a plasma membrane-located extracellular DNA sensor on cancer cells, recognizing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-DNA. This interaction activates the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-β-parvin-RAC1-CDC42 signaling cascade, leading to cytoskeletal remodeling, migration, adhesion, and proliferation of cancer cells (Liu2020CCDC25:). The AA 21-25 domain at the extracellular N terminus of CCDC25 is essential for this recognition (Liu2020CCDC25:).

In breast cancer, CCDC25 expression is influenced by cholesterol biosynthesis and is associated with lipid rafts, where it co-localizes with caveolin-1. This suggests a lipid raft-dependent mechanism for its expression and function in promoting metastasis (Tang2022Enhanced). CCDC25's interactions with NETs-DNA and its role in signal transduction highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
