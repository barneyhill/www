# RAB33B

## Overview
RAB33B is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, RAB33B, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. This protein is primarily involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and plays a crucial role in the autophagy process, particularly in the formation of autophagosomes. RAB33B is characterized by its classical RAB GTPase folding pattern and is localized to the medial cisternae of the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in Golgi-related transport processes (Pantoom2020RAB33B; Zheng1998A). The protein interacts with the ATG16L1 complex, facilitating the recruitment of this complex to the phagophore, which is essential for autophagosome formation (Pantoom2020RAB33B). Mutations in the RAB33B gene are associated with Smith-McCort dysplasia, a rare skeletal disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Dupuis2012A; Salian2017Additional).

## Structure
The RAB33B protein is a small GTPase involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, characterized by a classical RAB GTPase folding pattern. Its primary structure consists of 229 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 25.8 kDa (Zheng1998A). The secondary structure includes a central six-strand β-sheet flanked by five α-helices (Pantoom2020RAB33B). The tertiary structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, particularly involving residues I66 and F95 of RAB33B with W194 and V191 of ATG16L1 (Pantoom2020RAB33B). 

RAB33B forms a quaternary structure through interactions with the ATG16L1 complex, adopting a 2:2 configuration with dyad symmetry (Pantoom2020RAB33B). The protein binds one molecule of GTP or GDP and one Mg2+, with the switch I, switch II, and inter-switch regions playing crucial roles in its interaction with ATG16L1 (Pantoom2020RAB33B). 

RAB33B contains a GTP-binding domain, essential for its function, and undergoes post-translational modifications such as prenylation, which aids in membrane attachment (Zheng1998A). The protein's structure allows it to recruit the ATG16L1 complex to the phagophore, crucial for autophagosome formation (Pantoom2020RAB33B).

## Function
RAB33B is a small GTPase that plays a significant role in the process of autophagy, particularly in the formation of autophagosomes. It is involved in the recruitment of the ATG16L1 complex to the phagophore, a precursor to the autophagosome, which is crucial for the lipidation of LC3 and subsequent autophagosome formation (Pantoom2020RAB33B). RAB33B translocates from the Golgi to phagophores during autophagy, driven by its interaction with ATG16L1, and this interaction is essential for the proper localization and function of autophagic components (Pantoom2020RAB33B).

RAB33B is localized to the medial cisternae of the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in Golgi-related transport processes (Zheng1998A). It interacts with Atg16L, a component of the Atg5-12/16L complex, which is essential for the elongation of isolation membranes during autophagosome formation (Itoh2008Golgiresident). The interaction between RAB33B and Atg16L is GTP-dependent and modulates autophagosome formation, indicating a regulatory role in autophagy (Itoh2008Golgiresident). This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAB33B gene are associated with Smith-McCort dysplasia (SMC), a rare autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia characterized by short trunk dwarfism, rhizomelic limb shortening, and specific radiological features. Unlike Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome (DMC), which is clinically similar, SMC does not involve intellectual disability (Dupuis2012A; Salian2017Additional). Both SMC and DMC are linked to mutations in genes involved in Golgi trafficking, with RAB33B mutations specifically implicated in SMC (Salian2017Additional).

Several pathogenic variants of RAB33B have been identified, including missense mutations such as p.K46Q and p.N148K, which affect the GTPase domain crucial for guanine nucleotide binding (Dupuis2012A; Dimori2023A). These mutations lead to reduced RAB33B protein levels, impacting the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus and resulting in altered protein glycosylation and bone resorption defects (Dimori2023A). The altered glycosylation and impaired osteoclast function contribute to the skeletal abnormalities observed in SMC (Dimori2023A). The genetic heterogeneity of SMC is highlighted by the presence of multiple RAB33B mutations, expanding the clinical and mutation profile of the gene in affected patients (Salian2017Additional).

## Interactions
RAB33B, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and plays a significant role in autophagy through its interactions with various proteins. One of its primary interactions is with ATG16L1, a component of the autophagy-related Atg5-12/16L complex. This interaction is GTP-dependent, with RAB33B showing a preference for the GTP-bound form when binding to ATG16L1 (Itoh2008Golgiresident). The RAB33B-ATG16L1 complex adopts a 2:2 configuration, where two RAB33B molecules bind independently to each helix of the ATG16L1 dimer (Pantoom2020RAB33B).

The interaction between RAB33B and ATG16L1 is crucial for the recruitment of the complex to the phagophore, facilitating autophagosome formation. This interaction involves specific hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, with key residues such as I66 and F95 in RAB33B playing significant roles (Pantoom2020RAB33B). RAB33B also interacts with the coiled-coil domain of ATG16L1, with residues 141-265 being critical for complex formation (MetjeSprink2020Crystal).

RAB33B's interaction with ATG16L1 is essential for LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation, highlighting its role in autophagy (Pantoom2020RAB33B). This interaction is unique as ATG16L1 can induce a conformational change in RAB33B from its inactive to active form without the typical nucleotide exchange (Pantoom2020RAB33B).
