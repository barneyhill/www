# SLC14A1

## Overview
The SLC14A1 gene encodes the solute carrier family 14 member 1 protein, also known as the Kidd blood group antigen, which is a urea transporter protein categorized within the transmembrane protein family. This protein, referred to as UT-B, is primarily expressed in erythrocytes and the kidney's descending vasa recta, where it facilitates the transport of urea across cell membranes, playing a critical role in nitrogen balance and osmoregulation (Sands2014Genes; Shayakul2013The). The UT-B protein is integral to the kidney's countercurrent exchange system, essential for urine concentration and water balance. Additionally, it is associated with the Kidd blood group antigen, and its absence can lead to a mild urinary concentrating defect (Shayakul2004The). Beyond its physiological roles, SLC14A1 has been implicated in various cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor in urothelial carcinoma and influencing pathways such as TGF-β and mTOR in colorectal and prostate cancers, respectively (Chan2020SLC14A1; Ma2024Down-regulation).

## Structure
The SLC14A1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the urea transporter family, specifically known as UT-B. This protein is characterized by a primary structure that includes 10 transmembrane spanning domains organized into two internal hydrophobic repeats, which are typical of membrane proteins (Shayakul2013The). The secondary structure likely involves alpha helices, which are common in transmembrane domains. The protein also features an extracellular connecting loop, intracellular amino and carboxy termini, and a single N-glycosylation site, which is a common post-translational modification (Shayakul2013The).

The tertiary structure of UT-B is suggested to involve the folding of these transmembrane helices into a functional transporter, forming a pore with a selectivity filter that is crucial for urea binding and selectivity. This structure is highly conserved among mammalian urea transporters (Shayakul2013The). The quaternary structure may involve oligomerization, as the UT-A1 isoform functions as a dimer, and similar structural organization is suggested for UT-B (Shayakul2013The).

The SLC14A1 gene produces two mRNA transcripts due to alternative polyadenylation signals, both encoding a single 45-kDa protein, which is associated with the Kidd blood group antigen (Sands2014Genes).

## Function
The SLC14A1 gene encodes the UT-B protein, a urea transporter primarily expressed in erythrocytes and the descending vasa recta of the kidney. This protein plays a crucial role in the facilitated transport of urea across cell membranes, contributing significantly to the body's nitrogen balance and osmoregulation (Sands2014Genes; Shayakul2004The). In the kidney, UT-B is involved in the countercurrent exchange system, which is essential for medullary urea accumulation and the urinary concentrating mechanism (Shayakul2013The). This process is vital for maintaining water balance and efficient urine concentration, as demonstrated by the mild urinary concentrating defect observed in individuals with the Jk null blood group, who lack functional UT-B (Shayakul2004The).

In red blood cells, UT-B is associated with the Kidd blood group antigen, and mutations in SLC14A1 can lead to the absence of this antigen, affecting urea transport (Sands2014Genes). The UT-B protein is also expressed in other tissues, including the brain and heart, where it may play roles in modulating the nitric oxide pathway and maintaining normal cardiac conduction, respectively (Shayakul2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the SLC14A1 gene, which encodes a urea transporter protein, have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In urothelial carcinoma (UC), SLC14A1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation, often due to epigenetic silencing, is associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis. This downregulation leads to the accumulation of urea and arginine, contributing to tumorigenesis by affecting metabolic pathways critical for tumor growth (Chan2020SLC14A1).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lower expression of SLC14A1 is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Overexpression of the gene in hypoxic conditions increases apoptosis and reduces cell invasion and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shi2023Role).

Genome-wide association studies have identified SLC14A1 as a susceptibility gene for urinary bladder cancer (UBC). Specific genetic variants within the gene are associated with an increased risk of UBC, supporting the hypothesis that urine production and voiding frequency can modify the risk of bladder carcinogens (Rafnar2011European).

In prostate cancer, low expression of SLC14A1 is associated with a higher likelihood of biochemical recurrence, potentially due to urea accumulation leading to apoptosis and DNA damage (Ye2022Study).

## Interactions
The SLC14A1 gene encodes a protein that interacts with several key components in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the context of cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SLC14A1 interacts with the transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TβRII). This interaction inhibits the ubiquitination of TβRII by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, thereby enhancing the stability of TβRII and amplifying the activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for modulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is significant in cancer metastasis (Zhang2024SLC14A1).

In prostate cancer, SLC14A1 is involved in the regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway. Downregulation of SLC14A1 is associated with the activation of the mTOR pathway, which is linked to increased cell proliferation and tumor progression. The gene's expression is negatively correlated with cell cycle-related genes such as CDK1 and CCNB1, suggesting that SLC14A1 may play a role in inhibiting these pathways when expressed at normal levels (Ma2024Down-regulation). These interactions highlight the gene's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
