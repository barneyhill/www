# PPP1R16A

## Overview
The PPP1R16A gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 16A, also known as MYPT3, which is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This protein plays a critical role in modulating the activity of PP1, a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Esteves2012Protein; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). PPP1R16A is characterized by structural features such as an RVXF motif for PP1C binding, ankyrin repeats for protein interactions, and a prenylation site for membrane anchoring (Casamayor2020Controlling). It is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain and kidneys, and is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and nuclear signaling pathways, particularly through its interaction with the constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) (Sueyoshi2008PPP1R16A). The protein's regulatory functions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to xenobiotic stimuli, highlighting its significance in physiological and pathological contexts.

## Structure
The PPP1R16A protein, also known as MYPT3, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and is characterized by several structural features. Its primary structure includes an RVXF motif, which is crucial for binding to PP1C, the catalytic subunit of PP1 (Casamayor2020Controlling). The protein contains ankyrin repeats in its N-terminal portion, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Casamayor2020Controlling). 

PPP1R16A can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) at serine residues in its central region. This phosphorylation disrupts internal interactions, leading to the activation of PP1C (Casamayor2020Controlling). The protein also features a prenylation consensus CAAX box site, allowing it to anchor to membranes (Casamayor2020Controlling).

In terms of quaternary structure, PPP1R16A interacts with the constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) on the cell membrane, facilitating its nuclear translocation. This interaction is enhanced by phenobarbital treatment and involves the C-terminal subdomain of PPP1R16A, which is essential for mediating this interaction (Sueyoshi2008PPP1R16A). The protein can form dimers, which is important for its function in signaling pathways (Sueyoshi2008PPP1R16A).

## Function
PPP1R16A, also known as MYPT3, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by targeting myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) to cell membranes, which is crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular structure (Casamayor2020Controlling; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). PPP1R16A is expressed in tissues such as lymph nodes, kidneys, and the brain, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological functions (Casamayor2020Controlling).

In the context of nuclear signaling, PPP1R16A interacts with the nuclear receptor constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR), facilitating its nuclear translocation. This interaction is crucial for CAR's role in regulating hepatic functions, including xenobiotic metabolism (Sueyoshi2008PPP1R16A). PPP1R16A also modulates the activity of PP1β, influencing processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

PPP1R16A's activity is primarily cytoplasmic, where it modulates PP1 activity and influences cellular signaling pathways, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Esteves2012Protein). Its regulatory functions are essential for maintaining normal cellular and physiological processes.

## Interactions
PPP1R16A, also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 16A, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. It specifically interacts with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1β (PP1β), inhibiting its activity by more than 60%. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear translocation of the constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) in response to xenobiotics like phenobarbital (PB). Mutations in PPP1R16A that affect its interaction with PP1β reduce this inhibitory effect, indicating the presence of secondary interaction sites (Sueyoshi2008PPP1R16A).

PPP1R16A also interacts with CAR, facilitating its translocation to the nucleus. This interaction is enhanced by PB treatment and involves the dimerization of PPP1R16A through its middle region, which contains protein kinase A phosphorylation sites. The interaction between PPP1R16A and CAR was confirmed using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, demonstrating close proximity between the two proteins on the cell membrane (Sueyoshi2008PPP1R16A).

These interactions highlight the role of PPP1R16A in modulating PP1β activity and CAR nuclear translocation, emphasizing its significance in cellular signaling pathways and xenobiotic metabolism (Sueyoshi2008PPP1R16A).
