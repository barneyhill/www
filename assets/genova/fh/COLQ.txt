# COLQ

## Overview
The COLQ gene encodes the collagen-like tail subunit of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a protein that plays a pivotal role in neuromuscular function by anchoring AChE to the basal lamina at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This anchoring is essential for the efficient breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby terminating synaptic transmission and ensuring proper muscle function (Ohno1998Human). The COLQ protein, also known as Collagen Q, is categorized as a structural protein due to its collagen-like domains and its role in forming the asymmetric forms of AChE. It interacts with several key proteins, including muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) and perlecan, to maintain NMJ integrity (Kawakami2011AntiMuSK; Arredondo2013COOHterminal). Mutations in the COLQ gene can lead to congenital myasthenic syndromes, highlighting its clinical significance in neuromuscular disorders (Luo2021Mechanisms).

## Structure
The COLQ protein, also known as Collagen Q, is a multidomain protein crucial for anchoring acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to the basal lamina at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The primary structure of COLQ includes a secretion signal peptide, a proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD), and a collagen domain composed of GXY triplets, interrupted by a non-collagenous motif (Ohno1998Human). The secondary structure features a triple-helical collagen domain stabilized by disulfide bonds formed by conserved cysteines (Ohno1998Human). The tertiary structure includes two heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding domains, which are implicated in anchoring the collagen domain to the basal lamina (Ohno1998Human). The COOH-terminal domain interacts with muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) and is essential for anchoring AChE to the basal lamina (Arredondo2013COOHterminal). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of COLQ with AChE into asymmetric forms, such as A12, which are crucial for NMJ function (Legay2020Collagens). Mutations in the COLQ gene can impair its interaction with MuSK and the basement membrane, affecting the anchoring of AChE at the NMJ (Arredondo2013COOHterminal).

## Function
The COLQ gene encodes the collagen-like tail subunit of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is crucial for its function at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in healthy human cells. The COLQ protein, also known as ColQ, plays a significant role in anchoring AChE to the basal lamina at the NMJ, ensuring the proper breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft and thus terminating synaptic transmission (Ohno1998Human). The human ColQ peptide comprises 455 amino acids and includes several conserved domains, such as a secretion signal peptide, a proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) that interacts with AChE, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding domains that help anchor the collagen domain to the basal lamina (Ohno1998Human).

ColQ is essential for the formation of asymmetric forms of AChE, which are anchored to the basal lamina of the synaptic cleft and play a critical role in hydrolyzing acetylcholine to terminate synaptic transmission (Feng1999Genetic). The proper anchoring of AChE is essential for its role in hydrolyzing acetylcholine, thereby limiting the duration of synaptic responses and preventing prolonged exposure of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) to acetylcholine (Ohno1998Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COLQ gene are associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), specifically type V CMS, also known as endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency. This condition is characterized by muscle weakness, respiratory failure, restricted eye movements, drooping eyelids, and difficulty swallowing, often presenting at birth or shortly thereafter (Luo2021Mechanisms). The mutations in COLQ disrupt the anchoring of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at the neuromuscular junction, leading to prolonged acetylcholine signaling and potential muscle damage (Luo2021Mechanisms; Ishigaki2003Two).

More than 30 mutations in the COLQ gene have been identified, including missense, splicing, and truncating mutations, which often affect the protein's proline-rich region attachment domain (Luo2021Mechanisms). These mutations can impair the attachment of AChE catalytic subunits, prevent trimerization of the collagenic tail, or hinder the enzyme's anchoring within the synaptic basal lamina (Mihaylova2008Clinical).

Patients with COLQ mutations may exhibit a range of phenotypes, from severe muscle weakness at birth to milder symptoms with later onset. The variability in clinical presentation can complicate diagnosis and treatment, as some patients may initially respond to esterase inhibitors, which are generally ineffective for COLQ-related CMS (Mihaylova2008Clinical; Wargon2012Longterm).

## Interactions
The COLQ gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by anchoring acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to the synaptic basal lamina. This protein interacts with several other proteins to perform its function. The C-terminal domain of COLQ interacts with Muscle-Specific Kinase (MuSK), a key component in NMJ signaling. This interaction is essential for the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and proper neuromuscular function (Nakata2013Mutations; Kawakami2011AntiMuSK). Mutations in the C-terminal domain of COLQ can impair its interaction with MuSK, leading to compromised anchoring of AChE and affecting AChR clustering, which is associated with conditions like congenital myasthenic syndromes (Nakata2013Mutations; Arredondo2013COOHterminal).

COLQ also interacts with perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, through its central collagen domain. This interaction is crucial for anchoring AChE at the NMJ and is dependent on the heparan sulfate attachments of perlecan (Arredondo2013COOHterminal). The interaction with perlecan remains largely unaffected by mutations in the COOH-terminal domain of COLQ, unlike the interaction with MuSK, which is significantly compromised by certain mutations (Arredondo2013COOHterminal). These interactions highlight the importance of COLQ in maintaining NMJ integrity and function.
