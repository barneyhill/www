# PIGH

## Overview
The PIGH gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class H protein, which is integral to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis pathway. This protein is a component of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex, a multi-subunit enzyme complex located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The PIGH protein plays a pivotal role in the initial step of GPI anchor formation by facilitating the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol, a critical process for the post-translational modification of proteins that allows their attachment to the cell membrane. This modification is essential for the proper localization and function of GPI-anchored proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including signaling, adhesion, and immune response (Eisenhaber2003Enzymes; Watanabe1996PIGA). Deficiencies or mutations in the PIGH gene can lead to significant clinical manifestations, underscoring its importance in cellular function and human health (Wu2020The; Pagnamenta2018A).

## Function
The PIGH gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis pathway. This pathway is essential for the post-translational modification of proteins, allowing them to attach to the cell membrane via GPI anchors. The PIGH protein is part of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex, which catalyzes the initial step of GPI anchor formation by transferring N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Eisenhaber2003Enzymes; Watanabe1996PIGA).

In healthy human cells, PIGH is localized to the ER membrane, where it functions in concert with other proteins such as PIG-A, PIG-C, and GPI1 to form a complex that facilitates the synthesis of GlcNAc-PI, a precursor in GPI anchor biosynthesis (Watanabe1998The). This process is vital for the proper localization and function of GPI-anchored proteins, which play significant roles in cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response. The absence or malfunction of PIGH can lead to defects in GPI anchor biosynthesis, affecting the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins and potentially leading to various cellular dysfunctions (Wegner2021An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGH gene are associated with a range of developmental and neurological disorders. A homozygous variant disrupting the start codon of the PIGH gene, specifically c.1A > T, has been linked to developmental delay, epilepsy, and microcephaly. This variant results in a truncated PIGH protein, impairing its function in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway, which is crucial for attaching proteins to cell membranes. The mutation leads to a loss of function, contributing to the clinical symptoms observed in affected individuals, such as communication difficulties, behavioral issues, and specific brain abnormalities (Pagnamenta2018A).

Phenotypic variability is expected to increase as more cases are reported, with some patients exhibiting developmental delay and autism without epileptic encephalopathy. This variability is linked to the role of PIGH in the GPI-GnT enzyme complex, essential for the first step of GPI-anchor biosynthesis. Patients with PIGH mutations show a decrease in GPI-anchored proteins, as evaluated by flow cytometry and Western blotting (Wu2020The). The PIGH gene, along with other subunits of the GPI-GnT complex, has been identified as a disease-causing gene, highlighting its clinical significance in GPI-anchor deficiencies.

## Interactions
PIGH is a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, which is crucial for the initial steps of GPI anchor biosynthesis. This complex is located on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and includes other subunits such as PIGA, PIGC, PIGP, PIGQ, and PIGY. These proteins work together to mediate the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI), a critical step in the formation of GPI anchors (Tremblay‐Laganière2020PIGH; Liu2021A).

The interaction of PIGH with these proteins is essential for the proper synthesis of GPI-anchored proteins, which are important for various cellular functions. Knockout studies have shown that the absence of PIGH, along with other components of the GPI-GnT complex, results in a complete loss of GPI-anchored protein expression, underscoring its vital role in this biosynthetic pathway (Liu2021A). The complex's activity is crucial for anchoring numerous proteins to the cell membrane, and deficiencies in PIGH can lead to severe neurodevelopmental and skeletal manifestations (Tremblay‐Laganière2020PIGH).
