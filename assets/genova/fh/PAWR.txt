# PAWR

## Overview
The PAWR gene encodes the pro-apoptotic WT1 regulator protein, commonly referred to as Par-4, which is integral to the regulation of apoptosis, particularly in cancer cells. Par-4 is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein, lacking a stable global conformation, which allows it to interact flexibly with various cellular partners. It contains a leucine zipper domain and a SAC domain, both essential for its apoptotic functions. Par-4 primarily functions by inhibiting survival pathways such as the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and modulating the expression of antiapoptotic proteins like BCL2. This regulation underscores its role as a tumor suppressor and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Tan2020Expression; Rah2015PAWRmediated; Libich2009Intrinsic).

## Structure
The PAWR gene encodes the pro-apoptotic protein Par-4, which is involved in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Par-4 is a 332 amino acid protein characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, with over 70% of its structure predicted to be disordered (Libich2009Intrinsic). The primary structure includes a leucine zipper domain and a SAC domain, both crucial for its apoptotic function (Libich2009Intrinsic).

The secondary structure of Par-4 features a coiled-coil region, stabilized by heptad repeats and leucine residues, which facilitates homodimerization (Tiruttani2017Structural). This coiled-coil structure is essential for the protein's ability to form stable complexes and interact with various binding partners (Libich2009Intrinsic).

In terms of tertiary structure, Par-4 lacks a stable global conformation, existing instead as an ensemble of rapidly interchanging conformers, typical of intrinsically disordered proteins (Libich2009Intrinsic). The quaternary structure involves the formation of homodimers and heterodimers, with the coiled-coil domain playing a key role in these interactions (Tiruttani2017Structural).

Par-4 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its nuclear translocation and apoptotic activity (Libich2009Intrinsic). The protein can also form a tetrameric complex with DAPK3, highlighting its role in complex signaling networks (Tiruttani2017Structural).

## Function
The PAWR gene, also known as Par-4, encodes a pro-apoptotic protein that plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis in healthy human cells. PAWR is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to promote apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Tan2020Expression). In healthy cells, PAWR is involved in the inhibition of cell survival pathways and the activation of apoptotic pathways, contributing to its function as a tumor suppressor (Rah2015PAWRmediated).

PAWR's activity is linked to the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. By inhibiting this pathway, PAWR promotes apoptosis, particularly in response to various exogenous insults (Tan2020Expression). Additionally, PAWR modulates the expression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 by binding to the WT1 protein, forming a complex that acts as a transcriptional corepressor at the BCL2 promoter region (Rah2015PAWRmediated). This regulation of BCL2 is significant in maintaining the balance between cell survival and apoptosis, highlighting PAWR's role in cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Rah2015PAWRmediated).

## Clinical Significance
The PAWR gene, also known as Par-4, plays a significant role in various cancers, including ovarian and endometrial cancers. In ovarian cancer, PAWR expression is notably decreased compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with better overall survival and progression-free survival. This suggests that PAWR could serve as a prognostic biomarker for ovarian cancer, with its expression levels correlating with drug responsiveness, particularly to platinum and paclitaxel, which are standard chemotherapy agents (Tan2020Expression).

In endometrial cancer, PAWR is down-regulated, and its expression is linked to the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle progression. The gene is regulated by NF-κB/p65, which enhances its transcription, while Akt signaling inhibits it. This balance is crucial for determining PAWR expression levels, which are important for apoptosis and senescence in endometrial cancer cells (Saegusa2010Transcriptional).

Alterations in PAWR expression or function can contribute to cancer development by promoting resistance to apoptosis, thereby facilitating tumor growth and progression. These findings highlight the potential of PAWR as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancers where its expression is altered (Tan2020Expression; Saegusa2010Transcriptional).

## Interactions
PAWR, also known as Par-4, is a pro-apoptotic protein that interacts with several other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the PITX2 transcription factor, which is involved in ocular development. PAWR was identified as a novel interacting partner of PITX2C through yeast two-hybrid screening, and this interaction was confirmed by Ni2+ pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays. PAWR interacts with both PITX2C and PITX2A isoforms, primarily in the nuclear fraction of human trabecular meshwork cells. The interaction involves the homeodomain and adjacent C-terminal inhibitory domain of PITX2 and the C-terminal leucine zipper domain of PAWR (Acharya2009Human).

PAWR also interacts with the Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) protein, functioning as a transcriptional corepressor. This interaction occurs through the leucine repeats of PAWR and the zinc fingers of WT1, enhancing WT1's transcriptional repression capabilities (Johnstone1996A).

In prostate cancer cells, PAWR modulates the switch from autophagy to apoptosis by interacting with BCL2 and BECN1. PAWR disrupts the interaction between these proteins, promoting apoptosis. This regulatory role is crucial in the context of treatment with 3-azido withaferin A (3-AWA), where PAWR's presence is necessary for the apoptotic switch (Rah2015PAWRmediated).
