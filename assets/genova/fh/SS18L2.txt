# SS18L2

## Overview
SS18L2 is a gene that encodes the SS18-like 2 protein, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The SS18-like 2 protein is a member of the SS18 gene family and is characterized by the presence of the SNH domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. Unlike other family members, SS18-like 2 lacks the QPGY domain, which is typically associated with transcriptional activation. The protein interacts with the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, suggesting a role in modulating gene expression through chromatin structure alterations. SS18L2 has been implicated in various cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer and myelodysplastic syndrome, where it influences cell survival and disease progression. Its involvement in these processes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and a biomarker for certain cancers (Alerasool2021Identification; YedierBayram2021EPIKOL; Sridhar2009Relationship).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The SS18L2 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SS18L2 is essential for cell fitness, with its depletion leading to significant growth defects and apoptosis in TNBC cell lines. This suggests that SS18L2 is a potential therapeutic target for TNBC (YedierBayram2021EPIKOL).

In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), SS18L2 is overexpressed, particularly in patients with the del(5q) subtype, indicating its involvement in disease progression and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Sridhar2009Relationship).

SS18L2 is also part of a molecular signature used for diagnosing non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it serves as a prognostic marker. The gene panel, including SS18L2, has shown high accuracy in distinguishing NSCLC cases from healthy controls (Goswami2020Molecular).

In synovial sarcoma, SS18L2 may modulate interactions between the SYT gene and AF10, a transcription factor involved in leukemias, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (terry2008synovial). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its clinical significance and potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
SS18L2 is a protein that interacts with the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, which includes core members such as SMARCA2 and SMARCA4, as well as subunits specific to the canonical BAF (cBAF) and non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complexes. This interaction suggests that SS18L2 may play a role in transcriptional regulation through its association with the BAF complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling (Alerasool2021Identification).

Despite lacking the QPGY domain essential for transcriptional activation, SS18L2 shares the SNH domain with other members of the SS18 gene family, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions. This shared domain implies that SS18L2 might compete with SS18 and SS18L1 in their interactions, potentially interfering with their activities (de2006Common).

In the context of cancer, SS18L2 has been identified as having significant effects on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell fitness. Knockout of SS18L2 in TNBC cell lines resulted in growth defects and induced apoptosis, indicating its potential role in cancer cell survival and proliferation (YedierBayram2021EPIKOL). However, specific details on the physical interactions of SS18L2 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not provided.
