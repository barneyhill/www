# ADAM15

## Overview
ADAM15 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 15, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family. This protein is characterized by its complex domain structure, which includes a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, among others. The metalloprotease domain is involved in proteolytic activities, while the disintegrin domain facilitates cell adhesion through interactions with integrins (Stone1999Structure–Function; Lu2010ADAM15). ADAM15 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, and is implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can influence its interactions and functions, particularly in processes like angiogenesis and inflammation (Kleino2007ADAM15; Zhang2016ADAMs).

## Structure
ADAM15 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a complex domain structure. It includes a pro-domain, a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Stone1999Structure–Function; Lu2010ADAM15). The metalloprotease domain contains a zinc-binding catalytic site characterized by the consensus sequence HExxHxxGxxHD, essential for its proteolytic activity (Stone1999Structure–Function; Lu2010ADAM15). The disintegrin domain, which includes an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, facilitates cell adhesion by interacting with integrins (Stone1999Structure–Function; Lu2010ADAM15).

The cytoplasmic domain of ADAM15 contains proline-rich motifs that interact with Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, and it is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms (Kleino2007ADAM15; Shimizu2003Structure). These isoforms can have different numbers of SH3-binding motifs, affecting their interactions with other proteins (Kleino2007ADAM15). ADAM15 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can modulate its interactions and functions (Lu2010ADAM15). The protein's structure and alternative splicing are crucial for its roles in cell adhesion, signaling, and potentially in pathological conditions such as cancer (Kleino2007ADAM15).

## Function
ADAM15 is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling pathways. It functions as an ectodomain sheddase, involved in the shedding of proteins such as growth factors, cytokines, receptors, and adhesion proteins, which are crucial for cellular communication and tissue remodeling (Kleino2009Alternative). ADAM15 is known for its interactions with integrins, facilitated by its unique RGD motif in the disintegrin loop, allowing it to bind to integrin αvβ3 in an RGD-dependent manner (EDWARDS2008The).

The protein is involved in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and the shedding of adhesion proteins like E- and N-cadherin, impacting cell-cell interactions and cellular signaling (Kleino2009Alternative). ADAM15's cytosolic tail, which varies due to alternative splicing, contains proline-rich motifs that serve as binding sites for SH3-domain containing proteins, influencing intracellular interactions and signaling pathways (Kleino2007ADAM15). These interactions are crucial for processes such as angiogenesis and inflammation, where ADAM15 modulates endothelial permeability and neutrophil transmigration, affecting vascular function and inflammatory responses (Zhang2016ADAMs).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADAM15 gene have been linked to various cancers, including prostate and breast cancer. In prostate cancer, ADAM15 overexpression is associated with aggressive phenotypes, higher Gleason scores, and advanced pathological stages, indicating its role in disease progression and poor prognosis (Kuefer2006ADAM15; Burdelski2017Overexpression). The gene's expression is also linked to early PSA recurrence, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Burdelski2017Overexpression). ADAM15 interacts with integrins, contributing to angiogenesis and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Lucas2009The).

In breast cancer, ADAM15 is differentially expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with specific isoforms linked to patient survival outcomes. Higher levels of certain ADAM15 isoforms correlate with poorer relapse-free survival in node-negative patients, while others are associated with better survival in node-positive patients (Zhong2008Distinct). The gene's alternative splicing and increased copy number in breast cancer cells suggest a role in altered tumor cell behavior and cancer progression (Ortiz2004Aberrant). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ADAM15 in cancer prognosis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ADAM15, a member of the ADAM protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It physically interacts with acrogranin on the surface of spermatozoa, forming a complex that is crucial for sperm-egg binding during fertilization. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and the presence of acrogranin antibodies reduces sperm-egg adhesion, highlighting the importance of the ADAM15-acrogranin complex in fertilization (Pastén2014ADAM15).

ADAM15 also interacts with Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, such as Hck and Lck, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. These interactions involve the SH3 domains of the kinases and are modulated by the phosphorylation status of ADAM15's cytoplasmic domain (Poghosyan2002Phosphorylationdependent). The proline-rich motifs in ADAM15's cytoplasmic domain are crucial for these interactions, with specific motifs being important for binding to different proteins (Poghosyan2002Phosphorylationdependent).

Alternative splicing of ADAM15 results in isoforms with distinct proline clusters, affecting its interaction with SH3 domain-containing proteins like nephrocystin and SNX33. These interactions are isoform-specific and are influenced by the presence of particular proline clusters (Kleino2009Alternative).
