# C9orf153

## Overview
C9orf153, or chromosome 9 open reading frame 153, is a gene located on chromosome 9 that encodes a protein of the same name. While the specific biological function of the C9orf153 protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is categorized as a non-kinase protein with potential regulatory roles in cellular processes. Recent studies have suggested its involvement in cancer biology, particularly in the context of medulloblastoma, where its expression levels have been correlated with patient prognosis (Chen2020Two). Additionally, C9orf153 has been implicated in the cellular response to mTOR inhibitors, indicating a possible role in drug cytotoxicity pathways (Jiang2013Genomewide). Further research is necessary to clarify the molecular mechanisms and pathways involving C9orf153, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Clinical Significance
C9orf153 has been implicated in the prognosis of medulloblastoma, a type of brain cancer. A study developed a 47-mRNA metastasis-related prognostic model, which included C9orf153 among the genes with positive coefficients. This indicates that higher expression levels of C9orf153 are associated with shorter overall survival in medulloblastoma patients, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression (Chen2020Two).

In another study, C9orf153 was identified as a candidate gene in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) exploring the cytotoxicity of mTOR inhibitors, Rapamycin and Everolimus. The gene was included in functional validation studies due to its association with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to drug cytotoxicity. This suggests that C9orf153 may influence the cytotoxic response to these mTOR inhibitors, although the clinical significance of this association requires further investigation (Jiang2013Genomewide).

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of C9orf153 in cancer prognosis and drug response, although more research is needed to fully understand its role and implications in these contexts.
