# RCL1

## Overview
RCL1 is a gene that encodes the protein RNA terminal phosphate cyclase-like 1, which is integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is primarily involved in the processing and maturation of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), particularly in the formation of the small ribosomal subunit's 18S rRNA. Despite its structural resemblance to RNA cyclases, RCL1 lacks the typical enzymatic activity associated with these proteins due to distinct differences in its active site. Instead, RCL1 functions as part of a complex with the Bms1 protein, a GTPase, facilitating the nuclear import and incorporation of RCL1 into pre-ribosomes. This interaction is crucial for the proper processing of pre-rRNA and the assembly of functional ribosomes. Mutations in the RCL1 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in both cellular and disease contexts (Jiaze2022Rcl1; Delprato2014Crucial; Brownstein2021RCL1).

## Structure
The RCL1 protein is composed of four domain modules, each contributing to its overall structure and function. Domains 1, 2, and 4 share a homologous fold, characterized by a four-stranded beta sheet flanked by two parallel alpha helices. These domains are arranged with pseudo-threefold symmetry, forming three distinct layers: an innermost layer of a1 helices in a parallel 3-helix bundle, a middle layer of a2 helices, and an outer layer of beta sheets. Domain 3, in contrast, has a unique folding topology and acts as a 'lid' over domain 2, establishing multiple interdomain contacts (Tanaka2011Crystal).

The RCL1 protein structure is stabilized by various interactions, including van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bonds, and p-cation interactions, which contribute to its stability in solution as a monomer (Tanaka2011Crystal). Despite its structural similarity to RNA cyclases, RCL1 lacks the metal-dependent adenylyltransferase activity due to differences in its active site, such as the presence of an arginine instead of a histidine nucleophile (Tanaka2011Crystal). The protein also features an oxyanion-binding site in domain 1, which may have potential catalytic and RNA-binding functions, although mutations in this site do not affect yeast growth (Tanaka2011Crystal).

## Function
The RCL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the processing and maturation of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) in healthy human cells. RCL1 is involved in the processing of 18S rRNA, a component of the small ribosomal subunit, by participating in endonucleolytic cleavages at specific sites of the pre-rRNA, which are essential steps in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Delprato2014Crucial). The protein is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the formation of functional ribosomes, impacting protein synthesis and cellular growth (Brownstein2021RCL1).

RCL1 interacts with the Bms1 protein, a GTPase, forming a complex that is crucial for the proper processing of pre-rRNA. This interaction facilitates the nuclear import of RCL1 and its incorporation into pre-ribosomes, although GTP binding to Bms1 is not necessary for these processes. However, GTP binding is crucial for early pre-rRNA processing, indicating a regulatory role in ribosome assembly (Delprato2014Crucial). The RCL1-Bms1 complex is also involved in the recruitment and release of these proteins during the pre-ribosome maturation pathway, highlighting their synchronized role in ribosome biogenesis (Delprato2014Crucial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RCL1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RCL1 expression is commonly down-regulated, which is associated with higher tumor stages, increased levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), vascular invasion, and poor prognosis. This suggests that RCL1 may function as a tumor suppressor in HCC, and its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, particularly myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) (Jiaze2022Rcl1).

In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, RCL1 mutations, particularly copy number variants (CNVs), have been associated with conditions such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and developmental delays. These CNVs can result in a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric phenotypes, including childhood-onset psychosis and intellectual disability (Brownstein2021RCL1).

A rare missense variant in RCL1, rs115482041, has been linked to depression in extended families, explaining a significant portion of the genetic variance in depressive symptoms. This variant is enriched in certain populations and has been associated with major depressive disorder (Amin2017A).

## Interactions
RCL1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. It is an essential component of the eukaryal pre-rRNA processosome, where it is involved in the processing of pre-rRNA at sites flanking the 18S rRNA sequence. RCL1 is associated with the U3 snoRNA-guided pre-rRNA processing and is essential for viability in budding yeast (Tanaka2011Crystal).

RCL1 forms a stable complex with Bms1, a GTPase that is also essential for pre-rRNA processing. Bms1 binds U3 snoRNA in vitro and mediates the association of RCL1 with pre-ribosomes. The interaction between RCL1 and Bms1 is crucial for the incorporation of RCL1 into pre-ribosomes, and Bms1 acts as a loading factor for RCL1 onto the U3 snoRNP within pre-ribosomes (Delprato2014Crucial; WEGIERSKI2001Bms1p).

The interaction between RCL1 and Bms1 is regulated by guanine nucleotide binding, with GTP binding to Bms1 being essential for unveiling the RNA binding surface of RCL1, which promotes pre-rRNA cleavage (Delprato2014Crucial). Specific mutations in RCL1, such as C277R and R327A, significantly reduce its interaction with Bms1, affecting pre-rRNA processing in vivo (Delprato2014Crucial).
