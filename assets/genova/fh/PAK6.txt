# PAK6

## Overview
PAK6, or p21-activated kinase 6, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell motility, and apoptosis. The PAK6 protein is characterized by a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain, which includes a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif, allowing it to interact with small GTPases like Cdc42 and Rac1 (Kaur2008Increased). Unlike other PAK family members, PAK6's kinase activity is not activated by GTP-Cdc42 binding, indicating unique regulatory mechanisms (Lee2002AR). PAK6 is known for its interactions with androgen receptors (AR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), modulating their transcriptional activities and playing a role in AR-mediated transcription (Lee2002AR; Yang2001Androgen). The protein is primarily cytoplasmic but can translocate to the nucleus in response to androgen, suggesting a role in nuclear signaling pathways (Yang2001Androgen). PAK6 is highly expressed in the brain and testis, implicating it in brain development and testicular function (Lee2002AR). Its clinical significance is highlighted by its involvement in diseases such as Parkinson's disease and various cancers, where it influences key signaling pathways and cellular behaviors (Lei2022Comprehensive; Giusto2023Prospective).

## Structure
PAK6 is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain, which includes a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif (Kaur2008Increased). The molecular structure of PAK6 features a canonical bi-lobed protein kinase fold, with a predominantly beta-strand N-lobe and a predominantly alpha-helical C-lobe. The ATP-binding site is located between these lobes (Gao2013Substrate). The N-terminal region of PAK6 contains a pseudosubstrate sequence that acts as an autoinhibitory domain, regulating its catalytic activity (Gao2013Substrate).

PAK6 undergoes autophosphorylation, which is a common post-translational modification that influences its activity (Kaur2008Increased). The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers, affecting its interactions and function (Civiero2017PAK6). The structure of PAK6 has been studied in complex with ATP-competitive inhibitors, revealing insights into its conformational states and potential for targeted therapeutic interventions (Gao2013Substrate). The protein's interaction with small molecules like PF-3758309 and sunitinib has been crystallographically analyzed, showing specific binding modes and conformational changes (Gao2013Substrate).

## Function
PAK6 (p21-activated kinase 6) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell motility, and apoptosis. It interacts with androgen receptors (AR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), modulating their transcriptional activities. PAK6 inhibits AR-mediated transactivation in a ligand-dependent manner, potentially by competing with AR coactivators for binding (Lee2002AR; Yang2001Androgen). This interaction is not dependent on the LXXLL binding AF-2 region, suggesting a distinct binding site, possibly in the hinge region between the DNA-binding domain and ligand-binding domain (Lee2002AR).

PAK6 is primarily cytoplasmic but can translocate to the nucleus with AR in response to androgen, indicating a role in AR-mediated transcription (Yang2001Androgen). It is highly expressed in the brain and testis, suggesting roles in brain development and testicular function (Lee2002AR). PAK6 also targets cell-cell adhesions in a Cdc42-dependent manner, promoting cell-cell dissociation, which is crucial for processes like epithelial colony escape (Morse2015PAK6). This targeting is independent of its catalytic activity, indicating a structural role in adhesion dynamics (Morse2015PAK6).

## Clinical Significance
PAK6 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD) and various cancers. In the context of PD, PAK6 is associated with the LRRK2 gene, which is linked to both familial and sporadic forms of the disease. Alterations in PAK6 expression have been observed in PD patients, with lower levels in sporadic PD and higher levels in those with the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. PAK6 interacts with 14-3-3γ and LRRK2, influencing neurite outgrowth and potentially rescuing defects caused by the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (Giusto2023Prospective; Civiero2017PAK6). 

In cancer, PAK6 is significantly up-regulated in glioblastoma multiforme and is associated with poor prognosis. Its role in cancer involves the regulation of signaling pathways crucial for cell growth and survival, such as ERK, AKT, and β-catenin (Lei2022Comprehensive). PAK6's involvement in these pathways suggests its potential as a therapeutic target, with specific inhibitors being explored for cancer treatment (Lei2022Comprehensive). 

Overall, PAK6's altered expression and interactions contribute to its clinical significance in both neurodegenerative and oncological conditions.

## Interactions
PAK6 is known to interact with several proteins, notably the androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). It binds strongly to AR, as demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid screens and in vitro studies, where full-length AR and PAK6 proteins show specific binding. This interaction is ligand-dependent, requiring the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AR, and is confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and mammalian one-hybrid experiments (Lee2002AR; Yang2001Androgen). PAK6 inhibits AR transcriptional activity, potentially by recruiting Cdc42 to the AR complex or through phosphorylation of AR or associated proteins (Schrantz2004Mechanism; Lee2002AR).

PAK6 also interacts with ERα, with binding enhanced by the partial agonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT). This interaction occurs at a site distinct from the LXXLL coactivator binding site, indicating sensitivity to conformational changes in the AF-2 region (Lee2002AR). PAK6's kinase activity is not activated by GTP-Cdc42 binding, unlike other PAKs, suggesting unique regulatory mechanisms (Lee2002AR). Additionally, PAK6 can phosphorylate AR, potentially inhibiting its DNA binding and transcriptional activity (Schrantz2004Mechanism).
