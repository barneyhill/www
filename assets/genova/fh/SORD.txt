# SORD

## Overview
The SORD gene encodes the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase, a crucial component of the polyol pathway, which is responsible for converting sorbitol into fructose. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydrogenase and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular osmolarity and preventing the accumulation of sorbitol, which can lead to osmotic and oxidative stress. Sorbitol dehydrogenase is a homotetramer composed of 38-kDa subunits and contains a zinc-binding domain essential for its catalytic activity (Yilihamu2022No; Cortese2020Biallelic). The enzyme is widely expressed in various mammalian tissues, including the kidney and lens of the eye, and is vital for peripheral nerve metabolism and survival under normoglycemic conditions (Vaarala2010Sorbitol). Mutations in the SORD gene are associated with hereditary neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 and distal hereditary motor neuropathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Cortese2020Biallelic; EstévezArias2022Genetic).

## Structure
The SORD gene encodes the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase, which is involved in the polyol pathway by converting sorbitol to fructose. The SORD protein is a homotetramer composed of 38-kDa subunits, indicating a quaternary structure where multiple subunits assemble to form the functional enzyme (Cortese2020Biallelic). The protein contains a zinc-binding domain, which is crucial for its catalytic activity, as zinc ions are often involved in the enzymatic function of dehydrogenases (Yilihamu2022No). 

While specific details on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of the SORD protein are not provided in the context, it is known that the protein's structure includes domains that are essential for its function, such as the zinc-binding domain. The context does not provide information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of the SORD protein. However, the presence of a zinc-binding domain suggests that the protein may undergo typical modifications like phosphorylation, which are common in enzymes to regulate activity. The absence of detailed structural information in the context limits the description of the protein's molecular architecture.

## Function
The SORD gene encodes the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase, which plays a crucial role in the polyol pathway by converting sorbitol to fructose. This conversion is essential for maintaining normal sorbitol levels within cells, preventing its accumulation, which can lead to osmotic and oxidative stress (Cortese2020Biallelic). In healthy human cells, SORD is a homotetramer composed of 38-kDa subunits and is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, including the kidney and lens of the eye (Vaarala2010Sorbitol). The enzyme's activity is vital for peripheral nerve metabolism and survival under normoglycemic conditions, as it helps regulate cellular osmolarity and protect nerve cells from damage (Cortese2020Biallelic).

SORD's enzymatic function is also significant in the context of glucose metabolism, where it contributes to energy production and cellular function by facilitating the conversion of sorbitol to fructose (Dong2021Biallelic). The enzyme is involved in various physiological processes, including sperm physiology, as it is secreted by the epididymal epithelium (Vaarala2010Sorbitol). SORD's activity is particularly important in tissues like the liver, kidney, and seminal vesicles, where it helps regulate osmotic pressure and maintain cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SORD gene, which encodes the sorbitol dehydrogenase enzyme, are linked to several hereditary neuropathies, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN). These conditions are often caused by biallelic mutations, such as the c.757delG variant, which lead to a loss of function of the sorbitol dehydrogenase enzyme. This enzymatic deficiency results in the accumulation of sorbitol, contributing to axonal damage through mechanisms that may involve increased cellular osmolarity, oxidative stress, and decreased NADPH levels (Cortese2020Biallelic; EstévezArias2022Genetic).

Clinical manifestations of SORD-related neuropathies typically include axonal neuropathy, distal muscle weakness, and atrophy, with symptoms often appearing in the second or third decade of life (Laššuthová2021Biallelic). The c.757delG variant is notably prevalent among affected individuals, and its presence is a significant diagnostic marker for these neuropathies (Dong2021Biallelic).

SORD mutations also have implications for diabetic complications, as increased sorbitol levels can lead to osmotic damage and oxidative stress, potentially affecting retinal cells and contributing to diabetic retinopathy (Cortese2020Biallelic). The identification of SORD mutations as a common cause of hereditary neuropathy highlights the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions, such as substrate reduction and enzyme replacement therapies (Cortese2020Biallelic).
