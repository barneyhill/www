# CDC37L1

## Overview
CDC37L1 is a gene that encodes the protein cell division cycle 37 like 1, which functions as a co-chaperone in association with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). This protein is involved in the stabilization and activation of various client proteins, playing a critical role in cellular processes such as protein folding and signal transduction. CDC37L1 is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, where it has been implicated in the development of drug resistance, notably in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through its interaction with HSP90 and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) (Li2022miR15a). Additionally, CDC37L1 has been identified as a potential biomarker in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and is involved in the regulation of tau proteins in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its diverse roles in human health and disease (Peak2021Hsp90interacting; Janvilisri2015OmicsBased).

## Clinical Significance
CDC37L1 has been implicated in the development of resistance to sorafenib, a drug used in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of CDC37L1 in HCC cells is associated with increased resistance to sorafenib, while its knockdown enhances the drug's efficacy by reducing cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis (Li2022miR15a). This resistance is partly due to CDC37L1's role in enhancing the interaction between heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), which stabilizes PPIA and contributes to drug resistance (Li2022miR15a). High expression levels of CDC37L1 and PPIA correlate with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival in HCC patients treated with sorafenib, suggesting that these proteins could serve as prognostic markers (Li2022miR15a).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), CDC37L1 has been identified as a potential molecular biomarker through omics-based approaches, indicating its possible involvement in the disease's molecular pathology (Janvilisri2015OmicsBased). Additionally, CDC37L1 is involved in tau regulation in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, through its interaction with HSP90, although specific diseases or conditions associated with mutations in CDC37L1 are not detailed (Peak2021Hsp90interacting).

## Interactions
CDC37L1 is a co-chaperone protein that interacts with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to form a complex that plays a significant role in protein stabilization and activation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, CDC37L1 enhances the interaction between HSP90 and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), which is crucial for the stability of PPIA. This interaction is important for the resistance of HCC cells to sorafenib, a drug used in cancer treatment (Li2022miR15a). 

CDC37L1 does not directly interact with PPIA but facilitates the association between HSP90 and PPIA, forming a multiprotein complex. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have shown that CDC37L1 significantly interacts with HSP90, promoting the interaction between HSP90 and PPIA, although PPIA was not directly co-immunoprecipitated with CDC37L1 (Li2022miR15a). 

The interaction of CDC37L1 with HSP90 is part of a broader mechanism that involves the stabilization of client proteins, which is essential for various cellular processes, including those related to drug resistance in cancer cells (Li2022miR15a).
