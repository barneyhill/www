# TRAF2

## Overview
The TRAF2 gene encodes the TNF receptor-associated factor 2, a pivotal adaptor protein involved in the signal transduction pathways of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. As a member of the TRAF protein family, TRAF2 plays a crucial role in mediating cellular responses to TNF, including the regulation of cell survival, apoptosis, and immune responses. The protein functions primarily as a scaffold and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the activation of key signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAP kinase upon TNF receptor engagement (Borghi2016TRAF2; Lee2002Modulation). Structurally, TRAF2 is characterized by its RING finger and zinc finger motifs, as well as a distinctive TRAF domain that enables trimerization and interaction with receptor molecules (WU1999Structural). This structural configuration is essential for its role in signal transduction, allowing TRAF2 to interact with various proteins and modulate inflammatory and apoptotic pathways (Devergne1996Association; Hsu1996TRADD–TRAF2). The clinical significance of TRAF2 is underscored by its involvement in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, where mutations or dysregulation of TRAF2 can lead to pathological outcomes (Piao2011Tumor; Pienkos2021Novel).

## Structure
The TRAF2 protein is a member of the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) family and plays a crucial role in signal transduction. Structurally, TRAF2 is composed of several domains, including an amino-terminal domain with RING finger and zinc finger motifs, and a carboxy-terminal TRAF domain, which is further subdivided into TRAF-N and TRAF-C domains (WU1999Structural). The TRAF domain is essential for self-association and interaction with upstream receptors, facilitating trimerization, which is critical for its function (WU1999Structural).

The TRAF-C domain, spanning residues 352-501, features an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sandwich, a unique fold not found in other known structures. This domain is vital for receptor interaction and structural integrity (WU1999Structural). The trimeric structure of TRAF2 resembles a mushroom, with the TRAF-C domain forming the cap and the coiled-coil domain acting as the stalk. The coiled-coil domain, up to residue 347, forms a parallel structure with α-helices from other protomers, contributing to the trimer's stability (WU1999Structural).

TRAF2's trimeric nature is consistent with the trimeric cytokine ligands of TNFRs, suggesting an optimal mode of recognition for trimerized receptor molecules (WU1999Structural). The protein's structure allows for potential hetero-oligomerization with other TRAF proteins, influencing signal transduction pathways (WU1999Structural).

## Function
TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor 2) is a critical adaptor protein involved in TNF receptor-induced signaling pathways, playing a significant role in regulating cell survival, apoptosis, and immune responses. In healthy human cells, TRAF2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it functions as both a scaffold and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is recruited to TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors upon TNF stimulation, facilitating the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling pathways (Borghi2016TRAF2; Lee2002Modulation).

TRAF2 is essential for the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway, particularly upon TNFR2 stimulation, and it negatively regulates apoptosis and necroptosis in TNFR1 signaling (Borghi2016TRAF2). It also plays a role in the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway by forming a complex with cIAP1/2 and TRAF3, which targets NIK for degradation, preventing its accumulation and subsequent activation of NF-κB (Borghi2016TRAF2).

TRAF2's anti-apoptotic function is crucial, as it inhibits TNF-R1-dependent caspase-8 activation, thereby preventing apoptosis. It achieves this by facilitating the ubiquitination of caspases, particularly caspase-3 and -7, within the TNF-R1 signaling complex (Wajant2001Tumor). The protein's ubiquitin ligase activity is vital for its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses (Borghi2016TRAF2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TRAF2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including conditions like colitis, has been linked to TRAF2 deficiency. Mice lacking TRAF2 develop severe colitis characterized by increased apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-17A, and IFNγ. These changes lead to an imbalance in the gut microbiota, exacerbating the condition (Piao2011Tumor). In humans, increased expression of TRAF2 has been observed in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBD, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Qiao2013Gene).

TRAF2 mutations have also been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). A novel pathogenic variant in TRAF2 was identified in a patient with PAH, leading to a truncated protein and increased NF-κB activation, which is linked to disease progression (Pienkos2021Novel). In cancer, particularly colon cancers with high microsatellite instability, somatic frameshift mutations in TRAF2 result in loss-of-function mutations, potentially affecting its role in apoptosis and cancer development (Moon2021Brief). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TRAF2 in various inflammatory and proliferative disorders.

## Interactions
TRAF2 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in signal transduction pathways. It forms a trimeric structure that facilitates its interaction with receptor peptides, such as those from TNF receptor-2 (TNF-R2), through a conserved SXXE motif (Park1999Structural). TRAF2 interacts with TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain protein) to mediate NF-κB activation and apoptosis signaling pathways. This interaction is essential for recruiting TRAF2 to TNFR1, as there is no direct interaction between TNFR1 and TRAF2 without TRADD (Hsu1996TRADD–TRAF2).

TRAF2 also interacts with RIP (receptor-interacting protein) in response to oxidative stress, forming a complex that is crucial for reactive oxygen species-induced cell death (Shen2004Essential). In the context of Epstein-Barr virus LMP1, TRAF2, along with TRAF1 and TRAF3, binds to a specific site in the LMP1 cytoplasmic tail, which is important for NF-κB activation (Devergne1996Association). TRAF2's interaction with CD40 involves both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, with TRAF3 acting as an inhibitor of the noncanonical pathway (Hauer2005TNF).
