# MARVELD3

## Overview
MARVELD3 is a gene that encodes the MARVEL domain containing 3 protein, a member of the tight junction-associated MARVEL protein (TAMP) family. This transmembrane protein is characterized by the presence of a MARVEL domain, which is crucial for its role in membrane apposition and vesicle trafficking. MARVELD3 is integral to the formation and function of tight junctions in epithelial cells, contributing to the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity. It interacts with other tight junction proteins, such as occludin and tricellulin, and is involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell behavior, including the MEKK1-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. The protein's expression is observed in various tissues, and it plays a significant role in maintaining tissue integrity and function. Alterations in MARVELD3 expression have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Raleigh2010Tight; Steed2014MarvelD3; Heymans2021Spatiotemporal).

## Structure
MARVELD3 is a transmembrane protein characterized by the presence of a MARVEL domain, which is involved in membrane apposition and vesicle trafficking. The protein is composed of four transmembrane α-helices that span the lipid bilayer in an M-shape, a structural feature common to the Tight Junction Associated Marvel Proteins (TAMP) family, which includes occludin and tricellulin (Heymans2021Spatiotemporal; Raleigh2010Tight). 

MARVELD3 exists in two splice variants, isoform 1 and isoform 2, which differ in their C-terminal domains. Isoform 1 consists of 410 amino acids, while isoform 2 has 401 amino acids. Both isoforms share a common N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 198 amino acids but differ in their C-terminal halves, which contain the transmembrane domains. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domains are short, with isoform 1 having 30 amino acids and isoform 2 having 18 amino acids (Steed2009Identification).

The protein's N-terminal domain is longer than that of occludin and is not as well conserved, although it contains regions of better conservation that might be functionally relevant (Steed2009Identification). MARVELD3 interacts with other tight junction proteins, including occludin and tricellulin, through heterophilic interactions, influencing the organization and formation of tight junction strands (Cording2013In).

## Function
MARVELD3 is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in the formation and function of tight junctions in epithelial cells. It is part of the tight junction-associated MARVEL protein (TAMP) family, which includes occludin and tricellulin, and is characterized by the presence of a conserved MARVEL domain (Raleigh2010Tight; Steed2009Identification). MARVELD3 is involved in maintaining epithelial barrier function by being incorporated into claudin-based tight junction-like strands, although it cannot form these structures independently (Raleigh2010Tight).

MARVELD3 also plays a crucial role in signaling pathways that regulate cell behavior. It acts as a dynamic regulator of the MEKK1-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and survival. The protein recruits MEKK1 to tight junctions, suppressing JNK activity and thereby inhibiting JNK-regulated transcriptional mechanisms (Steed2014MarvelD3). This regulation is particularly important during osmotic stress, where MARVELD3 internalization and JNK activation modulate MEKK1 activity, affecting cell survival (Steed2014MarvelD3).

MARVELD3 is expressed in various tissues, including epithelial and endothelial cells, and is involved in maintaining tissue integrity and function (Heymans2021Spatiotemporal). Despite its significant roles, genetic ablation of MARVELD3 in mice does not significantly impact the development or function of certain tissues, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms (Heymans2021Spatiotemporal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MARVELD3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and inflammatory conditions. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), high expression of MARVELD3 is associated with poorer overall survival, suggesting its role as an oncogene. It is considered an independent prognostic factor for poor OSCC prognosis, with significant diagnostic potential indicated by an AUC of 0.808 in ROC curve analysis (Huang2022High).

In pancreatic cancer, MARVELD3 expression is downregulated during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process involved in cancer progression. This downregulation is associated with decreased tight junction integrity and increased expression of the transcription factor Snail, which is a marker of EMT (Kojima2011Downregulation).

MARVELD3 also plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease, specifically ulcerative colitis (UC). It is upregulated in UC and has been shown to have protective effects by stabilizing the intestinal barrier, although not through direct enhancement of paracellular barrier properties. Instead, its protective role is likely due to regulatory processes that support cell proliferation and survival (Weiß2022MarvelD3).

## Interactions
MARVELD3 is a tight junction-associated protein that interacts with several other proteins involved in cellular junctions. It is known to co-localize with occludin and tricellulin, suggesting a role in the organization of tight junctions. MARVELD3 interacts intracellularly with occludin, tricellulin, and claudin family proteins, including claudin-1, -3, -4, and -5, although its absence does not affect the abundance or localization of these tight junction components (Heymans2021Spatiotemporal; Raleigh2010Tight).

MARVELD3 also interacts with the MEKK1-JNK signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell behavior and survival. It recruits MEKK1 to tight junctions, thereby suppressing the JNK pathway and influencing cell migration and proliferation. This interaction is specific to the N-terminal domain of MARVELD3, which is necessary for regulating AP1 activity, a transcription factor complex activated by JNK (Steed2014MarvelD3).

MARVELD3's interaction with MEKK1 is suggested to regulate MEKK1's localization and activity at tight junctions, although direct coimmunoprecipitation was unsuccessful. A biotinylation assay indicated their close proximity, suggesting a regulatory interaction that might be unstable or sterically hindered (Steed2014MarvelD3).
