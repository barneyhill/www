# INPP5J

## Overview
INPP5J is a gene that encodes the protein inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase J, also known as proline-rich inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (PIPP). This protein is a phosphatase involved in the regulation of phosphoinositide signaling pathways, playing a crucial role in cellular processes by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). By modulating the levels of this lipid second messenger, INPP5J influences key signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is important for cell survival and growth (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide). The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and associates with the plasma membrane, where it impacts the actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis (Billcliff2014Inositol). INPP5J is expressed in a variety of tissues, suggesting its broad role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its expression levels have been linked to breast cancer prognosis, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide).

## Function
INPP5J, also known as proline-rich inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (PIPP), is involved in the regulation of phosphoinositide signaling pathways. It primarily functions by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), a critical lipid second messenger involved in various cellular processes. By degrading PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, INPP5J decreases the activation of Akt, a key kinase in cell survival and growth pathways, thereby opposing oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide).

INPP5J is active in the cytoplasm and associates with the plasma membrane, facilitated by its SKICH domain, which aids in its localization to these cellular regions. This localization is crucial for its role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis, impacting cellular communication and function (Billcliff2014Inositol). In neuronal cells, INPP5J influences neurite outgrowth and elongation by modulating PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and the activation of downstream signaling molecules such as GSK3β (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide).

The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, breast, heart, kidney, liver, stomach, and lung, indicating its broad role in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide).

## Clinical Significance
The INPP5J gene, encoding the proline-rich inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (PIPP), is located on chromosome 22q12. Alterations in INPP5J expression have been linked to breast cancer. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the region of chromosome 22q, where INPP5J is located, is frequently observed in breast carcinomas. Specifically, LOH of markers flanking INPP5J, such as D22S1150 and D22S280, has been detected in 41% and 45% of breast carcinomas, respectively (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide). INPP5J mRNA is expressed at higher levels in estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors compared to ER negative tumors, and higher expression of INPP5J correlates with a better prognosis, defined as no distant metastases developing within 5 years of diagnosis. It is one of the top-ranked genes for predicting breast cancer patient outcomes (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide). Despite these associations, the specific role of PIPP in controlling breast cancer proliferation remains unclear (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide). There is no mention of INPP5J in the context of other diseases or conditions, indicating that its clinical significance may be primarily related to breast cancer.
