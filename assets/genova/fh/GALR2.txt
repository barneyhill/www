# GALR2

## Overview
The GALR2 gene encodes the galanin receptor 2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices. This receptor is primarily involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter release, regulation of hormone secretion, and influence on cell proliferation. GALR2 is activated by the neuropeptide galanin, leading to the activation of intracellular signaling pathways, including those mediated by Gq/11 proteins, which result in increased intracellular calcium levels (Gopalakrishnan2020An; Heo2022Structure). The receptor plays a significant role in neuronal development and cell survival, with implications in neuroprotection and potential therapeutic applications for nervous disorders (Heo2022Structure). Additionally, GALR2 is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and cardiac conditions, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Boal2022Galanin; Misawa2013Tumor).

## Structure
The human galanin receptor 2 (GALR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs. The primary structure of GALR2 includes specific amino acid sequences that form these helices, which are crucial for its function in signal transduction (Heo2022Structure). The secondary structure involves these alpha-helices and connecting loops, contributing to the receptor's ability to interact with ligands and G proteins (Duan2022Molecular).

The tertiary structure of GALR2 is defined by the 3D arrangement of its transmembrane helices within the cell membrane, forming a binding pocket for the neuropeptide galanin. This pocket is located at the extracellular face of the receptor and involves key residues such as Trp2, Asn5, and Tyr9, which are important for ligand binding (Heo2022Structure). The receptor's quaternary structure may involve dimerization, as GALR2 can form heterodimers with other galanin receptors, influencing its signaling pathways (Freimann2015Galanin).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, affecting GALR2's activity and interactions. The receptor is involved in multiple intracellular signaling pathways, primarily through Gq/11 proteins, which activate phospholipase C and increase intracellular calcium levels (Freimann2015Galanin; Heo2022Structure).

## Function
Galanin receptor 2 (GALR2) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter release, regulation of hormone secretion, and influence on cell proliferation. GALR2 is activated by the neuropeptide galanin, leading to the stimulation of signaling cascades through the Gαq/11 class of G-proteins. This activation triggers phospholipase C, resulting in the hydrolysis of inositol phosphate and the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, which opens Ca2+-dependent channels (Gopalakrishnan2020An).

GALR2 is also associated with neuronal development and cell survival, primarily through the AKT and MAPK pathways. It stimulates MAPK1/3-dependent cell proliferation and AKT-dependent cell survival, mediated by activated Rap1 through GTP binding (Gopalakrishnan2020An). The receptor's activation is linked to neuroprotective effects, particularly in response to nerve damage, and it is believed to have potential as a treatment for nervous disorders by acting as an antidepressant or anticonvulsant, stimulating nerve growth, and reducing neuronal damage (Heo2022Structure). GALR2's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the GALR2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and cardiac conditions. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), GALR2 often undergoes hypermethylation, leading to its silencing and contributing to tumor progression. This epigenetic alteration is associated with decreased disease-free survival and increased cancer recurrence, suggesting GALR2's role as a tumor suppressor (Misawa2013Tumor). GALR2 expression, when restored, can suppress tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (KANAZAWA2014Galanin).

In cardiac tissues, GALR2 is involved in maintaining myocardial mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Deficiency in GALR2 expression leads to cardiac hypertrophic remodeling and increased mitochondrial ROS levels, indicating its role in cardiac health (Boal2022Galanin). GALR2 also plays a role in sensory neuron survival and pain behavior. In GalR2-deficient mice, there is decreased neurite outgrowth and impaired pain-like behavior, suggesting its importance in neuronal survival and pain perception (hobson2006mice). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GALR2 in both cancer and cardiac diseases, as well as in neurological conditions.

## Interactions
Galanin receptor 2 (GALR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with the neuropeptide galanin, forming a complex with heterotrimeric G-proteins. This interaction is crucial for GALR2's role in signaling pathways. GALR2 primarily signals through Gi/o proteins, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, but it can also activate phospholipase C via Gq/11 proteins, leading to increased intracellular calcium levels (Heo2022Structure). The receptor's interaction with Gq proteins is facilitated by specific structural features, such as the intracellular loop 2 (ICL2), which plays a significant role in partner selectivity. A salt bridge between Glu135 of ICL2 and Arg32 of mGαq iN is critical for this interaction (Heo2022Structure).

GALR2 also interacts with membrane cholesterol, which modulates its ability to bind galanin. Cholesterol depletion significantly reduces galanin binding, indicating that cholesterol is essential for maintaining GALR2's functional conformation. This interaction is specific to cholesterol, as only cholesterol and a few analogues can restore galanin binding in cholesterol-depleted membranes (Pang1999Membrane). These interactions highlight the importance of both protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions in GALR2's function and its potential as a drug target.
