# ARMCX4

## Overview
ARMCX4 is a gene that encodes the protein armadillo repeat containing X-linked 4, which is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeat domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ARMCX4 protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in the differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells, a process crucial for male fertility. Additionally, ARMCX4 interacts with DPAGT1, an enzyme involved in N-glycosylation, indicating its potential regulatory role in embryonic development and cell proliferation. Mutations in ARMCX4 have been associated with conditions such as male infertility, congenital myasthenic syndrome, and neonatal maxillofacial deformities, highlighting its clinical significance (Huang2021ARMC).

## Function
ARMCX4 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). This function is essential for male fertility, as mutations in ARMCX4 can lead to male infertility by disrupting SSC differentiation (Huang2021ARMC). The protein contains armadillo repeat domains, which are highly conserved and suggest a role in mediating protein-protein interactions crucial for its function (Huang2021ARMC).

ARMCX4 also interacts with DPAGT1, an enzyme that catalyzes N-glycosylation, a posttranslational modification process. This interaction indicates that ARMCX4 may play a role in inhibiting congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) and neonatal maxillofacial deformities, suggesting a regulatory role in embryonic development and cell proliferation (Huang2021ARMC). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it may influence neuronal development and function, although specific details on its role in healthy human cells are limited (Huang2021ARMC). The conservation of its armadillo repeat domains across species underscores its potential importance in these biological processes (Huang2021ARMC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARMCX4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. ARMCX4 interacts with DPAGT1, a gene involved in N-glycosylation, and this interaction is significant in preventing congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), male infertility, and neonatal maxillofacial deformities. Mutations in ARMCX4 can lead to these congenital deformities, suggesting its role in embryonic development and cell proliferation (Huang2021ARMC).

In the context of male infertility, ARMCX4 promotes the differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), and mutations in this gene can result in infertility (Huang2021ARMC). The gene's interaction with DPAGT1 may inhibit male infertility, highlighting its potential regulatory role in reproductive health (Huang2021ARMC).

ARMCX4 has also been associated with high-risk pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma (pPTC). Although not a tier 1 Cancer Gene Census gene, somatic mutations in ARMCX4 have been identified in thyroid cancer specimens. However, the specific impact of these mutations on protein function is predicted to be low, and there is insufficient evidence to classify them as causative of pPTC (Stenman2021Pangenomic).

In Crohn's disease, ARMCX4 interacts with environmental factors like Benzo(a)pyrene and Aflatoxin B1, influencing gene methylation and potentially contributing to postoperative recurrence (Rajalingam2023Identification).

## Interactions
ARMCX4 is known to interact with DPAGT1, an enzyme that catalyzes N-glycosylation, a posttranslational modification process. This interaction suggests that ARMCX4 may play a role in inhibiting male infertility and congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) by modulating the activity of DPAGT1. Mutations in ARMCX4 have been linked to male infertility and neonatal maxillofacial deformities, indicating that its interaction with DPAGT1 could be crucial in preventing these conditions (Huang2021ARMC).

While ARMCX4 is part of the ARMCX gene family, which is involved in various cellular processes, specific details about its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond DPAGT1 are not well-documented. The ARMCX family, including ARMCX4, is characterized by armadillo repeat domains, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions. However, the precise physical interactions of ARMCX4 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored in the available literature (ZederLutz2023Characterization; Huang2021ARMC).
