# OR4K2

## Overview
The OR4K2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K member 2, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules. The OR4K2 gene is located on chromosome 14 and is one of the many genes responsible for the vast diversity of olfactory receptors in humans. These receptors play a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorant molecules and initiating a neuronal response that is ultimately perceived as smell. The olfactory receptor family is characterized by a 7-transmembrane domain structure, which is a common feature among GPCRs, allowing them to traverse the cell membrane and interact with intracellular signaling pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
