# TSEN15

## Overview
The TSEN15 gene encodes the tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 15, a crucial component of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex. This protein is part of a heterotetrameric complex that includes TSEN54, TSEN34, and TSEN2, and plays a significant structural role in the assembly and stability of the complex. Although TSEN15 does not directly interact with RNA substrates, it is essential for the proper positioning and function of the catalytic subunits, facilitating the precise cleavage of introns from precursor tRNA transcripts, a critical step in tRNA maturation and protein synthesis (Breuss2016AutosomalRecessive; Hayne2022Recent). Mutations in TSEN15 are linked to pontocerebellar hypoplasia, a group of neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal health (Breuss2016AutosomalRecessive).

## Structure
The TSEN15 protein is a subunit of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which is crucial for processing pre-tRNAs. Structurally, TSEN15 is part of a heterotetrameric complex that includes TSEN54, TSEN34, and TSEN2. TSEN15 pairs with TSEN34 in a tail-to-tail fashion via their C-terminal β-strands, contributing to the structural integrity of the complex (Sekulovski2022Structural). The TSEN15 subunit is involved in forming a scaffold that supports the catalytic activity of the complex, although it does not directly interact with pre-tRNA (Yuan2023Recognition).

The TSEN15 protein has been characterized by an NMR structure, indicating its role as part of the structural core conserved from archaeal ancestors (Hayne2023Structural). The L10 loop in TSEN15 (residues 144-150) inserts into a positively charged cleft in the TSEN2 subunit, which is important for maintaining the structural integrity of the complex (Hayne2023Structural). The TSEN34-TSEN15 interaction is mediated by anti-parallel β-β interfaces formed by the final β-strand from each subunit (Hayne2023Structural). While specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of TSEN15 are not detailed in the available context, its structural role within the TSEN complex is well-documented.

## Function
The TSEN15 gene encodes a subunit of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which is essential for the maturation of tRNA molecules in human cells. This complex is responsible for the precise cleavage of introns from precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) transcripts, a critical step in producing functional tRNA necessary for protein synthesis (Breuss2016AutosomalRecessive; Hayne2022Recent). TSEN15, along with TSEN54, serves as a structural scaffold within the complex, facilitating the recruitment and proper positioning of the catalytic subunits TSEN34 and TSEN2 (Yuan2023Recognition). The interaction between TSEN15 and TSEN34 is particularly important for the assembly and stability of the endonuclease complex, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Breuss2016AutosomalRecessive).

In healthy human cells, TSEN15 is active in the nucleus, where tRNA processing occurs. It plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the TSEN complex, ensuring the proper splicing of tRNA introns and the formation of the anticodon stem loop, which is essential for tRNA functionality in protein synthesis (Sekulovski2022Structural; Hayne2022Recent). The absence of homozygous null alleles for TSEN15 suggests that its complete loss leads to early lethality, highlighting its critical role in cellular and organismal health (Breuss2016AutosomalRecessive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TSEN15 gene are associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, and cerebellar atrophy. These mutations lead to impaired function of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which is crucial for tRNA processing. Specific mutations, such as the homozygous single-nucleotide variant c.455A>G resulting in a p.Tyr152Cys substitution, have been identified in individuals with severe epilepsy, developmental delays, and cerebellar and pontine hypoplasia (Breuss2016AutosomalRecessive). Another mutation, c.346C>T, leading to a p.His116Tyr substitution, affects the assembly of the endonuclease complex, likely due to decreased interaction with TSEN34, although it does not impact protein stability (Breuss2016AutosomalRecessive).

The mutations in TSEN15 result in altered stoichiometry and impaired function of the TSEN complex, leading to a significant loss of tRNA cleavage activity. This disruption in RNA processing is linked to the severe phenotypes observed in PCH, such as PCH4 and PCH5, and suggests that a complete loss of function may result in early lethality (Breuss2016AutosomalRecessive). The study of TSEN15 mutations highlights the gene's critical role in brain development and its contribution to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders (Breuss2016AutosomalRecessive).

## Interactions
TSEN15 is a subunit of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which also includes TSEN54, TSEN34, and TSEN2. TSEN15 interacts with TSEN34 through an anti-parallel β-β interface formed by the final β-strand of each subunit, creating an extensive hydrophobic interface that is crucial for the stability of the complex (Hayne2023Structural; Hayne2022Recent). This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and function of the TSEN complex, as mutations in TSEN15, such as the H116Y mutation, can disrupt this interface and lead to pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) by affecting the structural integrity of the complex (Breuss2016AutosomalRecessive; Sekulovski2022Structural).

TSEN15 does not directly interact with RNA substrates, as its role is more structural, supporting the placement of the intron surrounding the 5′ splice site by providing structural support to TSEN34 and TSEN2 (Hayne2023Structural; Yuan2023Recognition). The TSEN complex also associates with the polyribonucleotide 5'-hydroxylkinase CLP1, although CLP1 is not required for intron removal, it may play a regulatory role in tRNA splicing (Hayne2023Structural).
