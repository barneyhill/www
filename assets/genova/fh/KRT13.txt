# KRT13

## Overview
Keratin 13 (KRT13) is a gene that encodes the type I intermediate filament protein keratin 13, which is primarily expressed in the suprabasal layers of non-cornified stratified epithelia. As a structural protein, keratin 13 plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and function of epithelial tissues by forming a network with its type II partner, keratin 4 (KRT4). This network is essential for providing mechanical support and resilience to epithelial cells, particularly in tissues such as the oral mucosa (Simonson2020Keratin; Hatta2016Mechanistic). Beyond its structural role, KRT13 is involved in cellular processes such as differentiation and cell cycle regulation, influencing pathways that maintain tissue homeostasis (Simonson2020Keratin). Mutations in the KRT13 gene are linked to White Sponge Nevus, a benign condition, while its altered expression is associated with cancer progression, highlighting its dual significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Kurklu2018Clinical; Yin2022KRT13).

## Structure
Keratin 13 (KRT13) is a type I intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in the suprabasal layers of non-cornified stratified epithelia. Its primary structure consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains, which are characteristic of keratin proteins (Ho2022Update). The secondary structure of KRT13 is characterized by coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the formation of stable heterodimers with type II keratins, such as KRT4 (Simonson2020Keratin; Ho2022Update).

In terms of tertiary structure, these coiled-coil motifs assemble into a filamentous network, providing structural integrity to epithelial cells (Ho2022Update). The quaternary structure involves heterodimerization with type II keratins, which is crucial for the assembly of intermediate filaments (Ho2022Update).

Post-translational modifications of KRT13 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Ho2022Update). These modifications are important for the regulation of keratin filament dynamics and cellular responses to stress. The presence of specific domains and motifs in KRT13 underscores its role in maintaining epithelial cell structure and function.

## Function
Keratin 13 (KRT13) is a type I acidic keratin that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues. It forms a major keratin network with its type II partner, KRT4, in the suprabasal layers of non-cornified stratified squamous epithelium, such as the oral mucosa (Hatta2016Mechanistic). KRT13 is integral to the formation of intermediate filaments, which are essential for providing structural support and resilience to epithelial cells (Simonson2020Keratin).

In healthy human cells, KRT13 is expressed in the suprabasal layers, contributing to the structural integrity and function of these tissues. It is involved in epithelial cell differentiation and helps maintain tissue homeostasis, particularly under mechanical stress (Simonson2020Keratin). The expression of KRT13 is typically high in normal epithelial cells, such as the immortalized human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line, which serves as a model for healthy epithelial cells (Hatta2016Mechanistic).

KRT13's role extends to regulating cell cycle processes, as its absence can lead to the upregulation of Cyclin E1 and E2, which are involved in cell proliferation (Simonson2020Keratin). This suggests that KRT13 influences cell proliferation through these pathways, highlighting its importance in maintaining epithelial cell homeostasis and proper differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT13 gene are associated with White Sponge Nevus (WSN), a benign autosomal dominant disorder characterized by white, spongy plaques in the oral mucosa. These mutations lead to epithelial fragility and hyperkeratosis due to disrupted keratin filament assembly. Several studies have identified specific mutations in KRT13 that cause WSN, including missense mutations such as Y118D and R114C, which are located in critical regions of the keratin protein that affect its structural integrity (Terrinoni2001A; Kurklu2018Clinical; Liu2011Mutational).

Alterations in KRT13 expression are also implicated in cancer progression. In breast cancer, overexpression of KRT13 is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness, promoting proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. This overexpression induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhances stemness, contributing to tumorigenesis and metastasis. The interaction of KRT13 with plakoglobin and desmoplakin is altered, reducing tumor suppressor functions and facilitating cancer progression through mechanisms involving c-Myc signaling (Yin2022KRT13). These findings suggest that KRT13 plays a significant role in both benign and malignant conditions, depending on its expression and mutation status.

## Interactions
Keratin 13 (KRT13) is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence cellular behavior, particularly in the context of cancer. In breast cancer, KRT13 interacts with plakoglobin (PG, also known as γ-catenin) and desmoplakin (DSP), forming complexes that play a role in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. This interaction is significant as it affects the expression and nuclear translocation of PG, which is known for its tumor suppressor functions. By sequestering PG and DSP, KRT13 reduces their tumor-suppressive effects, thereby promoting oncogenic signaling pathways (Yin2022KRT13).

The interaction between KRT13 and PG is particularly important in the context of the plakoglobin/c-Myc signaling pathway. KRT13 overexpression leads to decreased levels of PG and its nuclear translocation, which in turn relieves the inhibition of c-Myc, a key regulator of cell proliferation and stemness. This interaction contributes to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the acquisition of stem cell-like properties in breast cancer cells, promoting metastasis and aggressive tumor behavior (Yin2022KRT13). These findings suggest that KRT13's interactions with PG and DSP are crucial in modulating cancer progression.
