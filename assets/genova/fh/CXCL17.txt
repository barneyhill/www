# CXCL17

## Overview
CXCL17 is a gene that encodes the protein C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 17, a member of the chemokine family known for its role in immune cell recruitment and antimicrobial activity. The CXCL17 protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes a CXC motif formed by conserved cysteine residues, distinguishing it from classical chemokines (Giblin2023CXCL17; Choreño-Parra2020The). Unlike typical chemokines, CXCL17 is primarily expressed at mucosal surfaces, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, where it functions as a chemoattractant for monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, and exhibits broad antimicrobial properties (Giblin2023CXCL17; Xiao2020Mucosal). Recent studies have identified GPR182 as a high-affinity receptor for CXCL17, further elucidating its role in immune modulation and pathogen defense (Meyrath2024ACKR5GPR182). The gene's expression is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Choreño-Parra2020The).

## Structure
The CXCL17 protein is a chemokine encoded by the CXCL17 gene, consisting of 119 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 13,819 Da in humans (Choreño-Parra2020The). The primary structure includes six conserved cysteine residues, which are characteristic of CXC chemokines (Giblin2023CXCL17). The mature form of CXCL17, resulting from post-translational cleavage, has a molecular weight of 11,418 Da and contains four cysteine residues, forming the CXC motif crucial for its function (Xiao2020Mucosal; Choreño-Parra2020The).

Secondary structure predictions suggest that CXCL17 includes several short alpha-helices and random coiled regions, but it does not adopt a classical chemokine fold (Giblin2023CXCL17). The tertiary structure of CXCL17 has been modeled using in silico techniques, indicating a unique conformation with a C-terminal alpha-helix and loose coiled formations (Giblin2023CXCL17). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, with dimers forming along an interface containing exposed C-terminal alpha-helices (Giblin2023CXCL17).

CXCL17 is known to bind glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) through conserved basic residues, which may modulate its activity and enhance its antimicrobial function (Giblin2023CXCL17). Despite its classification as a chemokine, CXCL17's structure and function suggest it may play a role in pathogen defense at mucosal surfaces rather than traditional chemotactic activity (Giblin2023CXCL17).

## Function
CXCL17 is a chemokine primarily expressed at mucosal barriers, such as the airways and gastrointestinal tracts, where it plays a significant role in immune cell recruitment. It acts as a potent chemoattractant for monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, facilitating their migration to mucosal surfaces to interact with antigens from the external environment (Xiao2020Mucosal; Choreño-Parra2020The). CXCL17 is involved in angiogenesis, influencing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other angiogenesis-related genes (Xiao2020Mucosal; Choreño-Parra2020The). It exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, potentially maintaining immune homeostasis by reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and recruiting regulatory immune cells (Xiao2020Mucosal). 

CXCL17 also has broad antimicrobial activity, disrupting bacterial and fungal membranes, and is involved in shaping the mucosal immune system through its interaction with commensal flora (Giblin2023CXCL17; Xiao2020Mucosal). It is expressed in the epithelial barriers of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, suggesting its involvement in the secretion process into the airways and intestinal lumen (Choreño-Parra2020The). Despite its known functions, the specific receptor for CXCL17 was unidentified until recent studies established GPR182 as a high-affinity receptor for CXCL17 (Meyrath2024ACKR5GPR182).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCL17 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions. In cancer, CXCL17 is overexpressed in several types, including breast, colon, gastric, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancer, and is associated with poor survival and recurrence. It promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing cellular proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, inhibition of autophagy, and facilitating metastasis and angiogenesis. CXCL17 also modifies the immune microenvironment by recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), which can inhibit tumor immunity (Choreño-Parra2020The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the CXCL17/CXCR8 axis is regulated by miR-325-3p, which is downregulated in HCC tissues. Overexpression of miR-325-3p inhibits cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis by targeting CXCL17, suggesting that alterations in this axis contribute to HCC progression (Li2021MiR3253p).

CXCL17 is also involved in respiratory conditions such as asthma, where its expression is increased in the bronchial epithelium, potentially serving an anti-inflammatory role. It inhibits the production of molecules involved in eosinophil recruitment and airway remodeling, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker for asthma (Choreño-Parra2020The).

## Interactions
CXCL17 is known to interact with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are crucial for its function in modulating chemokine signaling. It binds effectively to heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate, with a particularly high affinity for heparin. This interaction is facilitated by specific motifs within the CXCL17 sequence, such as the BBXB and BXXBB motifs, which are located between residues 85 and 98 (Giblin2023CXCL17a; Giblin2023CXCL17). The binding of CXCL17 to GAGs is thought to play a role in its ability to modulate the activity of other chemokines, such as CXCL8, by disrupting their GAG binding and thereby inhibiting chemotactic responses (Giblin2023CXCL17a; Giblin2023CXCL17).

CXCL17 also acts as an endogenous inhibitor of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. This inhibition is mediated through a novel mechanism that likely involves GAG-containing accessory proteins. CXCL17 does not affect CXCR4 binding in dissociated membrane preparations, suggesting a unique mechanism of action that may involve forming a 'bridge' between CXCR4 and GAGs or causing clustering of GAGs near the receptor (White2021CXCL17).
