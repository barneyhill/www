# FERMT2

## Overview
FERMT2 is a gene that encodes the protein FERM domain containing kindlin-2, which is a critical component in cellular signaling and structural organization. Kindlin-2 is characterized by its FERM domain, which is integral to its role in integrin signaling and cell adhesion. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its involvement in mediating interactions between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. Kindlin-2 is essential for integrin activation, facilitating cell-extracellular matrix interactions, and is crucial for processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and embryonic development (Bu2021Emerging). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP), also implicate it in neurological processes and diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (Eysert2020Alzheimer’s). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts (Sullivan2018Candidatebased; Chapuis2016Genomewide).

## Structure
FERMT2, also known as kindlin-2, is a protein characterized by its FERM domain, which is crucial for its role in integrin signaling and cell adhesion. The FERM domain is composed of three subdomains: F1, F2, and F3, which typically form a compact clover-leaf conformation. The F1 domain has a ubiquitin-like fold, the F2 domain is primarily α-helical, and the F3 domain resembles PTB, PH, and EVH1 domains (Bu2021Emerging). Kindlin-2 also contains a unique pleckstrin homology (PH) domain within the F2 subdomain, which allows binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PIP2) (Levitskaya2024Mechanistic).

The F0 domain precedes the F1 domain and is involved in binding negatively charged membranes and targeting focal adhesions. The F3 domain binds to integrin β cytoplasmic tails and clathrin heavy chain, modulating clathrin-dependent expression of certain enzymes (Bu2021Emerging). Kindlin-2 can form dimers, which may facilitate integrin clustering (Bu2021Emerging). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, influence kindlin-2's activity and interactions (Chowdhury2024Pancancer). The full-length structure of kindlin-2 is challenging to resolve due to disordered regions, but truncation of certain domains has facilitated crystallization (Bu2021Emerging).

## Function
FERMT2, also known as kindlin-2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in integrin activation, which is essential for cell-extracellular matrix interactions. It is involved in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration by binding to specific motifs on the integrin β cytoplasmic tails, assisting talin in integrin activation, and promoting integrin clustering (Bu2021Emerging). Kindlin-2 is widely expressed in various cell types, except hematopoietic cells, and is essential for embryonic development, as its loss is embryonic lethal in animal models (Bu2021Emerging).

In cellular processes, kindlin-2 forms a homodimer and influences integrin clustering. Its F3 domain binds to the clathrin heavy chain, affecting the expression of enzymes like CD39 and CD73 in endothelial cells. The F0 domain is involved in binding to negatively charged membranes, crucial for cell spreading and migration. The PH domain is important for membrane localization and protein interactions, such as with paxillin, which promotes focal adhesion kinase activation and membrane protrusions (Bu2021Emerging).

Kindlin-2 also forms a transcriptional complex with β-catenin and TCF4 to enhance Wnt signaling, highlighting its diverse functions in cellular signaling and structural organization (Bu2021Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FERMT2 gene, also known as kindlin-2, have been implicated in several diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). FERMT2 is identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and is involved in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism. Alterations in FERMT2 expression can lead to increased levels of mature APP at the cell surface, facilitating APP recycling and resulting in increased production of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, which are central to AD pathology (Eysert2020Alzheimer’s; Chapuis2016Genomewide).

FERMT2 also plays a role in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Silencing FERMT2 in presynaptic neurons decreases synaptic connectivity, while its expression regulates synaptic plasticity in an APP-dependent manner. Impairments in synaptic plasticity due to FERMT2 alterations can be rescued by downregulating APP, indicating a complex interaction between these proteins in AD (Eysert2020Alzheimer’s).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FERMT2 locus have been associated with brain amyloidosis and are linked to amyloid levels in the postmortem brain, further supporting its role in AD (Sullivan2018Candidatebased). These findings highlight FERMT2's significant impact on AD-related processes, particularly through its influence on Aβ and tau proteostasis (Sullivan2018Candidatebased).

## Interactions
FERMT2, also known as kindlin-2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through its F3 domain and the NxTY motif of APP, which is similar to the motif found in Integrin-β3. This interaction is significant for axonal growth and synaptic plasticity, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Eysert2020Alzheimer’s).

FERMT2 also plays a role in integrin activation by binding to the β-integrin tails. It interacts with the β1 and β3-integrin cytoplasmic tails, enhancing talin-mediated integrin activation. This interaction is mediated by the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of FERMT2, and mutations in this domain can disrupt the interaction (Montanez2008Kindlin2).

In addition, FERMT2 interacts with Smurf1, which promotes its polyubiquitination and degradation. The interaction occurs through the WW2 domain of Smurf1 and the N-terminal and FERM domains of FERMT2. A proline-rich (PY) motif in FERMT2 is crucial for this interaction, and mutations in this motif can protect FERMT2 from degradation (Wei2017Smurf1). These interactions highlight FERMT2's role in integrin signaling and its regulation by other proteins.
