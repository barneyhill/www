# METTL2A

## Overview
METTL2A is a gene that encodes the methyltransferase 2A, tRNA N3-cytidine protein, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This protein is primarily involved in the methylation of tRNA molecules, specifically at the N3 position of cytidine, a modification crucial for the stability and function of tRNA, thereby influencing protein synthesis. The METTL2A protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an RNA-binding domain, a methyltransferase domain, and a VCR-conserved domain, each contributing to its role in RNA modification and splicing (Zhang2024METTL). METTL2A forms a functional complex with the DALRD3 protein, which is essential for recognizing and modifying specific tRNA molecules (Lentini2019METTL2). Clinically, METTL2A has been implicated as an oncogene, with its overexpression linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including breast invasive carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2022Integrative; Weijie2022Clinical; Qi2023Methyltransferaselike).

## Structure
The METTL2A protein is part of the METTL family, characterized by a seven Î²-folded chain methyltransferase structure. It includes an N-terminal RNA-binding domain, a methyltransferase domain (MTD), and a C-terminal VCR-conserved domain. The RNA-binding domain consists of approximately the first 40 amino acids, featuring multiple positively charged residues that form a groove for RNA accommodation, facilitating methyl transfer. The methyltransferase domain contains an ordered polypeptide loop, an NPPF motif, and a disordered loop. The ordered polypeptide loop acts as a sensor for intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) molecules, adjusting the methylation efficiency of METTL proteins. The NPPF motif serves as the active site, prompting substrate RNA to bind with SAM and undergo methylation. The disordered loop's charge state influences RNA binding, affecting methylation. The VCR domain, comprising VCR1, VCR2, and a disordered region, is involved in RNA splicing and methylation processes, though its full functions are not completely understood (Zhang2024METTL).

METTL2A forms a complex with the DALRD3 protein, which contains a putative anticodon-binding domain. This complex is necessary for recognizing specific arginine tRNAs for m3C modification (Lentini2019METTL2). The protein is involved in N3-methylcytidine modification of tRNA and is categorized as an oncogene (Qi2023Methyltransferaselike).

## Function
METTL2A is a gene encoding a methyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the methylation of tRNA molecules, specifically at the N3 position of cytidine (m3C) on tRNAs. This modification is essential for the stability and proper functioning of tRNA, impacting protein synthesis. METTL2A, along with METTL2B, modifies the C32 position of tRNA-arginine and tRNA-threonine, which is vital for the translation of mRNAs enriched in AGU codons. These codons require tRNA-Ser-GCT for translation, and the m3C32 modification by METTL2A/2B is necessary for maintaining normal cell cycle progression and DNA repair pathways (Cui2024m3C32).

In healthy human cells, METTL2A is involved in ensuring the fidelity and efficiency of mRNA translation, which is critical for cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. The absence of METTL2A leads to decreased m3C32 modification on tRNA-Ser-GCT, resulting in altered translation efficiency, increased ribosome stalling, and serine codon-biased changes in mRNA translation. This can cause phenotypes such as altered cell cycle, slowed proliferation, and increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (Cui2024m3C32). METTL2A is generally expressed at lower levels in most tissues and is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to efficient translation and cellular homeostasis (He2024METTL).

## Clinical Significance
METTL2A has been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA). It is often overexpressed in BRCA tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages, such as high grade and HER2 positive status (Wang2022Integrative). METTL2A is also linked to genetic alterations, including a notable amplification frequency of approximately 7% in BRCA patients, which correlates with poor overall survival (Wang2022Integrative; Zhang2024METTL). 

In addition to breast cancer, METTL2A is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and correlates with tumor grade and clinical outcomes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for HCC progression (Weijie2022Clinical). The gene's upregulation in various cancers indicates its role in promoting tumor growth and progression, possibly through pathways involved in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (Zhang2024METTL; Campeanu2021Multiomics). 

Drug sensitivity analyses have identified potential therapeutic agents for METTL2A-positive BRCA patients, such as Trifluridine, PD407824, and Taselisib, highlighting its significance in guiding treatment strategies (Wang2022Integrative).

## Interactions
METTL2A forms a complex with the DALRD3 anticodon-domain binding protein to catalyze the formation of 3-methylcytosine (m3C) in specific arginine tRNA isoacceptors, such as tRNA-Arg-CCU and UCU. This interaction is crucial for the recognition and modification of these tRNAs, highlighting the specificity of the METTL2-DALRD3 complex. DALRD3 facilitates the binding of METTL2A/B to these specific tRNAs, suggesting its role in targeting METTL2A/B for m3C modification. The interaction between METTL2A/B and DALRD3 was demonstrated through co-expression experiments in 293T cells, where FLAG-DALRD3 coprecipitated with Strep-METTL2A or 2B, indicating a direct interaction (Lentini2019METTL2).

The METTL2-DALRD3 complex is active for m3C formation on in vitro transcribed tRNA substrates, with specific sequence elements in the anticodon loop being crucial for this activity. DALRD3 recognizes specific arginine tRNAs through these sequence elements to facilitate METTL2A-dependent methylation (Lentini2019METTL2). The presence of DALRD3 is essential for m3C modification in human cells, and its knockout results in the loss of m3C modification in targeted tRNAs (Lentini2019METTL2).
