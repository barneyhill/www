# CFAP20DC

## Overview
The CFAP20DC gene encodes the CFAP20 domain containing protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a structural protein, playing a crucial role in the organization and function of cilia and flagella. CFAP20 domain containing proteins are essential for the proper motility and structural integrity of these organelles, which are vital for cell movement and signaling. Mutations or dysregulation of the CFAP20DC gene can lead to defects in ciliary function, potentially resulting in a range of ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by dysfunctional cilia (Qiu2020aarFDC).
