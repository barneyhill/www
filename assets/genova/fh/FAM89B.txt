# FAM89B

## Overview
FAM89B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 89 member B. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of signaling pathways such as the TGF-β pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and differentiation. FAM89B has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, otosclerosis, and sepsis, highlighting its potential role as a biomarker and therapeutic target. The gene's expression levels have been associated with clinical outcomes in breast cancer, where it may serve as a predictive marker for metastasis-free survival. Additionally, FAM89B's involvement in bone metabolism and immune response further underscores its significance in human health and disease (Wen2024Identification; Ibragimova2022Whole; Mironova2017The; Rämö2020Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FAM89B gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, low levels of FAM89B expression are linked to an unfavorable outcome in terms of metastatic-free survival (MFS). FAM89B is part of a gene signature where high expression is considered favorable, showing significant predictive value for MFS, suggesting its potential as a marker for predicting hematogenous metastasis in breast cancer patients with residual tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Ibragimova2022Whole).

In the context of otosclerosis, FAM89B is located in chromosome 11 and is associated with the expression of lead variants in otosclerosis susceptibility loci. It may regulate TGFβ signaling, which plays a crucial role in bone metabolism and remodeling, potentially impacting conditions like otosclerosis (Rämö2020Genomewide).

FAM89B is also implicated in sepsis, where it is significantly upregulated and associated with an increased risk of the condition. This suggests that FAM89B may play a role in the pathogenesis of sepsis, potentially serving as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Wen2024Identification).

Additionally, FAM89B has been identified as a suppressor of the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is associated with tumor-promoting activities. Its upregulation following RNase A treatment suggests a role in suppressing tumor progression through the negative regulation of this pathway (Mironova2017The).
