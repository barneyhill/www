# CST1

## Overview
CST1 is a gene that encodes the protein cystatin SN, a member of the cystatin superfamily, which functions as a cysteine protease inhibitor. Cystatin SN is primarily involved in the regulation of proteolytic activity, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and modulating immune responses. It is predominantly expressed in various glands and epithelial tissues, where it inhibits cysteine peptidases, thereby contributing to tissue protection and immune defense. The protein is characterized by its ability to form disulfide bonds, which stabilize its structure and enhance its inhibitory function. Cystatin SN is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression, where it influences tumor invasiveness and metastasis by interacting with proteases such as cathepsins B and L. Additionally, CST1's role in immune modulation and its involvement in cellular processes like the epithelial-mesenchymal transition highlight its significance in both health and disease (Dickinson2002Expression; Li2022CST1; Kim2013Cystatin).

## Structure
Cystatin SN (CST1) is a cysteine protease inhibitor with a molecular structure characterized by several key features. The primary structure of CST1 includes a Leu-rich secretory leader peptide at its N-terminus, which is essential for its secretion (Kim2013Cystatin). The protein contains a central QxVxG consensus sequence crucial for its cysteine protease inhibitory activity (Kim2013Cystatin). 

The tertiary structure of CST1 is stabilized by four cysteine residues that form two disulfide bonds at the C-terminus, contributing to its structural stability and extracellular secretion (Kim2013Cystatin). These disulfide bonds are necessary for CST1's ability to neutralize the inhibitory effect of cystatin C (CST3) on cathepsin B (CTSB) activity (Kim2013Cystatin). 

CST1 shares conserved amino acid sequences and structural features with other cystatins, including two beta-hairpin loops, L1 and L2, which are important for inhibiting papain cysteine proteases (Kim2013Cystatin). The protein does not undergo phosphorylation at the Ser residue in its mutants (Kim2013Cystatin). The expression of CST1 is upregulated in certain conditions, such as colorectal cancer, where it plays a role in tumorigenesis by counteracting CST3's inhibition of CTSB (Kim2013Cystatin).

## Function
CST1, also known as cystatin SN, is a cysteine protease inhibitor that plays a significant role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and immune modulation in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in the submandibular and lacrimal glands, as well as in the epithelial lining of the gallbladder and seminal vesicle, and is also detected in tracheal glands (Dickinson2002Expression). CST1 inhibits cysteine peptidases, which are enzymes involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components and modulation of immune responses, thus contributing to tissue protection and homeostasis (Dickinson2002Expression).

Cystatin SN is involved in inhibiting papain-like cysteine peptidases, which are crucial during processes like inflammation and cancer, and may also inhibit pathogen cysteine peptidases, aiding in host defense against infections (Dickinson2002Expression). In the oral cavity, CST1 contributes to mineral homeostasis by binding to hydroxyapatite and inhibiting calcium phosphate crystal growth, and it may protect against dietary plant cysteine peptidases that can degrade salivary proteins (Dickinson2002Expression).

CST1 is also implicated in preventing cellular senescence by modulating the activity of cathepsin B and glycogen synthase kinase 3β, thereby preventing abnormal glycogen accumulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Oh2017Extracellular). This regulation is crucial for preventing cellular senescence and promoting normal cell proliferation (Oh2017Extracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CST1 gene, which encodes the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin SN, have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancers. In gastric cancer, CST1 is significantly upregulated in both primary and metastatic tissues, correlating with poor prognosis and lower survival rates. CST1 promotes gastric cancer cell migration and invasion by stabilizing the GPX4 protein, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis, a form of cell death. This stabilization is achieved through the recruitment of OTUB1, which reduces GPX4 ubiquitination and decreases intracellular reactive oxygen species (Li2022CST1). CST1 also plays a role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis, by upregulating mesenchymal markers and downregulating epithelial markers (Li2022CST1).

In colorectal cancer, CST1 expression is upregulated, while the expression of the let-7d miRNA, which negatively regulates CST1, is downregulated. This dysregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and activation of the NNF-κB p65 pathway, which is involved in cell survival and inflammation (Jiang2018Let‑7d). CST1 is also implicated in gallbladder cancer, where it is upregulated by BRD9, promoting cancer progression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Qiang2024BRD9).

## Interactions
Cystatin SN, encoded by the CST1 gene, is primarily known for its role as a cysteine protease inhibitor. It interacts with proteases such as cathepsins B and L, inhibiting their activity. This interaction is significant in various biological processes, including cancer progression and immune response regulation (Zhang2023Type; Fukuoka2019Human). In cancer, CST1 has a higher affinity for cathepsin B, and its overexpression can neutralize the inhibitory effect of CYSC on cathepsin B, enhancing tumor invasiveness (Zhang2023Type).

CST1 also plays a role in immune modulation by acting as a competitive inhibitor of IFN-γ, binding to IFNGR1/2, and inhibiting the JAK/STAT1 pathway. This interaction promotes M2 macrophage polarization, contributing to anti-inflammatory responses (Zhang2023Type). In allergic rhinitis, CST1 inhibits pollen protease activities, protecting the nasal epithelial barrier and maintaining tight junction integrity (Fukuoka2019Human).

While CST1's interactions with other proteins are well-documented, specific details on its interactions with nucleic acids or its involvement in multiprotein complexes are not provided in the available context.
