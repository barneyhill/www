# AARS1

## Overview
AARS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme alanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (AlaRS), which is a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid alanine to its corresponding tRNA, a process essential for translating genetic information into proteins (MeyerSchuman2022A). AlaRS is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis, particularly in peripheral neurons (Sung2022Functional). Beyond its canonical role, AlaRS is involved in various cellular processes, including acting as a lactyltransferase and interacting with components of the Hippo signaling pathway, which influences cell proliferation (Ju2024The). Mutations in AARS1 are linked to several neurological disorders, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2N and distal hereditary motor neuropathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Høyer2022Clinical; Zhao2012AlanyltRNA).

## Structure
The AARS1 gene encodes the alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), which is responsible for attaching alanine to its corresponding tRNA. The protein structure of AlaRS includes several distinct domains: the N-terminal catalytic domain, the tRNA binding domain, the editing domain, and the C-terminal domain (C-Ala) (Zhang2020The). The C-Ala domain, initially termed the 'dimerization domain,' consists of a helical subdomain for dimerization and a globular subdomain for tRNA binding. In humans, this domain has evolved to lose its tRNA binding activity but can enter the nucleus and bind DNA, indicating a novel function (Zhang2020The).

AlaRS functions predominantly as a monomer in humans, unlike its archaeal and bacterial counterparts, which require dimerization for aminoacylation. The dimerization in human AlaRS occurs through the C-Ala domain rather than the catalytic domain (Zhang2020The). Post-translational modifications of AARS1 include methylation at lysine 943 by METTL21C, particularly in muscle tissue (Zoabi2020Methyltransferaselike). Splice variants of AlaRS have been identified, some lacking catalytic activity but retaining the C-Ala domain, suggesting non-enzymatic roles in biological activities such as cytoprotection and inflammatory responses (Zhang2020The).

## Function
The AARS1 gene encodes alanyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme that plays a critical role in protein synthesis by attaching alanine to its corresponding tRNA, a process known as aminoacylation. This activity is essential for translating genetic information into functional proteins, ensuring accurate protein assembly, which is vital for cellular function and organismal development (MeyerSchuman2022A). In healthy human cells, AARS1 functions as a homodimer, meaning it forms a complex with another identical molecule to perform its function effectively (MeyerSchuman2022A). This dimerization is crucial for maintaining protein stability and function, particularly in peripheral neurons, where it ensures the correct charging of tRNA with alanine (MeyerSchuman2022A).

AARS1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it coordinates with other cellular components to maintain the fidelity of protein synthesis in response to the cell's nutrient and energy status (Sung2022Functional). The enzyme's activity is regulated by intracellular concentrations of l-alanine, which competes with other metabolites for binding, influencing its function in protein synthesis (Ju2024The). This regulation ensures that AARS1 can adapt to varying cellular conditions, maintaining homeostasis and supporting normal cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AARS1 gene, which encodes alanyl-tRNA synthetase 1, are associated with several neurological disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to AARS1 mutations is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2N (CMT2N), a hereditary neuropathy characterized by degeneration of motor and sensory nerves, leading to muscle weakness and sensory disturbances. Specific mutations such as p.Arg326Trp, p.Arg329His, and p.Gln855Arg have been identified in patients with CMT2N, affecting the enzyme's function and contributing to the disease phenotype (Høyer2022Clinical; Lee2020AlanyltRNA).

AARS1 mutations are also implicated in distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN), a condition similar to CMT but primarily affecting motor neurons (Zhao2012AlanyltRNA). Additionally, mutations in AARS1 have been linked to non-photosensitive trichothiodystrophy (NPS-TTD), a disorder characterized by developmental delays and hair abnormalities, due to protein instability and reduced aminoacylation activity (Botta2021Protein).

Alterations in AARS1 expression or function can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory responses, which are relevant to the pathophysiology of these diseases (Høyer2022Clinical). The clinical spectrum of AARS1-related disorders is diverse, reflecting the gene's critical role in protein synthesis and cellular function.

## Interactions
AARS1, or alanyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is known for its interactions with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes beyond its traditional function in protein synthesis. AARS1 acts as a lactyltransferase, interacting with the YAP-TEAD1 complex, a critical component of the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the lactylation of YAP and TEAD1, which promotes cell proliferation in gastric cancer. The lactylation process is enhanced by the presence of lactate, indicating that AARS1 functions as a sensor of intracellular lactate levels (Ju2024The).

AARS1 also interacts with histone proteins H3 and H4, facilitating their lactylation in a process dependent on lactate and ATP. This interaction is confirmed through GST pull-down assays and in vitro experiments (Ju2024The). Additionally, AARS1 binds to importin KPNA4, promoting its nuclear translocation in response to lactate (Ju2024The).

In the context of neuropathy-associated mutations, AARS1 can dimerize with wild-type AARS1, as demonstrated in studies using HEK293T cells. This dimerization is necessary for the dominant-negative effects observed in certain mutations (MeyerSchuman2022A).
