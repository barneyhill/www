# ABCA13

## Overview
ABCA13 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 13 (ABCA13) protein, which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. This protein is notable for being the largest ABC transporter identified, comprising 5,058 amino acids and characterized by its complex structure, including twelve transmembrane helices and two nucleotide-binding domains (Nakato2021ABCA13; Prades2002The). ABCA13 is primarily involved in the transport of lipids, such as cholesterol and gangliosides, across cellular membranes, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and synaptic function (Nakato2021ABCA13). The gene's expression is widespread in human tissues, with significant implications for neurological health, as alterations in ABCA13 have been associated with psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Knight2009A; Nakato2021ABCA13). The protein's function and its potential involvement in disease highlight its importance in both cellular biology and clinical research.

## Structure
The ABCA13 protein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily and is characterized by a complex structure. It is the largest ABC protein described, consisting of 5,058 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 570 kDa (Nakato2021ABCA13; Prades2002The). The protein structure includes twelve predicted transmembrane helices and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which are typical features of ABC transporters (Nakato2021ABCA13; Prades2002The). These domains are characterized by conserved Walker A, Walker B, and ABC signature motifs (Nakato2021ABCA13).

ABCA13 also features two large extracellular domains, which are involved in substrate recognition and transport (Prades2002The). The protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms with varying lengths, ranging from 2,654 to 5,058 amino acids (Prades2002The). A shorter variant of the protein, lacking the N-terminal region, has been identified with a molecular mass of about 260 kDa (Maeß2013Evidence; Nakato2021ABCA13). This shorter variant retains essential structural motifs and is considered physiologically relevant (Maeß2013Evidence). The presence of these splice variants suggests a regulatory mechanism that may influence the protein's function and localization.

## Function
ABCA13 is a transmembrane protein involved in the internalization and transport of lipids, particularly cholesterol and gangliosides, from the plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles. This process is facilitated by endocytic retrograde transport and requires the long N-terminal region of ABCA13 and ATP hydrolysis (Nakato2021ABCA13). The protein is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, and is part of the ABCA subfamily known for lipid transport (Nakato2021ABCA13).

In cellular biology, ABCA13 plays a role in maintaining vesicular cholesterol concentration, which is crucial for synaptic vesicle endocytosis in neurons. This function is highlighted by studies on Abca13 knockout mice, which show impaired vesicular cholesterol accumulation and synaptic function (Nakato2021ABCA13). The protein's activity in the plasma membrane influences cellular lipid composition, impacting processes like membrane fluidity and signaling (Prades2002The).

ABCA13's role in cholesterol trafficking and synaptic function suggests its involvement in broader physiological processes, potentially linking its dysfunction to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression, although these associations remain controversial (Nakato2021ABCA13).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ABCA13 gene have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Studies have identified rare coding variants in ABCA13, such as nonsense and missense mutations, which are more frequent in individuals with these conditions compared to controls. These variants are associated with increased risk, with odds ratios indicating a higher susceptibility to these disorders (Knight2009A). The population attributable risk of these mutations is estimated to be 2.2% for schizophrenia and 4.0% for bipolar disorder (Knight2009A).

Research has also linked ABCA13 to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neuropsychiatric conditions. Variants in the gene have been associated with synaptic vesicle trafficking disruptions, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders (GerikCelebi2023Association). In a monkey model of ASD, ABCA13 deletion led to significant neuropathological changes, suggesting its role in neuronal maturation and network function (Iritani2018The).

ABCA13 dysfunction is thought to impair cholesterol trafficking and synaptic vesicle endocytosis, processes crucial for neuronal function. This impairment has been demonstrated in studies using knockout models, which show deficits in sensorimotor gating, a feature often disrupted in psychiatric conditions (Nakato2021ABCA13).
