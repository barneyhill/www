# FAM107A

## Overview
FAM107A is a gene that encodes the protein known as family with sequence similarity 107 member A, also referred to as DRR1. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of actin dynamics and stress response, and is characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain and a nuclear localization signal, suggesting its activity in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Kiwerska2017Combined; Ou2022Identification). FAM107A is widely expressed in human tissues, particularly in the nervous system, indicating its potential role in neuronal development and function (Ou2022Identification). The protein interacts with components of the histone acetyltransferase complex, implicating it in chromatin modification and gene transcription regulation (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). Additionally, FAM107A is considered a potential tumor suppressor, with its expression often downregulated in various cancers, including bladder, renal, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (Kiwerska2017Combined). This downregulation is frequently due to chromosomal deletions and promoter hypermethylation, contributing to tumor progression and highlighting its clinical significance as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and therapeutic interventions (Ou2022Identification; Kiwerska2017Combined).

## Function
FAM107A, also known as DRR1, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of actin dynamics and stress response. The protein is involved in modulating actin filamentous (F-actin) dynamics, which is crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal organization and cellular structure (Ou2022Identification). FAM107A contains a coiled-coil domain and a nuclear localization signal, indicating its activity in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it may influence gene transcription and signal transduction (Kiwerska2017Combined).

In healthy human cells, FAM107A is widely expressed, especially in the nervous system, suggesting a role in neuronal development and function (Ou2022Identification). The protein's interaction with transcriptional adaptor proteins, such as Tada2α and Tada3α, which are part of the histone acetyltransferase complex, implies a role in chromatin modification and gene transcription regulation (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). This interaction may influence chromatin structure, thereby affecting gene expression patterns essential for normal cellular function.

Overall, FAM107A's involvement in cytoskeletal organization and gene transcription highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological stress, contributing to its potential role as a tumor suppressor in various contexts.

## Clinical Significance
FAM107A is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a potential tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is often downregulated in several cancer types, including bladder, renal, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In LSCC, FAM107A is frequently silenced through a combination of chromosomal deletions and promoter hypermethylation, which leads to its inactivation and contributes to tumor progression (Kiwerska2017Combined). This epigenetic silencing is reversible, as treatment with demethylating agents like Decitabine can restore FAM107A expression, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies (Kiwerska2017Combined).

In renal cell carcinoma, reduced FAM107A expression is associated with poorer cancer-free survival and is linked to aggressive tumor characteristics such as higher histological grades and distant metastasis (Gotoh2014Comprehensive). The gene's downregulation is also correlated with poor prognosis in other cancers, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Ou2022Identification).

FAM107A's expression is negatively correlated with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability in several cancers, indicating its potential role in predicting immunotherapy responses (Ou2022Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FAM107A in cancer prognosis and its potential as a biomarker for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
FAM107A, also known as DRR1, is involved in several protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes such as chromatin remodeling and cytoskeletal organization. FAM107A interacts with transcriptional adaptor proteins Tada2α and Tada3α, which are core components of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex. This interaction implies that FAM107A may modulate the structure and function of HAT complexes, influencing chromatin structure and gene transcription (Frijters2010Prednisolone-induced; NAKAJIMA2012Loss).

FAM107A also interacts with F-actin, indicating a role in actin filament dynamics. This interaction is significant in processes such as cell movement and invasion, particularly in the context of cancer (Ou2022Identification). Additionally, FAM107A forms a complex with COMMD1, which affects NF-kB degradation and cell cycle progression, highlighting its involvement in regulatory pathways that control cell proliferation and apoptosis (Ou2022Identification).

These interactions underscore FAM107A's potential dual role in tumor suppression and promotion, as it can influence both gene expression and cytoskeletal dynamics, contributing to its complex function in cancer biology.
