# PDLIM2

## Overview
PDLIM2 is a gene that encodes the protein PDZ and LIM domain 2, which is a multifunctional adaptor or scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain and a LIM domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions. As a nuclear ubiquitin E3 ligase, PDZ and LIM domain 2 is crucial in regulating transcription factors, particularly STAT3, by targeting it for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This function is vital for modulating immune responses and inflammation, as well as maintaining cellular homeostasis through actin cytoskeleton regulation. PDLIM2's interactions with actin-associated proteins underscore its role in stabilizing actin dynamics, which is essential for podocyte function and the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. Additionally, PDLIM2 is implicated in various cancers, where its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and therapeutic resistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tanaka2011PDLIM2; Sun2019Causative; Sistani2011Pdlim2).

## Structure
PDLIM2 is a protein characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain and a LIM domain, which are crucial for its function as an adaptor or scaffold protein. The PDZ domain is a well-characterized protein-protein interaction scaffold, typically recognizing short sequences at the C-terminus of interacting proteins called PDZ binding motifs (PDZbm) (healy2023pdlim). The PDZ domain of PDLIM2 is a classic type I PDZ domain, consisting of five beta-strands and three alpha-helices, forming an anti-parallel beta-sheet (Yu2011PDlim2). Specific residues, such as Arg16 and Lys31, are critical for binding interactions, particularly with the NS1 protein of the H5N1 influenza virus (Yu2011PDlim2).

The LIM domain, approximately 55 amino acids long, forms a two zinc-finger-like structure by coordinating two zinc ions, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Krcmery2010Nucleocytoplasmic). PDLIM2 is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and localization (healy2023pdlim). The protein's structure allows it to interact with actin-associated proteins, playing a role in actin organization and membrane trafficking (healy2023pdlim).

## Function
PDLIM2 (PDZ and LIM domain 2) is a protein that functions as a nuclear ubiquitin E3 ligase, playing a crucial role in regulating the activity of transcription factors, particularly STAT3. It targets STAT3 for polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby inhibiting STAT3-mediated signaling pathways. This regulation is essential for controlling the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into T helper 17 (TH17) cells, which are involved in immune responses and inflammation (Tanaka2011PDLIM2). PDLIM2's ability to bind both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of STAT3 highlights its role in modulating STAT3 activity in various states (Tanaka2011PDLIM2).

In the context of the immune system, PDLIM2 helps prevent excessive inflammation by limiting the differentiation of TH17 cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 (Tanaka2011PDLIM2). PDLIM2 is also involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the actin cytoskeleton in podocyte foot processes, which is crucial for the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier in the kidney (Sistani2011Pdlim2). Its interaction with actin-associated proteins like α-actinin-4 and angiomotin-like-1 further underscores its role in stabilizing actin dynamics (Sistani2011Pdlim2).

## Clinical Significance
PDLIM2 is implicated in various cancers, particularly lung cancer, where its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and therapeutic resistance. In lung cancer, PDLIM2 expression is often epigenetically repressed through promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation, processes linked to tobacco smoking and increased expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Sun2019Causative). This repression contributes to tumorigenesis and resistance to therapies, including chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 treatments (Sun2019Causative).

PDLIM2 downregulation in lung cancer cells leads to increased NF-κB activity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of HIF-1α, promoting tumor growth and inflammation (Yang2024Tumor). In alveolar macrophages, PDLIM2 repression by ROS-activated BACH1 contributes to lung tumorigenesis by promoting a protumorigenic state and suppressing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Li2021PDLIM2).

In colorectal cancer, PDLIM2 loss is associated with immune escape and altered NF-κB signaling, contributing to cancer progression (Oh2017Exome). PDLIM2 repression through DNA methylation is also observed in colon and breast cancers, where it affects NF-κB activation and tumorigenicity (Qu2010Epigenetic; Qu2010DNA). These findings highlight PDLIM2 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
PDLIM2 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In podocytes, PDLIM2 interacts with actin-associated proteins such as α-actinin-4 and angiomotin-like-1 (AMOTL1). These interactions are crucial for stabilizing stress fibers and regulating actin dynamics, which are essential for maintaining podocyte structure and function (Sistani2011Pdlim2). The interaction with α-actinin-4, a known regulator of actin assembly, is particularly significant as mutations in α-actinin-4 are associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a kidney disease (Sistani2011Pdlim2).

PDLIM2 also interacts with the NS1 protein of the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A virus. This interaction is mediated by the PDZ domain of PDLIM2 and the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) of NS1, specifically the ESEV sequence, which is associated with high pathogenicity in H5N1 strains. The interaction is dependent on specific residues, Arg16 and Lys31, in the PDZ domain of PDLIM2, which facilitate binding through charge interactions (Yu2011PDlim2). This selective interaction suggests a potential role for PDLIM2 in the pathogenicity of influenza viruses (Yu2011PDlim2).
