# E2F6

## Overview
E2F6 is a gene that encodes the E2F transcription factor 6, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors known for its role as a transcriptional repressor. Unlike other E2F family members, E2F6 lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain, which is essential for transcription activation, and instead functions independently of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) (LAFTA2019E2F6). The E2F6 protein is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during the S phase, by repressing E2F target genes that are activated at the G1/S transition (Giangrande2004A). It achieves this through interactions with various protein complexes, including the polycomb group proteins and components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, indicating its role in chromatin modification and epigenetic silencing (Leung2012E2F6; Dahlet2021E2F6). E2F6's function in transcriptional repression and its potential implications in cancer highlight its significance in cellular regulation and disease contexts (Wu2021The).

## Structure
E2F6 is a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, characterized by its role as a transcriptional repressor. Unlike other E2F family members, E2F6 lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain, which is necessary for transcription activation and interaction with pocket proteins such as the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) (LAFTA2019E2F6). E2F6 contains a DNA-binding domain and a marked box domain, both crucial for its function in gene repression. The DNA-binding domain is essential for binding to target promoters, as demonstrated by a mutant E2F6 with a point mutation in this domain, which failed to bind and repress the Tuba3a promoter (Dahlet2021E2F6).

E2F6 can form complexes with other proteins, such as the polycomb group proteins, leading to transcriptional repression of E2F-responsive genes (LAFTA2019E2F6). It also interacts with components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, including BRG1, indicating its involvement in larger protein complexes (Leung2012E2F6). E2F6's interaction with these complexes suggests a potential quaternary structure, although specific details on its primary, secondary, or tertiary structures are not provided in the available context. The protein's activity may be influenced by post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context.

## Function
E2F6 is a transcriptional repressor within the E2F family, playing a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly during the S phase. It functions independently of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, distinguishing it from other E2F family members that require Rb interaction for their activity (Giangrande2004A; Leung2012E2F6). E2F6 specifically represses E2F target genes that are activated at the G1/S transition, thereby contributing to the temporal control of gene expression as cells progress through the S phase (Giangrande2004A).

E2F6 is involved in chromatin remodeling, potentially recruiting polycomb group proteins and histone methyltransferases to repress target genes, although it can also repress transcription independent of histone methylation (Giangrande2004A; Xu2007A). It forms complexes with other proteins, such as Mga and Max, during the G0 phase, which may help repress Myc- and Brachyury-responsive genes (Giangrande2004A).

In healthy cells, E2F6 is not essential for cell proliferation, as its absence can be compensated by other E2F family members like E2F4, which can bind to the same promoters during the S phase (Giangrande2004A; Xu2007A). This redundancy highlights the complex regulatory network within the E2F family, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and gene expression regulation.

## Clinical Significance
E2F6 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly in its role as a transcriptional repressor. In gastric cancer, high levels of E2F6 expression have been observed in gastric adenocarcinoma without lymph node metastasis, suggesting a potential suppressive role in metastasis. This expression pattern is negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis, indicating that E2F6 might contribute to better survival outcomes in gastric cancer (Wu2021The).

In ovarian cancer, E2F6 expression was analyzed for its impact on overall survival. However, the study found that E2F6 expression did not significantly affect disease-free or overall survival, suggesting that its role in ovarian cancer prognosis might be limited (Reimer2007Clinical).

E2F6's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its potential role in chromatin silencing through histone methylation have been studied, but its direct impact on specific diseases through these pathways remains unclear. While E2F6 interacts with Polycomb group proteins and binds to HOX gene promoters, its knockdown did not significantly affect histone modification levels, indicating that E2F6 may not play a critical role in HOX gene silencing (Xu2007A). Overall, E2F6's clinical significance in cancer appears to be context-dependent, with varying effects based on cancer type and expression levels.

## Interactions
E2F6 is a transcription factor that participates in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. Unlike other E2F family members, E2F6 does not bind to pocket proteins and represses transcription through RB-independent mechanisms (Leung2012E2F6). It interacts with BRG1, the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, and BAF155, a BRG1-associated factor, suggesting its involvement in chromatin remodeling (Leung2012E2F6). E2F6 also associates with DP1 and DP2 proteins, which are known to interact with E2Fs, forming complexes that regulate gene transcription (Leung2012E2F6).

E2F6 is part of the polybromo-containing SWI/SNF complex, PBAF, and interacts with components such as BAF155 and BAF180 (Leung2012E2F6). It is involved in the repression of E2F-target genes during the S phase of the cell cycle, often working in conjunction with E2F4 (Giangrande2004A). E2F6 also interacts with the PRC1.6 complex, including proteins like MAX, MGA, and L3MBTL2, indicating its role in epigenetic silencing during embryonic development (Dahlet2021E2F6). These interactions highlight E2F6's multifaceted role in transcriptional repression and chromatin modification.
