# MFSD1

## Overview
MFSD1, or major facilitator superfamily domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a lysosomal membrane protein belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters. These transporters are integral membrane proteins involved in the translocation of small solutes across cellular membranes. The MFSD1 protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains and a dileucine-based sorting motif, which is essential for its lysosomal localization (Massa2019The; Perland2016The). It plays a significant role in maintaining liver homeostasis and is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression levels in the kidney and spleen (Massa2019The). The protein forms a complex with its accessory subunit GLMP, which is crucial for its stability and function within lysosomes (López2020Characterization). MFSD1's function is closely tied to lysosomal membrane stability, and its deficiency is linked to severe liver disease and increased tumor cell migration in various cancers (Massa2019The; Roblek2022The).

## Structure
MFSD1 is a lysosomal membrane protein that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and is characterized by having 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Massa2019The; Perland2016The). The protein is non-glycosylated, as confirmed by the lack of molecular weight change upon treatment with endoglycosidases (Massa2019The). It contains a dileucine-based sorting motif near its cytosolic N-terminus, which is crucial for its lysosomal localization. Mutation of this motif results in mislocalization to the plasma membrane (Massa2019The).

The tertiary structure of MFSD1 suggests it forms a pore, potentially allowing substrate transport, with both N- and C-terminals located in the cytoplasm (Perland2016The). Homology modeling has identified 12 possible transmembrane helices, and the protein's structure was aligned against MFS protein templates, resulting in a global model quality estimation (GMQE) value of 0.47 (Perland2016The).

MFSD1 can form homodimers, as shown by immunoblot analyses and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, although it is not inherently oligomeric (López2020Characterization). The interaction with its accessory subunit GLMP is essential for its stability and function, although MFSD1 can form homodimers independently of GLMP (López2020Characterization).

## Function
The MFSD1 gene encodes a lysosomal membrane protein that is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters, which are involved in the transport of small solutes across cellular membranes (Massa2019The). MFSD1 is a polytopic lysosomal transporter protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining liver homeostasis by facilitating lysosomal transport processes (Massa2019The). It is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the kidney and spleen (Massa2019The).

The protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains and contains a dileucine-based sorting motif near its cytosolic N-terminus, which is essential for its localization to lysosomes (Massa2019The). MFSD1 interacts with the accessory subunit GLMP to form a stable lysosomal transporter complex, which is crucial for the stability and proper lysosomal localization of both proteins (López2020Characterization; Massa2019The). This interaction begins in the endoplasmic reticulum and affects their intracellular sorting (López2020Characterization).

In MFSD1 knockout mice, the absence of this protein leads to severe liver disease, characterized by extravasation of erythrocytes, sinusoidal damage, and loss of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, highlighting its essential role in liver function (Massa2019The). The exact substrates of MFSD1 remain unidentified, but its function is closely tied to lysosomal membrane stability and protection from proteolysis (Massa2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MFSD1 gene have been linked to several pathological conditions. In the liver, MFSD1 is crucial for maintaining homeostasis, and its deficiency leads to severe liver disease characterized by sinusoidal damage, fibrosis, and increased liver tumors as mice age. This is due to the loss of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and the extravasation of erythrocytes, which results in direct contact between hepatocytes and blood, contributing to liver dysfunction (Massa2019The).

In cancer, MFSD1 plays a role in regulating tumor cell migration and metastasis. Reduced expression of MFSD1 is associated with increased β1-integrin activation, which enhances tumor cell migration and metastasis. This is observed in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer, where low MFSD1 expression correlates with poor prognosis. The gene's role in stabilizing inactive β1-integrin and reducing its activation index suggests that MFSD1 acts as a suppressor of metastasis (Roblek2021The; Roblek2022The).

The interaction between MFSD1 and its accessory subunit GLMP is also critical. Deficiency in either protein leads to similar liver pathologies, indicating their interdependence for stability and function. This suggests that disruptions in the MFSD1/GLMP complex could contribute to metabolic diseases affecting the liver (Massa2019The; López2020Characterization).

## Interactions
MFSD1 interacts with its accessory subunit GLMP, forming a complex that is crucial for the stability and function of MFSD1 in lysosomes. This interaction is essential for protecting MFSD1 from lysosomal proteolysis, as GLMP stabilizes MFSD1 and prevents its degradation. The interaction between MFSD1 and GLMP is specific, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and FACS-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses, which confirm their close proximity and direct physical interaction (Massa2019The; López2020Characterization).

The MFSD1-GLMP complex is believed to form in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before being transported to lysosomes, indicating that their interaction affects intracellular trafficking. The luminal domain of GLMP is critical for this interaction, which is distinct from other transporter-accessory subunit pairs where the transmembrane domain is crucial (López2020Characterization).

MFSD1 can also form homodimers independently of GLMP. This dimerization was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and FRET analyses, suggesting that MFSD1 can form homodimers with the C-terminus of one molecule close to the N-terminus of its dimerization partner (López2020Characterization). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving MFSD1 and its role in lysosomal function.
