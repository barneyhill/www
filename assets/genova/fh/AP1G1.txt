# AP1G1

## Overview
The AP1G1 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit gamma 1, a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1). This protein is integral to clathrin-mediated vesicle transport, a process essential for intracellular trafficking and protein sorting between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. As a part of the AP-1 complex, the AP1G1 protein plays a pivotal role in the maturation of endosomes and the recycling of membrane proteins, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. The protein is characterized by specific domains that facilitate interactions with other proteins, underscoring its importance in vesicle formation and transport. Mutations in the AP1G1 gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders and other pathologies, highlighting its significance in normal cellular and developmental processes (Usmani2021De; Mignani2023Deficiency).

## Structure
The AP1G1 gene encodes the gamma-1 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1), which is involved in clathrin-mediated vesicle transport. The protein is predicted to have four transmembrane domains followed by an alpha adaptin C2 domain at the carboxy terminus (Usmani2021De). The gamma-1 adaptin subunit is crucial for the functional integrity of the AP-1 complex, which is a heterotetrameric structure consisting of two large subunits (beta-1 and gamma-1 adaptins), one medium (mu-type), and one small (sigma-type) subunit (Johnson2016A).

The AP1G1 protein contains specific domains such as the gamma-adaptin ear domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions. This domain is involved in recruiting co-adaptors and accessory proteins necessary for vesicle formation (Mignani2023Deficiency). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, while the quaternary structure refers to its assembly with other subunits in the AP-1 complex (Mignani2023Deficiency).

Mutations in the AP1G1 gene can lead to significant impacts on the protein's secondary structure, folding, and interactions due to amino acid substitutions, as indicated by in silico tools and 3D protein modeling (Usmani2021De).

## Function
The AP1G1 gene encodes the gamma-1 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1), which is crucial for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. These vesicles are involved in the intracellular trafficking of proteins between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes, playing a significant role in protein sorting and transport within cells (Usmani2021De; Mignani2023Deficiency). In healthy human cells, AP1G1 is primarily localized in the perinuclear region and colocalizes with clathrin-coated pits, recycling endosomes, lysosomes, and the TGN. This localization is essential for its role in the endosomal recycling pathway, facilitating the recycling of transferrin through recycling endosomes (Usmani2021De).

The AP1G1 protein is involved in the maturation of early endosomes into late, multivesicular body endosomes by forming a complex that activates the Rab5-Vps34 pathway, which increases phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate levels. This process is crucial for protein transport and endosome maturation (Mignani2023Deficiency). The AP1G1 complex also plays a role in the specification of neuronal and epithelial cells, with its dysfunction potentially leading to various pathologies due to mislocalized membrane proteins in polarized cells (Mignani2023Deficiency). The AP1G1 gene is highly intolerant to variations, indicating its essential role in maintaining normal cellular functions (Usmani2021De).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP1G1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Variants in AP1G1 have been linked to developmental delay, intellectual disability (ID), and epilepsy. These conditions are characterized by symptoms such as speech delay, behavioral problems, hypotonia, and limb deformities. The gene's role in clathrin-mediated vesicle transport is crucial, and mutations can significantly impact its function, leading to these disorders (Usmani2021De).

In zebrafish models, AP1G1 deficiency results in severe morphological defects and high mortality rates, underscoring its critical role in development. Certain missense variants, such as p.Arg15Gln, p.Arg35Trp, and p.Arg35Gln, have a dominant-negative effect, impairing development and highlighting their pathogenic nature (Usmani2021De).

In mice, a hypomorphic mutation in AP1G1 leads to abnormalities in the inner ear, retina, thyroid, and testes. This mutation causes hearing impairment, retinal degeneration, thyroid dysfunction, and male infertility, suggesting that impaired AP-1 sorting and targeting of membrane proteins in polarized cells may underlie these pathologies (Johnson2016A).

AP1G1 mutations are also linked to adaptinopathies, a class of disorders affecting intracellular vesicular traffic, which can lead to neurodevelopmental issues and fertility problems (Mignani2023Deficiency).

## Interactions
The AP1G1 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1), which is crucial for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles involved in intracellular protein trafficking. AP1G1 interacts with clathrin and other adaptor proteins to facilitate vesicle formation and transport. It is primarily localized in the perinuclear region and interacts with clathrin-coated pits, recycling endosomes, lysosomes, and the trans-Golgi network (Usmani2021De). AP1G1 is also involved in the maturation of early endosomes into late endosomes, interacting with proteins such as ArfGAP1 and Rabex-5, which activate the Rab5-Vps34 pathway (Mignani2023Deficiency).

The AP1G1 protein forms part of the AP-1 complex, which includes other subunits that stabilize each other. Reduced levels of AP1G1 correlate with reduced levels of other AP-1 complex proteins, suggesting a stabilizing interaction within the complex (Usmani2021De). AP1G1 also interacts with the AP1B1 protein, indicating a potential role in maintaining the stability of the AP-1 complex (Usmani2021De). These interactions are essential for the proper sorting and transport of proteins, such as E-cadherin, which is crucial for cell-cell adhesion and maintaining epithelial polarity (Mignani2023Deficiency).
