# SLC10A2

## Overview
The SLC10A2 gene encodes the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), a critical transmembrane protein involved in the reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum, part of the small intestine. ASBT plays a vital role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, which is essential for lipid digestion and cholesterol homeostasis. The protein is characterized by seven transmembrane domains, facilitating the uptake of bile acids from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes through a sodium gradient (Ticho2019Intestinal; Banerjee2005Membrane). ASBT's function is regulated by various protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications, including tyrosine phosphorylation, which affects its plasma membrane expression and stability (Chothe2019Tyrosine). Mutations in the SLC10A2 gene can lead to clinical conditions such as primary bile acid malabsorption and gallstone disease, highlighting its significance in maintaining bile acid and cholesterol balance (Oelkers1997Primary; Renner2009A).

## Structure
The human apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (hASBT), encoded by the SLC10A2 gene, is characterized by a structure comprising seven transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Banerjee2005Membrane). This 7-TMD model is supported by dual label epitope insertion scanning mutagenesis, which confirmed the orientation of the protein's transmembrane domains and refuted previous models suggesting nine TMDs (Banerjee2005Membrane). The N-terminus of the protein is exofacial, while the C-terminus is cytosolic, indicating a specific orientation across the membrane (Banerjee2005Membrane).

The protein's secondary structure includes transmembrane helices, with specific domains such as TM4 and TM5 playing crucial roles in substrate translocation and structural stability, respectively (Khantwal2008Cytosolic; Moore2013Transmembrane). TM4 is involved in forming part of the substrate translocation pathway, while TM5 contributes to maintaining the alpha helical stability necessary for the protein's function (Khantwal2008Cytosolic; Moore2013Transmembrane).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may influence the stability and function of SLC10A2, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein's structure is essential for its role in bile acid transport and maintaining bile acid homeostasis.

## Function
The SLC10A2 gene encodes the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), which is crucial for the reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum, a part of the small intestine. ASBT is a transmembrane protein that facilitates the uptake of bile acids from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes, using a sodium gradient with a 2:1 sodium to bile acid stoichiometry (Ticho2019Intestinal; Sabit2013Transmembrane). This process is electrogenic and essential for maintaining the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, which is vital for lipid digestion and cholesterol homeostasis (Alrefai2007Bile; Khantwal2008Cytosolic).

ASBT is primarily expressed in the villus cells of the distal ileum, with negligible expression in the colon, aligning with its role in conjugated bile acid uptake (Ticho2019Intestinal). It also plays a role in cholesterol metabolism, as bile acid synthesis from cholesterol accounts for a significant portion of cholesterol elimination (Ticho2019Intestinal). The transporter's activity is regulated by nuclear receptors, including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which links bile acid absorption to hepatic lipid metabolism (Jung2002Human). Dysfunction or inhibition of ASBT can lead to conditions such as primary bile acid malabsorption and has therapeutic implications for hypercholesterolemia (Alrefai2007Bile).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC10A2 gene, which encodes the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), are linked to several clinical conditions. Primary bile acid malabsorption (PBAM) is a notable disorder caused by mutations in SLC10A2. This condition is characterized by congenital diarrhea, steatorrhea, and reduced plasma cholesterol levels due to impaired bile acid reabsorption in the ileum. Specific mutations such as L243P and T262M have been identified to abolish bile acid transport activity without affecting protein expression or trafficking to the plasma membrane (Oelkers1997Primary).

SLC10A2 mutations are also associated with gallstone disease. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9514089 within the SLC10A2 gene has been identified as a risk factor for gallstone formation, particularly in male non-obese individuals. This variant is linked to lower plasma cholesterol levels and an increased prevalence of gallstones in certain populations (Renner2009A).

Alterations in SLC10A2 expression can lead to conditions like colonic secretory diarrhea and altered bile acid metabolism. Reduced expression of ASBT has been correlated with changes in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, although these findings require further investigation due to limited sample sizes (Renner2009Mutation).

## Interactions
The human gene SLC10A2 encodes the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), which is involved in the reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum. SLC10A2 participates in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function and regulation. 

One significant interaction involves tyrosine phosphorylation, which regulates the plasma membrane expression and stability of ASBT. This process is influenced by Src family kinases (SFKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Inhibition of SFKs reduces ASBT function and surface expression, while PTP inhibition enhances its function. Specific intracellular tyrosine residues, such as Y148, Y216, Y308, Y311, and Y337, are critical for this regulatory mechanism (Chothe2019Tyrosine).

ASBT also interacts with sodium ions, which are essential for its transport activity. Specific residues in transmembrane domains, such as Asp 91 in TM2, are involved in sodium translocation, affecting the transporter's function and conformation (Sabit2013Transmembrane). Additionally, transmembrane domain VII (TM7) is implicated in substrate translocation, with certain residues forming a structural anchor necessary for transporter activity (Hussainzada2006Transmembrane).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing SLC10A2 function, impacting bile acid transport and cholesterol homeostasis.
