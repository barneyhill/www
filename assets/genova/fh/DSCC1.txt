# DSCC1

## Overview
DSCC1, or DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the processes of DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion. The DSCC1 protein is a component of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, specifically the Ctf18-DSCC1-Ctf8-RFC complex, which plays a crucial role in loading the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA, a key step in DNA synthesis and repair. This protein is categorized as a nuclear protein due to its primary localization in the nucleus, where it is active during the S phase of the cell cycle. DSCC1 is essential for maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the recruitment of the SMC3 acetyltransferase ESCO2 to replication forks, thereby stabilizing cohesin complexes on chromatin. Its interactions with various proteins, including those involved in DNA polymerase activity, underscore its importance in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and error-free DNA replication (van2022MMS22LTONSL; Hailong2024Characterization; Wang2024Decoding).

## Structure


## Function
The DSCC1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion in healthy human cells. It is a component of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, specifically the Ctf18-DSCC1-Ctf8-RFC complex, which is crucial for loading the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA. This process is essential for DNA synthesis and repair, contributing to genomic stability and proper cell division (van2022MMS22LTONSL; Hailong2024Characterization).

DSCC1 plays a significant role in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion by promoting the recruitment of the SMC3 acetyltransferase ESCO2 to replication forks. This recruitment is necessary for the stabilization of cohesin complexes on chromatin, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (van2022MMS22LTONSL). The DSCC1-RFC complex interacts with the catalytic subunit of the leading-strand DNA polymerase epsilon (Polε), enhancing its processivity and contributing to error-free DNA replication (van2022MMS22LTONSL).

In the cell, DSCC1 is primarily localized in the nucleus and is active during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it is involved in DNA replication and the activation of replication stress checkpoints (Hailong2024Characterization; Wang2024Decoding). Loss of DSCC1 function results in reduced replication fork speed, increased DNA damage, and defective sister chromatid cohesion, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (van2022MMS22LTONSL).

## Clinical Significance
The DSCC1 gene is implicated in various human cancers due to its role in DNA replication and chromatid cohesion. Alterations in DSCC1 expression, particularly its overexpression, are associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in several types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and liver cancer (Hailong2024Characterization). In breast cancer, DSCC1 overexpression is linked to increased proliferation, invasion, and migration of carcinoma cells, primarily through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and inhibition of the p53 protein (Conte2022In). 

DSCC1 genetic alterations, especially amplifications, are prevalent in over 5% of cases across multiple cancer types, with the highest frequency in ovarian cancer (Hailong2024Characterization). These alterations are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including shorter disease-free and progression-free survival (Hailong2024Characterization). DSCC1 is also linked to genomic instability indicators like tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, which are relevant for predicting treatment responses to PARP inhibitors (Hailong2024Characterization).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, DSCC1 is suggested as a potential prognostic marker, with its elevated expression associated with decreased apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells (Xu2018Identification). The gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint blockade response, indicating its involvement in immune-oncology interactions (Hailong2024Characterization).

## Interactions
DSCC1 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion. It is a component of the Ctf18-RFC complex, which includes CTF18, CHTF8, and RFC subunits 2-5. This complex is essential for loading and unloading the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA, a critical step in DNA replication and repair processes (van2022MMS22LTONSL; Wang2024Decoding). DSCC1 interacts with proteins such as ESCO1, RFC5, RFC3, RFC2, POLE, ESCO2, CHTF18, CHTF8, RFC4, and SMC3, forming a network that supports DNA replication and repair (Wang2024Decoding).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, DSCC1 interacts with HSP90AB1, a molecular chaperone. This interaction is significant in promoting LUAD progression by regulating transcription through histone binding and managing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Lin2023DSCC1). The interaction with HSP90AB1 also influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and STAT3 signaling, which are important for cancer progression (Lin2023DSCC1).

DSCC1's interactions with other proteins, such as POLA1, PRIM1, and WDHD1, further suggest its involvement in DNA synthesis and cell cycle regulation, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability (Hailong2024Characterization).
