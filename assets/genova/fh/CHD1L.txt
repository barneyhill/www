# CHD1L

## Overview
The CHD1L gene encodes the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1-like (CHD1L), a member of the SNF2-like subfamily of chromatin remodelers. This protein is characterized by its ATPase activity, which is essential for its role in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair processes. CHD1L contains distinct structural domains, including two RecA-like ATPase domains and a C-terminal macro domain, which facilitate its function in modulating protein-DNA interactions and maintaining genomic stability. The protein is involved in critical cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, DNA recombination, and repair, and it plays a significant role in the cellular response to DNA damage. CHD1L's interactions with poly(ADP-ribose) and other proteins, such as PARP1, underscore its importance in the DNA damage response pathway. Clinically, CHD1L is implicated in various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Brockschmidt2011CHD1L:; Xiong2021Diversity; Chen2009Chromodomain).

## Structure
The CHD1L protein, also known as ALC1, is a chromatin remodeler characterized by its unique structural domains. It contains two RecA-like ATPase domains, referred to as lobe 1 and lobe 2, and a C-terminal macro domain. The ATPase domains are crucial for its helicase activity, with lobe 1 and lobe 2 exhibiting a typical RecA-like fold. These lobes have little direct interaction, suggesting a high degree of conformational flexibility (Wang2021Structural). The macro domain plays a dual role in autoinhibiting ATPase activity and facilitating nucleosome mobilization by binding to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) (Lehmann2017Mechanistic).

The macro domain interacts with lobe 2, sequestering elements necessary for nucleosome recognition and thus maintaining the protein in an autoinhibited state. This interaction involves hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions, covering an area of about 750 Å² (Wang2021Structural). Upon activation by PAR, the macro domain dislodges, allowing the ATPase domains to engage with nucleosomal DNA (Wang2021Structural).

CHD1L is subject to regulation by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and may exist in different isoforms due to splice variants, which can alter its function and interactions (Singh2017A).

## Function
The CHD1L gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair in healthy human cells. It is part of the SNF2-like subfamily of the SNF2 family, utilizing energy from DNA-dependent ATPase activity to modulate protein-DNA interactions. This allows CHD1L to participate in nuclear activities such as transcriptional regulation, DNA recombination, and repair (Xiong2021Diversity). The protein contains several domains, including the SNF2_N domain, which is involved in DNA repair and chromatin unwinding, and the Macro domain, which binds ADP-ribose and is involved in DNA transcription and repair (Xiong2021Diversity).

CHD1L is crucial for maintaining chromosomal integrity and genomic stability. It interacts with PARP1 to facilitate base-excision repair by spreading chromatin at damage sites, promoting DNA repair without affecting the recruitment of other repair proteins (Xiong2021Diversity). The protein is also involved in transcriptional control for DNA damage responses and promotes cell tolerance to DNA damage induced by replication stress (Xiong2021Diversity). In terms of cellular localization, CHD1L is active in the nucleus, where it influences cell cycle progression and cellular responses to DNA damage (Xiong2021Diversity).

## Clinical Significance
The CHD1L gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CHD1L is frequently amplified and overexpressed, correlating with advanced tumor stages, poor chemotherapy response, and reduced survival rates. Its oncogenic function is linked to its ability to inhibit apoptosis, particularly through blocking the Nur77-mediated apoptotic pathway, contributing to chemoresistance (Chen2010Clinical; Chen2009Chromodomain). CHD1L also plays a role in colorectal carcinoma (CRC), where its overexpression is associated with larger tumor size, deeper invasion, and worse disease-free survival (Ji2013CHD1L).

In addition to cancer, CHD1L is involved in congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT). Specific heterozygous missense variants in CHD1L have been identified in CAKUT patients, affecting chromatin remodeling and leading to renal tract malformations (Brockschmidt2011CHD1L:). Furthermore, CHD1L is implicated in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), where its dysregulation is associated with neuronal vulnerability and neurodegeneration (Pahlevan2024A). These findings highlight CHD1L's significant role in various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
CHD1L, also known as ALC1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. CHD1L interacts with the nucleosome at superhelical location 2 (SHL 2), where its lobe 1 and lobe 2 undergo structural transitions to align ATP-binding/hydrolysis motifs, indicating an activated state. The acidic pocket of lobe 2 interacts with the basic patch of the H4 tail of the nucleosome, a critical interaction for CHD1L activation (Wang2021Structurala).

CHD1L also interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and PARP1, with its ATPase activity being stimulated by PARP1 in a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent manner. This interaction is essential for its recruitment to DNA damage sites and its role in the DNA damage response (Ahel2009Poly(ADPribose)–Dependent page 1 of 6). The macro domain of CHD1L binds to PAR, facilitating its activation and recruitment to chromatin (Gottschalk2009Poly(ADPribosyl)ation page 0 of 3).

In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, CHD1L interacts with the protein Nur77, inhibiting its translocation from the nucleus to the mitochondria, thereby suppressing apoptosis. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal Macro domain of CHD1L (Chen2009Chromodomain).
