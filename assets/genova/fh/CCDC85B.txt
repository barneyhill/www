# CCDC85B

## Overview
CCDC85B is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 85B, which is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. CCDC85B plays a significant role in modulating the Wnt signaling pathway by inhibiting the interaction of β-catenin with T-cell factor 4, thereby influencing cellular signaling pathways that are critical in cancer progression (Feng2018CCDC85B). The gene is notably overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it contributes to tumor cell proliferation and invasion through the activation of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway (Feng2018CCDC85B). Given its involvement in these pathways, CCDC85B is considered a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC (Li2016The).

## Clinical Significance
CCDC85B is implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The gene is overexpressed in NSCLC tumor cells compared to normal lung tissues, and this overexpression is associated with advanced TNM stage and positive regional lymph node metastasis. CCDC85B promotes cell proliferation and invasion in lung cancer cell lines, such as A549 and H1299, by activating the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. This activation leads to increased levels of active β-catenin and Wnt targets, including c-myc, cyclin D1, and MMP7, which are crucial for cancer progression (Feng2018CCDC85B).

The study suggests that CCDC85B could serve as a potential target for NSCLC treatment due to its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining have shown that CCDC85B is highly expressed in the cytoplasm of NSCLC tissues and lung cancer cells, with higher levels in cancerous cells compared to normal bronchial epithelial cells. The role of CCDC85B in lung cancer progression and Wnt/β-catenin activation appears to be independent of TP53 status, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target regardless of TP53 mutations (Feng2018CCDC85B).

## Interactions
CCDC85B, a protein encoded by the human gene CCDC85B, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the hepatitis delta antigen, impacting viral genomic replication (Feng2018CCDC85B). CCDC85B also interacts with p78/MCRS/MSP58, which plays a role in regulating gene expression and cell proliferation (Feng2018CCDC85B). In the context of the Wnt signaling pathway, CCDC85B inhibits the interaction of β-catenin with T-cell factor 4 in the nucleus, thereby modulating the pathway's activity (Feng2018CCDC85B).

The protein is also known to interact with Eurl, a putative partner identified through the BioGRID database. This interaction modulates β-catenin signaling, where CCDC85B reduces β-catenin levels, while Eurl increases them. Co-transfection of Eurl with CCDC85B can counteract the reduction of β-catenin levels induced by CCDC85B, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Li2016The). These interactions highlight CCDC85B's role in cellular signaling and its potential impact on cancer cell proliferation and invasion, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (Feng2018CCDC85B).
