# CEP295

## Overview
CEP295 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 295, a critical component in the assembly and stability of centrioles within human cells. The protein is categorized as a scaffold protein, playing a pivotal role in centriole elongation and the recruitment of pericentriolar material necessary for centriole duplication and microtubule nucleation. Centrosomal protein 295 is involved in the centriole-to-centrosome conversion process, facilitating the assembly of essential proteins such as Cep192, Cep152, and γ-tubulin onto nascent centrioles. This protein's interactions with microtubules and other centriolar proteins underscore its importance in maintaining centriole integrity and function, which are crucial for proper cell cycle progression and cellular division (Chang2016CEP295; VasquezLimeta2021Human).

## Function
CEP295 is a crucial protein involved in centriole elongation and stability in human cells. It plays a significant role in the later stages of centriole elongation, particularly during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. CEP295 is essential for building the distal half of centrioles and interacts directly with microtubules, contributing to the posttranslational modification of centriolar microtubules, such as acetylation and glutamylation, which are important for stabilizing centrioles (Chang2016CEP295).

CEP295 acts as a scaffold protein necessary for the recruitment and stabilization of pericentriolar material (PCM) components, such as Cep192, Cep152, γ-tubulin, and pericentrin, onto nascent centrioles. This recruitment is vital for centrioles to gain the ability to duplicate and nucleate microtubules, a process essential for the centriole-to-centrosome conversion (CCC) (VasquezLimeta2021Human; Atorino2020CEP44).

CEP295 is located at the microtubule wall and is enriched at the proximal ends of centrioles. It is involved in the recruitment of proteins like POC5 and POC1B, which are crucial for building the distal portions of centrioles (Chang2016CEP295). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and stability of centrioles, ensuring proper centriole function and cell cycle progression (Atorino2020CEP44).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CEP295 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, a study identified a missense SNP, rs77922978, in the CEP295 gene that is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in Chinese women. This SNP may influence protein stability and expression levels, affecting cancer susceptibility, particularly in specific demographic and clinical subgroups such as women with a later first live birth and those with ER-negative and PR-negative breast cancer (Zhou2021Coding).

In the realm of neurological disorders, CEP295 is involved in centriole biogenesis, and its proper function is crucial for neural progenitor cell survival. Although the direct association of CEP295 mutations with specific diseases is not extensively documented, it is suggested that intact functional centrioles, which require CEP295, are critical for preventing conditions like primary microcephaly. This condition is characterized by reduced brain size and is linked to mutations in genes involved in centriole assembly, such as RTTN, which acts upstream of CEP295 (Chen2017Human).

CEP295's role in centriole elongation and its interaction with microtubules are essential for maintaining proper centriole structure, and disruptions in these processes could potentially contribute to developmental abnormalities (Chang2016CEP295).

## Interactions
CEP295 interacts with microtubules and is essential for centriole elongation. It associates with microtubules through two major regions: the N-terminal K1 fragment and the C-terminal K6 fragment. The C-terminal CEP295-K6C fragment directly interacts with microtubules, facilitated by a conserved ALMS motif, which is crucial for its function in centriole elongation (Chang2016CEP295).

CEP295 plays a role in the recruitment of other proteins to centrioles. It is necessary for the localization of POC5 and POC1B, which are involved in centriole construction and length control (Chang2016CEP295). CEP295 also interacts with CEP192, acting as a scaffold for the proper assembly of the daughter centriole (Zhou2021Coding).

In the centriole-to-centrosome conversion process, CEP295 is involved in the recruitment of pericentriolar material proteins to the daughter centriole. It connects to CEP135 and facilitates the recruitment of proteins such as CEP152 and CEP192, which are essential for centrosome function and duplication (Atorino2020CEP44).

CEP295 is also implicated in interactions with RTTN, an upstream effector involved in centriole elongation, suggesting a functional relationship in centriole-related processes (Chen2017Human).
