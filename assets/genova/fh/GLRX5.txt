# GLRX5

## Overview
GLRX5 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial protein glutaredoxin 5, which is a member of the monothiol glutaredoxin family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, essential cofactors involved in various cellular processes such as electron transport and enzymatic catalysis (Ye2010Glutaredoxin). Glutaredoxin 5 is characterized by its thioredoxin fold and forms a tetrameric structure when bound to a [2Fe-2S] cluster, coordinating with glutathione molecules (Johansson2010The). The protein's function is critical for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and proper heme biosynthesis, particularly in erythroblasts (Ye2010Glutaredoxin). Mutations in the GLRX5 gene can lead to clinical conditions such as sideroblastic anemia and variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial function and cellular viability (Marin2024Case; Liu2015Functional).

## Structure
The human GLRX5 protein is a monothiol glutaredoxin involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain with a CGFS motif, typical of monothiol glutaredoxins (Ye2010Glutaredoxin). The secondary structure of GLRX5 features a central four-stranded mixed beta sheet flanked by five alpha helices, characteristic of the thioredoxin fold superfamily (Johansson2010The). 

In terms of tertiary structure, GLRX5 is stabilized by various hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, particularly involving residues like Lys59, which anchors the β1-α2 loop and interacts with glutathione (GSH) (Johansson2010The). The protein's structure is designed to protect the iron-sulfur cluster from solvent exposure, with limited accessibility through a central aperture (Johansson2010The).

GLRX5 forms a tetrameric quaternary structure when bound to a [2Fe2S] cluster, with each monomer coordinating the cluster along with two GSH molecules (Johansson2010The). This tetrameric assembly is distinct from other glutaredoxins like GLRX2, which is dimeric in solution (Johansson2010The). The protein is sensitive to oxidative conditions, such as GSSG and H2O2, which may induce structural rearrangements (Johansson2010The).

## Function
The GLRX5 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) clusters, which are essential cofactors for various cellular processes, including electron transport and enzymatic catalysis. In healthy human cells, GLRX5 functions as an intermediate carrier, delivering [2Fe-2S] clusters to a variety of target apo proteins, such as ferredoxins, and potentially to iron-sulfur cluster scaffold/maturation proteins IscA1 and IscA2 (Ye2010Glutaredoxin; Olive2018Role). This process is vital for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and proper heme biosynthesis, particularly in erythroblasts, where GLRX5 is highly expressed (Ye2010Glutaredoxin).

GLRX5 interacts with the ISCU scaffold protein, which is important for its function in Fe-S cluster biogenesis (Johansson2010The). It is involved in the transfer of [Fe-S] clusters to various proteins, including iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) and ferrochelatase, which are vital for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and heme biosynthesis (Liu2015Functional). The protein also plays a role in mitigating cellular iron toxicity by sequestering iron (Olive2018Role). Deficiencies in GLRX5 can lead to conditions such as sideroblastic anemia due to impaired [Fe-S] cluster assembly and transfer (Ye2010Glutaredoxin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLRX5 gene are associated with several diseases, primarily due to their impact on mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. One of the main conditions linked to GLRX5 mutations is sideroblastic anemia, which is characterized by the body's inability to properly incorporate iron into hemoglobin, leading to iron-overloaded mitochondria in red cell precursors. This condition can result from mutations that affect RNA splicing, leading to impaired Fe-S assembly on iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) and ferrochelatase, essential for iron homeostasis and heme biosynthesis (Liu2015Functional; Rouault2008Iron–sulfur).

GLRX5 mutations are also implicated in variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia (vNKH), a condition caused by a deficient glycine cleavage enzyme system. The p.K51del mutation in GLRX5 may impair Fe-S transfer to the lipoate synthase enzyme, affecting lipoylation processes necessary for the glycine cleavage system (Marin2024Case; Liu2015Functional). Additionally, GLRX5 mutations can lead to neurological phenotypes, including spastic paraplegia, optic atrophy, and distal neuropathy, often associated with elevated glycine levels (Sager2021HACE1; Sankaran2021GLRX5associated). These mutations disrupt the normal function of GLRX5, affecting the biogenesis of Fe-S clusters in mitochondria, which is crucial for cell viability (Camponeschi2022Molecular).

## Interactions
GLRX5, a mitochondrial protein, plays a crucial role in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis and interacts with several proteins involved in this process. It forms a symmetrical homo-dimeric complex coordinating a [2Fe-2S] cluster and interacts with proteins such as ISCU, NFU1, and ferredoxins, which are part of the Fe-S cluster assembly machinery (Berndt2021Glutaredoxins). GLRX5 engages in bidirectional cluster transfer with NFU1, with the transfer from NFU1 to GLRX5 being significantly faster than the reverse (Olive2018Role). It also transfers clusters to ferredoxins 1 and 2, which are terminal cluster acceptors in mitochondria, although no reverse transfer is observed (Olive2018Role).

GLRX5 interacts with the chaperone pair HSPA9 and HSC20, which influence the directionality of cluster transfer with ISCU. These chaperones inhibit cluster transfer from ISCU to GLRX5 but promote the reverse transfer (Olive2018Role). Additionally, GLRX5 forms a [2Fe-2S]-bridged heterodimeric complex with BOLA1, although this complex is not involved in cluster trafficking, suggesting a potential redox role (Sen2020Cluster). The BOLA3-GLRX5 complex, in contrast, is involved in cluster trafficking (Sen2020Cluster).
