# COPS2

## Overview
COPS2, or COP9 signalosome subunit 2, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex, a multi-protein assembly involved in the regulation of protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The COPS2 protein is characterized by the presence of a PCI (proteasome, COP9, Initiation factor 3) domain, which facilitates its incorporation into the CSN complex and interaction with other subunits (Wei2003The; Qin2020COP9). Functionally, COPS2 is involved in the deneddylation of cullin-RING E3 ligases, a critical process for modulating protein ubiquitination and stability (Qin2020COP9; Kato2009Mammalian). Beyond its role in protein degradation, COPS2 also acts as a transcriptional corepressor, interacting with nuclear hormone receptors and transcription factors to influence gene expression (Wei2003The). The protein's activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Li2017Roles; Kato2009Mammalian).

## Structure
The COPS2 protein, also known as COP9 signalosome subunit 2, is a component of the COP9 signalosome complex, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is composed of 443 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 51,597 Da (Malik2020Finding). COPS2 contains a PCI (proteasome, COP9, Initiation factor 3) domain, which is crucial for its integration into the COP9 signalosome complex and for interactions with other subunits (Wei2003The; Qin2020COP9).

The N-terminal region of COPS2 is important for its interaction with nuclear hormone receptors, such as the thyroid hormone receptor and retinoic acid X receptor, where it acts as a transcriptional corepressor (Wei2003The; Malik2020Finding). This region is also essential for the protein's role in deneddylation activity, a process that involves the removal of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 from cullin subunits (Wei2003The).

COPS2 is highly conserved across species, showing significant homology with its counterparts in other organisms, such as the Drosophila alien protein and the mouse Cops2 protein (Schaefer1999Coding). The protein is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with higher concentrations in the nucleus in some cells (Schaefer1999Coding).

## Function
COPS2, also known as COP9 signalosome subunit 2, is a component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex, which is crucial for regulating protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This complex is involved in the deneddylation of cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs), a key step in controlling protein ubiquitination and stability (Qin2020COP9; Kato2009Mammalian). COPS2 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating the activity of CRLs, thereby influencing protein degradation and recycling within the cell (Qin2020COP9).

COPS2 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences transcriptional regulation and protein stability. It interacts with nuclear hormone receptors and transcription factors, such as the interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP), which is involved in interferon-mediated gene expression (Wei2003The). The CSN complex, including COPS2, is also implicated in various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction pathways, including the Ras and NF-kB pathways (Li2017Roles; Kato2009Mammalian). These activities highlight the multifunctional nature of COPS2 in cellular regulation and its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COPS2 gene have been implicated in various cancer-related conditions. In the context of cancer cachexia, a condition characterized by severe muscle wasting, COPS2 is significantly downregulated in skeletal muscle during the early stages of the disease. Exercise training has been shown to normalize COPS2 levels, suggesting its potential role in counteracting cancer-induced oxidative stress and muscle wasting (Alves2020Exercise). In patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), lower muscle COPS2 protein content is associated with impaired aerobic capacity, indicating a possible link between COPS2 expression and muscle function in cancer patients (Alves2020Exercise).

COPS2 is also involved in the regulation of cellular pathways that may contribute to tumorigenesis. Dysregulation of the COP9 signalosome, including COPS2, is observed in tumor tissues, suggesting that alterations in COPS2 expression may play a role in cancer progression (Wicker2016Analysis). Additionally, genetic variants in the COPS2 gene have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, highlighting its potential involvement in cancer susceptibility (Ge2019Genetic).

In the context of cancer treatment, alterations in COPS2, as part of the COP9 signalosome, may contribute to resistance mechanisms against therapies targeting the neddylation pathway (Norton2021Protein).

## Interactions
COPS2, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with several other subunits of the COP9 signalosome, including COPS1, COPS4, COPS5, COPS6, COPS7A, and COPS7B, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of the complex (Lingaraju2014Crystal; Malik2020Finding). COPS2 also interacts with the ligand-binding region of the thyroid receptor and with proteins such as CUL1 and CUL2, which are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Malik2020Finding).

COPS2 is known to interact with NIF3L1, a protein involved in neuronal differentiation, where it acts as a transcription co-repressor, negatively regulating neuronal differentiation (Malik2020Finding). In the context of cancer, COPS2 interacts with nuclear hormone receptors, acting as a transcriptional corepressor, which is independent of the COP9 signalosome complex (Alves2020Exercise). The protein is also involved in interactions with proteins such as TP53, CUL1/2/3/4, and JUN, participating in processes like protein neddylation and ubiquitination (Liu2024COP9). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of COPS2 in regulating protein stability and gene expression.
