# SEZ6L2

## Overview
SEZ6L2 is a gene that encodes the protein seizure related 6 homolog like 2, which is a member of the Sez6 family of proteins. This protein is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus and cerebellum, where it plays a critical role in synaptic function and neuronal development. SEZ6L2 is involved in modulating the complement system, acting as a moderate inhibitor of the classical complement pathway and a strong inhibitor of the alternative pathway, thereby preventing excessive inflammation and protecting synapses from complement-dependent pruning (Landa2021Seizurerelated; Qiu2021The). Additionally, SEZ6L2 interacts with the AMPA glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1), contributing to neural cell signal transduction and synaptic plasticity, which are essential for cognitive processes and motor coordination (Landa2021Seizurerelated). The protein's involvement in both neurological and immune functions underscores its significance in maintaining neural integrity and immune homeostasis.

## Function
The SEZ6L2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the Sez6 family, which includes Sez6 and Sez6L. These proteins are involved in regulating the complement system, an essential part of the immune response. SEZ6L2 acts as a moderate inhibitor of the classical complement pathway and a strong inhibitor of the alternative pathway. It facilitates the cleavage of C3b by acting as a cofactor for Factor I and accelerates the decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb, thereby modulating complement activation and preventing excessive inflammation (Qiu2021The).

SEZ6L2 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebellum, where it plays a crucial role in synaptic function and neuronal development. It is involved in protecting synapses and dendrites from complement-dependent pruning during development, which is important for maintaining synapse numbers and dendritic morphology (Landa2021Seizurerelated; Qiu2021The). SEZ6L2 also interacts with the AMPA glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1), contributing to neural cell signal transduction and synaptic plasticity, which are vital for cognitive processes and motor coordination (Landa2021Seizurerelated).

## Clinical Significance
The SEZ6L2 gene is clinically significant in both neurological and oncological contexts. In neurology, SEZ6L2 is associated with various conditions, including autism spectrum disorders and cerebellar ataxia. Mutations in SEZ6L2 have been linked to these disorders, affecting neuronal growth and motor function development. Anti-SEZ6L2 antibodies have been implicated in paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome, a condition characterized by neurological symptoms such as gait disturbance and limb ataxia, which can improve with cancer treatment (Landa2021Seizurerelated; Kather2022AntiSEZ6L2).

In oncology, SEZ6L2 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast invasive carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and colon cancer. In breast cancer, high SEZ6L2 expression correlates with shorter overall survival and progression-free intervals, and it is associated with immune cell infiltration in tumors (Ding2023Overexpression). In colorectal cancer, SEZ6L2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and lower survival rates, with knockdown studies showing impaired tumor growth through caspase-dependent apoptosis (An2020SEZ6L2). In colon cancer, SEZ6L2 serves as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, with its overexpression linked to lower survival rates (Zheng2024Targeting).

## Interactions
SEZ6L2, a member of the Sez6 family of proteins, is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence its role in neurological and immune functions. SEZ6L2 interacts with the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, linking it to the cytoskeleton via adducin. This interaction is crucial for synaptic functions related to short-term potentiation (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP), which are mechanisms underlying working and short-term memory (Nash2019Lack).

In the immune system, SEZ6L2 acts as a cofactor for Factor I in the cleavage of C3b, a component of the complement system, but does not facilitate the cleavage of C4b. SEZ6L2 also exhibits decay accelerating activity for the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb), although it requires higher concentrations compared to other decay accelerating factors (Qiu2021The). This protein is a moderate inhibitor of the classical complement pathway and a strong inhibitor of the alternative pathway, suggesting its role in protecting synapses and dendrites from complement-dependent pruning (Qiu2021The).

SEZ6L2 is also identified as a major substrate of the AD protease BACE1, implicating its processing in cognitive functions (Nash2019Lack). These interactions highlight SEZ6L2's multifaceted role in both neurological and immune processes.
