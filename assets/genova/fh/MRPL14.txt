# MRPL14

## Overview
The MRPL14 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L14, a vital component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrially-encoded proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a key process in cellular energy production. Structurally, MRPL14 is characterized by a five-stranded beta barrel and two small alpha-helices, contributing to its function in forming a bridge structure within the ribosome. It interacts with the C7orf30 protein, which is necessary for the biogenesis and proper assembly of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial ribosome integrity and function (Fung2013The). The evolutionary conservation of MRPL14 highlights its critical role in cellular metabolism and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer (Lin2022Expression; Lou2024Mitochondrial).

## Structure
MRPL14 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is part of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. The primary structure of MRPL14 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the MRPL14 gene. Its secondary structure includes a five-stranded beta barrel and two small alpha-helices, which are similar to its bacterial counterpart (Fung2013The). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these elements, contributing to its role in forming a bridge structure at the interface of the large and small subunits in the ribosome (Fung2013The).

The quaternary structure of MRPL14 involves its assembly with other ribosomal proteins within the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU). MRPL14 is essential for the incorporation into the mt-LSU, and its interaction with C7orf30 is crucial for mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and function (Fung2013The). The evolutionary conservation of MRPL14's structure and its interaction with C7orf30 highlight its importance in mitochondrial translation processes (Fung2013The). The study of MRPL14's structure and interactions provides insights into its role in maintaining mitochondrial ribosome integrity and function.

## Function
MRPL14 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is integral to the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mt-LSU). It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrially-encoded proteins, which are essential for the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process, a critical pathway for ATP production in cells (Fung2013The). MRPL14 interacts with C7orf30, a protein necessary for the biogenesis of the mt-LSU and mitochondrial translation. This interaction is vital for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, ensuring efficient mitochondrial protein synthesis (Fung2013The).

The depletion of MRPL14 in human fibroblasts leads to a significant decrease in C7orf30 protein levels and a reduction in the steady-state levels of mitochondrially-encoded proteins, indicating its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial protein synthesis (Fung2013The). MRPL14 is also involved in forming a bridge structure within the ribosome, which is crucial for its structural integrity and function (Fung2013The). The protein is active within the mitochondria, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function by supporting the translation of key components of the OXPHOS complexes (Fung2013The).

## Clinical Significance
MRPL14 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in mitochondrial function. In endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC), MRPL14 is associated with a decreased risk, suggesting a protective role against the development of this cancer type (Lou2024Mitochondrial). This finding highlights the potential of MRPL14 as a novel target for understanding the molecular mechanisms of EEC.

In breast cancer, MRPL14 is the most overexpressed gene among mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, with a Log2 (Fold Change) of 1.336. This overexpression is linked to genetic amplification, although it is not significantly associated with prognosis (Lin2022Expression). The upregulation of MRPL14 and other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins in breast cancer may contribute to oncogenic processes, potentially affecting cancer progression (Lin2022Expression).

MRPL14's interaction with C7orf30 is crucial for mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and translation. Depletion of MRPL14 results in defects similar to those observed with C7orf30 knockdown, affecting mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation (Fung2013The). These interactions underscore the importance of MRPL14 in maintaining mitochondrial function, which, when disrupted, could contribute to disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
MRPL14 is a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU) and interacts with the C7orf30 protein, which is crucial for the biogenesis of the mt-LSU and mitochondrial translation. The interaction between MRPL14 and C7orf30 has been confirmed through various experimental methods, including immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, which identified MRPL14 as a co-immunoprecipitating protein with C7orf30 (Fung2013The). This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and function of the mitoribosome, as depletion of MRPL14 results in phenotypes similar to those observed when C7orf30 is knocked down, such as reduced levels of mitochondrially-encoded proteins and impaired mitoribosome assembly (Fung2013The).

MRPL14 is also involved in the incorporation into the mt-LSU, a process promoted by C7orf30. The absence of C7orf30 leads to impaired ribosomal biogenesis and translation defects, affecting the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes (Fung2013The). The interaction between MRPL14 and C7orf30 is conserved and contrasts with the bacterial orthologue YbeB, which interacts with L14 but acts as a translational repressor (Fung2013The). This suggests that MRPL14 and C7orf30 are interdependent for their expression and function, highlighting their critical role in mitochondrial translation.
