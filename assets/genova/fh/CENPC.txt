# CENPC

## Overview
CENPC, or centromere protein C, is a gene that encodes a key component of the kinetochore complex, a structure essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein product, centromere protein C, is a structural protein that plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the kinetochore, ensuring proper attachment of spindle microtubules to centromeres. This interaction is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing chromosomal abnormalities. CENPC is characterized by its ability to bind centromeric DNA and interact with other kinetochore proteins, such as CENP-A, through its conserved domains. These interactions facilitate the organization and function of the kinetochore, highlighting CENPC's importance in mitotic progression. Disruptions in CENPC function can lead to significant clinical consequences, including chromosomal instability and cancer, underscoring its potential as a biomarker for disease (AliAhmad2019CENPC; Yang1996Identification; Trazzi2009The).

## Structure
CENP-C is a crucial component of the kinetochore complex, characterized by distinct structural domains that facilitate its function in chromosome segregation. The protein contains a central domain and a C-terminal domain, both of which can independently target the centromere and associate with centromeric DNA (Trazzi2009The). The central domain includes a DNA-binding region, specifically between residues 433 and 520, which overlaps with a centromere-targeting domain located between residues 478 and 537 (Yang1996Identification).

The C-terminal domain of CENP-C is notable for containing two highly conserved Mif2p homology domains, known as blocks II and III. These domains are essential for the protein's interaction with centromeric DNA and other kinetochore proteins. Mif2p homology domain II is involved in binding alpha satellite DNA, while domain III is crucial for CENP-C dimerization and oligomerization, contributing to the formation of higher-order structures (Trazzi2009The).

CENP-C also interacts with the histone variant CENP-A, binding to a hydrophobic region in the CENP-A tail and docking onto the acidic patch of histone H2A/H2B. This interaction is critical for kinetochore assembly and chromosome segregation (Kato2013A).

## Function
CENPC (centromere protein C) is a critical component of the kinetochore, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. It plays a significant role in the assembly and stabilization of the kinetochore complex, ensuring proper attachment of spindle microtubules to centromeres, which is vital for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation (Yang1996Identification; Trazzi2009The). CENPC localizes to the inner kinetochore plate and is involved in the organization and stability of the kinetochore, interacting with centromeric DNA and other proteins such as CENP-A and histone H3 (Yang1996Identification; Trazzi2009The).

The C-terminal domain of CENPC, particularly the Mif2p homology domains, is crucial for its function, enabling interactions with CENP-A and facilitating centromere chromatin packaging (Trazzi2009The). CENPC's DNA-binding capability, although not specific to known centromeric sequences, is essential for its role in kinetochore function (Yang1996Identification). Disruption of CENPC function can lead to metaphase delay and abnormalities in kinetochore structure, highlighting its importance in mitotic progression and genomic stability (Yang1996Identification). CENPC is also a marker of functional centromeres, present in conventional centromeres, neocentromeres, and active centromeres of dicentric chromosomes (Trazzi2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the CENPC gene can lead to significant clinical consequences. CENPC is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division, and disruptions in its function can result in chromosomal instability. This instability is a hallmark of various cancers, as it can lead to aneuploidy and the accumulation of genetic mutations that drive tumorigenesis. Studies have shown that aberrant expression of CENPC is associated with the progression of several cancer types, highlighting its potential role as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

In addition to its implications in cancer, disruptions in CENPC interactions may contribute to developmental disorders. These disorders are often linked to abnormal cell division, which can result from the improper functioning of centromere proteins like CENPC. The precise mechanisms by which CENPC mutations or expression alterations lead to these conditions are still under investigation, but the gene's critical role in maintaining chromosomal stability suggests that any perturbations could have widespread effects on cellular and organismal development. Understanding the clinical significance of CENPC is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving outcomes for patients with diseases associated with its dysfunction.

## Interactions
CENP-C is a crucial component of the kinetochore, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids to ensure proper centromere function and chromosome segregation. It specifically binds to the CENP-A nucleosome, a key interaction facilitated by the central region of CENP-C (CENP-C CR), which binds with higher affinity than the CENP-C motif. This binding is characterized by hydrophobic interactions involving residues such as W530, W531, V532, and V533, which interact with the C-terminal tail of CENP-A and the hydrophobic patch on histone H4 (AliAhmad2019CENPC; Kato2013A).

CENP-C also interacts with the C-terminal tail of histone H2A, leading to DNA unwrapping and stabilization of the H4 N-terminal tail, which is important for H4 K20 monomethylation, a modification essential for kinetochore assembly (AliAhmad2019CENPC). The C-terminal domain of CENP-C interacts with CENP-A and histone H3, with the Mif2p homology domain III mediating these interactions, crucial for centromere localization and chromatin structuring (Trazzi2009The).

CENP-C also forms complexes with other kinetochore components, such as CENP-LN and CENP-HIKM, and is necessary for the recruitment of CENP-N to the kinetochore (Pentakota2017Decoding). These interactions highlight CENP-C's role as a multivalent binder, essential for the structural organization of centromeric chromatin and kinetochore function.
