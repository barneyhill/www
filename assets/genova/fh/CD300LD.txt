# CD300LD

## Overview
The CD300LD gene encodes the CD300 molecule-like family member d, a protein that is part of the CD300 family of receptors. These receptors are typically involved in immune cell signaling and are characterized by their role in modulating immune responses. The CD300LD protein is a transmembrane receptor that is expressed on the surface of various immune cells, where it participates in the regulation of immune cell activation and function. This protein is implicated in several immune processes, including the modulation of inflammatory responses and the maintenance of immune homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of CD300LD is crucial for elucidating its role in immune-related diseases and potential therapeutic applications.
