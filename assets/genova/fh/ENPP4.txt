# ENPP4

## Overview
ENPP4 is a gene that encodes the protein ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 4, a type I transmembrane protein involved in the hydrolysis of nucleotide phosphates. This protein is part of the ENPP family, which plays a crucial role in regulating extracellular nucleotide levels and influencing various cellular processes, including purinergic signaling and lipid metabolism (Möller2007Monitoring; Massé2021The). ENPP4 is characterized by a single catalytic domain and is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the spleen, stomach, and ovary, where it participates in immune and reproductive functions (Yan2016Homology). The protein is also implicated in kidney development and tumoricidal activity, highlighting its significance in both developmental and immune-mediated processes (Yan2016Homology; Massé2021The). Despite its known functions, further research is needed to fully elucidate the range of activities and clinical implications associated with ENPP4.

## Structure
ENPP4 is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by a single catalytic domain, a short intracellular C-terminus, and a small extracellular region containing a phosphodiesterase motif (Yan2016Homology). The protein structure includes a hydrophobic N-terminus that functions as a signal peptide, followed by an extracellular catalytic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytosolic tail (Möller2007Monitoring). ENPP4 lacks the somatomedin B-like and nuclease-like domains found in ENPP1-ENPP3, consisting solely of a catalytic domain (Yan2016Homology).

The catalytic domain of ENPP4 shares high sequence identity with other ENPP orthologues, approximately 80-90%, but shows lower identity with paralogues within a species, around 40-50% (Möller2007Monitoring). Specific residues such as Asp192, His196, His339, Asp37, Thr73, Asp240, and His241 are located in the catalytic domain, contributing to its function (Yan2016Homology). The protein's 3D structure was modeled using ENPP1 as a template, revealing a substrate-binding pocket formed by an insertion loop (Yan2016Homology).

ENPP4 is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, stomach, and ovary, and is involved in immune and reproductive functions (Yan2016Homology). The protein is also implicated in tumoricidal activity and kidney patterning signaling networks (Massé2021The). However, specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ENPP4 is an ectonucleotidase involved in the hydrolysis of nucleotide phosphates, playing a significant role in nucleotide metabolism and purinergic signaling. It is part of the ENPP family, which regulates extracellular nucleotide levels, influencing various cellular processes (Möller2007Monitoring). ENPP4 is expressed on the plasma membrane, where it participates in the regulation of extracellular concentrations of purines and bioactive lipids, impacting signaling pathways such as Notch, Wnt, and retinoic acid (RA) (Massé2021The).

In the context of kidney development, ENPP4 is crucial for the patterning of pronephric tissues, particularly in Xenopus embryos. It interacts with phosphatidylserine to activate the S1pr5 receptor, which is involved in the regulation of pronephric markers like lhx1 and pax8. This interaction affects the expression domains of genes involved in kidney patterning, leading to changes in the formation and differentiation of pronephric structures (Massé2021The).

ENPP4 also demonstrates tumoricidal activity in BCG-activated macrophages, suggesting a role in immune responses against tumors (Yan2016Homology). However, its specific functions in healthy human cells remain less understood, with ongoing research needed to elucidate its full range of activities.

## Clinical Significance
ENPP4 has been implicated in various pathological conditions due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. Alterations in ENPP4 expression have been associated with kidney-related pathologies. In human studies, ENPP4 is highly expressed in the metanephros and kidney tumors, and its expression increases in deceased donor kidney biopsies with delayed graft function after transplantation, suggesting a potential role in renal pathologies (Massé2021The). The gene's proximity to the RUNX2 gene, mutations of which cause cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), has led to speculation about its involvement in renal anomalies, as evidenced by a reported case of a child with CCD and crossed renal ectopia, hinting at possible ENPP4 locus alterations (Massé2021The).

In the context of cancer, ENPP4 is upregulated by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and is involved in the anti-tumor activity of macrophages. This suggests that ENPP4 could be a therapeutic target for treating tumors, as its catalytic domain may interact with ATP and insulin receptors to reduce tumor cell proliferation (Yan2016Homology). However, the precise mechanisms and conditions associated with ENPP4 mutations or alterations remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its clinical significance in these contexts.

## Interactions
ENPP4 is involved in various interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It is known to bind to phosphatidylserine, a bioactive lipid, in a non-catalytic manner, which is crucial for its activation and subsequent interaction with the S1pr5 receptor. This interaction is significant in kidney development, particularly in the formation of pronephric structures in Xenopus embryos (Massé2021The). ENPP4's role in lipidic signaling pathways suggests it may generate a ligand that activates S1pr5, influencing the expression of key transcription factors like lhx1 and pax8, which are essential for pronephric development (Massé2021The).

In the context of immune function, ENPP4 is expressed on the surface of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-activated macrophages, where it plays a role in the tumoricidal effects against certain cancer cells. This suggests potential interactions with receptors on tumor cells, such as the ATP receptor or insulin receptor, which may modulate tumor cell proliferation and immune response (Yan2016Homology). These interactions highlight ENPP4's involvement in both developmental and immune-mediated processes.
