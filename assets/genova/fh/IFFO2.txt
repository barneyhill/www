# IFFO2

## Overview
The IFFO2 gene encodes the protein intermediate filament family orphan 2, which is a member of the intermediate filament protein family. These proteins are integral to the structural framework of cells, providing mechanical support and playing roles in various cellular processes. Although the specific functions of the IFFO2 protein are not fully understood, it is believed to be involved in maintaining cellular integrity and possibly in signaling pathways related to cellular stress responses. The gene's expression and the protein's function have been linked to several pathological conditions, including eosinophilic esophagitis and various forms of cancer, highlighting its potential significance in disease mechanisms and as a biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic response (Li2023A; Rochman2022Singlecell; Das2019A).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The IFFO2 gene has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), IFFO2 is significantly upregulated in the esophageal epithelial cells of patients with active EoE compared to controls. This upregulation persists even during remission, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathology and genetic risk (Rochman2022Singlecell). 

In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a type of skin cancer, the circular RNA derived from the IFFO2 gene is notably downregulated. This downregulation is one of the most significant among circRNAs in cSCC, indicating a possible involvement in the disease's progression (Das2019A). 

Additionally, IFFO2 has been identified as a prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). It is part of an oxidative stress-related gene signature that may influence patient prognosis and response to immunotherapy (Li2023A). These findings suggest that IFFO2 may play a role in the pathology of these conditions, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
