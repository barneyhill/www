# SHCBP1

## Overview
SHCBP1, or SHC SH2 domain-binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes the SHC binding and spindle associated 1 protein, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in cell division and signaling pathways. The protein is involved in the regulation of mitosis through its interaction with key mitotic proteins such as PLK1 and MISP, enhancing kinase activity and facilitating proper cell cycle progression (Shi2021Hyperactivation). Additionally, SHCBP1 is implicated in cancer biology, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several cancer types, including prostate, pancreatic, bladder, breast, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancers (Yang2021SHCBP1; Xu2020SHCBP1; Senter2022Identification; Yin2022EGFinduced; Zhou2024The). The protein's interactions with signaling molecules such as Shc1 and HER2 further underscore its role in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target (Shi2021Hyperactivation).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
SHCBP1 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In prostate cancer, elevated SHCBP1 expression is linked to poor prognosis, advanced disease stages, and increased biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Knockdown of SHCBP1 in prostate cancer cell lines reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Xu2020SHCBP1). In pancreatic cancer, SHCBP1 overexpression correlates with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival outcomes. It interacts with EOGT, enhancing O-GlcNAcylation of NOTCH1, which promotes cancer progression (Yang2021SHCBP1). In bladder cancer, SHCBP1's interaction with RACGAP1 and RAC1 increases cell invasiveness, and its expression is associated with poor disease-specific survival (Yin2022EGFinduced). In breast cancer, SHCBP1 is overexpressed in ER-positive cases and linked to poor outcomes, suggesting its role in tumor proliferation and migration (Senter2022Identification). In gastric cancer, SHCBP1 is part of the HER2-SHCBP1-PLK1-MISP axis, affecting mitosis and trastuzumab sensitivity, with high expression correlating with worse survival (Shi2021Hyperactivation). SHCBP1 is also associated with poor survival in non-small cell lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, and is linked to reduced sensitivity to DNA-damaging treatments (Zhou2024The).

## Interactions
SHCBP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with PLK1 and MISP, which is crucial for cell division during metaphase. SHCBP1 enhances PLK1 kinase activity, promoting MISP phosphorylation, essential for mitosis (Shi2021Hyperactivation). The interaction between SHCBP1 and PLK1 can be disrupted by the natural product theaflavine-3,3′-digallate (TFBG), which may have implications for trastuzumab sensitivity in gastric cancer (Shi2021Hyperactivation).

SHCBP1 also interacts with Shc1, a signaling adaptor protein. It is associated with Shc1 prior to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation and dissociates upon EGF stimulation, allowing SHCBP1 to bind to HER2, a process disrupted by trastuzumab (Shi2021Hyperactivation). In bladder cancer, SHCBP1 interacts with RACGAP1, inhibiting its GAP activity toward RAC1, which affects cell motility and migration (Yin2022EGFinduced).

In the context of viral interactions, SHCBP1 binds to the measles virus nonstructural C protein, modulating viral RNA polymerase activity and supporting viral RNA synthesis (Ito2013Measles). These interactions highlight SHCBP1's diverse roles in cellular signaling and disease progression.
