# KIRREL1

## Overview
KIRREL1 is a gene that encodes the protein kirre like nephrin family adhesion molecule 1, commonly referred to as NEPH1. This protein is a transmembrane cell adhesion molecule that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by its five immunoglobulin-like domains. These domains facilitate homophilic adhesion, which is essential for cell-cell interactions and signaling. NEPH1 plays a pivotal role in the Hippo signaling pathway, a critical regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is particularly significant in podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney glomerulus, where it contributes to the maintenance of the filtration barrier. Mutations in the KIRREL1 gene have been associated with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, underscoring its clinical importance in kidney function and disease (Gu2022Transmembrane; Paul2022Cell; Solanki2019Mutations).

## Structure
The KIRREL1 protein, also known as NEPH1, is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It features five immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region, which are involved in homophilic adhesion, crucial for cell-cell interactions (Paul2022Cell; Solanki2019Mutations). The protein's structure includes a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain, which is essential for its role in signaling pathways, particularly the Hippo signaling pathway (Paul2022Cell).

The intracellular domain of KIRREL1 is critical for its interaction with SAV1, a component of the Hippo pathway. The C-terminal end of this domain is necessary for binding with SAV1, while the N-terminal fragment is not involved in this interaction (Paul2022Cell). The extracellular domain of KIRREL1 forms trans-homodimeric interactions between adjacent cells, which is hypothesized to serve as a sensing mechanism for cell-cell contact (Paul2022Cell).

Mutations in KIRREL1 can lead to mislocalization of the protein, affecting its function in podocyte cell lines and contributing to conditions such as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (Solanki2019Mutations). The protein's interaction with NPHS1 is crucial for maintaining podocyte structure and function (Solanki2019Mutations).

## Function
KIRREL1, a transmembrane protein, plays a significant role in regulating the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis in healthy human cells. It acts as a feedback regulator by interacting with SAV1, a core component of the Hippo pathway, at cell-cell contact sites. This interaction promotes the activation of LATS1/2 kinases, leading to the inhibition of YAP/TAZ activity, which are key effectors of the pathway (Paul2022Cell). KIRREL1's intracellular C-terminal domain is essential for its function, facilitating interactions with SAV1 and LATS1/2, thereby promoting LATS1/2 activation and YAP phosphorylation (Gu2022Transmembrane; Paul2022Cell).

KIRREL1 is broadly expressed across various tissues and is particularly active in podocytes, where it contributes to the filtration barrier in the kidney glomerulus (Paul2022Cell; Solanki2019Mutations). Its role extends beyond the kidney, as it is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating regenerative responses by modulating the Hippo pathway. The presence of KIRREL1 at cell-cell contacts helps suppress excessive cell proliferation, thus maintaining proper cell density and adhesion (Paul2022Cell).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIRREL1 gene are clinically significant as they are linked to steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), a condition that often progresses to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Two specific mutations, p.Arg440Cys and p.Ser573Leu, have been identified in patients with SRNS. These mutations lead to defective trafficking and mislocalization of the KIRREL1 protein, impairing podocyte function and the integrity of the slit diaphragm, which is crucial for maintaining glomerular filtration (Solanki2019Mutations).

The mislocalization of KIRREL1 in podocytes results in increased transepithelial permeability, indicating compromised podocyte cell junctions and intercellular integrity. This is due to the protein's increased retention in subcellular organelles like the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes (Solanki2019Mutations). The extracellular domain of KIRREL1 interacts with the slit diaphragm membrane protein NPHS1, ensuring structural integrity and filtering function, while the intracellular domain is involved in signaling events that affect actin cytoskeleton organization (Solanki2019Mutations).

These findings underscore the biological importance of KIRREL1 in maintaining podocyte homeostasis and glomerular filtration function, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in SRNS (Solanki2019Mutations).

## Interactions
KIRREL1, a cell adhesion molecule, interacts with several key components of the Hippo signaling pathway. It physically interacts with the protein SAV1, recruiting it to cell-cell contact sites, which is crucial for the regulation of the Hippo pathway. This interaction suppresses the activity of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator involved in cell proliferation (Paul2022Cell). The intracellular domain (ICD) of KIRREL1 is essential for its interaction with SAV1, specifically the C-terminal fragment of the ICD, which directly binds to SAV1 (Paul2022Cell).

KIRREL1 also interacts with LATS1/2 kinases, promoting their activation by MST1/2 through SAV1, which acts as an adaptor. This interaction is necessary for the phosphorylation and inhibition of YAP, highlighting KIRREL1's role in the spatial organization and activation of Hippo signaling components at tight junctions (Gu2022Transmembrane). KIRREL1's localization to tight junctions is crucial for its function, as demonstrated by the failure of a KIRREL1 mutant lacking the transmembrane domain to induce YAP phosphorylation (Gu2022Transmembrane). These interactions position KIRREL1 as a significant regulator of the Hippo pathway, influencing cell proliferation and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor (Gu2022Transmembrane).
