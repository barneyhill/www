# PPEF2

## Overview
PPEF2 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase with EF-hand domain 2, a serine/threonine phosphatase characterized by its EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. This protein is part of the PPP family of phosphatases and plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in regulating apoptosis and stress responses. The protein's structure includes a catalytic domain and EF-hand domains that facilitate calcium binding, influencing its conformation and function. PPEF2 is involved in modulating the activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) and interacts with proteins such as calmodulin and heat shock proteins, highlighting its role in stress response and cell survival mechanisms (Sherman1997Identification; Kutuzov2010Protein; Kutuzov2002Protein).

## Structure
PPEF2 is a protein serine/threonine phosphatase characterized by the presence of EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. The primary structure of PPEF2 includes a catalytic domain typical of the PPP family of protein phosphatases, spanning amino acids 135 to 535 in the human protein (Sherman1997Identification). The protein also contains two EF-hand domains near the carboxy terminus, which are involved in calcium binding (Sherman1997Identification; Kutuzov2002Protein).

The secondary structure of PPEF2 likely involves alpha helices and beta sheets, common in protein phosphatases, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is influenced by the EF-hand domains, facilitating calcium binding and potentially affecting the protein's conformation and function (Kutuzov2002Protein).

PPEF2 can form complexes with other proteins, such as calmodulin, in a calcium-dependent manner, indicating a potential quaternary structure involving protein-protein interactions (Kutuzov2002Protein). The protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as PPEF-2(S) and PPEF-2(L), with the latter containing the EF-hand domains (Sherman1997Identification). These isoforms may have different functional roles and localizations within cells.

## Function
PPEF2 (protein phosphatase with EF-hand domain 2) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a significant role in regulating apoptosis and stress responses in human cells. It acts as a potent negative regulator of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1), a kinase involved in pro-apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways, particularly under oxidative stress conditions. PPEF2 suppresses the sustained activation of MAP kinases p38 and JNK, and prevents ASK1-dependent caspase-3 activation, thereby promoting cell survival and stress protective responses (Kutuzov2010Protein).

PPEF2 interacts with heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90, which are involved in protein folding and stress responses, suggesting its role in modulating stress-induced apoptotic pathways (Kutuzov2010Protein). It is more effective than protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) in suppressing ASK1 phosphorylation, indicating a stronger regulatory role in modulating ASK1 activity (Kutuzov2010Protein).

In the immune system, PPEF2 is crucial for the survival and function of CD8+ dendritic cells, where it regulates apoptosis and is involved in the cross-presentation of antigens, essential for T cell activation (Zwick2019Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPEF2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of schizophrenia, a missense variant (R86H) in PPEF2 has been identified in affected individuals, suggesting a potential link between PPEF2 mutations and the disorder. This variant may influence mGluR5 levels, which are associated with glutamatergic signaling pathways, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Timms2013Support).

PPEF2 also plays a role in immune function, particularly in CD8+ dendritic cells (DCs). Alterations in PPEF2 expression can lead to increased apoptosis and reduced antigen presentation capacity in these cells, which may impair immune responses. This is particularly evident in PPEF2-deficient mice, where CD8+ DCs show increased apoptosis and diminished T cell priming capacity, potentially affecting immune surveillance and response (Zwick2019Expression).

In cancer, PPEF2 is involved in regulating apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1), a kinase implicated in pro-apoptotic and inflammatory signaling. PPEF2's role as a negative regulator of ASK1 suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to cancer progression by affecting cell survival and stress responses (Kutuzov2010Protein).

## Interactions
PPEF2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It is a potent negative regulator of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1), a kinase involved in pro-apoptotic and inflammatory signaling. PPEF2 suppresses ASK1 activation and its downstream signaling pathways, including the activation of MAP kinases p38 and JNK, and prevents caspase-3 cleavage (Kutuzov2010Protein). 

PPEF2 also forms complexes with heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90, which are known to interact with other phosphatases like PP5. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, showing that PPEF2 consistently interacts with Hsp70 and Hsp90 across different calcium concentrations (Kutuzov2010Protein). 

Additionally, PPEF2 interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction is facilitated by IQ motifs in the N-terminal domain of PPEF2, which bind to CaM with high affinity in the presence of calcium ions. This suggests a regulatory mechanism involving calcium signaling (Kutuzov2002Protein). These interactions highlight PPEF2's role in modulating stress responses and cell survival.
