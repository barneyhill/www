# SOX11

## Overview
SOX11 is a gene that encodes the SRY-box transcription factor 11, a member of the SOXC family of transcription factors, which also includes SOX4 and SOX12. This protein is characterized by its high-mobility group (HMG) box domain, which facilitates DNA binding and plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation. As a transcription factor, SOX11 is involved in various biological processes, including embryonic development, cell fate determination, and chromatin remodeling. It acts as a pioneer factor, capable of binding to nucleosomal DNA and facilitating chromatin opening, which is crucial for gene expression regulation (Dodonova2020Nucleosomebound). SOX11 is expressed in multiple tissues, particularly during development, and is essential for the proper formation of the central and peripheral nervous systems (Dy2008The). Its expression and function are also implicated in several clinical conditions, including Coffin-Siris Syndrome and various cancers, where it serves as a marker for disease prognosis and progression (Federmann2019Highly; Tsurusaki2014De).

## Structure
SOX11 is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved high-mobility group (HMG) box domain, which facilitates DNA binding. The primary structure of the human SOX11 protein consists of 441 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 46,679.4 Da (Mondal2019An). The secondary structure predominantly features random coils and alpha helices, with minor occurrences of extended strands and beta turns (Mondal2019An). The protein's tertiary structure includes two main domains: the Sry-related HMG box DNA-binding domain near the N-terminal and a transactivation domain (TAD) near the C-terminal (Mondal2019An). The TAD is noted for its stable alpha-helical structure, contributing to SOX11's potent transactivation ability (Dy2008The).

SOX11 is a single-exon gene, and its HMG box domain shows high conservation, with 84% identity and 95% similarity to other SOXC proteins (Mondal2019An). The protein is hydrophilic, as indicated by its negative GRAVY score, and is likely localized in the nucleus (Mondal2019An). SOX11 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may modulate its activity (Dy2008The). The protein's role as a pioneer factor involves binding to nucleosomes and facilitating chromatin opening, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation (Dodonova2020Nucleosomebound).

## Function
SOX11 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in embryonic development and cell fate determination. It is part of the SRY-related high-mobility group (HMG) box transcription factors, specifically within the SOXC family, which also includes SOX4 and SOX12. SOX11 is involved in the regulation of transcriptional and post-translational processes, such as phosphorylation, DNA methylation, and histone modification, which are essential for maintaining the homeostasis of progenitor and stem cells (Tsang2020Regulatory).

In healthy human cells, SOX11 is characterized by its ability to bind to DNA and initiate transcription events in closed chromatin, facilitating nucleosome remodeling and gene expression. This function is significant for its role in regulating the expression of genes necessary for normal cellular functions (Tsang2020Regulatory). SOX11 is expressed in various tissues during development, including the central and peripheral nervous systems, and is crucial for proper embryonic development (Dy2008The; Tsang2020Regulatory).

SOX11's rapid turnover, with a half-life of under two hours, allows for dynamic regulation of gene expression in response to cellular needs (Tsang2020Regulatory). It is also involved in amplifying canonical Wnt signaling, which is crucial for development, stem cell regulation, and cancer pathogenesis (Tsang2020Regulatory).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SOX11 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Coffin-Siris Syndrome (CSS) is linked to mutations in SOX11, such as S60P and Y116C, which affect the gene's DNA binding and transcriptional regulation capabilities. These mutations lead to decreased transcriptional activity and are associated with neurological features of CSS, as SOX11 is primarily expressed in brain and heart tissues (Hempel2015Deletions; Tsurusaki2014De). SOX11 mutations are rare, found in a small percentage of CSS cases, and are associated with a milder phenotype compared to mutations in other related genes (Tsurusaki2014De).

In cancer, SOX11 expression is notably altered. In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), SOX11 is typically expressed and serves as a marker to differentiate MCL from other B-cell neoplasms. Its expression levels correlate with TP53 mutations, influencing the prognosis and behavior of MCL (Federmann2019Highly). SOX11 is also implicated in various other cancers, where its expression is associated with tumor progression and prognosis. High SOX11 expression is linked to poor survival in several cancers, including breast and lung cancers, while in some contexts, it may indicate a better prognosis (Seok2021MultiOmics; Sun2022Systematic).

## Interactions
SOX11 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in neurogenesis and other cellular processes. In Xenopus, SOX11 interacts with partner proteins such as Pou3f2 and Neurog2, but not with Neurog1, indicating species-specific interactions (Singleton2020Pairing; Singleton2024Xenopus). The N-terminus, including the HMG domain, is essential for these interactions, with the first 46 amino acids being critical for strong binding (Singleton2020Pairing; Singleton2024Xenopus).

In the context of head and neck cancer cells, SOX11 interacts with HSP90α, a chaperone protein, which is abundant in these cells. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and is associated with the proliferation and invasion capacity of cancer cells (Elzakra2017Mass).

SOX11 also plays a role in chromatin remodeling by regulating components of the SWI/SNF complex in adrenergic neuroblastoma cells. It directly influences the expression of several epigenetic regulators, including HDAC2, PHF6, and CBX2, highlighting its role in transcriptional regulation and maintaining cellular identity (Decaesteker2023SOX11).

Additionally, SOX11 binds to nucleosomal DNA, causing local DNA distortions that facilitate DNA unwrapping, thereby increasing accessibility for transcriptional regulation (Dodonova2020Nucleosomebound).
