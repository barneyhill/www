# KPNA2

## Overview
KPNA2, or karyopherin subunit alpha 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins. The protein, also referred to as karyopherin α2, functions as an adaptor in the nuclear import pathway, recognizing nuclear localization signals (NLS) on substrate proteins and facilitating their transport into the nucleus by binding to importin beta (Mattaj1998NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC). This process is crucial for various cellular functions, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and circadian rhythm development (Umemura2014Transcriptional; Teng2006Importin). KPNA2 is categorized as a transport protein and is implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and increased malignancy (Zhang2015Karyopherin; Christiansen2013The). The protein's interactions with key regulatory proteins and transcription factors underscore its significant role in cellular processes and disease progression (Zeng2021KPNA2; Christiansen2013The).

## Structure
KPNA2, also known as karyopherin α2, is a protein involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. It consists of 529 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 58 kDa (Christiansen2013The). The protein structure includes an N-terminal importin β-binding (IBB) domain, which has an autoinhibitory function, ensuring that KPNA2 is only translocated when bound to importin β and a cargo molecule (Miyamoto2016Importin; Christiansen2013The). The central region of KPNA2 contains 10 armadillo (ARM) repeats, which are hydrophobic and serve as binding sites for nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins (OKA2018Importin; Christiansen2013The). These ARM repeats form a superhelical structure that facilitates the binding of NLS-containing proteins (OKA2018Importin).

The C-terminal region of KPNA2 is short and acidic, with no reported function (Christiansen2013The). The 10th ARM repeat is specifically where CAS, the factor responsible for recycling KPNA2 to the cytoplasm, binds (Christiansen2013The). KPNA2 can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its transport activity (OKA2018Importin).

## Function
KPNA2, also known as karyopherin subunit alpha 2, is a crucial component in the nuclear import of proteins in healthy human cells. It functions by recognizing nuclear localization signals (NLS) on substrate proteins and facilitating their transport through the nuclear pore complex. KPNA2 acts as an adaptor, binding to importin beta, which is essential for the docking and translocation of NLS-protein complexes into the nucleus (Mattaj1998NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC).

In the context of DNA repair, KPNA2 is involved in the nuclear import of the NBS1 protein, a component of the MRN complex, which is critical for DNA double-strand break repair and the DNA damage-activated cell-cycle checkpoint. This process is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis (Teng2006Importin).

KPNA2 also plays a role in the development of the circadian clock during cellular differentiation. It regulates the subcellular localization of PER proteins, which are essential for circadian clock development. Misregulation of KPNA2 expression can disrupt circadian rhythm development by causing abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of PER proteins, indicating its role in cellular differentiation and circadian clock regulation (Umemura2014Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
KPNA2 (karyopherin subunit alpha 2) is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and mutations. Overexpression of KPNA2 is commonly observed in several cancer types, including breast, bladder, prostate, ovarian, colon, and endometrial cancers, and is often associated with poor prognosis and increased malignancy (Zhang2015Karyopherin; Ikenberg2014KPNA2; Christiansen2013The). In ovarian cancer, KPNA2 expression is linked to lower survival rates and advanced disease stages, with specific mutations such as R197* and S140F potentially affecting its function (Cui2021Increased; Zheng2010Overexpression). 

In colon cancer, high KPNA2 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes, including lower disease-free and overall survival rates, and is considered an independent prognostic marker (Zhang2015Karyopherin). Similarly, in endometrial cancer, KPNA2 overexpression is associated with shorter overall survival and is an independent prognostic factor (Ikenberg2014KPNA2). 

KPNA2's role in cancer progression is linked to its involvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport, which affects cellular proliferation and tumor aggressiveness. Knockdown studies in various cancer cell lines have shown that reducing KPNA2 expression can decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2015Karyopherin; Guo2019Upregulated).

## Interactions
KPNA2, also known as karyopherin α 2, is involved in the nuclear import of various proteins by recognizing their nuclear localization signals (NLS). It interacts with several proteins that play crucial roles in cancer and cellular processes. KPNA2 is known to facilitate the nuclear import of the DNA repair proteins Chk2, BRCA1, and NBS1, as well as the androgen receptor, which is significant in prostate cancer (Tseng2005Importin; Christiansen2013The). The interaction between KPNA2 and NBS1 is particularly important for the proper nuclear localization and function of the MRN complex, which is involved in DNA double-strand break repair and checkpoint signaling (Tseng2005Importin).

KPNA2 also interacts with transcription factors such as E2F1, PLAG1, LOT1, and Kaiso, which are deregulated in cancer (Christiansen2013The). It is involved in the translocation of the small Rho-GTPase RAC-1, which is implicated in cell cycle progression and cellular adhesion (Christiansen2013The). In osteoarthritis, KPNA2 interacts with the NF-κB subunit p65, promoting its nuclear translocation and modulating catabolic events (Tao2015KPNA2). In bladder cancer, KPNA2 interacts with CBX8, influencing the PRDM1/c-FOS pathway and contributing to cancer progression (Zeng2021KPNA2). These interactions highlight KPNA2's role in various cellular processes and its potential impact on disease progression.
