# DPCD

## Overview
The DPCD gene encodes a protein known as the deleted in primary ciliary dyskinesia homolog (mouse), which is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those related to ciliary function. Although the protein's precise biological role remains to be fully elucidated, it is associated with several protein complexes, including the Uri/prefoldin complex, and has potential interactions with the transcription factor YY1, a component of the hINO80 complex (Sardiu2008Probabilistic). Despite its name, the DPCD gene has not been directly linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia in humans, as no mutations have been identified in affected individuals (Leigh2009Clinical). Additionally, the gene has been studied in the context of split hand and foot malformation, where genomic rearrangements rather than direct mutations may play a role (Dai2013Discontinuous).

## Clinical Significance
The DPCD gene has been investigated for its potential role in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by defects in ciliary function. Despite initial interest, studies have not identified mutations in the DPCD gene in patients with PCD, suggesting that it may not be a significant contributor to the PCD phenotype in humans (Leigh2009Clinical). Animal models, such as Dpcd/poll knock-out mice, have been used to study PCD, showing symptoms like sinusitis, situs inversus, hydrocephalus, male infertility, and ciliary inner dynein arm defects. These findings initially linked the DPCD gene to PCD-related symptoms, but no direct mutations in human DPCD have been found to cause PCD (Lobo2011Ciliary).

In addition to PCD, the DPCD gene has been implicated in split hand and foot malformation (SHFM). A study identified microduplications at chromosome 10q24.31, which includes the DPCD gene, in a Chinese family with SHFM. However, no coding or splice-site mutations in DPCD were found, indicating that its role in SHFM may be related to genomic rearrangements rather than direct mutations (Dai2013Discontinuous).

## Interactions
The DPCD protein is involved in the assembly of human protein interaction networks and has been studied using label-free quantitative proteomics. It is associated with several protein complexes, including the Uri/prefoldin complex, although it is not considered a core component of this or any of the four main complexes identified in the study, which are hINO80, SRCAP, TRRAP/TIP60, and Uri/prefoldin complexes (Sardiu2008Probabilistic). DPCD has shown high Jaccard indices with components of the Uri/prefoldin complex, suggesting potential interactions, but it was not detected in purifications using core components as baits (Sardiu2008Probabilistic).

DPCD is also linked to the transcription factor YY1, a member of the hINO80 complex, indicating a potential interaction between DPCD and YY1. This connection suggests that DPCD may play a role in linking YY1 to the Prefoldin complex (Sardiu2008Probabilistic). However, specific details on direct physical interactions of DPCD with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the available data (Sardiu2008Probabilistic).
