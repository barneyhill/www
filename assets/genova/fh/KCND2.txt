# KCND2

## Overview
The KCND2 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 2, commonly referred to as the Kv4.2 protein. This protein is a critical component of voltage-gated potassium channels, which are integral membrane proteins that facilitate the selective flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane. Kv4.2 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily involved in mediating A-type potassium currents in neurons. These channels play a pivotal role in regulating neuronal excitability and are essential for the repolarization phase of action potentials. Kv4.2 is predominantly expressed in the dendrites of neurons, particularly in the hippocampus, where it significantly influences synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes. The function and expression of Kv4.2 are modulated by interactions with auxiliary proteins and posttranslational modifications, which can alter its biophysical properties and surface expression (Lee2014Exome; Birnbaum2004Structure; Zhang2021KCND2).

## Structure
The KCND2 gene encodes the Kv4.2 protein, a voltage-gated potassium channel α-subunit. The primary structure of Kv4.2 includes six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) with cytoplasmic N- and C-termini, and a re-entrant loop between S5 and S6 that contains the potassium selectivity filter sequence (Zhang2021KCND2). The secondary structure likely involves transmembrane helices, particularly in the S6 region, which is part of the ion permeation pathway (Lee2014Exome). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices to form the ion conduction pathway, with the S5 and S6 helices surrounding the central pathway and the distal S6 segments functioning as the cytoplasmic gate (Zhang2021KCND2).

In terms of quaternary structure, Kv4.2 α-subunits tetramerize to form functional channels. These channels can form ternary complexes with auxiliary proteins such as KChIPs and DPPs, which modulate channel gating and increase surface expression (Zhang2021KCND2). The Kv4.2 channel is involved in synaptic plasticity and is expressed in specific brain areas, such as the hippocampus and cerebellum (Lee2014Exome). The protein's function is influenced by interactions with auxiliary subunits like KChIP3a and DPP10a, which affect its inactivation properties (Lee2014Exome).

## Function
The KCND2 gene encodes the Kv4.2 subunit, a critical component of voltage-gated potassium channels that mediate A-type potassium currents in neurons. These channels are essential for regulating neuronal excitability by controlling the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane, which influences the repolarization phase of action potentials (Lee2014Exome; Birnbaum2004Structure). Kv4.2 channels are predominantly expressed in the dendrites of neurons, including those in the hippocampus, where they play a significant role in modulating synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes (Lee2014Exome; Birnbaum2004Structure).

In healthy human cells, Kv4.2 channels contribute to the regulation of action potential back-propagation and the induction of synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for learning and memory (Villa2016Potassium). The channels are involved in the transient outward A-type K+ current, which helps set the resting membrane potential and regulate firing frequency (Birnbaum2004Structure). The activity of Kv4.2 is modulated by interactions with auxiliary proteins and posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can alter their surface expression and biophysical properties (Birnbaum2004Structure). These processes enable Kv4.2 to function as a molecular signal integration device, contributing to the sophisticated regulation of neuronal signaling (Birnbaum2004Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCND2 gene, which encodes the Kv4.2 potassium channel, have been associated with several neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, and global developmental delay (GDD). Specific variants such as p.Val404Met (V404M) have been identified in individuals with ASD and seizures, affecting the inactivation of potassium channels and potentially leading to increased neuronal excitability (Lee2014Exome; Zhang2021KCND2). This mutation is considered a gain-of-function variant, which can result in network hyperexcitability and contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Zhang2021KCND2).

KCND2 variants have also been linked to early-onset GDD, characterized by impaired motor, speech, and cognitive development, as well as developmental epileptic encephalopathy (Zhang2021KCND2). The presence of these variants can lead to both loss-of-function and gain-of-function effects on Kv4.2 channel gating, impacting neuronal excitability and synaptic function (Zhang2021KCND2). Additionally, KCND2 is located within a genomic interval associated with ASD, and its expression is co-regulated with other autism-related genes, suggesting a broader role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Lee2014Exome).

## Interactions
The KCND2 gene encodes the Kv4.2 potassium channel, which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its localization and function. Kv4.2 interacts with the actin-binding protein filamin, specifically filamin A and filamin C, through a proline-rich region near its C terminus. This interaction is crucial for the localization of Kv4.2 at filopodial roots and enhances its current density by increasing the channel's surface membrane density (Petrecca2000Localization).

Kv4.2 also forms complexes with KChIP2, an accessory protein that stabilizes the Kv4.2 protein in myocardial cells. The absence of KChIP2 leads to the destabilization and loss of Kv4.2 protein, despite unchanged transcript levels, indicating that KChIP2 is essential for Kv4.2 protein stability (Foeger2013Stabilization).

Proteomic analyses have identified additional interactors of Kv4.2, including the Kvβ1 subunit, the α6 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, and the G protein-coupled receptor 158. These interactions suggest a role for Kv4.2 in synaptic responses and plasticity (Marionneau2011Proteomic). In cardiac tissue, Myzap has been identified as an interactor, affecting early repolarization currents and cardiac electrophysiology (Maurya2023Outlining).
