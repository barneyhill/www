# FGFR1OP2

## Overview
The FGFR1OP2 gene encodes the FGFR1 oncogene partner 2 protein, which is characterized by its coiled-coil domains and plays a significant role in cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. This protein is particularly notable for its involvement in oncogenic processes, especially when it forms a fusion with the FGFR1 protein, resulting in the FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 fusion protein. This fusion protein is implicated in various hematological malignancies, including the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome, due to its ability to disrupt normal cell signaling pathways and promote malignant phenotypes (Savage2013Myeloid; Li2022The). The FGFR1OP2 protein's interactions, particularly with the Hsp90-CDC37 complex, are crucial for maintaining the stability and activity of the fusion protein, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in related diseases (Li2022The).

## Structure
The FGFR1OP2 gene encodes a protein consisting of 253 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 29 kDa (Li2022The). The protein structure includes four coiled-coil domains, which are significant for its function. In the context of the FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 fusion protein, the first two coiled-coil domains are retained, contributing to the formation of a fusion protein composed of 526 amino acids and approximately 60 kDa in size (Li2022The).

The FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 fusion protein is stabilized by forming a complex with Hsp90 and Hsp90-CDC37, which protects it from hydrolysis, indicating a role for post-translational modifications in maintaining its stability and activity (Li2022The). This fusion protein is involved in promoting stem cell differentiation into T cells and triggering lymphoma in a mouse model, highlighting its functional significance (Li2022The).

The FGFR1OP2 gene is located at the 12p11-12 locus and consists of 7 exons (Li2022The). The specific domains and structural features of FGFR1OP2, such as the coiled-coil domains, are crucial for its interactions and functional roles in cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
The FGFR1OP2 gene is implicated in several hematological malignancies due to its involvement in chromosomal translocations, particularly with the FGFR1 gene. One notable fusion, FGFR1OP2-FGFR1, results from a chromosomal insertion that creates an in-frame fusion protein. This fusion protein is associated with the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome, a condition characterized by the proliferation of myeloid and lymphoid cells, often accompanied by eosinophilia and lymphadenopathy (Savage2013Myeloid; Li2022The). Patients with this fusion frequently present with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) and may experience symptoms such as tissue infiltration by neoplastic eosinophils, leading to organ damage (Savage2013Myeloid; Li2022The).

The FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 fusion protein is stabilized by the Hsp90-CDC37 complex, which protects it from degradation, thereby maintaining its oncogenic activity (Li2022The). This fusion protein, in conjunction with Notch1, has been shown to promote stem cell differentiation into T cells and trigger lymphoma in mouse models, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of T-cell malignancies (Li2022The). The clinical significance of FGFR1OP2 mutations and their interactions in these diseases highlights the importance of targeted therapies, although specific treatments for FGFR1OP2-related conditions are still under investigation (Helsten2015Fibroblast).

## Interactions
The FGFR1OP2 protein, also known as FOP2, is involved in significant interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of oncogenic processes. One of the key interactions is with the FGFR1 protein, forming the FOP2-FGFR1 fusion protein. This fusion results from a chromosomal insertion that creates an in-frame fusion of exon 4 of FOP2 to exon 9 of FGFR1. The fusion protein is composed of 526 amino acids and is approximately 60 kDa in size. It includes two coiled-coil domains from FOP2, which are crucial for its function (Li2022The).

The FOP2-FGFR1 fusion protein is known to interact with the Hsp90 and Hsp90-CDC37 complex. This interaction is essential for maintaining the stability and activity of the fusion protein, as the complex forms a permanent association with FOP2-FGFR1 to protect it from hydrolysis (Li2022The).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, the FOP2-FGFR1 fusion gene results in a constitutively active protein that disrupts normal cell signaling pathways, including the STAT1 pathway. This disruption is linked to resistance to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced differentiation, highlighting the fusion protein's role in maintaining the malignant phenotype of these cells (Marchwicka2016Restored).
