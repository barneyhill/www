# TRIM64C

## Overview
The TRIM64C gene encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 64C, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are involved in various cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and oncogenesis. TRIM64C is implicated in the regulation of protein ubiquitination, a process critical for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. The specific biological roles and mechanisms of TRIM64C remain under investigation, but it is thought to participate in pathways related to immune response and cellular stress (Qiu2020aarFDC).
