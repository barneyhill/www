# SMIM46

## Overview
The SMIM46 gene encodes the small integral membrane protein 46, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its integration into cellular membranes, suggesting a role in membrane-associated functions, although its specific biological activities remain to be fully elucidated. The SMIM46 protein is implicated in pathways that are critical for cellular signaling and homeostasis, potentially influencing processes such as cell growth and differentiation. Research into SMIM46 is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its precise functions and interactions within the cell, as well as its relevance to human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
