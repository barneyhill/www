# NDUFA3

## Overview
NDUFA3 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A3, a crucial component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Zheng2024HDACH3K27acmediated). NDUFA3 is characterized as a transmembrane protein, with structural features that include an amphipathic helix and a single transmembrane helix, which contribute to its role in the assembly and stability of complex I (Padavannil2022The). The gene's expression and function are regulated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) and H3K27ac-mediated mechanisms, underscoring its involvement in cellular stress responses and mitochondrial health (Zheng2024HDACH3K27acmediated). NDUFA3's interactions within the complex I subassemblies are vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism in cells (Andrews2013Assembly).

## Structure
The NDUFA3 protein is a component of the mitochondrial respiratory complex I, playing a crucial role in its assembly and stability. Structurally, NDUFA3 is characterized by an amphipathic helix located at the matrix-membrane interface, a single transmembrane helix (TMH), and an α-helix followed by a C-terminal coil in the intermembrane space (IMS) (Padavannil2022The). The amphipathic helix of NDUFA3 interacts with the N-terminal amphipathic helix of NDUFS8, facilitating the trapping of lipids against ND1 and ND3 (Padavannil2022The). In the membrane and IMS, NDUFA3 interacts with ND3 and ND1 via a short α-helix and with other subunits such as NDUFA13, ND6, NDUFS5, NDUFB5, and NDUFA8 through a C-terminal coil, bridging components of the Q, P P -a, and P P -b subassemblies (Padavannil2022The).

In different organisms, the role of NDUFA3 varies. In Y. lipolytica, it traps several lipids against ND3 and ND2, while in mammals, the truncation of ND2 and absence of a homolog for NUXM result in fewer structured lipids in this region (Padavannil2022The). This suggests that NDUFA3's original function was to stabilize lipid binding at the interface of ND1, ND3, and ND2, a role that may be minimized in mammals (Padavannil2022The).

## Function
NDUFA3 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is crucial for mitochondrial function and ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. This protein is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a significant role in the electron transport chain by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. This process is essential for ATP production, which is vital for energy metabolism in cells (Zheng2024HDACH3K27acmediated).

In human nucleus pulposus cells (HNPCs), NDUFA3 overexpression has been shown to promote cell viability, inhibit apoptosis, decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and enhance mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). These effects suggest that NDUFA3 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, which are crucial for cell survival and function (Zheng2024HDACH3K27acmediated). The transcription of NDUFA3 is regulated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) and H3K27ac-mediated mechanisms, which can be influenced by HDAC inhibitors like TSA, highlighting its role in cellular stress responses and mitochondrial health (Zheng2024HDACH3K27acmediated).

NDUFA3 is also associated with the assembly of complex I, specifically as part of the 315-kDa subcomplex, which is an intermediate in the assembly process. This highlights its importance in the proper assembly and function of complex I, which is crucial for mitochondrial function and cellular respiration (Andrews2013Assembly).

## Interactions
NDUFA3 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is involved in the electron transport chain. It is part of a 315-kDa subcomplex that includes core subunits NDUFS2 and NDUFS3, anchored to the membrane by MT-ND1. This subcomplex also incorporates other subunits such as NDUFA8 and NDUFA13, along with assembly factors like NDUFAF3, NDUFAF4, and C3orf1 (Andrews2013Assembly). The interactions within this subcomplex are crucial for the assembly and stability of complex I.

NDUFA3 is noted for its relative stability compared to other subunits when NDUFS3 is depleted, indicating its role in forming stable complex I subassemblies (D’Angelo2020Biogenesis). Despite the absence of NDUFS3, NDUFA3 remains stable, suggesting its involvement in maintaining the integrity of the ND1-module (Arroum2023Loss).

The assembly of complex I is a modular process, and NDUFA3 is part of the ND1-module, which remains unaffected in certain knockout models, such as NDUFB10 KO cells. This highlights its role in the early stages of complex I assembly, where it contributes to the formation of subcomplexes that eventually integrate into the fully assembled complex I (Arroum2023Loss).
