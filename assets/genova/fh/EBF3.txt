# EBF3

## Overview
EBF3 (Early B-cell Factor 3) is a gene that encodes the EBF transcription factor 3, a member of the Collier/Olf/EBF (COE) family of transcription factors. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly during neuronal development and differentiation. EBF3 is characterized by its unique structural domains, including a zinc-finger-like DNA-binding domain, an Ig-like/plexins/transcription factors (IPT/TIG) domain, an atypical helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, and a C-terminal transactivation domain. These domains facilitate its function as a transcription factor, allowing it to bind DNA as a homodimer or heterodimerize with other EBF family members, thereby influencing various cellular processes. Mutations in the EBF3 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Blackburn2017Novel; Tanaka2017De; Huang2021A).

## Structure
The EBF3 protein, encoded by the EBF3 gene, is a member of the Collier/Olf/EBF (COE) family of transcription factors. It plays a crucial role in neuronal differentiation and development. The protein structure of EBF3 includes several distinct domains: a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with a unique zinc-finger-like conformation, an Ig-like/plexins/transcription factors (IPT/TIG) domain, an atypical helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, and a C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) (Huang2021A). The DBD is highly homologous to that of EBF1, featuring a zinc knuckle motif essential for DNA binding (Blackburn2017Novel). The TIG domain adopts an Ig-like fold, and the HLH domain forms a helix bundle, contributing to dimerization (Treiber2010Structure).

EBF3 binds to DNA as a homodimer and can heterodimerize with other EBF family members, potentially exerting a dominant-negative effect when mutations occur (Blackburn2017Novel). The protein's structure is crucial for its function, as mutations in conserved regions, such as the zinc knuckle motif, can significantly impact DNA binding and lead to neurodevelopmental disorders (Tanaka2017De). The EBF3 protein may also undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, influencing its activity and stability.

## Function
EBF3 (Early B-cell Factor 3) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression during neuronal development, where it influences the transcription of target genes essential for neuronal differentiation and function. EBF3 regulates the expression of genes such as peripherin and NF-M, which are crucial for forming the neuronal cytoskeleton and are linked to axonal pathfinding and stability (Green2011EBF). 

In the bone marrow, EBF3 is preferentially expressed in CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells, which are critical for maintaining hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niches. EBF3 inhibits the differentiation of CAR cells into osteoblasts, thereby preserving the bone marrow cavity and supporting HSC maintenance (Seike2018Stem). 

EBF3 also acts as a transcriptional regulator in neurodevelopmental processes, binding to the promoters of numerous genes involved in chromatin regulation and transcription factor activity (Padhi2021Coding). It is active in the nucleus, where it modulates cellular processes essential for normal development and function (Zhu2023Further).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EBF3 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably Hypotonia, Ataxia, and Delayed Development Syndrome (HADDS). These disorders are characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, ataxia, hypotonia, and distinctive facial features. Patients may also exhibit strabismus, genitourinary abnormalities, and autism spectrum disorder-like symptoms (Deisseroth2020Integrated; Zhu2023Further). 

Specific missense mutations, such as R63Q, R152C, R163G, and F211L, have been shown to impair the transcriptional activity of EBF3, affecting its regulatory role on the transcription of the p21 promoter. These mutations alter the subcellular localization and distribution of the EBF3 protein, validating their pathogenicity (Zhu2023Further). 

EBF3 is also implicated in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a tumor suppressor gene. In this context, EBF3 is often epigenetically silenced through promoter hypermethylation, leading to decreased expression and contributing to cancer pathogenesis (Tao2015Early). 

The gene's dysfunction is linked to a broader phenotypic spectrum, including autism spectrum disorders, with EBF3 haploinsufficiency suggested as a principal pathogenic factor in 10q26-deletion syndrome (Deisseroth2020Integrated).

## Interactions
EBF3 (EBF transcription factor 3) is a transcription factor that interacts with DNA to regulate gene expression. It binds to specific sites on the promoters of target genes, such as Atp2a1, which is crucial for muscle relaxation. EBF3 has been shown to bind with high affinity to the M1 and E2 sites on the Atp2a1 promoter, and weakly to the E1 site, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays (Jin2014Ebf).

EBF3 also interacts with other transcription factors to modulate gene expression. It works synergistically with MyoD, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, to induce the expression of Atp2a1. MyoD binds to E-boxes in the Atp2a1 promoter, and although no direct physical interaction between EBF3 and MyoD has been demonstrated, their combined action significantly enhances Atp2a1 expression (Jin2014Ebf).

In addition to its role in muscle physiology, EBF3 is involved in neurodevelopmental processes. It binds to DNA as a homodimer and can heterodimerize with other EBF family members. The DNA binding domain of EBF3 includes a 'zinc knuckle' motif, which is essential for its interaction with DNA (Blackburn2017Novel). Variants affecting this motif, such as the p.(Arg163Trp) mutation, can decrease DNA affinity, impacting transcriptional activation (Blackburn2017Novel).
