# SEMA6A

## Overview
SEMA6A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein semaphorin 6A, which is a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in axonal guidance and neuronal development. The semaphorin 6A protein is characterized by a sema domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a transmembrane region, which facilitate its interactions with plexin receptors, such as Plexin-A2 and Plexin-A4 (Siebold2013Structural; Wagner2023Semaphorin). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of neuronal migration, axonal growth, and the development of the nervous system. Beyond its role in neural development, semaphorin 6A is implicated in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal regulation and cancer progression, through its involvement in signaling pathways like the SEMA6A/RhoA/YAP axis (Loria2022SEMA6ARhoAYAP). Mutations and dysregulation of SEMA6A have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Rünker2011Mutation; Ji2023VHLHIF2α).

## Structure
SEMA6A, a member of the semaphorin family, is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of SEMA6A features a semaphorin (sema) domain, an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain, and a transmembrane region (Wagner2023Semaphorin). The sema domain is approximately 500 residues long and exhibits a seven-bladed β-propeller fold, which is a common structural motif among semaphorins (Nogi2010Structural; Siebold2013Structural). This domain is crucial for interactions with plexin receptors, forming a rigid interface with the adjacent PSI (plexin-semaphorin-integrin) domain, which is a cysteine-knot structure (Siebold2013Structural).

The tertiary structure of SEMA6A is defined by the folding of these domains, with the sema domain forming a relatively rigid β-propeller platform (Siebold2013Structural). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a homodimeric face-to-face arrangement, which is essential for binding to plexin receptors, such as plexin-A2, resulting in a 2:2 heterotetrameric complex (Wagner2023Semaphorin).

Post-translational modifications of SEMA6A include N-glycosylation, with six sites identified in the sema+PSI segment, contributing to its structural stability and function (Nogi2010Structural). SEMA6A can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with the dimeric state being significant for its interactions in cis with plexin receptors (Rozbesky2020Structural).

## Function
SEMA6A (semaphorin 6A) is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with plexin receptors. It plays a significant role in axonal guidance, neuronal migration, and the development of the nervous system. SEMA6A interacts with plexin-A2 and plexin-A4, facilitating the termination of neuronal migration and influencing cellular activities in tissues such as the cerebellum and retina (Wagner2023Semaphorin). In the central nervous system, SEMA6A is crucial for the development and function of oligodendrocytes, which are essential for myelination. Its absence leads to delayed differentiation and improper myelination of axons (Battistini2016Transmembrane).

SEMA6A also acts as a gatekeeper at the boundary between the central and peripheral nervous systems, preventing motoneurons from emigrating from the spinal cord. This function is critical for the proper formation of dorsal roots and the organization of sensory afferents (Mauti2007Semaphorin6A). Additionally, SEMA6A modulates neuronal responses through cis interactions with Plexin-A4, affecting axonal growth and guidance (HaklaiTopper2010Cis). In reverse signaling, SEMA6A influences cellular aggregation and neuronal morphology by interacting with cytoplasmic proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation (PerezBranguli2016Reverse).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SEMA6A gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. SEMA6A is associated with schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as its mutations lead to neurodevelopmental defects that mirror aspects of these conditions. In SEMA6A mutant mice, there are disruptions in axonal guidance and neuronal organization, resulting in behavioral phenotypes such as increased social sniffing, decreased social dominance, and memory deficits, which are relevant to the etiology of SZ and ASD (Rünker2011Mutation).

SEMA6A is also linked to psychiatric disorders through its role in limbic and cortical connectivity. Dysconnectivity in these brain regions, observed in SEMA6A mutants, parallels findings in SZ and bipolar disorder (BD) (Rünker2011Mutation). The gene is located in a chromosomal region associated with SZ, and its interactions with related genes like PLXNA2 suggest a broader implication in psychiatric conditions (Rünker2011Mutation).

In cancer research, SEMA6A has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. In lung cancer, SEMA6A is downregulated, and its overexpression reduces cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor suppression (Shen2018The). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SEMA6A is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting cancer progression when overexpressed (Ji2023VHLHIF2α).

## Interactions
SEMA6A interacts with several proteins, primarily through its role in axonal guidance and cellular signaling. It forms complexes with plexin receptors, particularly Plexin-A2 and Plexin-A4, to mediate repulsive guidance cues in neuronal development. The interaction between SEMA6A and Plexin-A2 is crucial for modulating the repulsion of hippocampal mossy fibers, with Plexin-A2 attenuating SEMA6A's repulsive effects (Suto2007Interactions). SEMA6A also interacts with Plexin-A4 in a cis configuration, which inhibits the binding of SEMA6A in trans, thereby modulating axonal responses (HaklaiTopper2010Cis).

In addition to its interactions with plexins, SEMA6A is involved in reverse signaling with PlxnA2, affecting cell morphology and neurite growth. This interaction is specific, as mutations in SEMA6A can prevent PlxnA2 binding (PerezBranguli2016Reverse). SEMA6A also engages in interactions that influence cancer progression, such as its role in the SEMA6A/RhoA/YAP axis in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells, where it regulates actin cytoskeleton remodeling (Loria2022SEMA6ARhoAYAP). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, SEMA6A interacts with SEC62, promoting β-catenin stabilization and cancer progression (Ji2023VHLHIF2α).
