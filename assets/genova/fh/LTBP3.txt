# LTBP3

## Overview
LTBP3, or latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the latent TGF-β binding protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, a critical pathway for cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and tissue repair. LTBP3 is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and unique 8-cysteine domains, facilitating its interaction with other proteins and its role in the extracellular matrix (ÖKLÜ2000The; Yin19988Cysteine). The protein is involved in the secretion, folding, and deposition of TGF-β in a latent form, ensuring its proper storage and activation (Saharinen2000Specific). Mutations in the LTBP3 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Dental Anomalies and Short Stature syndrome and thoracic aortic aneurysms, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Papatheodorou2022Genetics; Zhu2021Novel).

## Structure
The LTBP3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein family, characterized by its complex molecular structure. LTBP3 contains multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, including calcium-binding EGF-like modules, which are crucial for its function and confer resistance to proteolysis (ÖKLÜ2000The; Brooke2002Latent). The protein also features unique 8-cysteine (8Cys) domains, which are important for its interaction with other proteins and are involved in covalent binding with latent TGF-β1 (Yin19988Cysteine).

LTBP3 shares structural similarities with fibrillin-1, including the presence of fibrillin motifs and proline/glycine-rich regions (Brooke2002Latent). The protein is secreted as a soluble form into the extracellular matrix, where it plays a role in regulating TGF-β activity by enabling its secretion and activation (Brooke2002Latent). Alternative splicing of LTBP3 RNA results in variants that may affect its structural domains, such as deletions in the N-terminal region and the third 8Cys domain (ÖKLÜ2000The). These structural features and variations are essential for LTBP3's role in the extracellular matrix and its interactions with other proteins.

## Function
LTBP3 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 3) plays a crucial role in the regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and repair. LTBP3 is involved in the secretion, folding, and deposition of TGF-β into the extracellular matrix (ECM) in a latent form, ensuring its proper storage and activation when needed (ÖKLÜ2000The; Saharinen2000Specific). 

LTBP3 binds to the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of TGF-β, forming a small latent complex (SLC) that is secreted as part of a larger latent complex (LLC) (Morita2016Egr2). This interaction is mediated by specific sequence motifs in the 8-cysteine (8-Cys) repeats of LTBP3, which create a hydrophobic interaction surface necessary for binding TGF-β•LAP (Saharinen2000Specific). 

In healthy human cells, LTBP3 is essential for the correct folding and secretion of TGF-β, as well as its targeting to specific sites in the ECM, where it can be stored or activated (Todorovic2012LTBPs). This regulation is vital for maintaining tissue homeostasis and proper skeletal development, as LTBP3 ensures the availability of TGF-β for its biological functions (Todorovic2012LTBPs).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LTBP3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting dental, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Pathogenic variants, especially homozygous loss-of-function mutations, are linked to Dental Anomalies and Short Stature syndrome (DASS), characterized by dental anomalies, short stature, and thoracic aortic disease (Papatheodorou2022Genetics; Kantaputra2022Expanding). DASS can include features such as hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta, hypodontia, underdeveloped maxilla, brachyolmia, and various cardiac anomalies (Kantaputra2022Expanding).

LTBP3 mutations are also implicated in thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD). Both compound heterozygous and homozygous variants have been identified in patients with TAAD, suggesting a role in heritable thoracic aortic disease (Zhu2021Novel). Heterozygous variants have been associated with nonsyndromic hereditary thoracic aortic disease, often presenting as late-onset aortic aneurysms and dissections without systemic features (Papatheodorou2022Genetics).

In animal models, Ltbp3-deficient mice exhibit skeletal abnormalities such as craniofacial malformations and osteosclerosis, which align with human phenotypes (Dabovic2002Bone; Zhu2021Novel). These findings underscore the gene's critical role in bone development and maintenance, as well as its involvement in TGF-β signaling pathways.

## Interactions
LTBP3 interacts with various proteins, primarily within the extracellular matrix (ECM), playing a significant role in modulating growth factors. It binds non-covalently with growth factors from the TGF-β superfamily, such as myostatin and GDF11, and is involved in the retention and release of pro-myostatin in the ECM. Upon cleavage by furin, the mature growth factor is released from the complex with LTBP3. LTBP3 also binds pro-GDF11 and proprotein convertase 5/6A (PC5/6A), which cleaves the GDF11 propeptide from the mature cytokine. It may act as a chaperone for PC5/6A zymogen in the ECM, preventing its maturation and regulating the processing of GDF11 (Todorovic2012LTBPs).

LTBP3 forms a covalent binding interaction with latent TGF-β1, mediated by a reducible disulfide bond. This interaction is facilitated by specific structural motifs within LTBP3, particularly between the second proline/glycine-rich domain and the penultimate EGF-CB repeat (Yin19988Cysteine).

LTBP3 also interacts with the extracellular domain of the heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor precursor (proHB-EGF). This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid system, suggesting that LTBP3 might link soluble HB-EGF and TGF-β, potentially targeting the TGF-β large latent complex to the EGF receptor (Brooke2002Latent).
