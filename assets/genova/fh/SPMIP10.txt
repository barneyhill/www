# SPMIP10

## Overview
SPMIP10 is a gene that encodes the protein sperm microtubule inner protein 10, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of sperm cells. The protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, involved in the stabilization and organization of microtubules within the sperm flagellum. This structural role is essential for proper sperm motility, which is a critical factor in male fertility. Mutations or dysregulation of SPMIP10 can lead to defects in sperm motility, potentially resulting in male infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
