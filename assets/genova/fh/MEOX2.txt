# MEOX2

## Overview
MEOX2, or mesenchyme homeobox 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in various biological processes, particularly within the cardiovascular and skeletal systems. The MEOX2 protein is a homeobox-containing transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and vascular homeostasis. It is expressed in multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes, vascular smooth muscle, and endothelial cells, where it functions as a transcriptional activator of key cell cycle inhibitors. MEOX2 is essential for proper embryonic development, influencing bone and skeletal muscle formation, and it also contributes to the maintenance of vascular integrity by modulating angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. Its interactions with other proteins and regulatory elements underscore its significance in cellular processes and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders (Tachon2019Prognostic; Soto2016Meox2; Douville2011Mechanisms).

## Function
MEOX2, also known as mesenchyme homeobox 2, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating vascular cell proliferation and maintaining vascular homeostasis. It is expressed in various cell types within the adult cardiovascular system, including cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle, and endothelial cells (Tachon2019Prognostic; Douville2011Mechanisms). MEOX2 functions as a transcriptional activator of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 CIP1/WAF1 and p16 INK4a, which are crucial for controlling the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. This regulation is essential for determining whether a cell enters a state of arrest, either temporarily (quiescence) or permanently (senescence) (Irelan2009A; Douville2011Mechanisms).

MEOX2 is involved in preventing blood vessel stenosis and is necessary for proper bone and skeletal muscle formation during embryonic development (Douville2011Mechanisms). It also plays a role in inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis by down-regulating NF-kB, thus contributing to the maintenance of vascular homeostasis (Tachon2019Prognostic). MEOX2 is active in the nucleus, where it binds DNA to regulate gene expression, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation pathways (Douville2011Mechanisms).

## Clinical Significance
MEOX2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma, MEOX2 is overexpressed and associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, poor prognosis, and resistance to chemotherapy. It influences pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 and MAPK/ERK, promoting tumor growth and malignancy (Li2022Integrated; Schönrock2021MEOX2). MEOX2 expression is also linked to overall survival in glioma patients, especially in lower-grade gliomas, where it serves as a prognostic biomarker (Tachon2019Prognostic).

In Alzheimer's disease, MEOX2 haploinsufficiency is associated with increased neuronal cell loss and vascular dysfunction, contributing to disease progression. This is particularly evident in the presence of amyloid plaques, where MEOX2 downregulation leads to reduced cerebral vascular density and cognitive deficits (Soto2016Meox2).

In coronary heart disease, specific MEOX2 genetic variations are linked to increased risk, suggesting a role in lipid handling and angiogenic responses (Yang2015Coronary). In breast cancer, lower MEOX2 expression correlates with poorer survival, particularly in the Luminal A subtype (Wang2021The).

## Interactions
MEOX2, a transcription factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cellular processes. It forms heterodimers with Tcf15, which are crucial for regulating gene expression in heart capillary endothelial cells, particularly genes involved in lipid binding and fatty acid transport (Coppiello2015Meox2Tcf15). MEOX2 also interacts with RING finger protein 10 (RNF10), a ubiquitin ligase, through a specific binding region within MEOX2, facilitating transcriptional regulation and protein turnover (Lin2005Characterization).

In glioma cells, MEOX2 regulates the expression of cathepsin S (CTSS), promoting cell proliferation and motility. This interaction involves binding to the promoter regions of the CTSS gene, as confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays (Wang2022MEOX2mediated). MEOX2 also modulates the expression of genes involved in the glycolytic pathway and response to hypoxia in glioblastoma stem cells, potentially affecting transcription factor binding sites for SP1 and Klf4 (Proserpio2022MEOX2).

Additionally, MEOX2 interacts with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 CIP1/WAF1 promoter, activating transcription through SP1 binding sites, independent of p53 activity (Douville2011Mechanisms). These interactions highlight MEOX2's role in transcriptional regulation across different cellular contexts.
