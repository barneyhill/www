# OR4C13

## Overview
OR4C13 is a gene in humans that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily C member 13, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR4C13 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants. Beyond its primary olfactory function, OR4C13 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, including the male reproductive system, where it may play a role in sperm maturation and chemotaxis (Olaniyan2021Ovarian; Milardi2018Olfactory). Additionally, OR4C13 has been implicated in the context of traumatic brain injury, where its presence in neuronally derived extracellular vesicles suggests a potential role as a biomarker for sensory system impairment (Bhomia2024Transcriptomic).

## Function
The human gene OR4C13 encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of smell. OR4C13 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the sense of smell. Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4C13 has been identified in non-olfactory tissues, suggesting additional functions. 

In the male reproductive system, OR4C13 is expressed on the surface of sperm cells, including the acrosome, midpiece, and flagellum, and is present throughout the testicular tubules from immature germinal cells to more differentiated cells. It shows intense and diffuse staining in the epididymis, indicating a potential role in sperm maturation and migration (Milardi2018Olfactory). The receptor may be involved in chemotaxis, influencing sperm movement towards the egg by mediating chemotactic responses (Olaniyan2021Ovarian). 

In the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI), OR4C13 has been found in neuronally derived extracellular vesicles, with elevated levels in TBI patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential role in sensory system impairment and as a biomarker for TBI (Bhomia2024Transcriptomic).
