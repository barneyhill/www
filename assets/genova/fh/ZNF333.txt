# ZNF333

## Overview
ZNF333 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 333, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its zinc finger and KRAB domains. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, binding specifically to the ATAAT core sequence in DNA to modulate gene expression. The zinc finger protein 333 is predominantly located in the nucleus and is involved in the regulation of various genes, including those with roles in cardiac tissue, where its expression is notably high. The protein's structure, featuring 10 zinc finger domains and a KRAB domain, facilitates its interaction with DNA and other proteins, potentially forming chromatin-associated complexes that influence transcriptional regulation. ZNF333's activity is further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may enhance its repressive functions. Clinically, alterations in ZNF333 expression and mutations have been linked to conditions such as gastric intestinal metaplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its significance in disease progression and prognosis (Jing2004Identification; Hawe2022Genetic; Kuk2022Prognostic).

## Structure
The ZNF333 gene encodes a protein that is part of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by its zinc finger domains and KRAB domains. The primary structure of ZNF333 includes 10 zinc finger domains, each defined by a conserved 28 amino acid motif with a consensus sequence of CX2CX3FX5LX2HX3-6 (Jing2004Identification). The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 75.5 kDa and is predominantly nuclear (Jing2004Identification).

The secondary structure of ZNF333 includes typical C2H2 zinc finger structures, which are fewer in number compared to other similar proteins, suggesting a unique configuration or function (Jing2004Identification). The zinc finger region spans amino acids 368 to 644, while the KRAB domain is located between amino acids 4 to 267 (Jing2004Identification).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs into a stable three-dimensional shape, allowing the protein to bind specifically to the DNA core sequence ATAAT (Jing2004Identification). The KRAB domain is associated with transcriptional repression, potentially through interactions with corepressors or chromatin-modulating factors (Jing2004Identification).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may play a crucial role in the protein's function in transcriptional regulation, as the coding region contains several phosphorylation sites (Jing2004Identification).

## Function
ZNF333 is a KRAB zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily functioning as a transcriptional repressor. It binds specifically to the ATAAT core sequence in DNA, which is crucial for its role in repressing transcriptional activity by about fivefold, as demonstrated in luciferase assays (Jing2004Identification). The KRAB domain of ZNF333 is responsible for this repressive function, and its activity may be optimized by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Jing2004Identification).

ZNF333 is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest expression in the heart, suggesting a significant role in cardiac tissue (Jing2004Identification). It is involved in gene regulation by binding to specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of target genes, potentially interacting with corepressors or chromatin-modulating factors (Jing2004Identification). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape by modulating the expression of genes such as EIF3s2, Cox6A1, PPP2R4, and BCL2L12 (Jing2004Identification).

ZNF333 may also play a role in forming chromatin-associated protein complexes, influencing transcriptional regulation through interactions with other proteins and transcription factors (Hawe2022Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF333 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in gene regulation. In gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM), alterations in ZNF333 expression are significant. The ALKBH5/ZNF333 axis regulates gastric IM through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Overexpression of ZNF333 leads to the activation of NF-κB signaling, which is associated with the expression of CDX2, a marker linked to gastric IM. This suggests that changes in ZNF333 expression or its interaction with other molecules like CYLD can significantly impact the development of gastric IM (Yue2021Essential).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), ZNF333 is identified as a risk gene with a high co-occurrence with other genes in stage 4 of the disease. Mutations in ZNF333 are associated with a worse prognosis, as they are enriched in higher stages of OSCC and linked to poorer survival outcomes. This highlights the potential role of ZNF333 mutations in the progression and severity of OSCC (Kuk2022Prognostic).

ZNF333 is also involved in the repression of endogenous retroelements and potentially exogenous viruses, such as HIV, through its function as a KRAB-zinc finger protein. This suggests a broader role in immune defense mechanisms (Bruno2019The).

## Interactions
ZNF333 is a zinc finger protein that interacts with nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner. It binds to a core DNA sequence, ATAAT, as identified through various assays, including a random oligonucleotide selection assay and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) (Jing2004Identification). The binding of ZNF333 to DNA is zinc-dependent, and its interaction with the ATAAT sequence can be disrupted by zinc chelation with EDTA, indicating the importance of zinc ions in maintaining the structural integrity necessary for binding (Jing2004Identification).

The protein contains a KRAB domain, which functions as a transcriptional repressor. This domain allows ZNF333 to repress transcription of promoters containing the ATAAT sequence, as demonstrated by luciferase assays (Jing2004Identification). The KRAB domain's repressive function suggests that ZNF333 may form complexes with other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, although specific protein-protein interactions are not detailed in the study.

ZNF333's role in transcriptional repression may involve post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its interaction with other proteins and its ability to regulate gene expression (Jing2004Identification). The presence of several phosphorylation sites on ZNF333 supports this potential regulatory mechanism.
