# ZNF432

## Overview
ZNF432 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 432, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, characterized by its involvement in DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms. The protein is distinguished by its Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and multiple zinc finger (ZNF) repeats, which facilitate its role as a poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) reader and its interaction with various proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. ZNF432 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it modulates the balance between homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, the two main pathways for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. By enhancing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and interacting with key DDR proteins such as PARP-1, ZNF432 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability. Its clinical significance is underscored by its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer, particularly in enhancing the efficacy of PARP inhibitors, and its involvement in modulating treatment responses in asthma (Wu2014Inhaled; O’Sullivan2023ZNF432).

## Structure
ZNF432 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and a zinc finger (ZNF) domain with 16 repeats. The KRAB domain is located at the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-205), while the ZNF domain spans amino acids 205-652, indicating a modular structure typical of zinc finger proteins (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432). The ZNF domain includes a CNxC PAR-binding motif common to several C2H2-type zinc finger proteins, which facilitates interactions with poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) and is crucial for its function as a PAR reader (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432).

ZNF432 is a nuclear protein that relocalizes to sites of DNA damage through DNA- and PAR-dependent mechanisms. It interacts with TRIM28/KAP1 via the KRAB domain, targeting proteins in the nucleoplasm, while the ZNF domains target proteins uniformly in the nucleus (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432). The protein also contains five serine PARylation sites, three of which are located in the ZNF domains, suggesting post-translational modifications that may regulate its activity (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432). The C-terminal region, containing the zinc finger repeats, is particularly important for stimulating PARP-1 activity and binding single-stranded DNA, which is essential for its role in DNA repair processes (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432).

## Function
ZNF432 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR) in healthy human cells. It is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by modulating the balance between homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), the two primary pathways for DSB repair. ZNF432 stimulates poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), which is essential for recruiting proteins involved in DDR and guiding DNA repair pathways (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432). 

ZNF432 enhances PARP-1 activity, a key enzyme in DNA damage signaling and repair, by binding to single-stranded DNA and inhibiting EXO1-mediated resection, thus regulating DNA end resection during repair processes (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432). It acts as a PAR reader, binding to PAR in vitro, and forms complexes with PARP-1 and other proteins involved in DDR, such as KAP1, H2AX, and MDC1, suggesting its role in chromatin remodeling and maintaining genomic integrity (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432).

ZNF432's activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences the transcriptional landscape and cellular responses to DNA damage, contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability in healthy cells (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF432 gene have been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer and asthma. In ovarian cancer, lower expression levels of ZNF432 are observed compared to normal tissue. This reduced expression is associated with increased resistance to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), a class of drugs used in cancer therapy. Overexpression of ZNF432 in ovarian cancer cell lines, including those resistant to PARPi, sensitizes them to these inhibitors, suggesting that ZNF432 could be a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of PARPi in resistant cancer cells (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432).

In the context of asthma, genetic variants in the ZNF432 gene have been linked to the response to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11666341, is associated with variable expression of ZNF432 in response to corticosteroid treatment. Individuals with certain alleles of this SNP exhibit altered ZNF432 expression, which may influence their bronchodilator response, highlighting the gene's potential role in modulating treatment efficacy in asthmatics (Wu2014Inhaled).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZNF432 in both cancer and asthma, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for treatment response and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
ZNF432 is a zinc finger protein involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. It forms stable complexes with PARP-1 and chromatin remodeling proteins, even in the absence of PARP-1, indicating its role in DDR through a PARP-1-dependent pathway (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432). ZNF432 enhances PARylation at DNA double-strand breaks by promoting PARP-1 assembly and activation, with its C-terminal zinc finger repeats being crucial for this activity (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432). It also interacts with KAP1/TRIM28, a scaffold protein involved in transcription silencing and DNA repair (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432).

ZNF432 binds both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, with a preference for single-stranded DNA, and inhibits DNA resection by EXO1, a process independent of PAR presence (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432). This binding ability is attributed to its zinc finger domains, as the KRAB domain shows negligible DNA binding (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432). The protein's interaction network includes several DDR-associated proteins and chromatin remodelers, highlighting its broader role in genomic maintenance (O’Sullivan2023ZNF432). These interactions suggest that ZNF432 plays a significant role in modulating DNA repair pathways and influencing cellular responses to DNA damage.
