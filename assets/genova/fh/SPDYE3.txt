# SPDYE3

## Overview
SPDYE3 is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E3, which is part of the Speedy/RINGO family known for its role in cell cycle regulation. This protein functions as a cell cycle regulator by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are pivotal for the progression of the cell cycle, particularly during the transitions from G1 to S phase and G2 to M phase (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE3 is characterized by a unique domain architecture and has undergone positive selection, suggesting its specialized function in humans (Wang2018Extensive). The gene is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the testis and the prefrontal cortex, indicating its potential roles in reproductive and cognitive functions (Wang2018Extensive).

## Function
SPDYE3 is a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, which plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Wang2018Extensive). This regulation is essential for cell cycle progression, particularly in the transitions from G1 to S phase and G2 to M phase, which are critical for cell proliferation and genomic stability. SPDYE3, as part of the Speedy subfamily E, exhibits a novel domain architecture and has undergone positive selection, indicating its functional differentiation in humans (Wang2018Extensive).

In healthy human cells, SPDYE3 is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the testis and the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Its constitutive expression in the prefrontal cortex across the lifespan suggests a role in fundamental brain functions and potential involvement in brain development (Wang2018Extensive). The diverse expression patterns of SPDYE3 and its interactions with other Speedy family members through potential ceRNA networks mediated by common miRNAs suggest that SPDYE3 may have diverse functions, particularly in the development of the prefrontal cortex in fetuses (Wang2018Extensive). These molecular activities highlight SPDYE3's importance in both reproductive and cognitive functions.
