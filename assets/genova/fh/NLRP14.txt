# NLRP14

## Overview
NLRP14 is a gene that encodes the NLR family pyrin domain containing 14 protein, which is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family. This protein is characterized by its pyrin domain (PYD), a central nucleotide-binding domain (NACHT), and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which are integral to its role in cellular signaling and immune response. NLRP14 is primarily expressed in the testis and is involved in spermatogenesis, playing a crucial role in the development of sperm cells (Westerveld2006Mutations). The protein's structural features, including its unique dimerization mode, are essential for its function in innate immunity, potentially through inflammasome formation (Eibl2014Structures). Mutations in NLRP14 have been associated with male infertility and certain inflammatory disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Westerveld2006Mutations; Okuzaki2016Microarray).

## Structure
The NLRP14 protein is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, characterized by its pyrin domain (PYD) at the N-terminus, a central nucleotide-binding domain (NACHT), and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) at the C-terminus. The pyrin domain is part of the death-domain superfamily, which includes CARDs, DEDs, and DDs, and is crucial for molecular interactions in innate immunity (Eibl2014Structures).

The PYD of NLRP14 exhibits a six-helix bundle architecture, typical of the death-domain superfamily, but with unique features such as a rearranged C-terminal helix 6, forming an extended 5/6 stem-helix. This structural rearrangement mediates a novel symmetric dimerization mode, which is significant for NLRP14's signaling functions (Eibl2014Structures). The dimer interface is stabilized by a hydrophobic motif involving residues Trp72, Leu76, and Leu87 (Eibl2014Structures).

Mutations in the PYD, such as D86V and L84R, affect its structural conformation and stability. The D86V mutation is associated with spermatogenic failure and alters the electrostatic surface potential, impacting dimerization and interaction with other proteins (Eibl2014Structures). The L84R mutation reconstitutes a charge bridge, resulting in a more stable monomeric form (Eibl2014Structures). These structural insights are crucial for understanding NLRP14's role in immune signaling and its potential interactions with adapter proteins like ASC (Eibl2014Structures).

## Function
NLRP14, a member of the NLRP family, plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the testis. It is expressed in A dark spermatogonia, mid and late spermatocytes, and spermatids, indicating its involvement in the development of sperm cells (Westerveld2006Mutations). The protein contains a pyrin domain, a NACHT domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which are crucial for its function in cellular signaling and oligomerization (Huber2014Intrinsic). The pyrin domain is involved in oligomerization and signal transduction, with its conformational dynamics being key to its function (Huber2014Intrinsic).

NLRP14 is not subject to genomic imprinting, as both alleles are equally expressed in testis tissue, suggesting a balanced role in cellular processes (Westerveld2006Mutations). The protein's intrinsic flexibility allows it to shift between different conformational states, which is essential for its signaling functions (Huber2014Intrinsic). Although primarily associated with reproductive functions, NLRP14 is also implicated in innate immunity, potentially through its involvement in inflammasome formation, which is crucial for activating inflammatory cytokines (Eibl2014Structures).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NLRP14 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly spermatogenic failure, which includes conditions such as azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia. Studies have identified several mutations in NLRP14 that are unique to men with these conditions, including a nonsense mutation that introduces an early stop codon, likely resulting in a truncated protein. These mutations are thought to disrupt normal spermatogenesis, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Westerveld2006Mutations).

NLRP14 is also implicated in Behçet's disease, a chronic inflammatory disorder. A nonsense mutation in NLRP14 was identified in familial cases of Behçet's disease, suggesting a potential role in its pathogenesis. This mutation may lead to a truncated protein that could affect immune system function, although it was not found in other Behçet's disease patients, indicating it might be specific to certain families (Okuzaki2016Microarray).

The structural analysis of NLRP14 has revealed that certain mutations, such as D86V, can alter the protein's interaction capabilities by affecting its electrostatic surface potential. This mutation may influence the protein's ability to interact with other components, potentially impacting its physiological role (Eibl2014Structures).

## Interactions
NLRP14, a member of the NLR family, is involved in protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in immune signaling and spermatogenesis. The pyrin domain (PYD) of NLRP14 is essential for these interactions, particularly in forming inflammasome complexes. The PYD facilitates homotypic interactions necessary for recruiting downstream effector molecules, such as the adaptor protein ASC, which in turn recruits caspase-1. However, experimental results indicate that neither the wild-type NLRP14 PYD nor its longer construct interacts with ASC PYD in a 1:1 complex, unlike AIM2 PYD, which does interact with ASC (Eibl2014Structures).

Mutations in NLRP14, such as D86V, affect its interaction capabilities. The D86V mutation alters the electrostatic surface potential of NLRP14 PYD, potentially impacting its interaction with ASC by introducing hydrophobic patches and breaking the extensive negatively charged surface seen in the wild-type (Eibl2014Structures). This mutation may affect the binding properties of NLRP14 PYD in its dimeric state, suggesting a loss of electrostatic complementarity to ASC and a tendency for aggregation (Eibl2014Structures). These structural insights into NLRP14 interactions are significant for understanding its role in immune signaling and its implications in spermatogenic failure.
