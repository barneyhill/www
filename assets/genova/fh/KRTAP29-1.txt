# KRTAP29-1

## Overview
KRTAP29-1 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 29-1, which is part of the keratin-associated protein family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the structural composition of keratinized tissues, such as hair and nails, where they interact with keratin intermediate filaments to enhance the mechanical properties of these tissues (Boldt2016An). The protein encoded by KRTAP29-1 is characterized by its ability to form disulfide bonds with keratins, contributing to the texture and strength of hair. While the gene has been implicated in genetic studies related to conditions such as asthma exacerbations, the specific functional roles and interaction partners of the keratin-associated protein 29-1 remain to be fully elucidated (Anderson2013Genetic; Pease2022Transcriptomic).

## Clinical Significance
The KRTAP29-1 gene, part of the keratin-associated protein family, has been linked to asthma exacerbations. Genetic analysis has identified significant markers on chromosome 17 associated with asthma exacerbations, including four markers in the KRTAP29-1 gene. These markers are highly correlated, suggesting a single genetic association with asthma exacerbations, although the specific clinical implications of this association remain unclear (Anderson2013Genetic).

In the context of skin aging, increased expression of KRTAP29-1 has been observed in fibroblasts and extracellular matrix interactions in aging female skin. This change is associated with alterations in fiber content and extracellular matrix interactions, which are linked to menopause in middle-aged women. The study suggests that these transcriptional changes may contribute to the aging process of the skin, although the direct clinical significance of KRTAP29-1 in this context is not fully detailed (Pease2022Transcriptomic).

While the Boldt2016An study mentions the removal of keratin-associated proteins, including KRTAP29-1, from their analysis due to their potential as contaminants, it does not provide specific information on the clinical significance of KRTAP29-1 (Boldt2016An).

## Interactions
KRTAP29-1, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, is involved in interactions with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the structural integrity of keratinized tissues such as hair and nails. These interactions typically involve the formation of disulfide bonds with keratins, which influence the texture and strength of hair. However, specific protein-protein interactions involving KRTAP29-1 have not been extensively detailed in the available literature.

In the context of protein interaction studies, KRTAP29-1 was identified as a potential contaminant in TAP-MS analyses, suggesting that its interactions may behave like negative interactions in certain experimental setups (Boldt2016An). This indicates that while KRTAP29-1 may be present in complex mixtures, its interactions might not be specific or significant in those contexts.

Additionally, KRTAP29-1 has been associated with genetic studies, such as those examining asthma exacerbations, where it was identified on chromosome 17 as part of a family of keratin-associated proteins. However, specific interactions involving KRTAP29-1 in these studies were not detailed (Anderson2013Genetic). Overall, while KRTAP29-1 is recognized for its structural role, detailed interaction partners remain to be elucidated.
