# CDKL4

## Overview
CDKL4, or cyclin-dependent kinase-like 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the serine/threonine kinase family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction pathways. As a kinase, CDKL4 plays a critical role in phosphorylating target proteins, which can alter their activity, localization, or interaction with other proteins. The precise biological functions of CDKL4 are still being elucidated, but it is known to participate in pathways that are crucial for normal cellular function and development. Mutations or dysregulation of CDKL4 have been implicated in several diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Qiu2020aarFDC).
