# TSPAN3

## Overview
TSPAN3 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 3, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, which is characterized by four transmembrane domains. Tetraspanin 3 is involved in organizing membrane microdomains and facilitating various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. The protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of intracellular β1 integrin recycling and is implicated in the activation of the FAK/MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation (Zhang2024Tetraspanin; Su2021Tetraspanin). Tetraspanin 3 is also associated with cancer progression, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, where it interacts with key proteins and signaling pathways (Zhang2018Tumor; Zhang2024Tetraspanin). Its expression in cardiovascular tissues suggests a potential role in cardiovascular diseases, although the clinical significance of TSPAN3 mutations remains to be fully elucidated (Sun2021A).

## Structure
Tetraspanin 3 (TSPAN3) is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, characterized by four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops: a small extracellular loop (SEL) and a larger extracellular loop (LEL) (Orinska2020Tetraspanins; Zhang2024Tetraspanin). The LEL contains a conserved Cys-Cys-Gly motif, which is crucial for protein interactions (Orinska2020Tetraspanins; GarciaEspaña2008Appearance). TSPAN3 has six potential N-linked glycosylation sites in its second extracellular loop, which contribute to its glycosylation status (Tiwari‐Woodruff2004Developmental). Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification for tetraspanins, affecting their interactions and functions (Orinska2020Tetraspanins).

TSPAN3 can form complexes with other proteins, such as β1 integrin and OSP/claudin-11, influencing cell signaling and adhesion (Zhang2024Tetraspanin; Tiwari‐Woodruff2004Developmental). The protein exists in two forms, a 32-kDa monomer and a 56-kDa form, which may indicate dimerization or association with another protein (Tiwari‐Woodruff2004Developmental). TSPAN3's interaction with β1 integrin is facilitated by its LEL domain, which is essential for integrin recycling and cell proliferation (Zhang2024Tetraspanin; Su2021Tetraspanin). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and myelin sheath formation (Tiwari‐Woodruff2004Developmental).

## Function
Tetraspanin 3 (TSPAN3) is a member of the tetraspanin family, which are integral membrane proteins involved in organizing membrane microdomains and facilitating various cellular processes. TSPAN3 plays a significant role in the regulation of intracellular β1 integrin recycling, a process crucial for cell adhesion and migration. It interacts with β1 integrin through its large extracellular loop (LEL) domain, facilitating the sorting of β1 integrin into Rab11a recycling endosomes. This interaction promotes the recycling of β1 integrin back to the cell surface, thereby enhancing cell proliferation and migration (Zhang2024Tetraspanin; Su2021Tetraspanin).

TSPAN3 is also involved in activating the FAK/MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation. This activation is dependent on the presence of integrin ligands, such as fibronectin, which suggests that TSPAN3's role in cell proliferation is context-dependent (Zhang2024Tetraspanin). The protein is highly expressed in certain cancerous tissues, indicating its potential role in tumor progression, although its function in healthy cells is primarily related to maintaining normal cell adhesion and signaling processes (Zhang2024Tetraspanin).

## Clinical Significance
TSPAN3 has been implicated in the progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through its interaction with miR-139-5p, a microRNA that acts as a tumor suppressor. In AML, miR-139-5p is downregulated, leading to the upregulation of TSPAN3. This imbalance contributes to the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. The overexpression of TSPAN3 in AML cells promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, while its suppression by miR-139-5p results in reduced tumor growth and cell cycle arrest (Zhang2018Tumor).

In the cardiovascular system, TSPAN3 is expressed at moderate to high levels in human tissues such as the aorta and coronary arteries. Although specific mutations in TSPAN3 have not been detailed, its expression is noted to be potentially upregulated under pathological conditions, suggesting a role in cardiovascular diseases (Sun2021A). However, the clinical significance of TSPAN3 mutations in other diseases remains unclear, as current studies do not provide detailed information on this aspect (Sun2021A).

## Interactions
Tetraspanin 3 (TSPAN3) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TSPAN3 interacts with β1 integrin, a critical component in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. This interaction is facilitated through the large extracellular loop (LEL) domain of TSPAN3, which is essential for the upregulation of β1 integrin expression in NSCLC cells (Zhang2024Tetraspanin; Su2021Tetraspanin). TSPAN3 also forms complexes with Rab11a, a protein involved in endosomal recycling. This interaction aids in the sorting of β1 integrin into Rab11a recycling endosomes, promoting its recycling and reducing lysosomal degradation, which is crucial for NSCLC cell proliferation (Zhang2024Tetraspanin; Su2021Tetraspanin).

In addition to its role in NSCLC, TSPAN3 is targeted by miR-139-5p, a microRNA that acts as a tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). miR-139-5p directly targets TSPAN3, negatively regulating its expression and influencing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and survival (Zhang2018Tumor). These interactions highlight TSPAN3's involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
