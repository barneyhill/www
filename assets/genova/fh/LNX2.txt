# LNX2

## Overview
LNX2, or ligand of numb-protein X 2, is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination and degradation. The LNX2 protein is characterized by its domain architecture, which includes a RING domain, zinc finger motifs, and multiple PDZ domains, facilitating diverse protein-protein interactions (Young2018LNX1LNX2; Nayak2015Structural). As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, LNX2 plays a crucial role in regulating neural communication, immune responses, and cell fate decisions by targeting specific proteins for degradation, such as connexin36 and the glycine transporter GlyT2 (Hong2020The). Additionally, LNX2 is implicated in the modulation of Notch signaling through its interaction with NUMB, influencing neurogenesis and osteoclast differentiation (Young2018LNX1LNX2; Lee2023Impaired). Clinically, alterations in LNX2 expression are associated with various diseases, including colorectal cancer and haematological tumors, highlighting its significance in oncogenic pathways and immune modulation (Young2018LNX1LNX2).

## Structure
The LNX2 protein is characterized by a specific domain architecture that includes an amino-terminal RING domain flanked by zinc finger motifs (ZnFs), a NUMB-binding NPAY/F motif, four PDZ domains, and a carboxyl-terminal PDZ-binding motif (Young2018LNX1LNX2). The RING domain, crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, is part of a Zn-RING-Zn structure, which includes two zinc-binding motifs forming a unique open circle conformation (Nayak2015Structural). This domain spans amino acids 20-147, with the core RING domain located between Asp46 and Arg90 (Nayak2015Structural).

The PDZ domains in LNX2 facilitate protein-protein interactions and are involved in binding to various ligands, including the human glycoprotein CD8α (D’Agostino2011Ligand). These domains are crucial for the protein's tertiary structure, forming compact, globular units that contribute to its functional versatility (Young2018LNX1LNX2). LNX2 can form homodimers or heterodimers, although it can function in a monomeric state (Hong2020The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate LNX2's E3 ubiquitin ligase functions (Hong2020The). Alternative splicing may result in different isoforms, potentially altering its structural and functional properties (Young2018LNX1LNX2).

## Function
LNX2 (ligand of numb-protein X 2) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in various cellular processes through its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. It plays a significant role in the regulation of neural gap junctions by targeting connexin36 for ubiquitylation and lysosomal degradation, which is crucial for maintaining neural communication and synapse formation in the central nervous system (Hong2020The). LNX2 also regulates the degradation of the glycine transporter GlyT2, impacting glycinergic neurotransmission (Hong2020The).

In the context of immune function, LNX2 interacts with the T-cell co-receptor CD8α, leading to its polyubiquitylation and degradation, which may influence immune responses (Hong2020The; D’Agostino2011Ligand). LNX2 is also involved in the regulation of Notch signaling by promoting the degradation of NUMB, a protein that inhibits Notch signaling, thereby influencing cell fate decisions and differentiation (Young2018LNX1LNX2; Lee2023Impaired).

LNX2's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with various proteins through its PDZ domains, affecting processes such as cell polarity, cytoskeleton remodeling, and cellular mobility (Young2018LNX1LNX2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LNX2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In colorectal cancer (CRC), LNX2 is overexpressed due to gene amplification in the chromosomal region 13q12.2, which is frequently amplified in CRC. This overexpression affects the NOTCH and WNT/β-catenin signaling pathways, crucial in CRC tumorigenesis (Young2018LNX1LNX2). LNX2 is also associated with haematological tumors, as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within its promoter region increases susceptibility to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Young2018LNX1LNX2).

In the context of immune response, LNX2 mRNA levels are elevated in chronic Q fever compared to acute Q fever, suggesting a role in immune modulation (Young2018LNX1LNX2). LNX2 is involved in glycinergic neurotransmission by regulating the degradation of the glycine transporter GlyT2. Dysregulation of this process can lead to neurological conditions such as hyperekplexia, characterized by muscle stiffness and elevated startle responses (Hong2020The; de2019E3).

LNX2's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in colorectal carcinoma, where it promotes oncogenic potential through NOTCH and WNT signaling pathways (Hong2020The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LNX2 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
LNX2, a member of the LNX protein family, is known for its interactions with various proteins through its PDZ domains. It interacts with the human glycoprotein CD8α, where the PDZ domains of LNX2 bind to the cytosolic C-terminal valine motif of CD8α. This interaction leads to the ubiquitylation and endocytosis of CD8α, promoting its degradation in lysosomes (D’Agostino2011Ligand). LNX2 also interacts with the presynaptic glycine transporter GlyT2, leading to its ubiquitination and affecting its expression and function, which is significant in glycinergic neurons (de2019E3).

LNX2 is involved in the NOTCH signaling pathway through its interaction with NUMB and Numblike proteins. It binds to these proteins via an NPAF motif, leading to their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which can influence cell fate decisions (Nayak2015Structural; Young2018LNX1LNX2). LNX2's interaction with NUMB is crucial for modulating NOTCH signaling, particularly during neurogenesis and osteoclast differentiation (Young2018LNX1LNX2). These interactions highlight LNX2's role in various cellular processes, including synapse formation, neurotransmission, and neuroglial function (Young2018LNX1LNX2).
