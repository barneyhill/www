# TOGARAM2

## Overview
TOGARAM2 is a gene that encodes the protein TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 2, which is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, playing a significant role in cellular processes that require microtubule organization and stability. The TOGARAM2 protein is particularly important in the context of cancer biology, where it has been implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as cervical and breast cancer. Its expression levels and functional interactions suggest that it may act as an oncogene, particularly in HPV18+ cervical cancer, where it is associated with poor survival outcomes and enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion (Patterson2024The). Additionally, TOGARAM2 is part of a prognostic model for breast cancer, indicating its potential utility as a biomarker for disease progression (Hu2024Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
TOGARAM2 is implicated in the progression of cervical cancer, particularly in cases associated with HPV18+ infections. The gene is upregulated in HPV18+ cervical cancers and is linked to poor survival outcomes. Research indicates that TOGARAM2 is a TAZ-dependent gene, playing a crucial role in TAZ-mediated migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Knockdown of TOGARAM2 in HeLa cells results in decreased cell growth and colony formation, while its overexpression enhances growth and invasion capabilities, suggesting its role as an oncogene in HPV18+ cervical cancer (Patterson2024The).

In breast cancer, TOGARAM2 is included in a prognostic model related to tumor immunological phenotypes. It is identified as one of the genes associated with a Tumor Immunological Phenotype (TIP) score, which correlates with patient prognosis. Although the study does not specifically discuss diseases directly caused by TOGARAM2 mutations, its inclusion in the prognostic model highlights its potential significance in breast cancer (Hu2024Clinical).

Overall, TOGARAM2's role in cancer biology, particularly in cervical and breast cancers, underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions and as a biomarker for disease progression.
