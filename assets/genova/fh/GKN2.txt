# GKN2

## Overview
GKN2 is a gene that encodes the protein gastrokine 2, which is predominantly expressed in the gastric epithelium. Gastrokine 2 is a member of the BRICHOS protein superfamily and is secreted by mucus-producing epithelial cells in the stomach. It plays a critical role in maintaining gastric mucosal homeostasis and acts as a stomach-specific tumor suppressor. The protein is involved in inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells, thereby preventing malignant transformation (Menheniott2016Loss). Additionally, gastrokine 2 functions as an anti-inflammatory paracrine signal, helping to maintain epithelial integrity and prevent inflammation-driven tumorigenesis. Its expression is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines, indicating its role as a cytokine-responsive transcriptional rheostat (Menheniott2016Loss). The loss of GKN2 expression is associated with increased gastric inflammation and susceptibility to gastric lesions, highlighting its importance in immune regulation and epithelial differentiation (Menheniott2016Loss).

## Function
Gastrokine 2 (GKN2) is a protein primarily expressed in the surface mucus cells of the gastric epithelium, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining gastric mucosal homeostasis. In healthy human cells, GKN2 functions as a homeostatic regulator of mucosal immunity and is believed to act as a stomach-specific tumor suppressor gene. It is involved in inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells, suggesting its role in preventing malignant transformation (Menheniott2016Loss).

GKN2 is part of the BRICHOS protein superfamily and is secreted by mucus-producing epithelial cells in the stomach. It is thought to function as an anti-inflammatory paracrine signal, helping to maintain epithelial integrity and prevent inflammation-driven tumorigenesis. The protein's expression is negatively regulated by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, indicating that GKN2 acts as a cytokine-responsive transcriptional rheostat (Menheniott2016Loss).

In mouse models, the loss of GKN2 expression has been associated with increased gastric inflammation and epithelial proliferation, leading to mucosal defects and increased susceptibility to gastric lesions. These findings underscore GKN2's role in regulating immune responses and maintaining gastric epithelial differentiation (Menheniott2016Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GKN2 gene are significantly associated with gastric cancer. GKN2 is typically downregulated in gastric cancer tissues, and its reduced expression is linked to poor overall survival, particularly in node-positive cases (Song2019Multiscale). The loss of GKN2 expression is one of the most frequent alterations observed in gastric adenocarcinomas and tumor cell lines (Menheniott2016Loss). This downregulation is also associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, which exacerbates gastric inflammation and tumor progression (Menheniott2016Loss).

GKN2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene, and its overexpression has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells (Menheniott2016Loss). The gene's loss leads to a proinflammatory phenotype, characterized by elevated cytokine levels and increased immune cell infiltration, which contributes to gastric tumorigenesis (Menheniott2016Loss). GKN2 also interacts with Trefoil Factor 1 (TFF1), and their combined expression has synergistic antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on gastric cancer cells (Kim2017Heterodimeric).

In addition to its role in cancer, GKN2 is involved in stress-induced gastric lesions, where its expression is linked to increased epithelial cell death and inflammation (Zhang2020Inhibition). The gene's expression is modulated by stress through the glucocorticoid receptor, which may contribute to gastric mucosal damage under stress conditions.

## Interactions
GKN2 (gastrokine 2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in gastric cancer suppression and inflammation regulation. It has been reported to form heterodimers with trefoil factor 1 (TFF1), suggesting a cooperative function in maintaining gastric mucosal integrity and potentially influencing tumorigenesis (Menheniott2016Loss). GKN2 also interacts with proteins from the Trefoil factor family (TFF), which are secreted onto epithelial surfaces with mucus, indicating a role in the regulation of gastric cancer (Dai2020NK6).

In the context of transcriptional regulation, GKN2 is influenced by the transcription factor NKX6-2, which binds to the promoter region of GKN2, facilitating its transcription. This interaction has been validated through dual-luciferase assays, demonstrating that NKX6-2 directly binds to the GKN2 promoter, promoting its transcription (Dai2020NK6).

In placental tissues, GKN2 co-localizes with smooth muscle actin (SMA) and HLA-G, suggesting potential interactions in the context of placental development and cell-cell adhesion (Fahlbusch2015Trophoblast). These interactions highlight GKN2's involvement in both gastric and placental cellular processes, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
