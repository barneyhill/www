# LRRC55

## Overview
LRRC55 is a gene that encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing 55 protein, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat-containing (LRRC) superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed in the brain and functions as an auxiliary subunit of large conductance voltage and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels, playing a critical role in modulating their activation and function. As a type I single-span membrane protein, LRRC55 is involved in protein-protein interactions through its leucine-rich repeat domains, which are essential for its regulatory role in ion channel activity and cellular excitability (Zhang2014Regulation; Wang2020An). Additionally, LRRC55 has been implicated in immune response modulation, particularly in the context of interleukin-6 (IL6) production, suggesting a broader role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and physiological functions (SánchezMaldonado2021Validation). The gene's involvement in neurological conditions, such as epilepsy, highlights its clinical significance, as mutations or alterations in LRRC55 can affect BK channel gating properties and contribute to neurological symptoms (GarcíaHernández2021Pathogenic; Zhang2014Regulation).

## Structure
The LRRC55 protein is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. These domains typically form a horseshoe-like structure, consisting of a curved parallel β-sheet and small helices or turns. The LRR domain contains 6 LRR units, each comprising 24 residues with a consensus sequence of LxxLxLxxN. These units are flanked by cysteine-rich regions, LRRNT and LRRCT, which cap the N-terminal and C-terminal sides, respectively, and help shield the hydrophobic core formed by inward-pointing leucine residues (Zhang2014Regulation).

LRRC55 is a type I single-span membrane protein with an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide for extracellular localization, a single transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal tail. The protein has N-glycosylation sites, and mutations or enzymatic removal of glycans can affect its mass. The transmembrane segment is predicted based on hydrophobicity and charged residues, following the 'positive-inside rule' (Zhang2014Regulation).

The protein is known to modulate BK channels by shifting the voltage dependence of channel activation, which is crucial for its function in various tissues, including the nervous system (Zhang2014Regulation). Specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of LRRC55 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The LRRC55 gene encodes a protein that is part of the leucine-rich repeat-containing (LRRC) superfamily, which is primarily expressed in the brain. This protein is involved in the regulation of ion channels, particularly large conductance voltage and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels, which are crucial for cellular excitability and signaling pathways (Wang2020An). LRRC55 acts as an auxiliary subunit of BK channels, influencing their activation and function, which is significant in the context of neurological conditions such as epilepsy (Wang2020An).

In addition to its role in ion channel regulation, LRRC55 is implicated in modulating immune responses. Although a direct interaction with interleukin-6 (IL6) has not been demonstrated, the LRRC55 rs717117 SNP has been shown to influence IL6 production in response to bacterial stimuli, suggesting a role in IL6-dependent immune processes (SánchezMaldonado2021Validation). This modulation of IL6 production may affect the response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in rheumatoid arthritis patients, indicating a broader role in immune regulation (SánchezMaldonado2021Validation). Overall, LRRC55 contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions through its involvement in ion channel regulation and immune response modulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LRRC55 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders. LRRC55 is associated with the modulation of large-conductance, voltage, and calcium-activated potassium channels (BK channels), which are crucial for neuronal polarization and depolarization. Alterations in LRRC55 can lead to changes in the gating properties of these channels, affecting their voltage dependence and potentially contributing to neurological symptoms such as seizures (GarcíaHernández2021Pathogenic).

In a study of a proband with a complex neurological syndrome, de novo copy number variations (CNVs) involving LRRC55 were identified. These CNVs included intronic deletions and the loss of the 3′ untranslated region of the mRNA, which may disrupt normal gene function and expression. Such genetic changes in LRRC55, along with other genes, were suggested to contribute to the proband's severe neuromotor developmental delay syndrome, characterized by symptoms like cerebral palsy, seizures, and dystonia (GarcíaHernández2021Pathogenic).

The role of LRRC55 in epilepsy and related neurological disorders is further supported by its involvement in the regulation of BK channels, which are essential for maintaining proper neuronal function (Zhang2014Regulation).

## Interactions
The LRRC55 protein is known to interact with the large conductance voltage and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channel, particularly in the context of epilepsy-associated mutations. The N930S mutation in the pore-forming alpha subunit of the BK channel (mSlo1) causes a significant shift in channel activation towards hyperpolarization, especially at low intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. When co-expressed with LRRC55, this mutation further increases the activation rate of the BK channel and causes a marked leftward shift in activation. This suggests that LRRC55 modulates the effects of the N930S mutation, potentially contributing to epilepsy pathophysiology by increasing BK channel activation levels (Wang2020An; Chen2020BK; Shimomura2020PI(3; Berglund2020Allosteric).

LRRC55 is also implicated in immune responses. The LRRC55 rs717117 SNP is associated with decreased production of IL6 in response to bacterial stimulation, suggesting a role in IL6-mediated immune responses. Although the interaction between LRRC55 and IL6 has not been directly demonstrated, the data imply that LRRC55 may be involved in IL6-dependent immune processes, potentially affecting the response to TNFi treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients (SánchezMaldonado2021Validation).
