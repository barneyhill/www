# ATG13

## Overview
ATG13 is a gene that encodes the autophagy-related protein 13, a pivotal component of the ULK1 complex, which is integral to the regulation of autophagy, a cellular process essential for the degradation and recycling of cellular components. The ATG13 protein functions as an adaptor within the ULK1 complex, facilitating interactions with other key proteins such as ULK1, RB1CC1, and ATG101, thereby playing a crucial role in the induction of autophagy, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation or cellular stress (WallotHieke2018Systematic). Structurally, ATG13 contains a conserved HORMA domain, which is essential for its interaction with other autophagy-related proteins, and intrinsically disordered regions that contribute to its flexibility and interaction capabilities (Qi2015Structure; Suzuki2015Atg13). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions, particularly in response to nutrient conditions (Suzuki2015Atg13). Dysregulation or mutations in the ATG13 gene can lead to significant clinical implications, including neurodegenerative diseases and developmental defects, underscoring its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kaizuka2016Atg13; Stamatakou2020Mendelian).

## Structure
The human ATG13 protein is a component of the ULK1 complex, playing a crucial role in autophagy. Structurally, ATG13 contains a HORMA domain, which is essential for its function in autophagy. This domain is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as Atg9, and is crucial for recruiting Atg9 vesicles during autophagosome formation (Suzuki2015Atg13). The HORMA domain of ATG13 is conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Suzuki2015Atg13).

The ATG13 protein forms a heterodimer with Atg101, which is stabilized by specific interactions, including a buried salt bridge between Atg13 Arg133 and Atg101 Asp54, and a hydrogen bond between Atg13 Ser127 and Atg101 His31 (Qi2015Structure). The complex features hydrophobic pockets that may serve as interaction hubs within the autophagy machinery (Qi2015Structure). The Atg13-Atg101 complex is structurally similar to the C-Mad2-O-Mad2 dimer, with a significant interface area involving the aC helices of both subunits (Qi2015Structure).

ATG13 also contains intrinsically disordered regions, which contribute to its flexibility and interaction capabilities (Qi2015Structure). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions, particularly in response to nutrient conditions (Suzuki2015Atg13).

## Function
The ATG13 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the ULK1 complex, which plays a central role in the regulation of autophagy, an essential cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. In healthy human cells, ATG13 functions as an adaptor protein, recruiting other key proteins such as ULK1, RB1CC1, and ATG101 to form the core ULK1 complex. This complex is vital for the induction of autophagy, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation or other stressors (WallotHieke2018Systematic).

ATG13 has several important domains and motifs that facilitate its function: a HORMA domain for interaction with ATG101, a phospholipid binding motif for interaction with various phospholipids, and a C-terminal region that interacts with ULK1 and RB1CC1. The interaction between ATG13 and ATG101 is particularly critical for autophagy induction, as disruption of this interaction impairs the process (WallotHieke2018Systematic).

ATG13 is also involved in the recruitment of the ULK1 complex to the site of autophagosome formation, enhancing ULK1 kinase activity. It can be phosphorylated by ULK1, leading to its relocalization to depolarized mitochondria, suggesting a role in mitophagy (Alers2014ATG13:). In ATG13-deficient cells, autophagy is completely impaired, highlighting its essential role in this process (Alers2014ATG13:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the ATG13 gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of autophagy-related diseases. ATG13 is a critical component of the ULK1 complex, which is essential for the initiation of autophagy. Disruptions in ATG13 function can impair autophagic processes, leading to various pathological conditions. For instance, impaired autophagy due to ATG13 mutations is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, where the accumulation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles contributes to neuronal dysfunction and cell death (Levine2019Biological; Stamatakou2020Mendelian).

In mice, ATG13 deficiency results in embryonic lethality due to cardiac development defects, highlighting its crucial role in heart development. This suggests that similar disruptions in humans could potentially lead to congenital heart defects or other developmental issues (Kaizuka2016Atg13). Additionally, ATG13 has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, with deficiencies leading to increased sensitivity to TNF-α-induced cell death, which may contribute to inflammatory conditions or increased susceptibility to cell death in stress-related diseases (Kaizuka2016Atg13).

Overall, the clinical significance of ATG13 is underscored by its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential role in various diseases when its function is compromised.

## Interactions
The human gene ATG13 is a crucial component of the ULK1 complex, which plays a significant role in autophagy induction. ATG13 interacts with several proteins, including ULK1/2, RB1CC1, and ATG101, forming a core complex essential for autophagy. The interaction between ATG13 and ATG101 is particularly significant, as it stabilizes ATG13 and is critical for autophagy regulation (Mercer2009A; WallotHieke2018Systematic). The amino acids I131, R133, V134, and Y138 in ATG13 are essential for its interaction with ATG101 (WallotHieke2018Systematic).

ATG13 also contains a highly conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, allowing it to interact with LC3 isoforms, which is crucial for autophagosome formation (Alers2014ATG13:). The interaction with RB1CC1 is mediated by residues 348-373, while the binding site for ULK1 is located in the C-terminus of ATG13 (Alers2014ATG13:; WallotHieke2018Systematic). ATG13's interaction with ULK1 is constitutive and not affected by its phosphorylation status or nutrient availability (Alers2014ATG13:).

ATG13 also binds to phospholipids and members of the Atg8 family, although these interactions have only mild effects on autophagy (WallotHieke2018Systematic). The ATG13-ATG101 interaction is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in autophagy (WallotHieke2018Systematic).
