# CDH1

## Overview
The CDH1 gene encodes the protein cadherin 1, commonly known as E-cadherin, which is a transmembrane glycoprotein integral to calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues. E-cadherin is categorized as a single-pass transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in maintaining tissue architecture and cellular polarity by forming adherens junctions. It interacts with the actin cytoskeleton through catenins, facilitating tight cell-cell contacts and contributing to processes such as embryonic development and tumor suppression (Wheelock2003Cadherins; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). Mutations in the CDH1 gene are clinically significant, being associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer, among other conditions (Guilford2010Hereditary; Figueiredo2019Clinical). The loss of E-cadherin function is a hallmark of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process implicated in cancer progression and metastasis (Niessen2011Tissue).

## Structure
The CDH1 gene encodes the E-cadherin protein, a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein. E-cadherin is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a primary structure consisting of a single polypeptide chain (Berx1995Cloning; Shenoy2019&lt; p&gt; CDH1). Its extracellular domain contains five tandem cadherin repeats, each approximately 110 amino acids long, which form seven anti-parallel β-strands arranged into an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold (Ishiyama2012The; Hulpiau2009Molecular). These repeats are crucial for calcium-dependent homophilic interactions, with calcium ions providing rigidity and preventing proteolytic degradation (Ishiyama2012The; Shenoy2019&lt; p&gt; CDH1).

The cytoplasmic region of E-cadherin includes the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and the catenin-binding domain (CBD), which interact with p120 catenin and β-catenin, respectively, linking E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton (Ishiyama2012The). Post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation and phosphorylation influence E-cadherin's oligomeric state and interactions with catenins (Ishiyama2012The).

E-cadherin forms homodimers through a 'strand-swap' mechanism, where the side chain of Trp2 from one monomer inserts into a hydrophobic pocket of an adjacent molecule, a feature essential for its adhesive function (Ishiyama2012The; Hulpiau2009Molecular). A novel splice variant of E-cadherin, associated with breast cancer, lacks part of Exon 14, affecting its expression and function (Rosso2019Characterization).

## Function
The CDH1 gene encodes E-cadherin, a transmembrane glycoprotein crucial for calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues. E-cadherin is primarily active at adherens junctions, where it facilitates tight cell-cell contacts and maintains tissue architecture (Wheelock2003Cadherins). It interacts with the actin cytoskeleton through catenins, such as β-catenin and α-catenin, which are essential for adhesion and junction assembly (Niessen2011Tissue; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical).

E-cadherin plays a significant role in maintaining cell polarity and tissue integrity, particularly during early embryonic development. It is involved in the compaction of the morula and is essential for processes like mesoderm formation and neural plate invagination (Wheelock2003Cadherins; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). The protein also participates in signaling pathways that regulate cell fate, proliferation, and polarity, acting as a tumor and metastasis suppressor by inhibiting invasive behavior in cells (Wheelock2003Cadherins; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical).

E-cadherin's expression is regulated by methylation of CpG islands in its promoter and by various transcription factors. Its loss is associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process important in both development and cancer progression (Niessen2011Tissue; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDH1 gene, which encodes the E-cadherin protein, are primarily associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) and lobular breast cancer (LBC). These mutations lead to a high lifetime risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer, with estimates ranging from 67% to 80% for men and 56% to 83% for women by age 80 (van2015Hereditary; Guilford2010Hereditary). CDH1 mutations also confer a significant risk for lobular breast cancer, with a lifetime risk of up to 60% (Lowstuter2017Unexpected).

In addition to these cancers, CDH1 mutations have been linked to other conditions such as blepharocheilodontic syndrome, a congenital disorder, and oral facial clefts (Figueiredo2019Clinical; Luo2018CDH1). The gene's pleiotropic nature means that the same mutation can result in different clinical outcomes, influenced by genetic background and other factors (Figueiredo2019Clinical).

Loss of E-cadherin function, due to CDH1 mutations, leads to increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis, as E-cadherin is crucial for cell-cell adhesion and maintaining tissue architecture (Shenoy2019&lt; p&gt; CDH1). This loss is a hallmark of lobular neoplasia and is observed in various epithelial cancers, including colorectal cancer (Figueiredo2019Clinical; Luo2018CDH1).

## Interactions
E-cadherin (CDH1) is a key protein involved in cell-cell adhesion, primarily through its interactions with various intracellular and extracellular proteins. It forms a complex with catenins, including α-catenin, β-catenin, and p120-catenin, which link E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton, stabilizing cell adhesion at adherens junctions (Guo2014Ecadherin; Mège2017Integration). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin interacts with these catenins, facilitating the connection between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton (Guo2014Ecadherin).

The E-cadherin interactome is extensive, involving both known and novel proteins. Proximity biotinylation and quantitative proteomics have identified 561 proteins in proximity to E-cadherin, including 79 known and 394 previously uncharacterized proteins (Guo2014Ecadherin). These interactions are largely independent of extracellular adhesion, as demonstrated by the minimal effect of calcium chelation on intracellular interactions (Guo2014Ecadherin).

E-cadherin also interacts with proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as kinases and GTPases, which regulate its interactions through posttranslational modifications (Guo2014Ecadherin). Additionally, E-cadherin is associated with proteins involved in trafficking, transcription, and translation, indicating its role beyond cell-cell junctions (Guo2014Ecadherin).
