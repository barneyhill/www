# PI4KB

## Overview
Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB) is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic enzyme belonging to the kinase family, specifically involved in the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol to produce phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking, primarily localized at the Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network. The protein encoded by PI4KB is essential for various cellular processes, including the regulation of membrane dynamics and lipid homeostasis. It interacts with several proteins, such as 14-3-3 and ACBD3, which modulate its stability and function. Mutations in the PI4KB gene have been linked to clinical conditions affecting the inner ear and peripheral nerves, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Su2020Phosphatidylinositol; Chalupska2017Structural; Dornan2016Type).

## Structure
Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB) is a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a crucial lipid for cellular signaling. The primary structure of PI4KB consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein chain. The secondary structure includes regions that can form alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's overall stability and function.

The tertiary structure of PI4KB involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which includes specific domains such as the lipid kinase domain. This domain is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity, allowing it to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol. PI4KB also contains long, disordered linkers that provide flexibility, enabling multiple conformations when interacting with other proteins like 14-3-3 (Chalupska2017Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, PI4KB can form complexes with other proteins. It interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, forming a complex with a 2:2 stoichiometry (Chalupska2017Structural). This interaction does not occlude the active site, allowing PI4KB to maintain its enzymatic activity (Chalupska2017Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at residue S294, are crucial for PI4KB's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, which protect it from proteolytic degradation (Chalupska2017Structural).

## Function
Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB) is a crucial enzyme in human cells, primarily involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a key lipid signaling molecule. PI4KB is predominantly localized at the Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it plays a significant role in membrane trafficking events. It facilitates the recruitment of Rab11, a GTPase essential for processes such as cargo selection, vesicle budding, and membrane tethering, to the Golgi and TGN (Dornan2016Type).

PI4KB's activity is regulated by its interaction with various proteins, including ACBD3, which recruits it to the Golgi, and 14-3-3 proteins, which protect it from proteolytic degradation. This protection is crucial for maintaining its stability and function within the cell (Chalupska2017Structural). The enzyme is also involved in the regulation of its activity through phosphorylation by protein kinase D (Dornan2016Type).

PI4KB's role extends to various cellular processes, including cytokinesis and the maintenance of lysosomal identity. It is also implicated in the synthesis of sphingomyelin by facilitating the ER-to-Golgi transport of ceramide, highlighting its importance in cellular lipid homeostasis and signaling pathways (Dornan2016Type).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PI4KB gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, particularly affecting the inner ear and peripheral nerves. In humans, PI4KB mutations are linked to nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL) and inner ear malformations. A specific heterozygous variant, c.362 A/G, p.Gln121Arg, was identified in affected individuals, suggesting its role in hearing impairment and inner ear malformation (Su2020Phosphatidylinositol). These mutations are inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion and have been shown to cause profound SNHL and inner ear malformations in both familial and sporadic cases (Su2020Phosphatidylinositol).

In the context of peripheral nerve function, PI4KB is crucial for the myelination process. Mutations in PI4KB lead to significant alterations in Schwann cell function, resulting in thinner myelin sheaths and reduced nerve conduction velocity. These changes are associated with peripheral neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, due to impaired lipid metabolism and protein glycosylation (Baba2020Myelination). The absence of PI4KB disrupts the structural integrity of myelinated and nonmyelinated nerve fibers, contributing to various myelination defects (Baba2020Myelination).

PI4KB mutations have also been implicated in SeSAME syndrome, a condition characterized by seizures, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, and mental retardation (Nadella2019Identification).

## Interactions
Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking. PI4KB interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which bind to it upon phosphorylation by protein kinase D. This interaction does not directly modulate PI4KB's enzymatic activity but protects it from proteolytic degradation, maintaining its stability (Chalupska2017Structural). The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to PI4KB is phosphorylation-dependent, specifically at Ser294, and forms a complex with a 2:2 stoichiometry (Chalupska2017Structural).

PI4KB also forms a complex with the protein c10orf76, which is essential for maintaining Golgi PI4P levels and enterovirus replication. This interaction involves a disorder-to-order transition in the PI4KB N-lobe linker and is modulated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation at Ser496 (McPhail2019Characterization). Despite c10orf76 inhibiting PI4KB's lipid kinase activity in vitro, its absence leads to decreased PI4P levels in cells, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism (McPhail2019Characterization).

Additionally, PI4KB interacts with ACBD3, which recruits it to the Golgi and viral replication sites, playing a critical role in viral replication (Sasaki2011ACBD3mediated). These interactions highlight PI4KB's involvement in various cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
