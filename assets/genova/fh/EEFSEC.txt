# EEFSEC

## Overview
The EEFSEC gene encodes the eukaryotic elongation factor, selenocysteine-tRNA specific (eEFSec), a specialized translation elongation factor crucial for the incorporation of the amino acid selenocysteine into selenoproteins. Selenocysteine is uniquely encoded by the UGA codon, which typically signals termination in protein synthesis, but is recoded in this context to incorporate selenocysteine. The eEFSec protein is characterized by a distinctive chalice-like structure composed of four domains, which facilitate its function in binding selenocysteinyl-tRNA and interacting with the SElenoCysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS) element in mRNA. This interaction is essential for the accurate decoding of the Sec UGA codon and the synthesis of selenoproteins, which are vital for various biological processes, including redox balance and thyroid hormone metabolism. Mutations in the EEFSEC gene have been linked to several health conditions, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal; Caban2005Size; Zhang2017Genetic).

## Structure
The human elongation factor eEFSec is involved in the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins and has a unique molecular structure. The protein is composed of four domains that form a chalice-like structure. The N-terminal domains (D1-D3) create the cup of the chalice, with D1 resembling EF-Tu and containing the GTPase site and a putative Sec-binding pocket. D1 is structured as a 6-stranded β-sheet surrounded by 7 α-helices, connected to D2 by an 8-residue loop. D2 is an 8-stranded β-barrel with a short α-helix, while D3 consists of 7 antiparallel β-strands and connects to the linker region via a long helix. The linker region, composed of two β-strands, connects to D4, which forms a small β-barrel flanked by α-helices (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal).

The C-terminal domain D4 undergoes significant conformational changes upon GTP-to-GDP exchange, which is crucial for the release of selenocysteinyl-tRNA during decoding on the ribosome (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal). The structure of eEFSec is described as a chimera of EF-Tu and IF2/eIF5B, with specific domain orientations and interactions being critical for its function (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal). The protein is an obligate monomer in solution, indicating that crystallographic dimers observed are not physiologically significant (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal).

## Function
The EEFSEC gene encodes the human elongation factor eEFSec, which is essential for the incorporation of selenocysteine (Sec) into selenoproteins during protein synthesis. Selenocysteine is a unique amino acid encoded by a recoded UGA codon, which typically signals a stop in protein synthesis. eEFSec functions as a specialized translation elongation factor that facilitates the incorporation of Sec by binding Sec-tRNA with high affinity and specificity. This process is crucial for the synthesis of selenoproteins, which play critical roles in maintaining redox balance, protecting genetic material and cell membranes from oxidative damage, regulating thyroid hormone metabolism, and controlling gene expression and protein folding (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal).

The mechanism by which eEFSec operates is distinct from other elongation factors like eEF1A and EF-Tu, involving a non-canonical mechanism for Sec-tRNA release, which is crucial for the read-through of the Sec UGA codon. This mechanism is conserved across different domains of life, although it exhibits structural and functional variations (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal). The accurate decoding of the Sec codon and the correct placement of Sec within selenoproteins are fundamental biological processes, and the knockout of the EEFSEC gene in model organisms leads to the inability to synthesize selenoproteins, resulting in severe systemic pathologies (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EEFSEC gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. Genetic variations at the EEFSEC locus have been linked to gestational duration and spontaneous preterm birth, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) also associated with prostate cancer risk, hypospadias, and age of menarche (Zhang2017Genetic). In the context of aggressive periodontitis, a missense variant in EEFSEC, specifically p.Pro223.Leu, has been identified, although it is not directly associated with the disease. This variant is predicted to have a moderate impact on protein function (Taiete2019Novel).

EEFSEC has also been implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a potential candidate gene at the 3q21 locus, suggesting its involvement in a novel COPD-related pathway (Hobbs2017Genetic). In cancer research, EEFSEC is considered a protective factor for uveal melanoma prognosis, indicating its potential significance in cancer prognosis (Lei2022Integrative). The gene's role in selenoprotein synthesis is crucial, and disruptions in this process can lead to systemic pathologies, including severe early-onset neurodegeneration (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal). These findings highlight the pleiotropic effects of EEFSEC genetic variations, influencing multiple traits and conditions.

## Interactions
The human elongation factor eEFSec is involved in the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins and interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids during this process. eEFSec specifically binds to Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec, facilitating its delivery to the ribosome in response to an in-frame UGA codon (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal). This interaction is crucial for the accurate decoding of the Sec codon and the synthesis of functional selenoproteins.

eEFSec also interacts with the SElenoCysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS) element in the mRNA, which helps differentiate the Sec UGA from a stop codon. This interaction is mediated by the SECIS Binding Protein 2 (SBP2), which tethers the eEFSec:GTP:Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec complex near the ribosome (DoboszBartoszek2016Crystal; Caban2005Size). The interaction between eEFSec and SBP2 is suggested to be RNA-dependent, with the presence of Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec enhancing this interaction (Caban2005Size).

The binding of eEFSec to the SECIS element can occur independently of other factors, although SBP2 may enhance this interaction. Mutations in the SECIS core can disrupt this binding, indicating the specificity of the interaction (Caban2005Size). These interactions are critical for the function of eEFSec in selenoprotein synthesis.
