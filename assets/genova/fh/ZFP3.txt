# ZFP3

## Overview
ZFP3 is a gene that encodes the ZFP3 zinc finger protein, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. The ZFP3 zinc finger protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by binding to specific DNA sequences. This protein plays a crucial role in gene expression and regulation, contributing to the modulation of various biological pathways. The precise mechanisms and pathways involving ZFP3 are still under investigation, but its involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests it may have significant implications in cellular differentiation and development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
