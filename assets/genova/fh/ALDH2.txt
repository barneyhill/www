# ALDH2

## Overview
The ALDH2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, which is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the detoxification of aldehydes, including acetaldehyde, a byproduct of ethanol metabolism, by converting them into less harmful compounds. ALDH2 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress, which is implicated in various diseases such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. The enzyme functions as a homotetramer and is characterized by its Rossmann fold, which facilitates NAD+ binding. Mutations in the ALDH2 gene, particularly the ALDH2*2 variant, are associated with reduced enzymatic activity and are linked to several health conditions, including alcohol flushing syndrome, certain cancers, and cardiovascular diseases (Singh2013Aldehyde; RodríguezZavala2019Role; Li2016ALDH2).

## Structure
The ALDH2 protein is a mitochondrial enzyme that functions as a homotetramer, composed of four identical subunits, each consisting of 500 amino acid residues (Larson2005Disruption). The primary structure of ALDH2 includes a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with each subunit containing two large α/β dinucleotide-binding domains and a smaller oligomerization domain (Steinmetz1997Structure). The tertiary structure of ALDH2 is a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds, with the enzyme forming a tetramer with 222 point group symmetry, described as a dimer of dimers (Steinmetz1997Structure).

The quaternary structure involves the assembly of these subunits into a functional tetramer, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Larson2005Disruption). The enzyme contains a Rossmann fold, a common nucleotide-binding domain, which is involved in binding the coenzyme NAD+ (Shortall2021Insights). The oligomerization domain is essential for both dimer and tetramer formation, with specific residues like Glu487 playing a critical role in maintaining the structure (Larson2005Disruption). The E487K mutation in the oligomerization domain disrupts these interactions, leading to structural perturbations and reduced enzymatic activity (Steinmetz1997Structure).

## Function
The ALDH2 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, which is primarily active in the mitochondria of human cells. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the detoxification of aldehydes, particularly acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of ethanol metabolism. ALDH2 catalyzes the conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid, thereby preventing the accumulation of acetaldehyde, which can lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage (Singh2013Aldehyde; RodríguezZavala2019Role).

Beyond its role in alcohol metabolism, ALDH2 is involved in the detoxification of other reactive aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA), which are products of lipid peroxidation. By converting these aldehydes into less harmful compounds, ALDH2 helps maintain cellular homeostasis and reduces oxidative stress, which is linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cardiovascular diseases (Singh2013Aldehyde; RodríguezZavala2019Role).

ALDH2 also exhibits nitrate reductase activity, contributing to vasorelaxation and the regulation of blood pressure. This multifunctional enzyme is essential for maintaining redox balance and protecting cells from environmental and metabolic stressors (Vasiliou2005Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALDH2 gene, particularly the ALDH2*2 variant, are associated with a range of diseases and conditions due to reduced enzymatic activity. This variant is prevalent in East Asian populations and leads to the accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism, resulting in alcohol flushing syndrome and increased risk for alcohol-related cancers such as esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers (Li2016ALDH2; Chen2014Targeting). The ALDH2*2 allele is also linked to cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and alcohol-induced cardiac dysfunction, due to its role in oxidative stress and acetaldehyde detoxification (Chen2019ALDH2; Tsai2020Aldehyde).

In addition to cancer and cardiovascular diseases, ALDH2 mutations are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, where increased oxidative stress and aldehyde accumulation contribute to disease progression (Chen2014Targeting). The ALDH2*2 variant is also associated with diabetes, particularly non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, due to increased insulin resistance and higher hemoglobin A1C levels (Chen2014Targeting). These mutations can also affect bone health, leading to conditions such as osteoporosis (Chen2014Targeting). Overall, ALDH2 mutations significantly impact health by altering normal metabolic processes and increasing susceptibility to various diseases.

## Interactions
ALDH2, a mitochondrial enzyme, participates in several interactions with other proteins, influencing its activity and function. ALDH2 can form heterotetramers with ALDH1B1, another mitochondrial enzyme, due to the high degree of conservation in their oligomer-forming residues. This interaction is energetically favorable and may affect the catalytic activity of ALDH1B1, similar to how the ALDH2*2 variant affects ALDH2 activity (Jackson2013Comparative). 

ALDH2 also interacts with proteins involved in oxidative stress pathways. It can increase SIRT1 levels, which inhibits the acetylation of the aging marker p53, thereby resisting cell senescence. ALDH2 affects the acetylation of p53 by regulating SIRT1 activity and can inactivate the EC p38 MAPK pathway, inhibiting the ROS-MAPK-p53/p16 pathway (Gao2022Aldehyde). 

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, ALDH2 reduces the accumulation of 4-HNE, which can modify proteins like tau and Aβ, leading to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease. It also catalyzes the oxidation of the dopamine metabolite DOPAL to DOPAC, reducing the aggregation of α-synuclein, a process implicated in Parkinson's disease (Gao2022Aldehyde).
