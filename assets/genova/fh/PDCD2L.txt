# PDCD2L

## Overview
PDCD2L is a gene that encodes the protein programmed cell death 2 like, which plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the maturation and export of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The protein is characterized as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and functions as an export substrate for CRM1, a major transport receptor. It contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal essential for its CRM1-dependent nuclear export, and it transits through the nucleolus before being exported to the cytoplasm (LandryVoyer2016Human). PDCD2L forms a stable complex with ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) and protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3), indicating its involvement in the late stages of 40S ribosomal subunit maturation (LandryVoyer2016Human). The gene is also implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and patient survival outcomes (Gao2022Pancancer). Additionally, PDCD2L is involved in metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, through its role in apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells (Yin2016Pdcd2l).

## Function
PDCD2L is a human gene involved in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the maturation and export of the 40S ribosomal subunit. It functions as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and is an export substrate of CRM1, a major transport receptor for exporting proteins and ribonucleoproteins from the nucleus. PDCD2L contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal necessary for its CRM1-dependent nuclear export, and it transits through the nucleolus before being exported to the cytoplasm (LandryVoyer2016Human).

PDCD2L forms a stable complex with RPS2 and PRMT3, and it associates with pre-40S ribosomal particles, indicating its role in the late stages of 40S ribosomal subunit maturation. Despite its involvement in these processes, PDCD2L is not essential for the accumulation of 21S and 18S-E rRNA precursors. However, PDCD2L-null cells show an accumulation of free 60S ribosomal subunits, suggesting its role in maintaining the balance between free 40S and 60S subunits (LandryVoyer2016Human).

PDCD2L and its paralog PDCD2 function redundantly in ribosome biogenesis, with PDCD2 also contributing to 40S ribosomal subunit production. The combined deficiency of both genes results in a synergistic increase in the 60S:40S free subunit ratio and reduced levels of 80S monosomes and polysomes (LandryVoyer2016Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PDCD2L gene have been implicated in various cancers. PDCD2L is highly expressed in several cancer types, including colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer, kidney cancer, and ovarian cancer, suggesting its potential role as an oncogene. In colorectal cancer, PDCD2L expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its downregulation in CRC cells has been shown to increase apoptosis and enhance proliferation, indicating a role in apoptosis-induced proliferation (AiP) (Gao2022Pancancer). High PDCD2L expression is associated with poor overall survival in cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma and kidney chromophobe, but favorable survival in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (Gao2022Pancancer).

PDCD2L is also involved in the tumor microenvironment, with its expression negatively correlated with cancer-associated fibroblasts in several cancers, suggesting a role in tumor-stroma interactions (Gao2022Pancancer). In pancreatic β-cells, PDCD2L is implicated in palmitate-induced apoptosis, a process relevant to type 2 diabetes, where its expression is regulated by the transcription factor FoxO1 (Yin2016Pdcd2l). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PDCD2L in cancer progression and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
PDCD2L is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of ribosome biogenesis. It forms a stable complex with the 40S ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) and protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3), suggesting a conserved extra-ribosomal complex across species, including humans, yeast, and Drosophila (LandryVoyer2016Human). PDCD2L interacts directly with CRM1, a nuclear export receptor, through a leucine-rich nuclear export signal, facilitating its role as an export substrate for CRM1-mediated export of pre-40S ribosomal particles (LandryVoyer2016Human).

PDCD2L also associates with several pre-ribosomal factors, such as hRRP12, Bystin/ENP1, C21orf70, PNO1, hLTV1, and NOC4L, which are components of the pre-40S particle (LandryVoyer2016Human). It is enriched in the 18S-E rRNA precursor, indicating its association with immature pre-40S particles and/or mature 40S ribosomal subunits (LandryVoyer2016Human). PDCD2L's interaction with the ribosomal protein uS5 is mutually exclusive with its paralog PDCD2, suggesting distinct roles in ribosome assembly (LandryVoyer2023Ribosomal). These interactions highlight PDCD2L's role in ribosome biogenesis and its potential involvement in cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell cycle regulation.
