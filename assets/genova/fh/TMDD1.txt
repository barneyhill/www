# TMDD1

## Overview
The TMDD1 gene encodes the transmembrane and death domain 1 protein, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a death domain, a conserved protein interaction module that is typically involved in the regulation of apoptosis and other cellular processes. The transmembrane and death domain 1 protein is implicated in various signaling pathways, where it may play a role in mediating cellular responses to external stimuli. Its function and interactions suggest potential involvement in the regulation of cell death and survival, making it a subject of interest in studies related to cancer and other diseases where apoptosis is dysregulated (Qiu2020aarFDC).
