# FGF8

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is a gene that encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which is integral to various developmental and cellular processes. The protein product, FGF8, is a signaling molecule that plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly in processes such as gastrulation, neural induction, and mesenchymal-epithelial signaling. FGF8 functions by binding to specific fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), including FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, initiating signaling cascades that regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Zhang2006Receptor; Teven2014Fibroblast). The protein's activity is modulated by alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms with distinct biological functions (Goetz2013Exploring). Clinically, mutations in the FGF8 gene are associated with developmental disorders such as idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Kallmann syndrome, and holoprosencephaly, highlighting its critical role in human development (Falardeau2008Decreased; Hong2018Lossoffunction).

## Structure
The FGF8 protein is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family and plays a crucial role in embryonic development. It has several splice variant isoforms, including FGF8a and FGF8b, which differ by an additional 11 amino acids at the N terminus of FGF8b. This difference significantly affects their receptor-binding affinity and biological activity (Olsen2005Structural). The core region of FGF8b adopts a β-trefoil fold consisting of 12 anti-parallel β-strands, with a unique one-residue insertion in the β4-β5 loop (Olsen2005Structural). 

FGF8b interacts with the FGFR2c receptor, engaging the D2, D3, and the interconnecting D2-D3 linker. The N-terminal region of FGF8b forms a g helix linked to the β-trefoil core, stabilized by hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds, suggesting a rigid conformation (Olsen2005Structural). Key residues such as F32, V36, and F93 are crucial for engaging the FGFR receptor, specifically the D3 groove of FGFR2c (Olsen2005Structural). 

The FGF8b-FGFR2c complex reveals a unique set of hydrogen bonds and a novel salt bridge, inducing a distinct rotation in the receptor linker/D3 region, which affects receptor dimerization and signaling (Olsen2005Structural). This structural mode is conserved across vertebrates, indicating its evolutionary significance (Olsen2005Structural).

## Function
Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is a critical protein involved in various developmental and cellular processes. It functions by binding to fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), initiating a cascade of phosphorylation events that activate several downstream signaling pathways, including the RAS/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, and the phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ) pathway. These pathways are essential for cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration (Teven2014Fibroblast).

FGF8 plays a significant role in embryonic development, particularly during gastrulation, where it is crucial for cell migration and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Teven2014Fibroblast). It is also involved in neural induction by inhibiting bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and facilitating the expression of neural genes, contributing to early neural tissue patterning (Teven2014Fibroblast).

In the female reproductive tract, FGF8 is involved in mesenchymal-epithelial signaling, influencing processes such as glycolysis in cumulus cells and steroidogenesis in ovarian cells. It also plays a role in uterine epithelial proliferation, which is crucial for preparing the endometrium for implantation (Estienne2018The). FGF8's activity is modulated by alternative splicing, producing isoforms with distinct biological functions, which are crucial for its role in development and cellular signaling (Goetz2013Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FGF8 gene are associated with several developmental disorders and diseases. FGF8 mutations are implicated in idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS), conditions characterized by a deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) leading to reproductive issues. These mutations can affect the development of GnRH neurons, resulting in symptoms such as delayed puberty and reproductive failure (Falardeau2008Decreased). 

FGF8 is also linked to holoprosencephaly (HPE), a disorder involving the incomplete division of the forebrain. Mutations in FGF8 can act as independent risk factors for HPE, affecting the development of midline structures and leading to a spectrum of craniofacial abnormalities (Arauz2010A; Hong2018Lossoffunction; Dubourg2016Mutational).

In the context of craniofacial development, FGF8 mutations or overexpression can result in conditions such as cleft lip and palate, mandibular hypoplasia, and other oral-maxillofacial abnormalities. These alterations can disrupt normal signaling pathways, leading to significant developmental defects (Hao2019Roles).

## Interactions
FGF8 (fibroblast growth factor 8) is known for its interactions with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. These interactions are crucial for its role in developmental processes such as limb and brain development (Zhang2006Receptor; Goetz2013Exploring). FGF8 requires heparan sulfate as a cofactor to effectively bind FGFRs, forming a stable FGF-FGFR complex that involves a 2:2 ratio of ligands to receptors (Goetz2013Exploring).

The interaction between FGF8 and FGFRL1, a receptor-like protein, has been studied extensively. FGF8 primarily binds to the Ig2 domain of FGFRL1, with high affinity in the nanomolar range, indicating a strong interaction (Zhuang2020Dissecting). This interaction is significant in kidney development, where FGFRL1 acts as a physiological receptor for FGF8, promoting nephrogenesis and inhibiting cell death in the nephrogenic zone (Zhuang2020Dissecting).

FGF8's binding specificity is influenced by its structural features, such as the unique spatial positioning of its N terminus relative to the β-trefoil core, which differs from other FGFs (Olsen2005Structural; Zhang2006Receptor). These interactions and structural characteristics underscore FGF8's role in various developmental processes.
