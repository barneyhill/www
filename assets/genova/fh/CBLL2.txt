# CBLL2

## Overview
CBLL2, or Cbl proto-oncogene like 2, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a key player in the ubiquitination pathway. This protein is involved in tagging other proteins for degradation, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein levels. The CBLL2 protein is implicated in various signal transduction pathways that are crucial for cell growth and differentiation, particularly through its role in receptor endocytosis and degradation. This regulation ensures that signaling receptors are appropriately terminated and maintained at optimal levels within the cell. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it influences cellular signaling and protein turnover, potentially affecting transcriptional regulation and gene expression patterns. Through these activities, CBLL2 plays a significant role in the regulation of cellular processes, contributing to the maintenance of cell growth, differentiation, and homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
CBLL2, also known as Cbl proto-oncogene like 2, encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a crucial component in the ubiquitination process. This process tags proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein levels within the cell and maintaining cellular homeostasis. CBLL2 is involved in signal transduction pathways that are essential for cell growth and differentiation. By influencing these pathways, CBLL2 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as receptor endocytosis and degradation. This activity is vital for the proper regulation of signaling receptors, ensuring that signals are appropriately terminated and that receptor levels are controlled within the cell.

The protein encoded by CBLL2 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it exerts its effects on cellular signaling and protein turnover. In the cytoplasm, CBLL2's role in receptor endocytosis and degradation helps modulate the availability of receptors on the cell surface, impacting how cells respond to external signals. In the nucleus, CBLL2 may influence transcriptional regulation by targeting nuclear proteins for degradation, thus affecting gene expression patterns. Through these mechanisms, CBLL2 contributes to the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and overall cellular homeostasis.
