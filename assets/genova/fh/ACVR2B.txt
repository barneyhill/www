# ACVR2B

## Overview
The ACVR2B gene encodes the activin A receptor type 2B, a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor that is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. This receptor is integral to various biological processes, primarily through its role in binding ligands such as activins and myostatin, which are pivotal in regulating muscle growth, differentiation, and development (Magga2019Systemic; Walsh2007Activintype). The activin A receptor type 2B is involved in both canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways, influencing cellular activities such as hypertrophy, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as muscle protein degradation and cardiomyocyte growth (Magga2019Systemic). Beyond its role in muscle tissue, ACVR2B also modulates other cellular processes, including inhibiting BMP-signaling in myeloma cells (Olsen2015Activin). The receptor's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in conditions like muscle wasting and cardiac dysfunction, where its signaling pathways are potential therapeutic targets (Huot2020ACVR2B).

## Function
The ACVR2B gene encodes the activin A receptor type 2B, a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor that is part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in binding ligands such as activins and myostatin, which play crucial roles in regulating muscle growth, differentiation, and development (Magga2019Systemic; Walsh2007Activintype). In healthy human cells, ACVR2B is involved in activating type I receptors, such as activin receptor-like kinases (ALK4 and ALK5), which subsequently activate downstream SMAD2/3 signaling pathways. These pathways are essential for regulating myogenic genes that influence cellular hypertrophy, proliferation, and differentiation (Magga2019Systemic).

ACVR2B also regulates noncanonical pathways, including MAP kinases, which are involved in cardiomyocyte growth and muscle protein degradation (Magga2019Systemic). In the context of cardiac physiology, ACVR2B ligands like myostatin can exacerbate hypoxic stress, but their blockade has been shown to protect the myocardium by reducing infarct size and preserving left ventricular systolic function (Magga2019Systemic). The receptor's activity is not limited to muscle tissue; it also plays a role in other cellular processes, such as inhibiting BMP-signaling in myeloma cells by competing for receptor binding (Olsen2015Activin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the ACVR2B gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly those involving muscle wasting and cardiac dysfunction. ACVR2B is a primary receptor for myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth, and its signaling is crucial in conditions like cancer cachexia and ischemic heart failure. In metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) cachexia, ACVR2B signaling contributes to muscle wasting, and its antagonism through ACVR2B/Fc treatment has shown potential in preserving muscle mass and function, as well as cardiac function, in preclinical models (Huot2020ACVR2B). 

In ischemic heart failure, systemic blockade of ACVR2B ligands with ACVR2B-Fc has been found to attenuate muscle wasting without compromising cardiac function, although it does not significantly improve cardiac remodeling post-myocardial infarction (Szabó2020Systemic). ACVR2B-Fc treatment also reduces markers of protein catabolism and enhances anabolic signaling pathways, suggesting its potential therapeutic benefits in managing muscle wasting conditions (Huot2020ACVR2B). 

The role of ACVR2B in muscle-related phenotypes is further supported by genetic studies, which have identified associations between ACVR2B haplotypes and variations in muscle strength, particularly in women (Walsh2007Activintype).

## Interactions
ACVR2B, also known as activin A receptor type 2B, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in signaling pathways. ACVR2B forms stable homomeric complexes, which are enhanced by the presence of Activin A (ActA). It also forms heterocomplexes with ALK2 variants, including both the wild-type (ALK2-WT) and the R206H mutant (ALK2-R206H), with ActA further enhancing these interactions. This ability to form dimers without a ligand allows ACVR2B to induce ActA-independent clustering of ALK2-R206H, which is essential for the activation of SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathways (Szilágyi2024The).

ACVR2B also interacts with ligands such as GDF11, forming a ternary receptor complex with ActRIIB (another name for ACVR2B) and Alk5. In this complex, ActRIIB binds at the knuckle regions of GDF11, forming a concave surface with a hydrophobic core, which is crucial for the specificity and stability of the interaction (Goebel2019Structural). Additionally, ACVR2B competes with BMP-6 and BMP-9 for binding, inhibiting their signaling pathways in myeloma cells, which highlights its role in modulating BMP signaling (Olsen2015Activin).
