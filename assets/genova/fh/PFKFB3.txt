# PFKFB3

## Overview
PFKFB3 is a gene that encodes the protein 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3, a bifunctional enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of glycolysis. This enzyme is categorized as a kinase due to its ability to catalyze the synthesis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), a potent activator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), thereby enhancing glycolytic flux (Calvo2006PFKFB3). PFKFB3 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in proliferating cells, where it supports increased metabolic demands associated with cell growth and division (SimonMolas2018PI3K–Akt). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which significantly enhance its kinase activity relative to its phosphatase activity (Cavalier2012Molecular). PFKFB3 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer metabolism, where it contributes to the Warburg effect, and in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, making it a potential therapeutic target (Bartrons2018Fructose; Liu2024Advances).

## Structure
The PFKFB3 protein is a bifunctional enzyme involved in glycolysis regulation, characterized by its unique molecular structure. It consists of a single polypeptide chain with two catalytic domains: a kinase domain and a bisphosphatase domain (Cavalier2012Molecular). The N-terminal region forms a β-hairpin structure that interacts with the bisphosphatase domain, while the C-terminal residues are largely disordered (Cavalier2024Insights; Cavalier2012Molecular). 

PFKFB3 functions as a dimer, with each subunit contributing to the enzyme's active site (Cavalier2024Insights). The enzyme's structure is stabilized by interactions between specific residues, such as His253, Arg252, His387, and Asn259, which are crucial for its catalytic activity (Cavalier2024Insights; Cavalier2012Molecular). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, significantly enhance the kinase-to-phosphatase activity ratio of PFKFB3, which is notably higher than other isoforms (Cavalier2012Molecular). This isoform is linked to increased glycolytic flux in cancer cells, contributing to the Warburg effect (Cavalier2024Insights). The enzyme's structure and function are further influenced by its splice variant isoforms, which exhibit differences in their regulatory domains (Cavalier2024Insights).

## Function
PFKFB3 is a key enzyme involved in the regulation of glycolysis, primarily through the synthesis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), a potent activator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). This activation enhances glycolytic flux, which is crucial for energy production and cellular metabolism (Houddane2017Role; Calvo2006PFKFB3). PFKFB3 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in proliferating cells, where it supports the increased metabolic demands associated with cell growth and division (SimonMolas2018PI3K–Akt).

In healthy human cells, PFKFB3 plays a significant role in T-lymphocyte activation, where its expression is upregulated in response to mitogens, leading to enhanced glycolysis and lactate production. This metabolic adaptation is essential for meeting the energetic and anabolic demands during early T-cell activation (SimonMolas2018PI3K–Akt). The enzyme is also involved in cell proliferation and protein synthesis, as its expression and activity are linked to increased Fru-2,6-P2 levels, which facilitate these processes (Houddane2017Role).

PFKFB3 is regulated by various signaling pathways, including the PI3K-Akt pathway, which influences its expression during immune responses (SimonMolas2018PI3K–Akt). The enzyme's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its role in glycolysis and energy production (Houddane2017Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the PFKFB3 gene are implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In cancer, PFKFB3 is overexpressed in several types, including gastric, colon, breast, and glioblastoma, contributing to enhanced glycolytic flux and tumor growth (Bartrons2018Fructose; Ros2013Balancing). Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer, where it also contributes to drug resistance (Bartrons2018Fructose; Da2023Glycolytic). PFKFB3 is involved in the Warburg effect, a hallmark of cancer metabolism, and its inhibition has been shown to reduce tumor growth and improve sensitivity to chemotherapy (Shi2017Roles; Liu2024Advances).

PFKFB3 also plays a role in inflammatory diseases and fibrosis. Its expression is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, contributing to chronic inflammation and diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (Liu2024Advances). In fibrotic diseases, PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis is linked to renal, pulmonary, and myocardial fibrosis, and its inhibition can reduce fibrosis and improve outcomes (Liu2024Advances). These findings highlight PFKFB3 as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and non-cancerous diseases.

## Interactions
PFKFB3 interacts with several proteins that influence its function and cellular localization. It binds specifically to importin 5α, which is crucial for its nuclear transportation. Acetylation at lysine 472 (K472) disrupts this interaction, leading to PFKFB3 accumulation in the cytoplasm (Li2018Acetylation). PFKFB3 also interacts with PIM2, a kinase that phosphorylates it at Ser478, enhancing its stability and activity by reducing ubiquitination (Lu2021Positive).

Under hypoxic conditions, PFKFB3 interacts with G3BP2, a process enhanced by OGT knockdown and mediated by the ERK pathway. This interaction prevents PFKFB3's nuclear translocation and is regulated by phosphorylation at the O-GlcNAcylation site Ser172 (Lei2020OGlcNAcylation). PFKFB3 is also involved in the Ras signaling pathway, which increases glycolytic flux, and is regulated by hypoxic conditions through HIF-1α (Kotowski2021Role).

PFKFB3's interaction with the AMPK signaling pathway influences its role in autophagy. Cytoplasmic PFKFB3 promotes ATP generation and inhibits autophagy, while nuclear PFKFB3 is associated with autophagy promotion (Kotowski2021Role). These interactions highlight PFKFB3's role in cellular metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
