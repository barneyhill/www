# NEK6

## Overview
NEK6 is a gene that encodes the protein NIMA related kinase 6, a serine/threonine kinase involved in critical cellular processes, particularly cell cycle regulation. The NEK6 protein plays a pivotal role during mitosis, facilitating the metaphase-anaphase transition and ensuring proper chromosome segregation and cell division. It is activated through phosphorylation, with its activity peaking during the M phase of the cell cycle. NEK6 localizes to spindle microtubules and the midbody, underscoring its importance in spindle stability and cytokinesis. Beyond its role in mitosis, NEK6 is implicated in telomere maintenance and interacts with various proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and signaling pathways. Alterations in NEK6 expression have been linked to several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (O’Regan2009The; Yin2003The; He2018Overexpression; Hirai2016NEK6‐mediated).

## Structure
Human NEK6 is a monomeric kinase with a mostly globular structure and a slightly elongated shape. It consists of a catalytic domain with a short, flexible N-terminal extension that is not conserved and may play a role in differential regulation (Meirelles2011Human). The primary structure of NEK6 includes 338 amino acids (Hashimoto2002Identification).

The secondary structure of NEK6 is characterized by a high content of α-helices, approximately 41.7%, along with 13.2% β-strands, 15.7% beta-turns, and 25.8% random coils (Meirelles2011Human). The tertiary structure is mostly globular, with some elongation in solution, and includes a flexible disordered N-terminal domain (Meirelles2011Human). NEK6 does not form quaternary structures as it is monomeric in nature (Meirelles2011Human).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a crucial role in NEK6's function. Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as Ser 206, is critical for its activation and affects its conformation and stability (Meirelles2011Human; Vaz2010Characterization). NEK6 is involved in cell cycle regulation and is activated during mitosis, with its expression levels increasing during this process (Moraes2015Kinase).

## Function
NEK6 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. It is essential for the metaphase-anaphase transition, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and cell division. NEK6 is phosphorylated and activated during the M phase, with its kinase activity peaking during mitosis. This activity is crucial for mitotic progression, as inhibition of NEK6 leads to mitotic arrest and apoptosis (Yin2003The).

NEK6 is involved in the formation of the mitotic spindle, a structure necessary for chromosome segregation. It localizes to spindle microtubules during metaphase and anaphase and to the midbody during cytokinesis, indicating its role in spindle stability and cytokinesis (O’Regan2009The). NEK6 also interacts with and phosphorylates microtubule-associated proteins, such as Eg5, which is crucial for centrosome separation (Fry2012Cell).

In addition to its role in mitosis, NEK6 is implicated in the regulation of telomere length through its interaction with TPP1, a component of the shelterin complex. NEK6 phosphorylates TPP1, enhancing telomerase activity and contributing to telomere maintenance (Hirai2016NEK6‐mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NEK6 gene have been implicated in various cancers, often correlating with poor prognosis. In breast cancer, NEK6 overexpression is associated with malignant growth and reduced survival rates. It is considered an independent prognostic factor, with high expression levels linked to lower survival rates and increased tumor aggressiveness (He2018Overexpression). In hepatocellular carcinoma, NEK6 overexpression correlates with histological grade and alpha-fetoprotein levels, serving as an independent prognostic marker for poor outcomes (Cao2011Clinical).

In prostate cancer, particularly castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), NEK6 plays a role in regulating redox balance and DNA damage response. Its overexpression is linked to increased antioxidant protein expression, contributing to cell survival and chemotherapy resistance (Pavan2023NEK6). NEK6 is also implicated in glioma, where high expression correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with immune cell infiltration and tumor grade (Wang2024Identification).

NEK6's involvement in cell cycle regulation and its overexpression in various cancers highlight its potential as a therapeutic target. Inhibitors of NEK6 are suggested as a treatment option, as they can induce cell death in tumor cells without affecting normal tissues (KASAP2012Aurora).

## Interactions
NEK6, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and other cellular processes. NEK6 interacts with RBBP6, particularly its isoform 3, which includes the DWNN domain. This interaction is significant for cell cycle regulation, as NEK6 phosphorylates RBBP6, promoting cell proliferation. Mutations in RBBP6 isoform 3 can reduce its affinity for NEK6, affecting phosphorylation sites and potentially impacting cancer progression (Mbita2021RBBP6).

NEK6 also interacts with Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase overexpressed in various cancers. This interaction has been confirmed through GST pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation experiments. The interaction between Pin1 and NEK6 is implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis, as both proteins are involved in cell cycle regulation, and their depletion leads to mitotic arrest and apoptosis (Chen2006Interaction).

In addition, NEK6 is involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway, potentially regulating it by phosphorylating or activating RelB. It also interacts with proteins involved in DNA repair, such as RAD26L, and is implicated in Notch signaling through interactions with CIR and SNW1 (Vaz2010Characterization).
