# TREX1

## Overview
The TREX1 gene encodes the protein three prime repair exonuclease 1, a crucial enzyme in the DEDDh family of exonucleases, which plays a significant role in DNA repair and immune regulation. This protein is primarily responsible for degrading single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and small DNA oligonucleotide products, thereby preventing the accumulation of DNA fragments that could trigger inappropriate immune responses. TREX1's activity is essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing autoimmune diseases by ensuring a DNA-free cytosol, which inhibits the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Structurally, TREX1 forms a homodimer with a unique C-terminal domain and a proline-rich region, distinguishing it from other exonucleases. Mutations in the TREX1 gene are linked to several autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, familial chilblain lupus, and retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Stetson2008Trex1; Kim2022TREX1; Simpson2020TREX1).

## Structure
The TREX1 protein is a crucial DNA exonuclease involved in DNA repair and immune regulation. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, including specific residues like F17 and M19, which are conserved in primates and influence the protein's stability and function (Zhou2022Structural). The secondary structure of TREX1 includes an extended anti-parallel β-sheet, which is a prominent feature in its dimeric form (de2007The). 

The tertiary structure of TREX1 is characterized by a homodimeric conformation, with enzymatic active sites located on opposite faces of the dimer (Zhou2022Structural). This structure is crucial for its function in DNA degradation, as it allows TREX1 to interact with DNA substrates effectively. The protein also contains a unique C-terminal domain and a proline-rich region, which are distinct from other exonucleases like TREX2 (de2007The).

TREX1 is part of the DEDDh family of exonucleases, which includes conserved sequence motifs essential for its catalytic activity (de2007The). The protein's exonuclease domain is involved in the precise excision of 3' overhangs and unwinding of DNA duplexes, facilitated by specific structural features such as the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster (Huang2018Structural). These structural insights are critical for understanding TREX1's role in immune silencing and DNA repair.

## Function
The TREX1 gene encodes a 3' to 5' DNA exonuclease that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and immune regulation in healthy human cells. TREX1 is primarily involved in degrading single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and small DNA oligonucleotide products resulting from nucleotide excision repair (NER) processes. This degradation prevents the accumulation of ssDNA, which could otherwise lead to chronic checkpoint activation and autoimmune diseases (Yang2007Trex1; Kim2022TREX1).

TREX1 is localized mainly in the perinuclear region and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but it can translocate to the nucleus in response to DNA damage, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle (Yang2007Trex1). In the cytosol, TREX1 degrades DNA to prevent the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which can trigger immune responses if cytosolic DNA is detected (Simpson2020TREX1).

Mutations in TREX1 can lead to the accumulation of undegraded DNA, resulting in inappropriate immune activation and conditions such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and lupus (Simpson2020TREX1). By maintaining a DNA-free cytosol, TREX1 helps prevent autoimmunity and ensures proper immune homeostasis (Stetson2008Trex1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TREX1 gene are associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a severe neurological disorder linked to TREX1 mutations, characterized by progressive encephalopathy, skin lesions, and elevated interferon levels. These mutations lead to the accumulation of DNA fragments, triggering an immune response through the cGAS-STING pathway, resulting in high levels of type I interferon (Wu2021Case; Amico2022GenotypePhenotype).

Familial chilblain lupus (FCL) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are also associated with TREX1 mutations. FCL is often linked to heterozygous mutations, while SLE can involve non-syndromic lupus cases with TREX1 mutations (Paradis2019TREX1Related; Crow2015Characterization).

Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) is another condition caused by frameshift mutations in TREX1, leading to systemic microangiopathy and affecting microvessels in various organs. These mutations result in aberrant localization of TREX1, contributing to the disease pathology (Saito2018Retinal).

TREX1 mutations can also lead to early-onset cerebrovascular diseases, such as small vessel disease with CADASIL-like neuroimaging patterns, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Amico2022GenotypePhenotype).

## Interactions
TREX1, a 3'-5' DNA exonuclease, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in DNA repair and immune regulation. TREX1 forms stable dimers, which are essential for its enzymatic activity, with a significant dimer interface involving hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and hydrophobic interactions (de2007The). It interacts with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through a nucleotide binding pocket, which is crucial for its substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency (de2007The).

TREX1 is part of the SET complex, interacting with proteins such as NM23-H1, pp32, HMG-2, and APE1, to degrade DNA during granzyme A-mediated cell death (de2007The). Unlike other proteins in the complex, TREX1's activity is not inhibited by its interaction with the SET protein (de2007The).

In the context of immune regulation, TREX1 interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) during the DNA damage response (Wei2022Human). It also localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, which is crucial for its function in regulating the cGAS-dependent immune response (Zhou2021cGAS). TREX1's interactions with cGAS-DNA phase-separated droplets inhibit its exonuclease activity, thereby enhancing cytosolic DNA sensing (Zhou2021cGAS). These interactions are vital for preventing inappropriate immune activation and maintaining genomic stability.
