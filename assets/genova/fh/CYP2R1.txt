# CYP2R1

## Overview
CYP2R1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily R member 1, a crucial component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme functions as a vitamin D 25-hydroxylase, playing a pivotal role in the metabolism of vitamin D by converting it into 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the primary circulating form necessary for the production of the active hormone 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This active form is essential for maintaining calcium and phosphate homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes. The CYP2R1 protein is predominantly expressed in the liver and testis but is also found in other tissues, ensuring adequate vitamin D metabolism even in individuals with liver disorders. Mutations in the CYP2R1 gene can lead to clinical conditions such as vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1B, highlighting its significance in human health (Cheng2004Genetic; Strushkevich2008Structural; Dong2021The).

## Structure
The CYP2R1 protein, encoded by the CYP2R1 gene, is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily and plays a crucial role in vitamin D metabolism. The protein is composed of 501 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 57,359 Da (Fronczek2021New). Its structure is characterized by a typical P450 fold, consisting of α-helices (A-L) and β-sheets, with the heme group deeply embedded within the protein (Fronczek2021New; Strushkevich2008Structural).

The secondary structure includes prominent α-helices, such as the E, I, J, K, and L helices, which form the core of the enzyme, while the F and G helices contribute to the active center (Fronczek2021New). The B′-helix is involved in substrate recognition and is stabilized by polar interactions (Strushkevich2008Structural). The active site is lined with conserved hydrophobic residues, facilitating the binding of vitamin D3 in an elongated conformation (Strushkevich2008Structural).

CYP2R1 functions as a dimer, with the dimer interface involving helices F and G, which are also part of the active site formation (Strushkevich2008Structural). The protein's structure is stabilized by electrostatic interactions, particularly between specific residues such as Arg259 and Asp255 at the C-terminal end of the G-helix (Fronczek2021New). The protein's membrane association is maintained through hydrophobic interactions involving the F-G loop and other helices (Cheng2018Properties). 

The CYP2R1 protein does not have detailed information available on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The CYP2R1 gene encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme that functions as a vitamin D 25-hydroxylase, playing a crucial role in the metabolism of vitamin D in humans. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of vitamin D into 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the major circulating form of the vitamin, which is essential for the subsequent production of the active hormonal form, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This active form regulates plasma calcium and phosphate homeostasis and controls various cellular responses, including cell differentiation and proliferation (Cheng2004Genetic; Strushkevich2008Structural).

CYP2R1 is primarily expressed in the liver and testis, but its expression is more ubiquitous in humans, allowing for the maintenance of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels even in patients with liver disorders (Strushkevich2008Structural; Cheng2003Deorphanization). The enzyme is located in the microsomal membrane and is involved in the hydroxylation of both vitamin D2 and D3 with similar kinetics, distinguishing it from other enzymes like CYP27A1, which only hydroxylates vitamin D3 (Cheng2003Deorphanization; Dong2021The). Genetic defects in CYP2R1 can lead to a hereditary form of rickets, underscoring its importance in vitamin D metabolism (Dong2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYP2R1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in vitamin D metabolism. Mutations can lead to vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1B, characterized by bone deformities and growth retardation. This condition arises from impaired 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D, a crucial step in its activation (Thacher2015CYP2R1Mutations; Bakhamis202125Hydroxylase). Specific mutations, such as c.367+1G>A and c.768dupT, have been identified in patients with 25-hydroxylase deficiency, leading to low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and poor response to standard vitamin D treatments (Bakhamis202125Hydroxylase).

Polymorphisms in CYP2R1 have also been linked to type 1 diabetes. The rs10741657 polymorphism, particularly the 'G' variant, is more frequently transmitted to affected offspring and is associated with lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in patients with type 1 diabetes (Ramos‐Lopez2007CYP2R1). Additionally, the rs12794714 polymorphism is associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion, suggesting a role in immune function and pregnancy outcomes (Liu2021SNP).

The CYP2R1 gene also influences the risk of multiple sclerosis. A low-frequency synonymous coding variant, rs117913124, significantly affects vitamin D levels and is associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (Manousaki2017LowFrequency). These findings underscore the gene's importance in vitamin D metabolism and its broader implications for health.

## Interactions
CYP2R1, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, primarily interacts with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, which serves as its redox partner. This interaction is crucial for the enzyme's function in the hydroxylation of vitamin D3. The interaction involves both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, with specific positively charged amino acids in the L-helix, C-helix, and the heme-binding region of CYP2R1 playing significant roles. Key residues involved in these interactions include Arg131, Arg137, Arg138, and Arg145 from the C-helix, as well as Lys434, Lys435, Arg445, and Arg455 from the L-helix (Strushkevich2008Structural).

CYP2R1 also interacts with cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), which is necessary for its enzymatic activity. A concentration of 1 μM POR, in a 4:1 ratio to CYP2R1, is required to achieve maximum activity, indicating a significant interaction between these two proteins (Cheng2018Properties). Although cytochrome b5 was investigated as a potential electron donor or allosteric modifier for CYP2R1, it was found not to significantly affect the rate of vitamin D3 metabolism, suggesting it does not modulate CYP2R1 activity (Cheng2018Properties). There is no mention of interactions with nucleic acids in the provided context.
