# SEC63

## Overview
The SEC63 gene encodes the SEC63 homolog, a protein translocation regulator that is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is a key component of the Sec62/Sec63 complex, which facilitates the translocation of polypeptides across the ER membrane, a critical process for protein maturation and cellular function. The SEC63 protein is characterized by its three transmembrane domains and a luminal DnaJ domain, which interacts with the ER chaperone BiP to assist in protein import. It plays a pivotal role in both signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent and SRP-independent pathways, ensuring the proper translocation of proteins with challenging signal peptides. Mutations in the SEC63 gene have been linked to various diseases, including Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Liver Disease (ADPLD), highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular health (Jung2021Emerging; Schorr2019Proteomics; Feldheim1992Topology).

## Structure
The SEC63 protein is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) involved in protein translocation. It is characterized by three transmembrane domains, with its N-terminus facing the ER lumen and its C-terminus facing the cytosol (Jung2021Emerging; Feldheim1992Topology). The protein contains a DnaJ domain located in the luminal loop between the second and third transmembrane domains, which is crucial for interaction with the ER lumenal chaperone Kar2 (BiP in mammals) (Jung2021Emerging; Lyman1995Interaction). This domain is essential for the translocation of both signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent and -independent precursors (Jung2021Emerging).

The C-terminal region of SEC63 is highly charged, containing numerous aspartate and glutamate residues, and interacts with other components of the translocation machinery, such as Sec62, Sec71, and Sec72 (Jung2021Emerging; Feldheim1992Topology). Phosphorylation of threonine residues at positions 652 and 654 enhances its interaction with Sec62, indicating a regulatory role in protein translocation (Jung2021Emerging). The SEC63 protein is part of a larger complex that includes Sec61, Sec62, Sec71, and Sec72, forming a heptameric structure essential for protein translocation across the ER membrane (Jung2021Emerging).

## Function
The SEC63 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the translocation of polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in human cells. It is a component of the Sec62/Sec63 complex, which plays a crucial role in the import of precursor polypeptides into the ER. This complex supports the Sec61 channel, facilitating the translocation of proteins into the ER in a substrate-specific manner, particularly for precursors with inefficiently gating signal peptides or those with certain detrimental features in their mature regions (Schorr2019Proteomics; Schorr2020Identification).

SEC63 interacts with BiP, a chaperone protein, to assist in the opening of the Sec61 channel, which is essential for the import of certain proteins, such as pre-ERj3, preproapelin, and prion protein. This interaction is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis within the ER (Schorr2019Proteomics; Schorr2020Identification). The SEC63 protein is also involved in the regulation of ER protein import through phosphorylation and calcium-binding, similar to the TRAP complex (Schorr2020Identification).

Mutations in SEC63 can impair the ER import of specific proteins, leading to diseases such as Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Liver Disease (PLD) and Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) (Schorr2019Proteomics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEC63 gene are implicated in autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), a condition characterized by the formation of multiple fluid-filled cysts in the liver. These mutations can lead to structural and functional changes in the SEC63 protein, which is crucial for protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The mutations identified include missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, which can result in premature termination of protein translation and contribute to the development of polycystic liver disease (Waanders2006Extensive; Davila2004Mutations).

The SEC63 gene is also associated with a two-hit mechanism similar to that observed in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), where somatic mutations lead to the loss of function of cilial proteins, contributing to cyst formation (Davila2004Mutations). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in SEC63 germline carriers has been observed in polycystic liver disease, suggesting that somatic mutations may play a role in cyst development (Janssen2012Loss).

In addition to liver disease, SEC63 mutations can affect the biogenesis and function of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, proteins crucial for preventing cyst formation, and activate the unfolded protein response pathway, which may influence disease severity (Fedeles2015Sec63).

## Interactions
SEC63 is a key component of the protein translocation machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and participates in several critical interactions. It forms part of the Sec63 complex, which includes Sec62, Sec71, and Sec72, and is essential for both SRP-dependent and SRP-independent pathways of protein translocation (Young2001Sec63p). SEC63 interacts with the chaperone BiP (Kar2p in yeast), which is crucial for the translocation process. This interaction stimulates BiP's ATPase activity, facilitating the transition from ATP- to ADP-bound states, which is necessary for binding to the translocon (Young2001Sec63p).

The interaction between SEC63 and BiP is mediated by the lumenal J-domain of SEC63, which is essential for the proper functioning of the Sec61 channel and the import of proteins into the ER (Schorr2020Identification). SEC63 also interacts with nucleoredoxin (NRX), a protein involved in Wnt signaling pathways. This interaction may provide insights into the pathophysiology of autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (PCLD), as mutations in SEC63 are linked to this condition (Müller2011An). These interactions highlight SEC63's role in maintaining protein homeostasis and its involvement in disease mechanisms.
