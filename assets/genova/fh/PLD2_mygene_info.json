catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid and choline. The activity of the encoded enzyme is enhanced by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and ADP-ribosylation factor-1. This protein localizes to the peripheral membrane and may be involved in cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, and/or regulated secretion. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2011].", "symbol": "PLD2", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1418642"}, "unigene": "Hs.104519", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "O14939", "TrEMBL": ["I3L3I7", "I3L4R5", "I3L1F3", "I3L222", "I3L381"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "PLD2"}}
