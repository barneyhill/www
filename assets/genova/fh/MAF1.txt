# MAF1

## Overview
MAF1 is a gene that encodes the MAF1 homolog, a protein that functions as a negative regulator of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription. The MAF1 protein is a conserved regulatory element that plays a crucial role in controlling the synthesis of small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, which are essential for protein synthesis and cell growth. Structurally, MAF1 contains a central beta sheet and several helices, with a C-box region that is vital for its stability and function. The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which affects its interaction with Pol III and its response to cellular stress. MAF1's regulatory function is significant for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions, by conserving energy and resources. Alterations in MAF1 expression or function have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Vorländer2019Structural; Moir2013Regulation; Bonhoure2015Loss).

## Structure
The MAF1 protein is a conserved negative regulator of RNA polymerase III, with a structure that includes several key regions and motifs. The primary structure of MAF1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the MAF1 gene. Within its secondary structure, MAF1 contains a central beta sheet and several helices, which are crucial for its function (Vorländer2019Structural). The protein also features a C-box region, a 53 amino acid segment that includes four β-sheets, playing a significant role in transcriptional activity and protein stability (Pradhan2017The).

The C-box region is essential for MAF1's stability and function, with the YSY motif (amino acids Y166, S167, Y168) being critical for maintaining its structural integrity and activity. Mutations in this motif can destabilize the protein and affect its transcriptional targets (Pradhan2017The). MAF1's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which influences its interaction with RNA polymerase III and its response to cellular stress (Vorländer2019Structural; Orioli2016Human).

MAF1 exists in two distinct species, MAF1 L and MAF1 S, which differ in their sensitivity to the ubiquitin-proteasome system and subcellular localization (Pradhan2017The). The protein's regulatory internal region is accessible even when bound to RNA polymerase III, allowing for rapid de-repression by kinases (Vorländer2019Structural).

## Function
The MAF1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription in human cells. MAF1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with components of the Pol III transcription machinery, including the TFIIB family members Brf1 and Brf2, to inhibit transcription. This repression is crucial for controlling the synthesis of small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, which are essential for protein synthesis and cell growth (Cieśla2008Regulation; Rollins2007Human).

MAF1's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which affects its localization and function. Under stress conditions or nutrient deprivation, MAF1 is dephosphorylated and accumulates in the nucleus, where it represses Pol III transcription. This regulation is mediated by signaling pathways, including the TORC1 and PKA pathways, which influence MAF1's phosphorylation state and nuclear localization (Moir2013Regulation).

The repression of Pol III transcription by MAF1 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions. By modulating Pol III activity, MAF1 helps conserve energy and resources, thereby contributing to the cell's ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions (Moir2013Regulation; Cieśla2008Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MAF1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and metabolic disorders. In cancer, MAF1 acts as a transcriptional repressor and is involved in the PTEN/PI3K signaling pathways. Loss of PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, leads to reduced MAF1 expression, which is associated with increased tumorigenesis and lipid accumulation. This is significant because elevated expression of lipogenic enzymes, which MAF1 normally represses, is linked to cancer progression (Palian2014Maf1). In breast cancer, MAF1 is frequently amplified, especially in HER2-positive subtypes, but its protein expression is decreased, suggesting a complex role in cancer biology. Increased MAF1 expression correlates with improved relapse-free survival in response to trastuzumab treatment, indicating its potential as a predictive biomarker (CabarcasPetroski2023MAF1).

In metabolic disorders, the loss of MAF1 in mice has been shown to confer resistance to diet-induced obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This resistance is attributed to increased energy expenditure and metabolic inefficiency, suggesting that MAF1 could be a therapeutic target for obesity and related conditions (Bonhoure2015Loss).

## Interactions
Human MAF1 interacts with components of the TFIIIB complex, specifically the subunits Brf1 and Brf2, which are involved in RNA polymerase III transcription. MAF1 represses RNA polymerase III transcription by directly interacting with these subunits. In HeLa cells, overexpression of Brf1 can alleviate MAF1-induced repression, suggesting that MAF1 inhibits transcription through Brf1. Similarly, Brf2 is also a target of MAF1 repression, although its overexpression only partially restores transcription activity. Co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays have demonstrated that MAF1 directly interacts with Brf2, and localization studies show that both MAF1 and Brf2 co-localize in the nucleus, supporting the idea that MAF1 exerts its repressive effects through direct interaction with Brf2 (Rollins2007Human).

In yeast, MAF1 has been shown to interact with the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III, Rpc160, and other subunits such as C160, C128, C82, AC40, C34, AC19, C17, and ABC14.5. These interactions suggest a physical association between MAF1 and the RNA polymerase III complex (Cieśla2008Regulation).
