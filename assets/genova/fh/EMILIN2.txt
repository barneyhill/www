# EMILIN2

## Overview
EMILIN2 is a gene that encodes the protein elastin microfibril interfacer 2, which is a member of the EMILIN/Multimerin family of extracellular matrix proteins. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal cysteine-rich EMI domain, a central coiled-coil domain, a unique proline-rich domain, a collagenous domain, and a C-terminal gC1q domain, which facilitate its diverse biological functions (Sa2011EMILIN2; Colombatti2012The). Elastin microfibril interfacer 2 is involved in critical cellular processes such as angiogenesis, apoptosis, and the regulation of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. It interacts with various signaling pathways, including the EGFR/Jak2-STAT3 and Wnt pathways, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and survival (Paulitti2018The; Marastoni2014EMILIN2). The protein's role in disease contexts, particularly in cancer and thrombosis, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Sa2011EMILIN2; Andreuzzi2022Colorectal).

## Structure
EMILIN2 is a protein that is part of the EMILIN/Multimerin family, characterized by several distinct domains. It contains an N-terminal cysteine-rich EMI domain, a central coiled-coil domain, a unique proline-rich domain, a collagenous domain, and a C-terminal gC1q domain (Huang2015EMILIN2; Sa2011EMILIN2; Colombatti2012The). The EMI domain is notable for its seven cysteine residues and a conserved sequence motif, which may contribute to its structural stability (Colombatti2012The).

The central region of EMILIN2 is predicted to form coiled-coil structures, which are common in proteins that form multimeric assemblies (Colombatti2012The). The proline-rich domain, unique to EMILIN2, is hydrophilic and exposed, potentially allowing interactions with other ligands and providing structural flexibility (Sa2011EMILIN2; Colombatti2012The).

The gC1q domain of EMILIN2 is conserved and forms a beta-sheet secondary structure, adopting a beta sandwich topology in a homotrimeric arrangement (Colombatti2012The). This domain is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as integrins, and can form both homo- and hetero-multimers (Sa2011EMILIN2).

EMILIN2 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its stability and function (Huang2015EMILIN2). The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, affecting its structural and functional properties (Huang2015EMILIN2).

## Function
EMILIN2, or elastin microfibril interfacer 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, by enhancing the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) through the activation of the EGFR/Jak2-STAT3 signaling axis. This process is crucial for the viability and motility of endothelial cells, which are essential for vascular development (Paulitti2018The). EMILIN2 is expressed by several cell types, including fibroblasts, astrocytes, and smooth muscle cells, and is abundant in tissues such as the sclera and retina, indicating its involvement in retinal vascular development (Paulitti2018The).

In the bone marrow, EMILIN2 is a component of the extracellular matrix and plays a role in regulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and hematopoietic progenitors. It influences the balance between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, maintaining bone marrow homeostasis and modulating hematopoiesis (Da2022Emilin2). EMILIN2 also has a pro-apoptotic function, promoting cell death through the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by binding to death receptors 4 and 5 (Colombatti2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the EMILIN2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In colorectal cancer, the absence of EMILIN2 is associated with increased neoplastic lesions, poor tumor immunosurveillance, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This is linked to altered cytokine expression and increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which correlate with poor prognosis (Andreuzzi2022Colorectal). EMILIN2 also influences macrophage polarization, promoting an anti-tumor M1 phenotype through the TLR-4/MyD88 pathway. Loss of EMILIN2 leads to a shift towards the pro-tumor M2 phenotype, affecting tumor progression and patient outcomes (Andreuzzi2022Colorectal).

In breast cancer, EMILIN2 methylation is associated with relapse, lymph node metastases, and poor relapse-free survival. Methylated tumors exhibit lower EMILIN2 expression, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Hill2010Identification). EMILIN2 also modulates the Wnt signaling pathway, reducing breast cancer cell growth and motility by attenuating β-catenin activation (Marastoni2014EMILIN2).

In low-grade gliomas, high EMILIN2 expression or low methylation is linked to poor overall survival. EMILIN2 expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, indicating its role in tumor immunology (Wang2021EMILIN2). EMILIN2's involvement in thrombosis is suggested by its expression in thrombi and its role in platelet aggregation, potentially affecting clot stability (Sa2011EMILIN2).

## Interactions
EMILIN2, an extracellular matrix protein, engages in several significant interactions with other proteins, influencing various biological processes. It directly binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), promoting angiogenesis by enhancing interleukin-8 (IL-8) production through the activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. This interaction is specific to EMILIN2 and does not occur with other proteins like Multimerin2 (Paulitti2018The). EMILIN2 also interacts with Wnt1, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, through its cysteine-rich EMI domain. This interaction inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway by decreasing LRP6 phosphorylation and β-catenin activation, which affects breast cancer cell proliferation and migration (Marastoni2014EMILIN2).

EMILIN2 is involved in interactions with the protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis, where it binds to PA and inhibits its toxic effects. This interaction is mediated by the EMI domain of EMILIN2, which is crucial for binding (Doliana2008EMILINs). Additionally, EMILIN2 forms heterodimers with EMILIN1, influencing platelet aggregation and clot retraction, which are critical in thrombosis (Huang2015EMILIN2). These interactions highlight EMILIN2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and its potential therapeutic implications.
