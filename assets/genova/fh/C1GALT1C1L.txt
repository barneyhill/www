# C1GALT1C1L

## Overview
The C1GALT1C1L gene encodes the protein C1GALT1 specific chaperone 1 like, which is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins. This protein is categorized as a chaperone, playing a crucial role in the proper folding and stability of glycosyltransferases, particularly those involved in the synthesis of O-glycans. The C1GALT1 specific chaperone 1 like protein assists in the correct assembly and function of the core 1 Î²1,3-galactosyltransferase enzyme complex, which is essential for the biosynthesis of mucin-type O-glycans. These glycan structures are important for various biological processes, including cell-cell communication and immune response (Qiu2020aarFDC).
