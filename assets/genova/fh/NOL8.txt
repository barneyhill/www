# NOL8

## Overview
NOL8, or nucleolar protein 8, is a gene that encodes a nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental process for protein synthesis within cells. The NOL8 protein is characterized by its RNA-recognition motif domain, which facilitates its role in RNA binding and processing, particularly within the nucleolus (Mo2021MicroRNA). This protein is crucial for the proper localization and function of other nucleolar components, such as DEAD-box RNA helicase 47, which are essential for pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (Sekiguchi2006NOP132; Mo2021MicroRNA). Beyond its role in normal cellular function, NOL8 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it interacts with key signaling molecules like beta-catenin to promote oncogenic processes (Gu2018NOL8). Its expression is also modulated by microRNAs, such as MIR452, which further underscores its involvement in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Mo2021MicroRNA).

## Structure


## Function
NOL8 (nucleolar protein 8) is primarily involved in ribosome biogenesis, a critical process for protein synthesis in cells. The NOL8 protein is located in the nucleolus, where it participates in the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits, essential for maintaining cellular growth and proliferation (Sekiguchi2006NOP132). NOL8 encodes an RNA-recognition motif domain in its amino acid terminal region, which is crucial for its function in RNA binding and processing (Mo2021MicroRNA).

In healthy human cells, NOL8 is necessary for the proper localization of DEAD-box RNA helicase 47 within the nucleolus, which is important for pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (Mo2021MicroRNA). This interaction suggests that NOL8 plays a significant role in the recruitment and localization of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, similar to its yeast ortholog Nop8 (Sekiguchi2006NOP132). The proper functioning of NOL8 is vital for the efficient production of ribosomes, which in turn supports the overall protein synthesis capacity of the cell, impacting cellular growth and proliferation. The precise molecular mechanisms and additional roles of NOL8 in healthy cells remain areas for further research.

## Clinical Significance
NOL8 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In nervous system tumors, NOL8 is significantly upregulated, with expression levels exceeding a 10-fold increase in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with tumor formation, as RNAi knockdown of NOL8 in HeLa cells and diffuse-type gastric cancer cell lines inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Galante2009A).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), NOL8 is regulated by microRNA 452 (MIR452), which is upregulated in CRC tissues. MIR452 modulates NOL8 mRNA and protein levels, affecting cell-cell communication and functions in CRC tissues. This regulation is crucial for understanding colorectal carcinogenesis, as NOL8 promotes cancer cell migration and colony formation (Mo2021MicroRNA).

NOL8 is also upregulated in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), indicating a potential role in the disease's pathophysiology. However, specific details on how NOL8 mutations or expression alterations directly relate to T2DM are not well-documented (Liu2019Key). These findings highlight NOL8's potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker and as a target for cancer therapy (Galante2009A).

## Interactions
NOL8, a nucleolar protein, is known to interact with beta-catenin, a key player in the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction enhances the binding of beta-catenin to TCF4, thereby activating beta-catenin/TCF signaling, which is crucial for the growth and migration of prostate cancer cells (Gu2018NOL8). The interaction between NOL8 and beta-catenin was confirmed through GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating a physical association that promotes oncogenic processes in prostate cancer (Gu2018NOL8).

In colorectal cancer, NOL8 is regulated by microRNA 452 (MIR452), which binds to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of NOL8 mRNA, leading to decreased NOL8 expression. This regulatory interaction was demonstrated using luciferase assays, where MIR452 binding resulted in reduced luciferase activity, indicating a direct interaction with the NOL8 mRNA (Mo2021MicroRNA). The modulation of NOL8 by MIR452 suggests a role in colorectal carcinogenesis, affecting cell proliferation and migration (Mo2021MicroRNA). These interactions highlight NOL8's involvement in cancer progression through its interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids.
