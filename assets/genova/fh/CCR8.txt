# CCR8

## Overview
CCR8, or C-C motif chemokine receptor 8, is a gene that encodes a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) known for its involvement in immune cell signaling and trafficking. The CCR8 protein is characterized by a seven transmembrane helical structure typical of GPCRs, which facilitates its role in signal transduction across cell membranes (Sun2023Structural). This receptor is primarily expressed in tissue-resident memory T cells and regulatory T cells, where it plays a crucial role in immune response modulation and tissue homeostasis (McCully2018CCR8; Moser2022Chemokine). CCR8 interacts with various ligands, including the chemokine CCL1, to mediate chemotaxis and immune cell activation (Fox2006StructureFunction). Its expression and function are implicated in several clinical conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, colorectal cancer, and glioblastoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Islam2011Mouse; Sun2023Oxamate; Angelova2015Characterization).

## Structure
The C-C motif chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8) is a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven transmembrane helical bundle, typical of GPCRs (Sun2023Structural). The primary structure of CCR8 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific residues such as Q91, Y114, Y172, and E286 playing crucial roles in its activation by the endogenous ligand CCL1 (Sun2023Structural). 

The secondary structure includes alpha helices that contribute to the receptor's transmembrane domain, facilitating its role in signal transduction (Peng2024CryoEM). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional shape, forming a transmembrane domain that is essential for its function (Sun2023Structural). 

CCR8's quaternary structure is observed in its complex with G proteins, where it displays an active state even in the absence of a ligand, suggesting a potential for self-activation (Peng2024CryoEM). Post-translational modifications such as disulfide bridges are essential for CCL1 signaling and CCR8 binding (Sun2023Structural). The receptor's extracellular loops, particularly ECL1 and ECL2, are involved in interactions with antibodies and ligands, contributing to its functional specificity (Sun2023Structural).

## Function
CCR8 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 8) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in immune cell signaling and trafficking. It is prominently expressed in tissue-resident memory (TRM) T cells in human skin, where it contributes to their localization and function. CCR8+ skin T cells exhibit features of mature TRM cells, such as the expression of CD69 and low levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 and CCR7, which are associated with tissue retention and memory phenotype maintenance (McCully2018CCR8). These cells proliferate robustly in response to IL-15 and TCR stimulation, indicating their long-term persistence in the skin (McCully2018CCR8).

In addition to its role in skin T cells, CCR8 is expressed in regulatory T (Treg) cells, where it is involved in immune suppression and potentially tissue repair processes. The expression of CCR8 in Treg cells is influenced by the tissue environment, with factors like 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and prostaglandin E2 enhancing its expression (Moser2022Chemokine). CCR8 signaling in Treg cells is associated with the transcription factor BATF, which is involved in tissue repair programs, suggesting a role in wound healing and immune regulation (Moser2022Chemokine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CCR8 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving immune system dysregulation. In the context of atopic dermatitis, CCR8 plays a crucial role in the recruitment of IL-5+ TH2 cells to inflamed skin, contributing to chronic allergic inflammation. The absence of CCR8 or its ligand, mouse CCL8, has been shown to protect against chronic allergic dermatitis, highlighting its significance in TH2 cell recruitment and eosinophilic inflammation (Islam2011Mouse).

In colorectal cancer, CCR8 expression is associated with a favorable prognosis, although it is downregulated in metastatic tumors. This suggests that CCR8 may play a role in modulating the immune response within the tumor microenvironment (Angelova2015Characterization).

CCR8 is also involved in the immunosuppressive environment of glioblastoma, where lactate in the tumor microenvironment enhances CCR8 expression on regulatory T cells, contributing to a Th17/Treg imbalance. Inhibition of lactate production has been shown to reduce CCR8 expression, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for enhancing CAR-T cell therapy efficacy in glioblastoma (Sun2023Oxamate).

In IgG4-related sialadenitis, the CCL8-CCR8 axis is upregulated, contributing to inflammation and fibrosis. Targeting this pathway with an anti-mCCL8 neutralizing antibody has shown potential in reducing disease symptoms, indicating its role in the pathogenesis of IgG4-related diseases (Honda2021Pathogenic).

## Interactions
CCR8 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 8) interacts with various ligands, including chemokines and small molecules, which influence its signaling pathways and functional outcomes. The primary ligand for CCR8 is CCL1, which binds to the receptor and induces chemotaxis and intracellular calcium release, activating immune responses (Fox2006StructureFunction). Another significant interaction is with the viral chemokine vMIP-I, encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-related herpesvirus, which acts as a specific agonist for CCR8, promoting cell migration and calcium signaling (Endres1999The).

CCR8 also interacts with β-arrestins, which are crucial for receptor internalization. This process is β-arrestin-dependent and pertussis toxin-independent, highlighting a unique pathway compared to other chemokine receptors (Fox2006StructureFunction). The receptor's internalization and signaling are modulated by the amino terminus of CCL1, which is essential for effective binding and activation (Fox2006StructureFunction).

In addition to natural chemokines, small molecule agonists like ZK756326 and AZ6 have been shown to activate CCR8, demonstrating biased signaling properties by preferentially activating certain pathways, such as Gαi protein signaling, without significant Gβγ activity (Liu2021Biological). These interactions underscore the complexity of CCR8's role in immune modulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
