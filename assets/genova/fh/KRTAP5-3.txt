# KRTAP5-3

## Overview
KRTAP5-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 5-3, which is a crucial component of the keratin-associated protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair and nails. Characterized by a high sulfur content and a unique sequence pattern, keratin-associated protein 5-3 interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to provide strength and resilience to hair fibers, influencing their physical attributes such as thickness and curliness (Litman2023Ancient). The gene is predominantly expressed in hair-related tissues, particularly within the hair cortex, and is part of the metallothionein-related group, suggesting an evolutionary link to metallothioneins known for metal ion binding (Rogers2001Characterization; Litman2023Ancient). The protein's structural features and expression patterns underscore its specialized role in hair follicle development and maintenance (Rogers2001Characterization; Litman2023Ancient).

## Function
KRTAP5-3, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, plays a significant role in the structure and function of hair. It is primarily expressed in hair-related tissues, particularly in the hair cortex, where it contributes to the formation and integrity of hair fibers (Rogers2001Characterization; Litman2023Ancient). The protein is characterized by its ultrahigh sulfur content and a distinct sequence pattern, which is crucial for its interaction with keratin intermediate filaments. This interaction provides mechanical strength and resilience to hair fibers, influencing characteristics such as thickness and curliness (Litman2023Ancient).

KRTAP5-3 is part of the metallothionein-related group within the KRTAP family, indicating a potential evolutionary relationship with metallothioneins, which are known for their role in metal ion binding and detoxification (Litman2023Ancient). Although the specific molecular function of KRTAP5-3 in healthy human cells is not directly addressed, its expression pattern and structural features suggest a specialized role in hair follicle development and maintenance (Rogers2001Characterization; Litman2023Ancient).
