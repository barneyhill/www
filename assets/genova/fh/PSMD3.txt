# PSMD3

## Overview
PSMD3 is a gene that encodes the protein proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 3, which is a crucial component of the 26S proteasome complex. This complex is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins in eukaryotic cells. The PSMD3 protein, categorized as a non-ATPase subunit, plays a significant role in substrate recognition and binding, facilitating the proteasome's function in maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating protein turnover (Gomes2013Genetics). The activity of PSMD3 is essential for various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and stress responses, by ensuring the proper degradation and recycling of proteins. Dysregulation of PSMD3 expression has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular regulation and organismal health (Zheng2013Genetic; Rubio202126S).

## Function
PSMD3 is a component of the 26S proteasome, specifically part of the 19S regulatory cap, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins in eukaryotic cells. This degradation process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating protein turnover, and ensuring proper cellular function. PSMD3, as a non-ATPase subunit, is involved in substrate recognition and binding, facilitating the proteasome's ability to target and degrade specific proteins (Gomes2013Genetics).

In healthy human cells, PSMD3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and stress responses. By regulating the degradation of proteins, PSMD3 helps maintain cellular homeostasis and proper function, which is vital for organismal health. The protein's activity in these cellular compartments ensures that proteins are appropriately recycled and that damaged or misfolded proteins do not accumulate, which could otherwise lead to cellular dysfunction (Gomes2013Genetics).

PSMD3's role in the UPS highlights its importance in cellular regulation and its potential impact on various physiological processes, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSMD3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders. In cancer, PSMD3 is upregulated in several types, including lung adenocarcinoma, kidney cancers, skin cutaneous melanoma, and uveal melanoma, where its higher expression is associated with reduced overall survival (Rubio202126S). In lung cancer, PSMD3 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by stabilizing the protein expression of ILF3, contributing to poor prognosis (Zhang2023PSMD3ILF3). In breast cancer, high PSMD3 expression correlates with worse overall survival and is particularly significant in HER2+ breast cancer, where it stabilizes HER2 from degradation (Fararjeh2019Proteasome).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), PSMD3 is upregulated in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant cell lines, contributing to drug resistance by stabilizing nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) (BencomoAlvarez2021Proteasome). This upregulation is associated with increased NF-κB transcriptional activity, which is crucial for the survival of resistant CML cells (BencomoAlvarez2021Proteasome).

In metabolic diseases, genetic variants of PSMD3 are linked to insulin resistance, a key factor in type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. These variants interact with dietary factors, such as carbohydrates and monounsaturated fatty acids, to modulate insulin resistance and glucose metabolism (Zheng2013Genetic).

## Interactions
PSMD3, a component of the 26S proteasome, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In breast cancer, PSMD3 interacts with the HER2 protein, stabilizing it and preventing its degradation. This interaction is significant in HER2-positive breast cancer cells, where PSMD3 helps maintain HER2 levels, thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival (Fararjeh2019Proteasome). The interaction between PSMD3 and HER2 was confirmed using immunoprecipitation and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assays, demonstrating a direct interaction in HER2-positive cell lines (Fararjeh2019Proteasome).

In lung cancer, PSMD3 interacts with ILF3, an RNA-binding protein. This interaction promotes lung cancer cell proliferation and migration. PSMD3 stabilizes ILF3 protein expression and facilitates its deubiquitination, which is crucial for the progression of lung cancer (Zhang2023PSMD3ILF3). The interaction between PSMD3 and ILF3 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (Zhang2023PSMD3ILF3).

In chronic myeloid leukemia, PSMD3 is involved in the regulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) protein expression and transcriptional activity, contributing to resistance against tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BencomoAlvarez2021Proteasome).
