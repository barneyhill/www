# SHROOM2

## Overview
SHROOM2 is a gene that encodes the protein shroom family member 2, which is part of the shroom family of proteins known for their role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular architecture. The SHROOM2 protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a PDZ domain, a serine-and proline-rich domain, and myosin-VIIa-binding regions, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and cellular structures (Etournay2007Shroom2). It plays a crucial role in the regulation of melanosome biogenesis and localization within the retinal pigment epithelium, impacting pigmentation and visual function (Fairbank2006Shroom2). Additionally, SHROOM2 is involved in maintaining the integrity of tight junctions in epithelial cells, contributing to cellular contractility and structural organization (Etournay2007Shroom2; Amano2015Kinaseinteracting). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including ocular disorders, neural tube defects, and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease (Yuan2019SHROOM2; Fairbank2006Shroom2).

## Structure
The SHROOM2 protein, also known as mShrm2, is a member of the shroom family of proteins, characterized by the presence of conserved sequence motifs. It is predicted to be 1487 amino acids long with a molecular weight of approximately 163.5 kDa (Etournay2007Shroom2). The protein contains several distinct domains, including a PDZ domain (amino acids 27-107), a serine-and proline-rich domain (SPR; amino acids 123-326), a myosin-VIIa-binding region (MBR; amino acids 350-721), and two Apx-Shroom domain (ASD) motifs, ASD1 (amino acids 705-807) and ASD2 (Etournay2007Shroom2).

The PDZ domain is common in proteins that interact with tight junction proteins, facilitating interactions with ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, JAMs, and claudins (Etournay2007Shroom2). The MBR region mediates interaction with myosin VIIa, specifically through the C-terminal MyTH4/FERM repeat of myosin VIIa (Etournay2007Shroom2). The SPR domain is involved in binding to ZO-1, particularly within the SH3/GuK domains of ZO-1 (Etournay2007Shroom2).

SHROOM2 is also involved in actin binding, with its actin-binding region located in the C-terminal part of the MBR (Etournay2007Shroom2). The protein is expressed strongly in the eye, particularly in the retinal pigment epithelium, and is hypothesized to regulate pigmentation (Fairbank2006Shroom2).

## Function
The SHROOM2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of melanosome biogenesis and localization within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Melanosomes are pigment-containing organelles essential for proper eye pigmentation and visual function. SHROOM2 is involved in the movement of melanosomes to the apical surface of the RPE, a process that requires the coordination of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons (Fairbank2006Shroom2). The protein functions upstream of the Rab27a GTPase and is necessary for the maturation and apical localization of melanosomes, impacting retinal lamination and anterior eye development (Fairbank2006Shroom2).

SHROOM2 also plays a role in maintaining the integrity of tight junctions in epithelial cells. It interacts with myosin VIIa and ZO-1, forming a scaffolding complex that stabilizes tight junctions and links the junctional membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton (Etournay2007Shroom2). This interaction is crucial for the structural maintenance of cell-cell junctions and may influence intracellular signaling pathways that regulate gene expression (Etournay2007Shroom2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SHROOM2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), SHROOM2 acts as a suppressor of tumor metastasis. Its depletion leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing cancer cell migration and invasion, which contributes to cancer progression (Yuan2019SHROOM2). SHROOM2 is downregulated in NPC, with lower expression levels observed in metastatic tumors compared to primary ones, indicating its role in inhibiting metastasis (Yuan2019SHROOM2).

SHROOM2 mutations have also been identified in patients with neural tube defects (NTD), although these mutations do not significantly affect its interaction with the ROCK pathway (Yuan2019SHROOM2). In the context of ocular disorders, SHROOM2 is located within a critical region for two forms of ocular albinism, suggesting that mutations may contribute to these visual system disorders (Fairbank2006Shroom2).

Additionally, variations near the SHROOM2 gene have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential role in cancer susceptibility (Dunlop2012Common). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SHROOM2 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SHROOM2 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to myosin VIIa, a motor protein involved in cellular transport, through its myosin-VIIa-binding region (MBR). This interaction is crucial for the transfer of melanosomes in retinal pigment epithelium cells (Etournay2007Shroom2). SHROOM2 also interacts with ZO-1 at tight junctions, where it helps stabilize these structures by linking the plasma membrane to the cortical cytoskeleton. This interaction is mediated through the SPR domain of SHROOM2, which binds to the SH3/GuK domains of ZO-1 (Etournay2007Shroom2).

SHROOM2 forms a complex with Scrib and Rho-kinase, which is involved in modulating cell contractility. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, with Rho-kinase phosphorylating Scrib to facilitate the complex formation. The complex plays a role in cellular contractility and structural organization, particularly at the cortical edge of cells (Amano2015Kinaseinteracting). SHROOM2 also interacts with the RhoA-ROCK pathway, influencing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. It mediates ROCK membrane recruitment and activation, although its inhibition of EMT is independent of the ROCK pathway (Yuan2019SHROOM2).
