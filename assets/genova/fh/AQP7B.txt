# AQP7B

## Overview
Aquaporin 7B (AQP7B) is a gene that encodes the protein aquaporin 7B, which is a member of the aquaporin family of transmembrane water channel proteins. These proteins are integral to cellular water homeostasis, facilitating the transport of water and, in some cases, small solutes across cell membranes. Aquaporin 7B is particularly significant in tissues where rapid water movement is essential, such as in adipose tissue and the kidney, where it may play a role in glycerol metabolism and osmoregulation. The expression and regulation of AQP7B can have implications for metabolic processes and disorders, highlighting its potential clinical significance in conditions such as obesity and diabetes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
