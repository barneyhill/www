# ZNF184

## Overview
ZNF184 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 184, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role as transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by zinc finger domains that facilitate binding to DNA, thereby regulating gene expression. Zinc finger protein 184 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes (Li2018Association). While the precise functions of ZNF184 in normal physiological conditions remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and has associations with certain cancers, such as lung cancer and choriocarcinoma (Li2018Association). Additionally, ZNF184 has clinical significance in diseases like Parkinson's disease and hereditary hemochromatosis, where specific genetic variants and haplotypes have been linked to disease susceptibility and progression (Li2018Association; Cruz2008A).

## Structure
ZNF184 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are small protein motifs stabilized by zinc ions. These domains typically facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger proteins often have a modular structure, with multiple zinc finger motifs contributing to their function. Common post-translational modifications of zinc finger proteins include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can affect protein stability and function. Splice variant isoforms may exist, leading to variations in the protein's structure and function. However, specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ZNF184 are not provided in the available context (Gao2020Association).

## Function
ZNF184 (zinc finger protein 184) is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains that facilitate binding to DNA. These proteins typically function as transcription factors, regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. ZNF184 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell (Li2018Association).

The exact function of ZNF184 in healthy human cells remains largely unknown, but it is suggested to play a role in transcriptional regulation. This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper cellular function. ZNF184's involvement in transcriptional regulation implies that it may impact various organismal outcomes, such as development and differentiation, by influencing the expression of genes critical for these processes (Li2018Association).

ZNF184 has also been associated with aberrant cell proliferation in certain cancers, such as lung cancer and choriocarcinoma, indicating its potential role in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (Li2018Association). However, further research is needed to fully elucidate its functions in normal physiological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF184 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions, particularly in relation to Parkinson's disease (PD) and hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). In the context of PD, studies have identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9468199 in the ZNF184 gene as being significantly associated with the disease in various genetic models. This SNP has been linked to both early-onset and late-onset PD, with notable associations in allele, additive, and recessive models (Gao2020Association; Li2018Association). The ZNF184 variant is also associated with non-motor symptoms of PD, such as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and excessive daytime sleepiness (Zhang2020Association).

In hereditary hemochromatosis, ZNF184 is part of a haplotype associated with CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers, which influences the severity of the disease. Specific haplotypes involving ZNF184 are linked to variations in CD8+ T-cell counts and iron overload severity, suggesting a role in modulating the clinical expression of HH (Cruz2008A). These findings highlight the gene's potential impact on disease susceptibility and progression, although further research is needed to fully understand its role.
