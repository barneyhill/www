# PNRC1

## Overview
PNRC1, or proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a nuclear receptor coactivator. The PNRC1 protein is characterized by its proline-rich Src homology domain-3 (SH3)-binding motif, which facilitates interactions with various nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (Zhou2006The). This protein plays a significant role in cellular processes by modulating nucleolar RNA dynamics and rRNA maturation, acting as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell proliferation (Gaviraghi2018Tumor). PNRC1 is involved in recruiting the cytoplasmic decapping complex to the nucleolus, which is crucial for the decapping of snoRNAs necessary for rRNA processing (Gaviraghi2018Tumor). The gene's expression is often downregulated in various cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogene-induced proliferation (Gaviraghi2018Tumor).

## Structure
PNRC1 (proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator 1) is characterized by its small size, consisting of 327 amino acids with a molecular weight of 35.2 kDa. The protein contains a proline-rich Src homology domain-3 (SH3)-binding motif, which is crucial for its interaction with nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (Zhou2006The). This SH3-binding motif is located in the amino acid region 278-300 and includes a core binding sequence SDPPSPS, essential for its coactivator function (Zhou2006The).

PNRC1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms, such as PNRC1c, PNRC1d, and PNRC1f, which differ in their ability to bind nuclear receptors and their subcellular localization (Wang2008Identification). These isoforms exhibit variations in their primary structure, affecting their functional roles. For instance, PNRC1c retains the SH3-binding motif, while PNRC1f lacks it, impacting their interaction capabilities (Wang2008Identification).

The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively documented in the provided context. The structural details of PNRC1, such as secondary or tertiary structures, are not explicitly described in the available sources.

## Function
PNRC1, or proline rich nuclear receptor coactivator 1, functions as a tumor suppressor gene involved in the regulation of rRNA maturation and cellular proliferation. In healthy human cells, PNRC1 plays a critical role in modulating nucleolar RNA dynamics by recruiting the cytoplasmic decapping complex, including proteins like DCP1a and DCP2, to the nucleolus. This recruitment is essential for the decapping of U3 and U8 snoRNAs, which are crucial for rRNA maturation (Gaviraghi2018Tumor). By influencing rRNA processing, PNRC1 helps maintain proper ribosomal function and controls cell proliferation, acting as a safeguard against oncogene-induced proliferation (Gaviraghi2018Tumor).

PNRC1 is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it interacts with the RNA decapping machinery, altering the localization of decapping proteins from cytoplasmic P-bodies to the nucleolus (Gaviraghi2018Tumor). This interaction is not mediated by RNA molecules, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction (Gaviraghi2018Tumor). The presence of PNRC1 in the nucleolus and its role in rRNA processing highlight its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing unchecked cell proliferation (Gaviraghi2018Tumor).

## Clinical Significance
PNRC1 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene, with its expression frequently downregulated in various cancers, including prostate, pancreatic, breast, T-cell neoplasms, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Gaviraghi2018Tumor). The gene is part of a cluster of tumor suppressor genes that are often located in regions of hemizygous deletions in cancerous tissues, suggesting that its loss or reduced expression may contribute to cancer progression (Gaviraghi2018Tumor).

PNRC1 plays a crucial role in rRNA maturation by recruiting the decapping complex to the nucleolus, which is essential for controlling ribosomal synthesis and translation. Its partial loss is common in carcinogenesis, as it allows increased ribosomal synthesis necessary for cancer cell proliferation (Gaviraghi2018Tumor). The gene's function is dosage-dependent, and its complete knockdown induces apoptosis in cancer cells, indicating its essential role in cell survival (Gaviraghi2018Tumor).

Mutations in PNRC1, such as the W300A mutation, impair its interaction with the decapping machinery, affecting its nucleolar recruitment and subsequent rRNA processing. This mutation hinders PNRC1's antiproliferative effects, failing to counteract RAS-driven proliferation, which underscores its tumor-suppressive function (Gaviraghi2018Tumor).

## Interactions
PNRC1 interacts with the DCP1a/DCP2 decapping complex, facilitating its recruitment to the nucleolus. This interaction is crucial for modulating rRNA dynamics, as PNRC1 binds directly to U3 and U8 snoRNAs, which are important for rRNA maturation. The binding of PNRC1 to these snoRNAs suggests that it confers specificity to the DCP2 decapping activity, playing a significant role in rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (Gaviraghi2018Tumor).

PNRC1 also interacts with several nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and liver X receptor (LXR), influencing their transcriptional activity. These interactions often involve the recruitment of additional coactivators or corepressors, affecting cellular processes like metabolism and inflammation (Wang2011PNRC).

The interaction of PNRC1 with the RNA helicase UPF1 has been noted, although its downregulation does not affect RNA decay processes controlled by UPF1. This suggests a specific role for PNRC1 in RNA processing rather than general RNA decay (Gaviraghi2018Tumor).

PNRC1's role as a tumor suppressor is linked to its ability to counteract oncogene-driven proliferation, such as that induced by RAS and MYC, through its interactions with the decapping complex and its influence on rRNA maturation (Gaviraghi2018Tumor).
