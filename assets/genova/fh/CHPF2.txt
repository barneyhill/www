# CHPF2

## Overview
CHPF2, or chondroitin polymerizing factor 2, is a gene that encodes a glycosyltransferase protein involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, a vital component of the extracellular matrix. The protein encoded by CHPF2 exhibits dual enzymatic activity, functioning as both a β1,3-GlcA transferase and a β1,4-GalNAc transferase, which are essential for the elongation of chondroitin sulfate chains (Mizumoto2021An). This protein operates within the Golgi apparatus, where it forms a complex with chondroitin synthase to facilitate the polymerization of chondroitin sulfate, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix (Nuytemans2018Variants). The activity of CHPF2 is significant for various physiological processes, including tissue development and repair, as well as cell signaling and adhesion, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal health.

## Structure


## Function
CHPF2, or chondroitin polymerizing factor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS), a critical component of the extracellular matrix. This protein exhibits dual enzymatic activity, functioning as both a β1,3-GlcA transferase and a β1,4-GalNAc transferase, which allows it to participate in the elongation of the CS chain by adding GlcA and GalNAc residues (Mizumoto2021An). CHPF2 forms an enzyme complex with chondroitin synthase (CHSY), facilitating the construction of the repeating disaccharide region of CS (Mizumoto2021An).

In healthy human cells, CHPF2 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in the polymerization process of chondroitin sulfate chains. This activity is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix, impacting tissue development and repair (Nuytemans2018Variants). The protein's involvement in glycosaminoglycan metabolism is significant for the formation, sulfation, and degradation of the chondroitin backbone, which is vital for cell signaling, adhesion, and structural integrity (Nuytemans2018Variants). CHPF2's function in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining healthy cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
CHPF2 (chondroitin polymerizing factor 2) has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or genetic mutations. In thrombotic storm (TS) patients, rare missense variants in CHPF2 and other genes involved in chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate metabolism have been identified, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of TS (Nuytemans2018Variants). 

In colorectal cancer, CHPF2 expression is significantly increased compared to normal tissues. This elevated expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and poorer overall survival, indicating that CHPF2 may play a role in cancer progression and patient prognosis (Wu2021Glycogenes). 

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), CHPF2 is upregulated and acts as the host gene for miR-671-5p, which is involved in the migration and proliferation of GBM cells. This suggests that CHPF2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of GBM through its interaction with miR-671-5p and other downstream targets (Barbagallo2015Dysregulated).

CHPF2 is also identified as a glycosyltransferase correlated with cuproptosis in colon adenocarcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in tumor immunity and extracellular matrix interactions (Ma2022Identification).
