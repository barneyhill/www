# DAW1

## Overview
DAW1, or Dynein Assembly Factor with WD Repeat Domains 1, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the assembly and function of dynein motor complexes. These complexes are essential for the movement of motile cilia, which play a significant role in various physiological processes, including embryonic development, respiratory function, and cerebrospinal fluid circulation. The DAW1 protein is characterized by its WD repeat domains, which likely form a β-propeller structure, facilitating its role in the assembly of outer dynein arms. This assembly is vital for converting ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force, enabling ciliary beating. Disruptions in DAW1 can lead to ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by defective ciliary function, manifesting in conditions such as heterotaxy and congenital heart disease (Lesko2020Dynein).

## Function
DAW1, also known as Dynein Assembly Factor with WD Repeat Domains 1, is essential for the assembly of dynein arms, which are critical for the function of motile cilia in healthy human cells. These dynein arms convert ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force, enabling the beating of cilia, which is vital for processes such as establishing left-right organ asymmetry during embryogenesis, clearing pathogens from airways, and propelling cerebrospinal fluid in the brain's ventricular system (Lesko2020Dynein).

DAW1 is involved in the assembly of outer dynein arms, facilitating their interaction with other cellular components. The protein contains WD repeat domains that likely form a β-propeller structure, which is crucial for its function in dynein arm assembly (Lesko2020Dynein). Disruption in DAW1 function can lead to ciliopathies, disorders arising from defective ciliary function, which can manifest as conditions like heterotaxy and congenital heart disease (Lesko2020Dynein).

In the cytoplasm, DAW1 assists in the assembly of dynein complexes, ensuring efficient cellular transport and division. This role is critical for maintaining proper cellular function and organismal health, as it impacts processes like mitosis and organelle positioning (Lesko2020Dynein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DAW1 gene, also known as Dynein Assembly Factor with WD Repeat Domains 1, have been implicated in a range of ciliopathies, which are disorders resulting from defects in ciliary function. In vertebrate models, such as mice, mutations in DAW1 lead to abnormalities in ciliary beating, causing conditions like heterotaxy, congenital heart disease, and defective mucociliary clearance. Heterotaxy, characterized by abnormal organ arrangement across the left-right axis of the body, can be fatal, as DAW1 homozygous mutant mice often die before birth due to complex congenital heart defects. Those that survive may die shortly after birth due to hydrocephalus, an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain (Lesko2020Dynein).

In planarians, the homologous gene Smed-daw1 is crucial for motile cilia function. RNA interference targeting Smed-daw1 results in motility defects and impaired fluid homeostasis, suggesting that DAW1 dysfunction in humans could lead to similar ciliopathies. Disruption of Smed-daw1 affects the structural stability and length of epidermal motile cilia, leading to reduced ciliary abundance and irregular beating patterns, which could translate to respiratory issues or fertility problems in humans (Lesko2020Dynein). Although DAW1 has not been directly linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in humans, its role in dynein arm transport suggests potential involvement in ciliary dysfunctions (Niziolek2022PCD).

## Interactions
DAW1, also known as Dynein Assembly Factor with WD Repeat Domains 1, is involved in the assembly and function of dynein motor complexes, which are essential for ciliary movement. DAW1 interacts with Intraflagellar Transport Protein 46 (IFT46) to facilitate the transport of dynein particles along cilia. This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly of outer dynein arms, which are necessary for ciliary beating (Lesko2020Dynein). In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the ortholog of DAW1, known as ODA16, also interacts with IFT46, highlighting a conserved mechanism across species (Fassad2018C11orf70).

In zebrafish, the ortholog WD Repeat Domain 69 (WDR69) is involved in the assembly of outer arm dyneins, indicating a similar role for DAW1 in other vertebrates (Lesko2020Dynein). Mutations in DAW1 or its orthologs can lead to ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defective ciliary function, further emphasizing the importance of these interactions in maintaining normal cellular processes (Lesko2020Dynein).

While DAW1's interactions with nucleic acids are not explicitly detailed in the provided context, its role in dynein assembly suggests it may influence gene expression or cellular processes indirectly through its protein interactions.
