# PJA1

## Overview
PJA1, or praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 1, is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein involved in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation by the proteasome. This protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein stability and degradation, and is implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts. PJA1 is known for its interactions with key proteins such as TDP-43 and Tau, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, and its involvement in the degradation of EZH2, a chromatin modifier crucial for muscle differentiation (Consalvi2017Praja1; Watabe2020Praja1). Additionally, PJA1 is involved in the regulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway, influencing cancer progression and response to therapy (Chen2020Targeting). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Suzuki2020A; Chen2020Dysregulated).

## Function
PJA1, or praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 1, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in protein ubiquitination, marking proteins for degradation by the proteasome. In healthy human cells, PJA1 is involved in several molecular processes and cellular functions. It is known to interact with the SMC5/6 complex, facilitating the binding of viral and episomal DNAs in the cell nucleus, which suggests its role in silencing extrachromosomal DNA and restricting DNA viruses in an interferon-independent manner (Xu2018PJA1).

PJA1 is also implicated in skeletal myogenesis by promoting muscle differentiation through the degradation of EZH2, a chromatin modifier. This process is essential for the progression of the myogenic program and is dependent on the activation of p38α kinase, which marks EZH2 for degradation (Consalvi2017Praja1).

In the brain, PJA1 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the aggregation of TDP-43, a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases. PJA1 binds to TDP-43 and the E2-conjugating enzyme UBE2E3, suppressing TDP-43 phosphorylation and aggregation, which is crucial for normal neuronal function (Watabe2020Praja1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PJA1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers. In neurodevelopmental disorders, a recurrent missense variant, c.1126C>T (p.Arg376Cys), in the PJA1 gene has been identified in patients with conditions such as trigonocephaly and epilepsy. This variant is associated with behavioral changes, social memory impairments, and increased seizure susceptibility in model organisms, suggesting its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Suzuki2020A).

In cancer, PJA1 expression levels are altered in several types. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PJA1 is overexpressed, which negatively regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and proliferation. Targeting PJA1 with specific inhibitors has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to restore tumor-suppressing functions (Chen2020Dysregulated; Chen2020Targeting). Conversely, in lung adenocarcinoma, PJA1 is underexpressed and acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting the degradation of FOXR2, with higher expression levels correlating with better patient prognosis (Luo2021E3). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, PJA1 contributes to chemotherapy resistance and reduced antitumor immunity by degrading PGAM5, which inhibits pyroptosis (Huang2024PJA1mediated).

## Interactions
PJA1, or praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 1, is known to participate in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. PJA1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2E3, suggesting a preferential partnership in the ubiquitination of TDP-43, a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This interaction is crucial for suppressing the phosphorylation and aggregate formation of TDP-43, particularly in neurons (Watabe2020Praja1).

PJA1 also interacts with the SMC5/6 complex, which is involved in chromosome maintenance and the restriction of DNA viruses. This interaction facilitates the binding of the SMC5/6 complex to viral and episomal DNA, thereby restricting DNA virus replication and episomal gene activation (Xu2018PJA1).

In the context of cancer, PJA1 interacts with phosphorylated SMAD3, a component of the TGFβ signaling pathway. This interaction promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of SMAD3, affecting the expression of several cancer-related genes and potentially modulating oncogenic processes (Chen2020Targeting).

PJA1 also interacts with Tau, a microtubule-associated protein linked to neurodegenerative diseases. PJA1 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of Tau, suggesting a role in regulating Tau stability (Aoki2024E3).
