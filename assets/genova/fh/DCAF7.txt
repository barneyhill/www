# DCAF7

## Overview
DCAF7 is a gene that encodes the protein DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 7, also known as WDR68 or HAN11. This protein is characterized by its WD40 repeat domains, which form a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, facilitating its role as a scaffold protein in various cellular processes (Yousefelahiyeh2018DCAF7WDR68; Kawara2019DCAF7). DCAF7 is integral to the DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it functions as an adaptor, influencing protein stability through ubiquitin-mediated pathways (Kawara2019DCAF7). It plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by promoting interactions between kinases such as DYRK1A and RNA Polymerase II, thereby impacting cell proliferation, differentiation, and myogenesis (Yu2019A). DCAF7's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in developmental pathways and cellular homeostasis.

## Structure
DCAF7, also known as WDR68 or HAN11, is a protein characterized by the presence of five WD40 repeats, which are motifs known to facilitate protein-protein interactions by forming a beta-propeller structure (Yousefelahiyeh2018DCAF7WDR68; Kawara2019DCAF7). This structure is typical of WD40 repeat domain-containing proteins and serves as a scaffolding element for the assembly of multi-subunit protein complexes (Yousefelahiyeh2018DCAF7WDR68). The tertiary structure of DCAF7 is described as a seven-blade beta-propeller, which is a common fold for proteins with WD40 repeats (Yousefelahiyeh2018DCAF7WDR68).

DCAF7 functions as an adaptor in the DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, implicating it in the ubiquitin-mediated regulation of protein stability (Kawara2019DCAF7). The protein's role in this complex suggests it may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its activity. Although the context does not provide specific details on the primary, secondary, or quaternary structures of DCAF7, its involvement in protein-protein interactions and molecular scaffolding is well-documented. The presence of splice variant isoforms of DCAF7 may result in different functional properties, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
DCAF7, also known as DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 7, functions as a scaffold protein that facilitates interactions between various proteins, playing a critical role in cellular processes. In human cells, DCAF7 promotes the interaction between DYRK1A, a kinase, and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), which is essential for DYRK1A's kinase and transcriptional activities. This interaction is crucial for transcriptional regulation and is enhanced by DCAF7, which acts as a scaffold to tether DYRK1A to Pol II (Yu2019A). DCAF7 is also involved in the regulation of DYRK1A and DYRK1B kinases, which are important for balancing cell proliferation and differentiation. It maintains normal levels of DYRK1A protein, which is significant for craniofacial development and the growth and patterning of multiple organ systems (Yousefelahiyeh2018DCAF7WDR68).

DCAF7's role extends to myogenesis, where it promotes the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes by facilitating the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of Pol II, thereby stimulating the transcription of myogenic genes (Yu2019A). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it coordinates signaling complexes and stabilizes protein interactions (Glenewinkel2016The; Xiang2017DYRK1A).

## Interactions
DCAF7, also known as WDR68, is a WD40 domain protein that acts as an adaptor, facilitating interactions with several proteins, notably DYRK1A and HIPK2. It forms a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, enabling diverse protein interactions (Glenewinkel2016The). DCAF7 mediates the interaction between the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein and protein kinases DYRK1A and HIPK2, crucial for modulating E1A's function in cell proliferation and transformation (Glenewinkel2016The). It binds to DYRK1A, DYRK1B, and HIPK2, but not to HIPK1, despite structural similarities between HIPK1 and HIPK2 (Glenewinkel2016The).

DCAF7's interaction with DYRK1A is independent of DYRK1A's kinase activity and involves a conserved 27 amino acid sequence in DYRK1A's N-terminal domain (Glenewinkel2016The). It also interacts with RNA Polymerase II, enhancing DYRK1A's binding to Pol II, which is crucial for DYRK1A's kinase and transcriptional activities (Yu2019A). DCAF7 interacts with the ERCC1-XPF complex, maintaining its cellular levels and stability, which is essential for nucleotide excision repair (Kawara2019DCAF7). Additionally, DCAF7 is involved in neurodevelopment, interacting with proteins like AUTS2 and SKI, and modulating DYRK1A's nuclear translocation (Wang2023A).
