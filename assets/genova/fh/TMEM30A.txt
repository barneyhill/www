# TMEM30A

## Overview
TMEM30A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 30A, a crucial component of the P4-ATPase flippase complex. This protein is integral to maintaining phospholipid asymmetry across cellular membranes, a function vital for various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking and membrane stability (Chen2023Knockdown; Yang2021The). TMEM30A is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is active in both the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles, where it plays a significant role in the transport of proteins and lipids, particularly between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane (Yang2021The). The protein's function is critical in several physiological contexts, such as insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells and photoreceptor cell integrity in the retina, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Zhang2017Loss; Yang2021The).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM30A is a crucial component of the P4-ATPase flippase complex, which is essential for maintaining phospholipid asymmetry in cell membranes. This protein facilitates the translocation of phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS), from the outer to the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, a process vital for cell membrane stability and vesicle formation (Chen2023Knockdown; Yang2021The). TMEM30A is active in the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles, where it plays a significant role in vesicular trafficking and protein transport, particularly between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane (Yang2021The).

In pancreatic β cells, TMEM30A is involved in insulin maturation and secretion. It regulates the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are crucial for insulin granule secretion and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (Yang2021The). TMEM30A also influences the function and expression of glucose transporters like Glut2, affecting glucose sensing and insulin secretion (Yang2021The).

In the retina, TMEM30A is essential for maintaining photoreceptor cell integrity by ensuring proper phospholipid distribution, which is critical for cell survival and function (Zhang2017Loss). Its deficiency can lead to photoreceptor degeneration, highlighting its importance in cellular processes and organismal homeostasis (Zhang2017Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM30A gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), TMEM30A is considered a putative tumor-suppressor gene. Loss-of-function mutations in TMEM30A, which are prevalent in 11% of DLBCL patients, often co-occur with hemizygous deletions or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity, leading to reduced gene expression. These mutations are associated with lymphomagenesis and present a potential therapeutic vulnerability in B-cell lymphoma (Ennishi2020TMEM30A).

In the context of neurological disorders, TMEM30A disruption in cerebellar Purkinje cells results in cerebellar ataxia and degeneration. This is likely due to the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent apoptosis of Purkinje cells, highlighting TMEM30A's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and survival (Yang2018Disruption).

TMEM30A also plays a critical role in insulin maturation and secretion. Conditional knockout of TMEM30A in pancreatic β cells leads to diabetes-like symptoms, including impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance. This suggests that TMEM30A is essential for proper insulin processing and that its deficiency can contribute to metabolic disorders resembling type 2 diabetes mellitus (Yang2021The).

## Interactions
TMEM30A interacts with the β-carboxyl-terminal fragments (βCTFs) of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) in endosomes. This interaction is crucial for the formation of abnormally enlarged endosomes, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. TMEM30A interacts with full-length APP and βCTFs, but not with αCTFs, indicating a specific interaction dependent on the presence of the Aβ N-terminal sequence (Takasugi2018TMEM30A).

TMEM30A also forms a complex with ATP8A1, a brain-enriched lipid flippase subunit, although the presence of ATP8A1 reduces interactions between TMEM30A and both full-length APP and βCTF, suggesting a complex formation independent of lipid flippase activity (Takasugi2018TMEM30A).

In the context of insulin maturation and secretion, TMEM30A interacts with P4-ATPases such as ATP8A1, ATP8B2, and ATP11A, which are crucial for vesicular trafficking and the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. This interaction is essential for maintaining phosphatidylserine asymmetry and proper insulin granule secretion from the trans-Golgi network (Yang2021The).

TMEM30A's interaction with P4-ATPases is also critical for photoreceptor cell survival and function, as its loss leads to severe retinal degeneration (Zhang2017Loss).
