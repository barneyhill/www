# OR1J1

## Overview
The OR1J1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily J member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transmits signals from the external environment to the inside of the cell, facilitating communication and response to olfactory stimuli. The OR1J1 gene is one of many olfactory receptor genes, which together form the largest gene family in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the olfactory system (Qiu2020aarFDC).
