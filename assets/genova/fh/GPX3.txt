# GPX3

## Overview
Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) is a gene that encodes the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 3, a member of the glutathione peroxidase family of antioxidant enzymes. This enzyme is characterized by its extracellular activity and the presence of selenocysteine, a rare amino acid that is crucial for its catalytic function. GPX3 plays a significant role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, thus maintaining cellular redox balance and preventing oxidative stress-related damage. It is particularly important in modulating platelet function and thrombosis, as well as in muscle regeneration and metabolic regulation. The gene is primarily expressed in the kidney, and its protein product is secreted into the plasma, where it exerts its antioxidant effects (Ottaviano2009Regulation; BrigeliusFlohé2013Glutathione; Jin2011Glutathione).

## Structure
The human GPX3 protein is a glycosylated member of the glutathione peroxidase family, characterized by its unique extracellular presence and glycosylation among selenium-containing GPx isoforms (Song2014Unglycosylated). The primary structure of GPX3 includes the incorporation of selenocysteine, encoded by a UGA codon, which is typically a stop signal but is recognized as selenocysteine through a specific mechanism involving a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) (Ottaviano2009Regulation; Song2014Unglycosylated).

The protein forms a homotetramer in its native state, with each subunit having a molecular weight of approximately 23 kDa (Song2014Unglycosylated). The crystal structure reveals that each subunit contains a selenocysteine residue located in a pocket on the protein surface, forming a catalytic tetrad with Gln-87, Trp-161, and Asn-162, which is highly conserved in the selenium-dependent GPx family (Song2014Unglycosylated). The quaternary structure as a tetramer is crucial for its enzymatic function, although recombinant forms expressed in E. coli may exist as monomers due to the absence of glycosylation and disulfide bridges (Song2014Unglycosylated). GPX3 is synthesized in the kidney and secreted into the plasma, where it functions as an antioxidant enzyme (BrigeliusFlohé2013Glutathione).

## Function
Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx-3) is a selenocysteine-containing enzyme that plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and corresponding alcohols. It is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it helps maintain redox balance and supports cellular health by preventing oxidative stress-related damage (Ottaviano2009Regulation). GPx-3 is crucial for modulating platelet function and thrombosis by limiting the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can enhance platelet activation and aggregation. By maintaining the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), GPx-3 inhibits platelet activation and aggregation, thus playing a protective role against thrombosis (Jin2011Glutathione).

In human skeletal muscle precursor cells, GPx-3 is identified as a retinoid-responsive gene that mediates the antioxidant effects of retinoic acid (RA), enhancing cell survival by scavenging ROS and reducing cell death. This function is particularly important in the context of muscle regeneration and repair (El2012Glutathione). GPx-3 also interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in muscle cells, where it helps regulate oxidative stress and insulin signaling, suggesting its involvement in metabolic regulation (Chung2009Glutathione).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GPX3 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In kidney diseases such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), GPX3 is downregulated, contributing to increased oxidative stress and disease progression. Upregulating GPX3 can mitigate oxidative stress and renal injury, while its knockdown exacerbates kidney fibrosis (Zhang2024Insights). In cardiovascular diseases, decreased GPX3 activity is associated with increased mortality, particularly in individuals with low HDL levels. GPX3 is involved in regulating autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses, with its deficiency linked to increased platelet activation and vascular dysfunction (Zhang2024Insights).

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), GPX3 expression is altered, with decreased levels in the brain associated with disease progression. The GPX3-TNIP1 locus has been identified as a risk factor for ALS, with changes in GPX3 expression potentially serving as a biomarker for disease progression (Benyamin2017Crossethnic; Restuadi2022Functional). In cancer, GPX3 expression is generally downregulated in several types, including breast, colon, and lung cancers. High GPX3 expression is associated with poor overall survival in certain cancers, suggesting its role in cancer progression and patient outcomes (Hu2023GPX3).
