# ADORA2A

## Overview
The ADORA2A gene encodes the adenosine A2A receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to numerous physiological processes. This receptor is primarily involved in modulating neurotransmission and immune responses, playing a pivotal role in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. The adenosine A2A receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitate its interaction with various ligands and G proteins (Fredholm2000Structure; Furlong1992Molecular). The receptor's activity is crucial in regulating cardiovascular functions, influencing sleep, and modulating responses to caffeine, among other roles (Fredholm2011International; Rétey2007A). Additionally, the ADORA2A gene is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Hohoff2010Adenosine; Huin2019Neurogenetics).

## Structure
The ADORA2A gene encodes the adenosine A2A receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. The primary structure of the receptor consists of a polypeptide chain of 412 amino acids (Furlong1992Molecular). The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of transmembrane alpha helices, typical of GPCRs, which facilitate its function as a receptor (Furlong1992Molecular). 

The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the cell membrane, allowing the receptor to interact with ligands and G proteins. The receptor is known to couple with different G proteins, such as Gs proteins in peripheral tissues and Golf proteins in the striatum, indicating its versatile signaling capabilities (Fredholm2000Structure).

Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, are common and can influence the receptor's function and signaling pathways (DíazMuñoz2022Structure–activity). The ADORA2A gene also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants that may contribute to tissue-specific expression and functional diversity (Yu2004Characterization). These structural features underscore the receptor's complexity and its critical role in cellular signaling.

## Function
The ADORA2A gene encodes the adenosine A2A receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, the A2A receptor is primarily involved in modulating immune responses and protecting tissues from excessive inflammatory damage. It achieves this by elevating cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels upon activation by extracellular adenosine, which accumulates during inflammation. This increase in cAMP leads to immunosuppressive signaling, downregulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines and thus preventing tissue damage (Ohta2001Role; Lukashev2003Analysis).

In the central nervous system, the A2A receptor is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the striatum, where it modulates neurotransmission. It interacts with dopamine D2 receptors, influencing motor control and behavior, and is involved in fine-tuning glutamatergic neurotransmission, which is significant for both physiological and pathological states (Fredholm2011International; Wei2011Normal). The receptor's activity in the cell membrane impacts cardiovascular and central nervous systems, contributing to vasodilation and influencing sleep regulation by modulating responses to caffeine (Fredholm2011International; Rétey2007A).

## Clinical Significance
The ADORA2A gene, encoding the adenosine A2A receptor, is implicated in several psychiatric and neurological disorders. Variants in ADORA2A have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), where specific genotypes are linked to increased social interaction, nonverbal communication, and repetitive behavior scores. A haplotype of eight SNPs, including rs5751876, is associated with anxiety in ASD patients (Huin2019Neurogenetics).

In panic disorder (PD), the rs5751876 T-allele is overrepresented and linked to higher anxiety-related personality traits. This variant is particularly associated with PD with agoraphobia and higher harm avoidance scores (Hohoff2010Adenosine). The ADORA2A gene is also linked to depression, where the rs2298383 TT genotype is associated with a reduced risk of depression and fewer sleep disturbances (Oliveira2018Impact).

In schizophrenia, certain ADORA2A SNPs, such as rs2298383T/C, are more frequent in affected individuals, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Miao2019&lt; p&gt; Association). The gene is also implicated in neurological conditions like Huntington's disease, where the rs5751876 TT genotype is associated with an earlier onset (Huin2019Neurogenetics).

## Interactions
The adenosine A2A receptor (ADORA2A) is known to interact with several proteins, playing significant roles in various physiological processes. One notable interaction is with the GPR37 receptor, which is associated with Parkinson's disease. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments. The co-expression of ADORA2A with GPR37 enhances the expression of GPR37, suggesting a chaperone-like function of ADORA2A. This interaction is specific, as ADORA2A does not enhance GPR37 expression when co-expressed with ADORA1, a related adenosine receptor. The ADORA2A/GPR37 interaction was validated in native tissue, specifically in the mouse striatum, and was shown to affect dopamine-mediated psychomotor behavior (Sokolina2017Systematic).

ADORA2A also interacts with dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) in brain regions such as the striatum, which are involved in locomotor activity. This interaction may play a critical role in D2R/ADORA2A-mediated psychomotor behavior, potentially functioning as a homeostatic regulator of dopaminergic/adenosinergic transmission in vivo (Sokolina2017Systematic). These interactions highlight the potential biological significance of ADORA2A in modulating signaling pathways and influencing neurological functions.
