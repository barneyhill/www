# SCAND1

## Overview
SCAND1 (SCAN domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily through its role in forming transcriptional repressor complexes. The SCAND1 protein is characterized by the presence of a SCAN domain, a leucine-rich oligomerization domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, particularly with other SCAN domain-containing proteins. Unlike other members of the SCAN-ZF family, SCAND1 lacks zinc finger motifs, classifying it as a SCAN domain-only protein. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lipid metabolism, through its interactions with nuclear receptors and other transcription factors. SCAND1's expression and function have significant implications in cancer biology, where it can act as a tumor suppressor by maintaining epithelial integrity and repressing oncogenic pathways (Collins2005The; Eguchi2019SCAND1; Eguchi2022SCAND1).

## Structure
SCAND1 is a protein characterized by the presence of a SCAN domain, which is a leucine-rich oligomerization domain highly conserved among the SCAN-ZF family. This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly in forming complexes with other SCAN domain-containing proteins, such as MZF1 (Sheta2023StressInducible; Eguchi2019SCAND1). The SCAN domain facilitates selective dimerization, which is crucial for the protein's function in transcriptional repression (Nam2004Structural).

SCAND1 is a SCAN domain-only protein, meaning it lacks the zinc finger motifs typically found in other members of the SCAN-ZF family (Eguchi2019SCAND1). The SCAN domain itself is composed of a core structure of three alpha helices, which are essential for its dimerization properties (Nam2004Structural). The amino-terminal helix of the SCAN domain is particularly important for determining dimerization selectivity, as it contains critical surface-exposed binding residues (Nam2004Structural).

While specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SCAND1 are not provided, the protein's role in forming repressive chromatin structures and its interaction with other proteins suggest a complex structural organization (Eguchi2022SCAND1). There is no detailed information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for SCAND1 in the provided context.

## Function
SCAND1 (SCAN domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily active in the nucleus. The SCAND1 protein is part of the SCAN domain-containing protein family, which facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for forming transcriptional regulatory complexes (Collins2005The). In healthy human cells, SCAND1 is highly expressed in tissues such as the prostate, liver, lung, thyroid, and heart, where it is associated with maintaining epithelial characteristics (Eguchi2022SCAND1).

SCAND1 interacts with the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy), enhancing PPARy-dependent gene expression, which is important for adipogenesis and lipid metabolism (Collins2005The). It also interacts with other SCAN domain proteins like MZF1, forming complexes that can repress the transcription of genes such as CDC37, which is involved in cell proliferation and cancer progression (Eguchi2019MZF1; Eguchi2019SCAND1).

SCAND1 plays a role in maintaining epithelial integrity by reversing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to cancer metastasis. It achieves this by promoting the expression of epithelial markers like E-cadherin and inhibiting mesenchymal markers, thus supporting epithelial cell morphology and function (Eguchi2022SCAND1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SCAND1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, SCAND1 expression is reduced, which is associated with the promotion of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Overexpression of SCAND1 in prostate cancer cells has been shown to reverse EMT, inhibit tumor growth, and reduce migration, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Eguchi2022SCAND1). SCAND1 interacts with MZF1 to form complexes that repress the expression of EMT driver genes and oncogenic signaling pathways, such as the MAPK-ERK pathway, which are crucial for cancer progression (Eguchi2022SCAND1).

In other cancer types, high expression levels of SCAND1 are associated with better prognoses. For instance, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, elevated SCAND1 expression correlates with improved outcomes (Sheta2023StressInducible). Conversely, in kidney cancer, high SCAND1 expression is linked to poorer prognosis, indicating that its role may vary depending on the cancer type (Eguchi2022SCAND1).

Overall, SCAND1's involvement in cancer appears to be multifaceted, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts while its prognostic significance varies across different cancer types (Sheta2023StressInducible; Eguchi2022SCAND1).

## Interactions
SCAND1, a member of the SCAN domain-containing protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence transcriptional regulation. It interacts with MZF1 (ZSCAN6), a SCAN-zinc finger transcription factor, to form a transcriptional repressor complex. This interaction is significant in prostate cancer, where SCAND1 and MZF1 oligomerize and bind to the CDC37 gene promoter region, repressing its transcription and potentially suppressing tumorigenicity (Eguchi2019MZF1; Eguchi2022SCAND1). SCAND1 and MZF1 are mutually inducible, meaning the overexpression of one leads to increased expression of the other, and they co-localize in the nuclei of cancer cells (Eguchi2022SCAND1).

SCAND1 also interacts with heterochromatin protein 1γ (HP1γ), suggesting its involvement in heterochromatin formation, a form of repressive chromatin (Eguchi2022SCAND1). Additionally, SCAND1 interacts with the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), enhancing PPARγ-dependent gene expression, which is important for lipid metabolism (Collins2005The). These interactions highlight SCAND1's role in modulating gene expression through complex formation and chromatin interactions, impacting processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression (Eguchi2022SCAND1).
