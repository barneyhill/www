# DGKZ

## Overview
Diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKZ) is a gene that encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKζ), which is a member of the kinase family involved in lipid signaling pathways. DGKζ plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by converting diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic acid (PA), both of which are critical lipid second messengers. This enzymatic activity is essential for modulating various cellular processes, including immune responses, cell proliferation, and cytoskeletal reorganization. DGKζ is particularly significant in the regulation of T-cell receptor signaling and innate immune responses, where it influences pathways such as Ras, ERK, and AP-1 (Joshi2013Diacylglycerol; Mérida2007Diacylglycerol). The protein's structure includes domains that facilitate its interaction with lipid substrates and its localization to cellular membranes, which are crucial for its function. DGKZ has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels correlate with tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Ma2024DGKZ).

## Structure
DGKZ (diacylglycerol kinase zeta) is an enzyme characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in lipid signaling. The protein contains a catalytic domain responsible for the phosphorylation of diacylglycerol to produce phosphatidic acid. This catalytic activity is central to its role in cellular signaling pathways. DGKZ also includes C1 domains, which are crucial for diacylglycerol binding, facilitating its interaction with lipid substrates. Additionally, the presence of a PH domain allows for membrane association, which is essential for its localization and function within the cell.

Post-translational modifications of DGKZ may include phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions. These modifications are important for the dynamic regulation of the enzyme's function in response to cellular signals. DGKZ is known to have splice variants, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functions or regulatory properties. These isoforms allow for a diversity of functions and regulatory mechanisms, enabling the enzyme to participate in various cellular processes. The structural features and modifications of DGKZ highlight its complex role in lipid signaling and its adaptability to different cellular contexts.

## Function
Diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKζ) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating diacylglycerol (DAG) levels by phosphorylating it to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), both of which are important lipid signaling molecules. In T cells, DGKζ is involved in the regulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, where it helps to modulate the activation response by attenuating DAG levels, thereby influencing the activation of Ras, ERK, and AP-1 pathways (Joshi2013Diacylglycerol; Mérida2007Diacylglycerol). This regulation is essential for maintaining the threshold of T cell activation and preventing excessive immune responses (Joshi2013Diacylglycerol).

DGKζ is also involved in the adaptive and innate immune responses. It negatively regulates TCR signaling by interacting with RasGRP1, which attenuates the Ras-Erk1/2-AP1 pathway, thus preventing overactivation of immune responses (Zhong2008Diacylglycerol). In the innate immune system, DGKζ acts as a positive modulator of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in macrophages, influencing the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol).

DGKζ is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it regulates DAG levels and affects cell cycle dynamics. Its activity is modulated by receptor signals, and it translocates to membranes upon activation (Shulga2011Regulation; Mérida2007Diacylglycerol). This enzyme is crucial for maintaining normal cell proliferation and preventing excessive cell transformation by regulating DAG levels and signaling pathways (Shulga2011Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DGKZ gene have been implicated in various cancers. In bladder cancer, DGKZ expression is upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis. The gene promotes tumor progression by modulating phosphatidic acid biosynthesis through the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and its interaction with the CEBPZ protein is crucial for this process (Ma2024DGKZ). High DGKZ expression is also associated with poor outcomes in osteosarcoma and triple-negative breast cancer, where it enhances TGFβ signaling and metastasis (Ma2024DGKZ). In cervical cancer, downregulation of DGKZ inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, while in glioblastoma, increased DGKZ levels are linked to enhanced cell proliferation and metastasis (Ma2024DGKZ).

In lung cancer, DGKZ interacts with ERK3, acting as a negative regulator of ERK3-mediated cell motility. This interaction suggests that DGKZ can inhibit lung cancer cell migration and invasion, potentially impacting cancer progression (Myers2023ERK3). These findings highlight DGKZ as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers due to its role in promoting tumor progression and metastasis.

## Interactions
Diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKZ) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. DGKZ interacts with Rac1, PAK1, and RhoGDI, forming a complex crucial for actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Upon stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), DGKZ produces phosphatidic acid (PA), which activates PAK1. Activated PAK1 phosphorylates RhoGDI, leading to the release of Rac1, which then interacts with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and effectors at the plasma membrane (ard2012regulation).

DGKZ also interacts with RhoA and PKCα, forming a signaling complex that regulates RhoA activation and actin reorganization. This interaction is essential for the phosphorylation of RhoGDI by PKCα, facilitating the release and activation of RhoA from RhoGDI (ard2012regulation). DGKZ binds directly to RhoA, enhancing the interaction between PKCα and RhoA, and acts as a scaffold in these signaling complexes (ard2012regulation).

In bladder cancer cells, DGKZ interacts with the CEBPZ protein, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. This interaction is dependent on the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of DGKZ and is involved in modulating phosphatidic acid biosynthesis via the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Ma2024DGKZ).
