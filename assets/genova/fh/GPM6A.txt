# GPM6A

## Overview
GPM6A is a gene that encodes the glycoprotein M6A, a member of the tetraspan proteolipid protein family, which is characterized by its four transmembrane domains. Glycoprotein M6A is predominantly expressed in neurons within the central nervous system and plays a significant role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. It is involved in critical processes such as neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and the maintenance of synaptic plasticity, largely through its interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and various signaling pathways (Formoso2014Tyrosine; León2021Neuronal). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and palmitoylation, which are essential for its localization in lipid rafts and its role in signal transduction (Ito2018Glycoprotein; León2021Neuronal). Alterations in GPM6A expression have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cognitive and emotional functions (Yunaini2022Association; Gregor2014AlteredGPM6AM6Dosage).

## Structure
The GPM6A gene encodes the glycoprotein M6A, a member of the tetraspan proteolipid protein family. This protein is characterized by four transmembrane domains (TMDs), two extracellular loops (EC1 and EC2), and one intracellular loop, with both the N- and C-termini facing the cytoplasmic side (Formoso2016Evidence; León2021Neuronal). The EC2 loop contains four cysteine residues, with C174 and C192 forming a disulfide bond crucial for protein-protein interactions (León2021Neuronal). 

M6A undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and palmitoylation. It has seven potential phosphorylation sites, some of which are essential for its function, and seven potential palmitoylation sites near the TMDs, with three (C17/18/21) necessary for its inclusion in lipid rafts (León2021Neuronal). The EC2 loop also has two predicted N-glycosylation sites, with glycosylation at N164 experimentally confirmed (León2021Neuronal).

The C-terminal cytosolic end of GPM6A is critical for filopodium formation, with key residues such as K250, K255, and E258 identified as essential for this process (Rosas2018Alanine). These residues are involved in clathrin-mediated trafficking events and may interact with proteins regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Rosas2018Alanine).

## Function
The GPM6A gene encodes the glycoprotein M6A, which is integral to neuronal development and plasticity. M6A is a four-transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in neurons of the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, and prefrontal cortex (León2021Neuronal). It plays a crucial role in neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and the maintenance of synaptic plasticity (Formoso2014Tyrosine; León2021Neuronal).

M6A is involved in the formation of filopodia, which are essential for neurite extension and synaptogenesis. The protein facilitates the outgrowth of neurites and the formation of filopodia and spines, which are precursors to dendritic spines critical for excitatory synapses (Rosas2018Alanine; Alfonso2005The). M6A's function in filopodia formation involves interactions with actin regulators such as Coronin 1a and the Rac1/Pak1 signaling pathway (Alvarez2016Neuronal).

M6A is localized in lipid rafts, which are microdomains of the plasma membrane, and is involved in signal transduction processes that influence neuronal polarity and differentiation (Ito2018Glycoprotein). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and palmitoylation, which are crucial for its localization and function in the cell (Ito2018Glycoprotein; León2021Neuronal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPM6A gene have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric conditions. A de novo duplication of GPM6A has been associated with learning disabilities and behavioral anomalies, indicating that increased expression levels can lead to cognitive impairments (Gregor2014AlteredGPM6AM6Dosage). This duplication results in increased membrane protrusions in patient-derived cells, which can be partially alleviated by cholesterol supplementation, suggesting a role for cholesterol in modulating these phenotypes (Gregor2014AlteredGPM6AM6Dosage).

GPM6A has also been implicated in mood disorders. Variants in the gene are associated with schizophrenia, claustrophobia, and bipolar disorders (Formoso2015Filopodia). Specifically, the rs13142920 polymorphism in GPM6A has been linked to an increased risk of paranoid schizophrenia, with certain genotypes showing a higher risk compared to others (Yunaini2022Association). Additionally, GPM6A is associated with a depression subgroup within the schizophrenia phenotype, highlighting its potential role in mood symptoms (Boks2008Do).

The gene's expression is downregulated in the hippocampus of depressed suicide victims, and chronic stress can alter its expression levels, which can be counteracted by antidepressants (Rosas2018Alanine). These findings underscore the importance of GPM6A in the regulation of the central nervous system and its involvement in stress-related psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
GPM6A, or glycoprotein M6A, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neuronal development and plasticity. It interacts with the μ-opioid receptor (MOPr), facilitating receptor endocytosis and recycling. This interaction is specific to certain transmembrane domains of both proteins and does not affect MOPr binding (Wu2007Membrane). GPM6A also interacts with other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the δ-opioid receptor, cannabinoid receptor CB1, and somatostatin receptor sst2A, suggesting a broader role in GPCR regulation (Wu2007Membrane).

In the synaptic context, GPM6A interacts with synaptic proteins like piccolo, synaptic vesicle protein 2B, and synapsin 1, which are primarily located in the presynaptic compartment. These interactions are important for synaptic function and are implicated in neurological disorders (Aparicio2020Identification). GPM6A also associates with proteins involved in synapse formation and maintenance, such as synaptophysin, and is involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle recycling (León2021Neuronal). Additionally, GPM6A interacts with cytoskeletal regulators like coronin-1A, which facilitates filopodium formation through pathways involving Rac1 and Pak1 (Alvarez2016Neuronal).
