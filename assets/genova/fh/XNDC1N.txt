# XNDC1N

## Overview
XNDC1N is a gene that encodes the XRCC1 N-terminal domain containing 1, N-terminal like protein, which is implicated in DNA repair processes. This protein is categorized as a DNA repair protein and is involved in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the repair of single-strand breaks in DNA. The XNDC1N protein is believed to modulate the activity of XRCC1, a critical component of the DNA repair machinery, thereby playing a significant role in preserving DNA integrity within the cell nucleus. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including fat, liver, and pancreas, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes pertinent to these tissues. Mutations in XNDC1N have been linked to an increased risk of diabetes mellitus in childhood cancer survivors, highlighting its clinical significance in genetic risk assessment and disease prevention strategies (Im2023Transancestral).

## Function
The XNDC1N gene encodes a protein involved in DNA repair processes, specifically predicted to encode XRCC1 N-terminal domain-like proteins. These proteins play a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the repair of single-strand breaks in DNA. The XNDC1N protein is thought to modulate the activity of XRCC1, a well-known DNA repair protein, thereby contributing to the overall function of DNA repair mechanisms in the cell (Im2023Transancestral).

In healthy human cells, the XNDC1N protein is active in the cell nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins in the DNA repair pathway. This interaction is essential for preserving DNA integrity, which supports normal cellular function and organismal health. The protein's activity in the nucleus ensures that DNA damage is efficiently repaired, preventing mutations that could lead to cellular dysfunction or disease (Im2023Transancestral).

The transcription of the XNDC1N locus in tissues such as fat, liver, and pancreas suggests its involvement in cellular processes relevant to these tissues, although its specific role in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated (Im2023Transancestral).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the XNDC1N gene have been associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) in survivors of childhood cancer. A study identified XNDC1N as a novel potential DM risk locus, with a significant pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant burden linked to DM risk. This association was confirmed in both discovery and replication cohorts, achieving genome-wide significance in combined data. Individuals carrying XNDC1N pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were found to have significantly higher odds of developing DM (Im2023Transancestral).

Functional annotations suggest that rare pathogenic alleles of XNDC1N are protein-truncating variants that overlap transcribed regions in the fat, liver, and pancreas epigenomes. These mutations may disrupt normal protein function, contributing to increased DM susceptibility among childhood cancer survivors (Im2023Transancestral). The gene is predicted to encode XRCC1 N-terminal domain-like proteins, which are involved in DNA repair processes. Alterations in these proteins could impair DNA repair, potentially leading to increased disease susceptibility (Im2023Transancestral).

The study highlights the clinical significance of XNDC1N mutations in increasing DM risk, particularly in the context of childhood cancer survivorship, and underscores the need for precision diabetes surveillance tailored to genetic risk factors (Im2023Transancestral).
