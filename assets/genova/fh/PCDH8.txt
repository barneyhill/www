# PCDH8

## Overview
PCDH8 is a gene that encodes the protein protocadherin 8, a member of the non-clustered protocadherin family within the cadherin superfamily. Protocadherin 8 is a transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion and signaling, influencing neural circuit formation and function. The protein is characterized by its six extracellular cadherin (EC) domain repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a unique cytoplasmic tail, which suggests distinct interactions with cytoplasmic proteins (Strehl1998Characterization; Harrison2020Familywide). PCDH8 is involved in various cellular processes, including synaptic function, cell motility, and cytoskeletal organization, through its interactions with other cadherins and signaling pathways (Weiner2013Protocadherins; Hayashi2015Emerging). Additionally, PCDH8 has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression and regulation can influence tumor progression and prognosis (Yang2024PCDH8; ZHANG2012Frequent).

## Structure
The PCDH8 gene encodes a protein that is part of the protocadherin subfamily within the cadherin superfamily. The primary structure of PCDH8 consists of 936 amino acids, with a methionine start codon at nucleotide 204 and a stop codon at nucleotide 3012 (Strehl1998Characterization). The protein features six extracellular cadherin (EC) domain repeats, a signal sequence, and a transmembrane domain. Each EC repeat has distinct features, such as the presence of conserved motifs like the DXNDNXPXF motif, although some variations occur, such as the replacement of asparagine with histidine in certain domains (Strehl1998Characterization).

The secondary structure includes a 23-amino-acid hydrophobic segment characteristic of membrane-spanning domains (Strehl1998Characterization). The tertiary structure involves a linear arrangement of the six EC domains with canonical calcium binding, as observed in crystal structures (Harrison2020Familywide). The cytoplasmic tail of PCDH8 is unique and does not show significant homology with other cadherin-related proteins, suggesting distinct interactions with cytoplasmic proteins (Strehl1998Characterization).

PCDH8 does not form higher-order oligomers in solution, indicating that its quaternary structure is limited to dimerization, which is sufficient for cell surface adhesion (Harrison2020Familywide). The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (Strehl1998Characterization).

## Function
Protocadherin 8 (PCDH8) is a member of the non-clustered protocadherin family, primarily expressed in the central nervous system. It plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion and signaling, influencing neural circuit formation and function. PCDH8 is involved in modulating cell adhesion and motility by interacting with classical cadherins, such as N-cadherin, and inducing its endocytosis through a pathway involving TAO2β kinase and p38 MAPK (Kim2011Nonclustered; Weiner2013Protocadherins). This interaction suggests a regulatory role in synaptic function and cell adhesion processes.

PCDH8 also interacts with the WAVE complex, which regulates actin dynamics and cell motility, indicating its involvement in cytoskeletal organization and cell migration (Hayashi2015Emerging). In the context of brain development, PCDH8 is implicated in maintaining cell identity and organization, particularly through its interaction with the transcription factor Dbx1, affecting neuronal identity and cortical development (Cwetsch2023Bidirectional).

Additionally, PCDH8 is expressed in the paraxial mesoderm during embryonic development, where it regulates cell sorting and convergent extension by modulating C-cadherin activity, crucial for normal gastrulation (Hayashi2015Emerging). These functions highlight PCDH8's role in both neural and developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
PCDH8 (protocadherin 8) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and promoter methylation. In thyroid cancer, PCDH8 is overexpressed, correlating with poorer progression-free intervals and suggesting its role in promoting tumor progression and immune escape (Yang2024PCDH8). In contrast, PCDH8 acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, where its expression is frequently silenced by promoter methylation. This silencing is reversible with demethylating agents, which restore PCDH8 expression and inhibit cancer cell migration and proliferation (ZHANG2012Frequent).

In prostate cancer, PCDH8 is often inactivated by promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with reduced expression and poorer prognosis (Zhang2017Association). Similarly, in bladder cancer, PCDH8 promoter methylation is linked to advanced disease stages and shorter survival times, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Lin2013Clinical).

In breast cancer, PCDH8 is suppressed by estrogen in ERα-positive cells, contributing to increased cell proliferation and migration, which aligns with its role as a tumor suppressor (Kumar2019Estrogen). These findings highlight the diverse roles of PCDH8 in cancer, depending on the context of its expression and regulation.

## Interactions
PCDH8, also known as protocadherin 8, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular adhesion and signaling. It has been shown to interact with N-cadherin, a classical cadherin, in hippocampal neurons. This interaction leads to the internalization of N-cadherin, reducing its presence at synaptic junctions and affecting cell adhesion. The process is mediated by a pathway involving TAO2β kinase and p38 MAPK (Weiner2013Protocadherins). PCDH8 does not function as a cell adhesion molecule independently but modulates adhesion through its interactions with other cadherins (Weiner2013Protocadherins).

PCDH8 is also implicated in synapse disassembly by promoting the internalization of N-cadherin through receptor-mediated endocytosis, which destabilizes synaptic connections (Light2017δProtocadherins:). In the context of cerebral cortex development, PCDH8 interacts with the transcription factor Dbx1, forming a bidirectional regulatory mechanism that influences cell aggregation and neuronal differentiation. This interaction involves the repression of Notch1 signaling ligands, such as Jag1 and Dll1, suggesting a role in neuronal differentiation (Cwetsch2023Bidirectional). These interactions highlight PCDH8's role in modulating cell adhesion and signaling pathways, contributing to its function in neural development and cancer progression.
