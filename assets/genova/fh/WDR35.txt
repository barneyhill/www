# WDR35

## Overview
WDR35 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 35 protein, a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-A complex. This protein is characterized by the presence of multiple WD repeats, which form a β-propeller structure facilitating protein-protein interactions. WDR35 plays a significant role in the retrograde transport of proteins within cilia, essential for maintaining ciliary function and structure. It is involved in the localization and function of key signaling components, such as those in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, and is critical for the recruitment of the EVC complex and Smoothened into the ciliary compartment. Mutations in the WDR35 gene are linked to several ciliopathies, including Sensenbrenner syndrome and short-rib polydactyly syndrome, highlighting its importance in human health and development (Sekiguchi2021WDR35; Mill2011Human; Quidwai2021A).

## Structure
WDR35, also known as IFT121, is a protein characterized by the presence of multiple WD repeats, which are short structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These repeats typically form a β-propeller structure, a common feature among WD-repeat proteins, providing a stable scaffold for interactions with other proteins (Smith1999The; Li2001Human). The β-propeller structure is composed of several blades, each formed by a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Schapira2017WD40).

WDR35 is part of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, specifically the IFT-A complex, which is crucial for retrograde transport to the ciliary base. This role is significant in the context of ciliary function, as WDR35 is involved in the subcellular localization of acetylated tubulin in primary cilia (Sekiguchi2021WDR35). The protein interacts with components of the CCT complex, which assists in the folding of α-tubulin, indicating its involvement in protein folding processes (Sekiguchi2021WDR35).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in WDR35, influencing its function and interactions. Variants in WDR35 have been linked to genetic disorders like Sensenbrenner syndrome, highlighting its importance in human health (Sekiguchi2021WDR35).

## Function
The WDR35 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-A complex, which is essential for the formation and function of cilia in human cells (Sekiguchi2021WDR35; Quidwai2021A). WDR35 is involved in retrograde transport within cilia, a process necessary for the proper localization and function of key signaling components, such as the Gli transcription factors involved in Hedgehog signaling (Mill2011Human). The protein is active in the ciliary axoneme and basal body, contributing to the dynamic movement of multiprotein complexes along the axoneme (Mill2011Human).

In healthy cells, WDR35 is essential for the recruitment and localization of the EVC complex and Smoothened (SMO) into the ciliary compartment, which is critical for ciliary function (CaparrósMartín2015Specific). It also plays a role in the transport of ciliary membrane cargo vesicles from the Golgi to the cilia, acting similarly to a coatomer complex that facilitates vesicular transport (Quidwai2020A). The absence of WDR35 leads to defects in cilia formation and function, resulting in ciliopathies that affect multiple organ systems (Mill2011Human; Quidwai2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR35 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in cilia structure or function. These mutations can lead to conditions such as Sensenbrenner syndrome, also known as cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED), characterized by craniofacial, skeletal, and ectodermal abnormalities (Walczak‐Sztulpa2021Interfamilial; Gilissen2010Exome). WDR35 mutations are also linked to short-rib polydactyly syndrome (SRP), Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD), and Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EVC), which present with skeletal defects, such as rib and limb deformities, and can involve multiple organ dysfunctions (Hu2019Downregulated; Mill2011Human).

The gene plays a crucial role in cilia formation, and its down-regulation can impair cilia formation and disrupt Gli signaling, negatively affecting osteogenic differentiation (Hu2019Downregulated). Variants in WDR35 can lead to a range of phenotypes, from severe developmental defects to milder presentations, depending on the specific mutation and its impact on ciliary function (Mill2011Human; Smith2015A). The variability in phenotypic expression suggests that other genetic and non-genetic factors may influence the clinical presentation of WDR35-related disorders (Walczak‐Sztulpa2021Interfamilial).

## Interactions
WDR35, also known as IFT121, is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex A and plays a crucial role in ciliary function. It interacts with several proteins, forming part of a novel coatomer complex essential for the transport of ciliary membrane proteins from the Golgi to the cilia. WDR35 is structurally similar to coatomer COPI proteins, suggesting its involvement in vesicular trafficking and membrane remodeling (Quidwai2020A; Quidwai2021A).

WDR35 is critical for the stability of the IFT-A complex, interacting with core and peripheral components such as IFT122, IFT139, and IFT43. Its absence leads to the degradation of peripheral components and the accumulation of core components at the transition zone (Quidwai2020A; Quidwai2021A). WDR35 also interacts with RagA, a protein involved in mTORC1 signaling, suggesting a regulatory role in mTORC1 activity and primary cilia formation (Sekiguchi2019RagA).

Additionally, WDR35 is associated with the CCT complex, particularly TCP1, which is involved in protein folding. This interaction may influence the localization of acetylated tubulin in primary cilia (Sekiguchi2021WDR35). These interactions highlight WDR35's multifaceted role in ciliary transport and cellular signaling pathways.
