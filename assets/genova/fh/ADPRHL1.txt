# ADPRHL1

## Overview
ADPRHL1, or ADP-ribosylhydrolase-like 1, is a gene that encodes a pseudoenzyme protein belonging to the ADP-ribosylhydrolase family. Despite its classification as a pseudoenzyme due to the absence of key catalytic residues, the ADPRHL1 protein plays a significant structural role in cardiac muscle development. It is primarily involved in the assembly of myofibrils and the growth of heart chambers, contributing to the structural organization of cardiac muscle tissue. The protein localizes to cardiac sarcomeres, particularly near the Z-disc and H-zone, where it interacts with actin filaments, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and ensuring proper myofibril alignment within cardiomyocytes. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the heart during development (Smith2020Defective; Smith2016The). Additionally, ADPRHL1 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including heart defects and prostate cancer risk, highlighting its broader biological significance (Smith2020Defective; Zhang2022A).

## Structure
The ADPRHL1 protein is a member of the ADP-ribosylhydrolase family, but it is classified as a pseudoenzyme due to the absence of key catalytic residues necessary for enzymatic activity. The protein lacks several critical aspartate residues and other amino acids essential for ADP-ribose binding, which are present in related enzymes like ADPRH (Smith2020Defective; Smith2016The). 

The primary structure of ADPRHL1 includes a sequence that is highly conserved across vertebrates, with significant sequence identity to human ADPRH (Smith2016The). The secondary structure features include two antiparallel α-helices encoded by exon 3, connected by an extended loop (Smith2020Defective). 

In terms of tertiary structure, the protein's model suggests a substrate binding cleft that is crucial for its role in heart development, despite its lack of catalytic activity (Smith2020Defective). The protein localizes to cardiac sarcomeres, specifically near the Z-disc and H-zone, indicating a structural role in muscle actin filament assembly (Smith2016The). 

No specific information on quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms is provided in the available context.

## Function
ADPRHL1 (ADP-ribosylhydrolase-like 1) is a pseudoenzyme that plays a crucial role in heart development, particularly in the assembly of myofibrils and the growth of heart chambers. Despite lacking enzymatic activity due to the absence of key catalytic residues, ADPRHL1 is essential for the structural organization of cardiac muscle tissue. It is involved in the assembly of actin filaments and the formation of myofibrils, which are critical for the contractile function of the heart (Smith2020Defective; Smith2016The).

In healthy human cells, ADPRHL1 is thought to interact with actin, influencing the dynamics of the cytoskeleton and contributing to the proper alignment and organization of myofibrils within cardiomyocytes. This interaction is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the heart during development (Smith2020Defective). The protein is primarily active in the developing heart myocardium, where it is expressed in regions of actively growing heart chambers (Smith2016The).

ADPRHL1's role extends beyond structural support, as it may also be involved in post-transcriptional regulation, potentially affecting the synthesis and stability of its own mRNA, which is crucial for its function during heart development (Smith2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADPRHL1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly affecting heart development and function. In Xenopus models, mutations in exon 3 and exon 6 of the adprhl1 gene result in significant heart defects, including malformed cardiomyocytes and defective sarcomere structures. These mutations disrupt myofibrillogenesis and heart chamber growth, leading to cardiac abnormalities such as small ventricles and disorganized myofibrils (Smith2020Defective). 

In humans, a missense mutation in the ADPRHL1 gene, specifically p.Leu294Arg, has been associated with a left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) conduction defect, indicating its potential role in cardiac conduction abnormalities (Smith2020Defective). 

Additionally, the ADPRHL1 gene has been implicated in prostate cancer risk, particularly in African American families. A recurrent germline mutation (c.A233T; p.D78V) in ADPRHL1 has been identified as a genetic risk factor for prostate cancer. This mutation activates PARP1, enhancing DNA repair mechanisms and promoting cancer cell survival, which suggests that ADPRHL1 may function as a tumor suppressor in prostate tissue (Zhang2022A).

## Interactions
ADPRHL1 is involved in heart development, particularly in myofibrillogenesis and heart chamber growth. Although it is classified as a pseudoenzyme due to the loss of key catalytic residues, ADPRHL1 is suggested to play a crucial role in cardiac development through its interactions with actin filaments. It is associated with myofibrils in Xenopus, localizing to actin filament boundaries, which is significant as actin is a major target for ADP-ribosylation by bacterial toxins that can disrupt actin filaments (Smith2020Defective). 

The protein is thought to influence myofibrils through direct binding to actin, potentially affecting heart development and function (Smith2020Defective). ADPRHL1 may also interact with components of the myofibril, potentially localizing to Z-disc/actin filament boundaries, and may cooperate with chaperones involved in actin filament assembly (Smith2020Defective). 

The study of ADPRHL1 in Xenopus models suggests that the protein may have repurposed binding affinities from ADP-ribosylhydrolases, indicating that not all familial amino acid sequences are necessary for its function (Smith2020Defective). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving ADPRHL1 are not detailed in the available context.
