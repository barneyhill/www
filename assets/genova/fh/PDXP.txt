# PDXP

## Overview
The PDXP gene encodes the enzyme pyridoxal phosphatase, a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-type superfamily of phosphatases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the regulation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) levels, the active form of vitamin B6, by catalyzing its dephosphorylation. Pyridoxal phosphatase plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing PLP toxicity, which is vital for various biochemical processes, including neurotransmitter synthesis and amino acid metabolism (Gohla2019Do; Jeanclos2020Ca2+). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it influences cognitive functions and neurotransmitter metabolism (Brenner20247; Gohla2019Do). Additionally, pyridoxal phosphatase is involved in actin cytoskeletal dynamics, impacting cell migration and synaptic function (Gohla2019Do). The enzyme's activity and interactions with proteins such as CIB1 and calmodulin are modulated by calcium levels, highlighting its regulatory complexity in cellular processes (Jeanclos2020Ca2+).

## Structure
The pyridoxal phosphatase (PDXP) protein is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-type superfamily of phosphatases, characterized by a modified Rossman fold that positions the catalytic core residues (Knobloch2015Synthesis). The primary structure of PDXP consists of 297 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 32 kDa (Bøe2004Pyridoxal). The enzyme functions as a homo-dimer in solution, as evidenced by its crystallization as a homo-dimer in complex with substrate analogs (Knobloch2015Synthesis).

The secondary structure includes a loop and helix H4, which is surface-exposed and plays a role in binding interactions with other proteins, such as CIB1 (Jeanclos2020Ca2+). The tertiary structure of PDXP involves a catalytic pocket where substrate analogs bind, with specific residues like Asp27 and Asn60 playing roles in substrate orientation and stabilization during catalysis (Knobloch2015Synthesis). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.

PDXP may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and interactions.

## Function
The human gene PDXP encodes pyridoxal phosphatase, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the regulation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) levels, the active form of vitamin B6. This enzyme is involved in the dephosphorylation of PLP, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing PLP toxicity. PLP is a cofactor in numerous biochemical reactions, including neurotransmitter synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and glycogen breakdown (Gohla2019Do; Jeanclos2020Ca2+).

PDXP is primarily expressed in the brain, where it regulates PLP levels, influencing neurotransmitter metabolism and potentially affecting cognitive functions such as memory and learning (Brenner20247; Gohla2019Do). The enzyme's activity is crucial for preventing the formation of covalent bonds between PLP and lysine residues in proteins, which can lead to deleterious effects (Gohla2019Do).

In addition to its role in vitamin B6 metabolism, PDXP is involved in actin cytoskeletal dynamics by dephosphorylating phosphocofilin, a process important for cell migration and synaptic function (Gohla2019Do). The enzyme's activity is modulated by interactions with proteins such as CIB1 and calmodulin, which may influence its function in cellular processes (Jeanclos2020Ca2+).

## Clinical Significance
The PDXP gene, encoding pyridoxal phosphatase, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes and disease progression. In glioblastomas, a common and aggressive brain tumor, PDXP is located in a chromosomal region frequently lost, and its monoallelic loss and aberrant promoter methylation are associated with reduced patient survival. Loss of PDXP expression leads to increased cofilin phosphorylation, promoting actin polymerization and enhancing cell migration and invasiveness, which are critical factors in tumor progression (Gohla2019Do).

PDXP is also identified as a novel cancer autoantigen in the central nervous system, with autoantibodies against it detected in a significant number of lung cancer patients and those with other cancers. This suggests a potential link between PDXP expression and cancer, as well as autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis (Bøe2004Pyridoxal).

Furthermore, PDXP's involvement in neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly its regulation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) levels, suggests its role in fine-tuning gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels. Disruptions in this process can lead to conditions such as childhood epilepsy and axonal polyneuropathy (Jeanclos2020Ca2+).

## Interactions
PDXP, or pyridoxal phosphatase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. PDXP interacts with Ca2+-and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1) and calmodulin (CaM), with these interactions being mutually exclusive. The binding of CaM to PDXP is enhanced by elevated Ca2+ concentrations, which reduces the binding of CIB1, suggesting that Ca2+ acts as a molecular switch in regulating these interactions (Jeanclos2020Ca2+). Despite these interactions, neither CIB1 nor CaM alters the phosphatase activity of PDXP in vitro (Jeanclos2020Ca2+).

The interaction between PDXP and CIB1 is largely independent of Ca2+ concentrations, indicating that CIB1 can bind PDXP in a Ca2+-independent manner (Jeanclos2020Ca2+). The region encompassing amino acids 75-85 in PDXP is crucial for its interaction with CIB1, involving a loop and helix H4 near the active site entrance (Jeanclos2020Ca2+). PDXP also has a putative CaM binding motif that overlaps with its CIB1 binding site, and Ca2+ levels above 20 µM favor the formation of the CaM-PDXP complex over the CIB1-PDXP complex (Jeanclos2020Ca2+).
