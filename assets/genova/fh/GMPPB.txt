# GMPPB

## Overview
The GMPPB gene encodes the enzyme GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase B, which is a crucial component in the glycosylation pathways of human cells. This cytoplasmic enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of GTP and mannose-1-phosphate into GDP-mannose, a key substrate for various glycosylation processes, including O-mannosylation, N-glycosylation, and the formation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors. These processes are essential for the proper function and structural integrity of proteins and lipids, particularly in muscle and nerve tissues. Disruptions in GMPPB function can lead to a spectrum of neuromuscular disorders known as dystroglycanopathies, which are characterized by impaired glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a protein critical for linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton (Chompoopong2023GDPMannose; Liu2021GMPPBcongenital).

## Structure


## Function
GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase B (GMPPB) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of GDP-mannose from GTP and mannose-1-phosphate. GDP-mannose is a vital substrate for several glycosylation pathways, including O-mannosylation, C-mannosylation, N-glycosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor formation. These glycosylation processes are essential for the proper function of proteins and lipids in human cells (Chompoopong2023GDPMannose; Liu2021GMPPBcongenital).

GMPPB is crucial for the synthesis of dolichol-phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man), which serves as a mannose donor for mannosylation reactions in the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is particularly important for the O-mannosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a protein that links the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton. Proper glycosylation of α-DG is necessary for its interaction with extracellular proteins such as laminin-2, agrin, and neurexin, which is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle and nerve tissues (Chompoopong2023GDPMannose).

In healthy human cells, GMPPB ensures the proper glycosylation of α-DG, facilitating its role in muscle and neuromuscular junction function. Disruptions in GMPPB function can lead to dystroglycanopathies, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal physiology (Chompoopong2023GDPMannose).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GMPPB gene are associated with a range of neuromuscular disorders, primarily inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. These disorders include congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), and congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) (Chompoopong2023GDPMannose). The clinical manifestations of GMPPB mutations can vary widely, from severe CMD with brain and eye abnormalities to milder forms of muscular dystrophy and even asymptomatic hyper-CKemia (Chompoopong2023GDPMannose). 

Patients with GMPPB mutations may experience symptoms such as proximal muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and myoglobinuria. Cardiac conduction defects and mild intellectual disabilities have also been reported (Chompoopong2023GDPMannose). Neurological symptoms, including generalized seizures and developmental delays, are also associated with these mutations (Raphael2014Congenital). 

GMPPB-related disorders are characterized by reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, leading to dystroglycanopathies. These conditions can manifest as severe CMD with structural brain defects, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and ophthalmic abnormalities (Chompoopong2023GDPMannose). The phenotypic spectrum of GMPPB mutations is broad, and the importance of molecular characterization in patients with reduced alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation is emphasized (Panicucci2017Mutations).

## Interactions
GMPPB (GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase B) is involved in several interactions critical for its function in glycosylation pathways. It catalyzes the formation of GDP-mannose, a substrate necessary for various glycosylation processes, including O-mannosylation, N-glycosylation, and the formation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors. These processes are essential for the proper glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, which links the dystroglycan complex to the extracellular matrix. Impaired function of GMPPB can lead to dystroglycanopathy due to reduced GDP-mannose availability, affecting interactions with extracellular proteins such as laminin-2, agrin, and neurexin (Chompoopong2023GDPMannose; Jensen2015GMPPBAssociated).

GMPPB is also associated with the Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factor 2 (EEF2), a target of the antidepressant Esketamine, suggesting potential interactions that may influence the pathogenesis of suicide attempts (Zhao2024Identifying). In glioblastoma multiforme, GMPPB interacts with the Hippo/MMP3 pathway, where it affects the phosphorylation of YAP, a component of the Hippo pathway, influencing cell proliferation and invasion (Huang2023Silencing). These interactions highlight GMPPB's role in both neurological and muscular systems, impacting various cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
