# ITGA11

## Overview
ITGA11 is a gene that encodes the integrin subunit alpha 11, a transmembrane protein that is part of the integrin family, which plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and signaling. The integrin α11 subunit is primarily involved in forming the integrin α11β1 complex, which functions as a receptor for collagen and Osteolectin, contributing significantly to bone health and maintenance by activating the Wnt signaling pathway (Shen2018Integrin). Beyond its role in skeletal biology, integrin α11 is implicated in fibrotic diseases and various cancers, where it influences cell behavior and extracellular matrix interactions (Primac2019Stromal; Bansal2017Integrin). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are critical in pathological contexts, making ITGA11 a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and fibrotic conditions (Cui2021Comprehensive; Yang2022Comprehensive).

## Structure
The ITGA11 gene encodes the integrin α11 subunit, a protein that is part of the integrin family involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of the α11 subunit includes a polypeptide chain with 1166 amino acids, featuring a 22-residue N-terminal signal peptide, a large extracellular domain of 1120 residues, a 23-residue transmembrane domain, and a short 24-residue cytoplasmic domain (Lehnert1999Cloning; Zhang2002Analysis). 

The secondary structure of the α11 subunit includes seven FG-GAP repeats that form a β-propeller domain, a common feature in integrin α-subunits (Lehnert1999Cloning; Springer1997Folding). The extracellular region also contains an I-domain of 207 amino acids, which includes a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif crucial for ligand binding (Lehnert1999Cloning; Zhang2002Analysis).

In terms of tertiary structure, the α11 subunit's I-domain undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding, which is essential for its function as a collagen receptor (Zhang2002Analysis). The quaternary structure involves the association of the α11 subunit with a β-subunit to form the integrin α11β1 complex, which acts as a receptor for collagen XIII (Koivunen2020Integrin).

Post-translational modifications include potential N-glycosylation sites, which may increase the molecular mass of the mature protein (Lehnert1999Cloning). The α11 subunit is closely related to other collagen-binding integrins, sharing structural similarities with the α10, α1, and α2 subunits (Lehnert1999Cloning).

## Function
Integrin alpha 11 (ITGA11) is a protein that functions primarily as a receptor for collagen and Osteolectin, playing a crucial role in maintaining adult skeletal bone mass. It is expressed by LepR+ skeletal stem cells and osteoblasts, and is essential for the osteogenic response to Osteolectin, which involves the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. This pathway is critical for osteogenesis, as ITGA11 deficiency leads to reduced bone formation and accelerated bone loss, particularly in trabecular bone (Shen2018Integrin).

ITGA11 forms a heterodimer with integrin beta1 (ITGB1), and this complex binds Osteolectin with high affinity, promoting Wnt pathway activation necessary for osteogenesis. The protein is involved in the differentiation of skeletal stem/progenitor cells into osteoblasts, contributing to bone maintenance and health (Shen2018Integrin).

In addition to its role in bone health, ITGA11 is implicated in the regulation of the myofibroblast phenotype during fibrotic diseases. It is significantly upregulated in myofibroblasts in fibrotic tissues, where it influences cell shape, contractility, and migration, as well as extracellular matrix production and remodeling (Bansal2017Integrin).

## Clinical Significance
ITGA11 is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), ITGA11 is overexpressed and linked to poor survival outcomes. Functional studies have shown that ITGA11 knockdown inhibits malignant phenotypes in STAD cell lines, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Cui2021Comprehensive). ITGA11 is also upregulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), where it correlates with tumor stage and poor overall survival. It plays a critical role in controlling the secretome of pancreatic stellate cells, which stimulates tumor cell migration and invasion, highlighting its involvement in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (Yang2022Comprehensive).

In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), ITGA11 is significantly expressed at high levels in cancer tissues, contributing to integrin-mediated signaling pathways related to cell adhesion (Gong2019Diagnostic). Additionally, ITGA11 is upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and thyroid carcinoma (THCA), where it is associated with poor overall survival and advanced disease stages (Cui2021Comprehensive). These findings suggest that ITGA11 may serve as a target for therapeutic interventions across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
Integrin α11 (ITGA11) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In breast cancer, ITGA11 interacts with PDGFRβ, forming a complex that recruits CRK, a connector between tyrosine kinase receptors and downstream effectors. This interaction enhances PDGFRβ signaling, promoting cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) invasion and tumor progression (Primac2019Stromal). ITGA11 also colocalizes with PDGFRβ in juxta-epithelial fibroblasts, contributing to the desmoplastic reaction in breast cancer (Primac2019Stromal).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ITGA11 is part of a competitive binding relationship with the long non-coding RNA FEZF1-AS1 and microRNA miR-516b-5p. FEZF1-AS1 competes with miR-516b-5p for binding to ITGA11, which negatively regulates ITGA11 expression, affecting cell proliferation and invasion (Song2020Long).

ITGA11 also acts as a receptor for collagen XIII, mediating cell adhesion and spreading. The α11-I domain of ITGA11 binds to specific motifs within collagen XIII, facilitating interactions that are crucial for tissue remodeling and fibrosis (Koivunen2020Integrin). These interactions highlight ITGA11's role in various cellular and pathological processes.
