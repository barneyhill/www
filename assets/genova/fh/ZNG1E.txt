# ZNG1E

## Overview
ZNG1E is a gene that encodes the protein Zn regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1E, which plays a crucial role in cellular zinc homeostasis. This protein is categorized as a GTPase, a type of enzyme that hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein synthesis. The activity of Zn regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1E is essential for the regulation of metalloproteins, which are proteins that require metal ions to function properly. The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest due to their potential implications in understanding zinc-related metabolic pathways and their impact on human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
