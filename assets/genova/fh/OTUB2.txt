# OTUB2

## Overview
OTUB2 is a gene that encodes the OTU deubiquitinase, ubiquitin aldehyde binding 2, a member of the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain-containing family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of ubiquitination, a post-translational modification process that controls protein stability, activity, and localization. The OTUB2 protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including a five-stranded β-sheet and a catalytic triad, which enable it to cleave various polyubiquitin chains, thereby influencing numerous cellular processes (Nanao2004Crystal; Li2022The). Functionally, OTUB2 is involved in the DNA damage response, modulating repair pathway choice and maintaining genomic stability (Kato2014FineTuning). It also participates in key signaling pathways, such as NF-kappaB and Hedgehog, impacting immune response and development (Li2022The). Clinically, dysregulation of OTUB2 expression is associated with the progression of several cancers, including colon, gastric, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer, where it contributes to tumor growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance (Ouyang2022OTUB2; Zhu2024OTU; Li2019OTUB2; Zhang2019OTUB2).

## Structure
The OTUB2 protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure that distinguishes it from other deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). It consists of a five-stranded β-sheet flanked by a small helical amino-terminal region and a larger helical region (Nanao2004Crystal; Li2022The). The active site of OTUB2 is located at the junction of the β-sheet and α-helix, containing the catalytic residues Cys51, His224, and Asn226, which form a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity (Sivakumar2020Activation; Li2022The).

OTUB2's structure includes a novel oxyanion hole formed by the active site loop, which facilitates interaction with ubiquitin (Li2022The). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by a unique hydrogen-bonding network that maintains the catalytic triad in a productive conformation, even in the absence of ubiquitin (Sivakumar2020Activation). Unlike OTUB1, OTUB2 lacks a long N-terminal helix, which affects its substrate specificity and interaction with E2 enzymes (Sivakumar2020Activation; Li2022The).

OTUB2 can cleave various polyubiquitin chains, including Lys48, Lys63, and Lys11, due to its structural configuration, which allows for a broader substrate range compared to OTUB1 (Li2022The). The protein's structure is further characterized by a hydrophobic pocket and a potential metal-binding site, contributing to its functional specificity (Nanao2004Crystal).

## Function
OTUB2 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by regulating the ubiquitination processes involved in DNA repair pathway choice. It specifically inhibits RNF8-mediated ubiquitination, which is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Kato2014FineTuning). OTUB2 negatively regulates the synthesis of Lys 63-linked ubiquitin chains, which are important for the recruitment of repair proteins like RAP80 and 53BP1 to DSBs (Kato2014FineTuning). This regulation is crucial for maintaining a balance between homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), two major DSB repair pathways (Kato2014FineTuning).

In healthy human cells, OTUB2's activity ensures the appropriate repair pathway is selected, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations or chromosomal translocations (Kato2014FineTuning). OTUB2 also interacts with L3MBTL1, deubiquitinating it to influence the recruitment of 53BP1 to damaged chromatin, which affects the DNA repair process (Kato2014FineTuning). Beyond DNA repair, OTUB2 is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, including the NF-kappaB and Hedgehog pathways, impacting processes like immune response and bone growth (Li2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the OTUB2 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In colon cancer, OTUB2 is overexpressed, which is associated with poor prognosis, increased tumor diameter, lymphatic metastasis, and distant metastasis. It plays a role in regulating the stemness feature, chemoresistance, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of colon cancer cells, contributing to tumor metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy drugs like oxaliplatin (Zhu2024OTU).

In gastric cancer, OTUB2 is also overexpressed and correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor differentiation. High OTUB2 expression is linked to lower overall survival rates, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis and proliferation (Ouyang2022OTUB2).

OTUB2 is identified as a metastasis enhancer in breast cancer, promoting cancer stem cell traits and chemotherapy resistance. It stabilizes YAP and TAZ proteins, enhancing their pro-metastatic functions through Hippo-independent pathways (Zhang2019OTUB2).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), OTUB2 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and advanced tumor stages. It promotes NSCLC progression by stabilizing U2AF2 and activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, contributing to the Warburg effect and tumorigenesis (Li2019OTUB2).

## Interactions
OTUB2 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as DNA repair and signal transduction. It interacts with L3MBTL1, a protein involved in DNA repair pathways, and can deubiquitinate L3MBTL1, influencing the recruitment of 53BP1 to damaged chromatin (Kato2014FineTuning). OTUB2 also interacts with proteins in the DNA damage response, such as RAP80 and RNF168, modulating their assembly at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and affecting the early phase of the DNA damage response (Kato2014FineTuning).

In the context of cancer progression, OTUB2 interacts with YAP1 and TAZ, key effectors in the Hippo signaling pathway. It stabilizes these proteins by deubiquitinating them, which is crucial for their activation and contributes to tumor progression (Liu2022OTUB2; Zhang2019OTUB2). OTUB2's interaction with TRAF6 in the NF-kappaB pathway prevents the degradation of proteins involved in the phosphorylation of p65, promoting cancer progression by activating anti-apoptotic genes (Li2022The). These interactions highlight OTUB2's role as a regulator of protein stability and activity, influencing various cellular pathways.
