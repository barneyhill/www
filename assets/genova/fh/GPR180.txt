# GPR180

## Overview
GPR180 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 180, a non-classical receptor involved in the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway. Unlike typical G protein-coupled receptors, GPR180 lacks several conserved motifs and exhibits a reverse orientation in the plasma membrane, akin to the adiponectin receptor (Balazova2021GPR180). The protein is predominantly expressed in brown and beige adipose tissues, where it plays a crucial role in energy metabolism by promoting thermogenic adipocyte function (Balazova2021GPR180). GPR180 interacts with the protein CTHRC1, facilitating SMAD3 phosphorylation, a critical step in TGFβ signaling, which is essential for maintaining normal metabolic functions (Balazova2021GPR180). The gene has been implicated in various health conditions, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and congenital microcoria, highlighting its significance in metabolic and developmental processes (Yoshida2023Lack; Pozza2020Microcoria).

## Function
The GPR180 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway, which is crucial for promoting thermogenic adipocyte function and regulating metabolic processes in healthy human cells (Balazova2021GPR180). Unlike classical G protein-coupled receptors, GPR180 lacks several conserved motifs typical of GPCRs and has a reverse orientation in the plasma membrane, similar to the adiponectin receptor (Balazova2021GPR180). It is primarily expressed in brown and beige adipose tissues, where it plays a significant role in energy metabolism by promoting the thermogenic function of adipocytes (Balazova2021GPR180).

GPR180 interacts with the adipocyte-secreted factor CTHRC1, which enhances SMAD3 phosphorylation, a key step in the TGFβ signaling pathway (Balazova2021GPR180). This interaction is essential for maintaining normal metabolic functions, as evidenced by GPR180 knockout mice exhibiting reduced UCP1 protein levels, altered energy expenditure, and impaired glucose tolerance (Balazova2021GPR180). The protein's activity is particularly relevant in the context of obesity and metabolic diseases, as it contributes to increased energy expenditure and improved glucose homeostasis (Balazova2021GPR180).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPR180 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. GPR180 has been identified as a candidate gene for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through genome-wide association studies. The lack of GPR180 in knockout mice has been shown to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and plasma lipid levels by downregulating mTORC1 signaling, suggesting its potential role in lipid metabolism and as a therapeutic target for NAFLD and dyslipidemia (Yoshida2023Lack).

In the context of ocular conditions, GPR180 is associated with congenital microcoria (MCOR), a rare eye anomaly characterized by small pupils. Structural variations involving the GPR180 gene, such as duplications or deletions, have been linked to the dominant form of MCOR. These genetic alterations can lead to the underdevelopment or absence of the dilator muscle of the pupil, resulting in the characteristic small pupil size (Pozza2020Microcoria; Angée2021Congenital).

The gene's involvement in smooth muscle cell growth and its location on chromosome 13q32.1 further suggest its role in the molecular pathogenesis of MCOR and potentially other conditions related to smooth muscle function (Pozza2020Microcoria).

## Interactions
GPR180 is involved in the TGFβ signaling pathway and interacts with the protein CTHRC1. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of SMAD3, a key signaling molecule in the TGFβ pathway. CTHRC1 is identified as a potential ligand for GPR180, as its binding is significantly reduced in GPR180 knockout cells, suggesting a direct physical interaction between these proteins (Balazova2021GPR180). GPR180 is not a classical GPCR but acts as a component of the TGFβ signaling hub, mediating the effects of CTHRC1 to regulate thermogenic adipocyte function (Balazova2021GPR180).

The interaction between GPR180 and CTHRC1 involves targeting GPR180 and TGFβR1 to increase SMAD3 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation, forming part of a feedback loop that regulates SMAD3 stability and TGFβ signaling intensity (Balazova2021GPR180). This interaction is essential for the full activation of the TGFβ signaling machinery, although submaximal activation can still drive processes like adipocyte browning (Balazova2021GPR180). The study also highlights that GPR180 may interact with the TGFβ receptor complex, possibly with TGFβR1 kinase, although it is not clear whether it acts as a downstream modulator or directly interacts with the receptor complex (Balazova2021GPR180).
