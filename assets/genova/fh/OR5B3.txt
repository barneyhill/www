# OR5B3

## Overview
OR5B3 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily B member 3, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it functions as a receptor for odorant molecules, playing a critical role in the sense of smell. The OR5B3 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is responsible for detecting specific odorants, thereby contributing to the vast diversity of olfactory perception (Solaimani2017Exposure). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR5B3 has been implicated in various physiological processes, including neuroprotection and tissue regeneration, as evidenced by its expression in response to environmental stressors and during wound healing (Solaimani2017Exposure; Ohshima2024Timecourse). These findings suggest that OR5B3 may have broader biological functions beyond olfactory signaling (Ohshima2024Timecourse).

## Function
OR5B3 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR5B3 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (Solaimani2017Exposure).

The function of OR5B3 extends beyond olfactory perception. It has been observed that the expression of OR5B3 is upregulated in response to exposure to ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) in human primary neurons, suggesting a potential role in neuroprotection or response to environmental stressors (Solaimani2017Exposure). Additionally, OR5B3 expression is noted in periodontal ligament fibroblasts during wound healing processes, indicating its involvement in tissue regeneration and repair mechanisms (Ohshima2024Timecourse).

The gene's activity in non-olfactory tissues suggests that OR5B3 may have broader biological roles, potentially influencing cellular processes such as inflammation and tissue regeneration, although its exact functions in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated (Ohshima2024Timecourse).
