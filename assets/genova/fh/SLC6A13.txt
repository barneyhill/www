# SLC6A13

## Overview
The SLC6A13 gene encodes the protein known as γ-aminobutyric acid transporter 2 (GAT-2), which is a member of the solute carrier family 6 (SLC6). This protein functions as a neurotransmitter transporter, primarily facilitating the reuptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an essential inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. GAT-2 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane helices, which form a channel for substrate transport across cell membranes, and it exhibits high selectivity and low affinity for GABA (Kristensen2011SLC6; Schlessinger2012High). Predominantly expressed in peripheral tissues such as the liver, kidney, and testis, GAT-2 plays a significant role in peripheral GABAergic mechanisms and is involved in the transport of other substrates like taurine (Zhou2012Deletion). The structural and functional properties of GAT-2, including its resistance to typical GABAergic inhibitors and its sodium-dependent transport mechanism, underscore its importance in maintaining neurotransmitter balance and its potential implications in various clinical conditions (Schlessinger2012High; Zhou2012Deletion).

## Structure
The SLC6A13 gene encodes the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter 2 (GAT-2), a member of the solute carrier family 6 (SLC6). This protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane helices, forming a channel that facilitates the transport of substrates like GABA across cell membranes (Kristensen2011SLC6). The molecular structure of GAT-2 is modeled based on the leucine transporter LeuT, which features a 5+5 inverted repeat fold, a common structural motif in secondary active transporters (Kristensen2011SLC6; Colas2020Toward).

The primary binding site of GAT-2 is located between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10, and is composed of three subpockets that contribute to ligand binding and specificity (Colas2020Toward). The protein undergoes conformational changes between occluded and outward-facing states, which are crucial for its transport function (Schlessinger2012High).

GAT-2 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and regulation (Kristensen2011SLC6). Alternative splicing of the SLC6A13 gene can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting the transporter's functional properties (Kristensen2011SLC6).

## Function
The SLC6A13 gene encodes the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter 2 (GAT-2), a member of the solute carrier family 6, which functions primarily as a neurotransmitter transporter. GAT-2 is involved in the reuptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a key inhibitory neurotransmitter, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining neurotransmitter balance in the central nervous system (Schlessinger2012High). This transporter is characterized by its high selectivity and low affinity for GABA, and it is resistant to inhibition by typical GABAergic inhibitors (Schlessinger2012High).

GAT-2 is predominantly expressed in peripheral tissues such as the liver, kidney, and testis, where it regulates peripheral GABAergic mechanisms (Schlessinger2012High). In the liver, GAT-2 is the major contributor to GABA uptake, which is sodium-dependent and inhibited by certain compounds, indicating its substrate selectivity (Zhou2012Deletion). Additionally, GAT-2 is involved in the transport of taurine, a role that is significant in both liver and kidney function (Zhou2012Deletion). The transporter is expressed in the basolateral membranes of proximal tubules in the kidney and in periportal hepatocytes in the liver, suggesting its involvement in the transport of amino acids and neurotransmitters across cell membranes (Zhou2012Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC6A13 gene, encoding the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter 2 (GAT-2), has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in neurotransmitter transport and metabolism. Alterations in SLC6A13 expression have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its downregulation is linked to poorer prognosis. Increased expression of SLC6A13 correlates with improved overall survival, progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and disease-specific survival in liver cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2024Transcription).

In the context of immune responses, SLC6A13 deficiency has been shown to promote Th17 cell differentiation during intestinal bacterial infections, affecting cytokine expression and cellular metabolism. This suggests a role in modulating immune responses, which could have implications for autoimmune diseases and infections (Ren2019Slc6a13).

Additionally, the deletion of SLC6A13 in mice has been linked to changes in taurine content in the liver and brain, indicating its involvement in taurine transport. These alterations could have potential implications for neurological conditions, although the specific clinical outcomes related to these changes remain to be fully elucidated (Zhou2012Deletion).
