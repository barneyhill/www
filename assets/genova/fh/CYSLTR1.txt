# CYSLTR1

## Overview
The CYSLTR1 gene encodes the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1, a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to mediating inflammatory responses. This receptor is primarily expressed in immune cells, such as eosinophils and mast cells, and is involved in processes like bronchoconstriction and immune cell recruitment. The protein encoded by CYSLTR1 is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, typical of GPCRs, and is known to form dimers or oligomers. It plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis by mediating the effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes, potent pro-inflammatory lipid mediators. Variations in the CYSLTR1 gene have been linked to altered responses in inflammatory diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in disease progression and treatment response (Thompson2016Cysteinyl; Céspedes2023Altered; Singh2010Cysteinyl).

## Structure
The CYSLTR1 protein, also known as the human CysLT1 receptor, is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) with a primary structure consisting of 337 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 38 kDa. Despite this, it typically migrates at approximately 42 kDa as a monomeric form due to post-translational modifications, but is mostly present in dimeric and oligomeric forms, even in the presence of denaturing agents (Capra2004Molecular).

The secondary structure of CYSLTR1 includes seven transmembrane helices organized in the serpentine topology characteristic of GPCRs (Capra2004Molecular). The tertiary structure involves potential N-glycosylation sites, one in the extracellular N-tail, two in the second, and one in the third extracellular loop. There are also many potential protein kinase A and C phosphorylation sites, mostly located in the third intracellular loop and carboxyl terminal (Capra2004Molecular).

The quaternary structure is suggested by its tendency to form dimers or oligomers, a common feature in the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, although the physiological significance of CYSLTR1 oligomerization is not yet established (Capra2004Molecular). The receptor shares 32% amino acid identity with the purinoceptor P2Y1 and the receptor for platelet activating factor (PAF), and 28% identity with the BLT receptor (Capra2004Molecular).

## Function
The CYSLTR1 gene encodes the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1, a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in mediating inflammatory responses. This receptor is primarily expressed in immune cells such as eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, and B lymphocytes, and is involved in various cellular processes, including bronchoconstriction, vascular permeability, and immune cell recruitment (Singh2010Cysteinyl). In healthy human cells, CYSLTR1 is expressed in the spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and to a lesser extent in the lung, small intestine, pancreas, and placenta (Singh2010Cysteinyl).

CYSLTR1 mediates the effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid. These leukotrienes, including LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are potent pro-inflammatory agents that contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis by promoting bronchoconstriction and increasing microvascular permeability (Singh2010Cysteinyl). The receptor is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses in the gastrointestinal system and is expressed in the small intestine and colon (Singh2010Cysteinyl). CYSLTR1's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to inflammatory stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CYSLTR1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving inflammatory responses. In the context of asthma, specific variants of CYSLTR1, such as the Gly300Ser and 927T>C polymorphisms, have been associated with increased risk and altered drug response. These variants can influence receptor activation and sensitivity to leukotriene modifiers, impacting the efficacy of treatments like montelukast (Thompson2016Cysteinyl; arriba2006927t). 

In cancer, CYSLTR1 expression is notably altered. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CYSLTR1 is downregulated, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes and reduced survival rates. This downregulation is particularly evident in the basal subtype of breast cancer (Céspedes2023Altered). Conversely, in colorectal cancer (CRC), CYSLTR1 is upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics. This upregulation is linked to hypomethylation of the gene and is associated with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, indicating a role in cancer progression and metastasis (Ghatak2023DNA). 

These findings suggest that CYSLTR1 plays a significant role in both inflammatory diseases and cancer, with its expression levels and genetic variants influencing disease severity and treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
CYSLTR1, or cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1, is known to participate in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing its function and signaling pathways. The receptor interacts with CysLT2, forming heterodimers that modulate mitogenic responses in mast cells. This interaction can down-modulate cysteinyl leukotriene-dependent signaling, affecting cell proliferation and ERK phosphorylation (Jiang2007CysLT2). 

In the context of the L118F mutation in CysLTR1, the interaction profile changes significantly. Mass spectrometry analysis identified 16 proteins interacting with the mutant variant, compared to 7 with the wild-type. Notably, proteins such as Histone H2A, snRNP Sm D2, and various ribosomal proteins were found to interact exclusively with the mutant form, suggesting altered roles in gene transcription, mRNA processing, and protein translation (Hu2019Generation).

CYSLTR1 also interacts with proteins like P2RY10 and XCR1, as identified in gene-interaction analyses. These interactions are associated with immune system responses and may play a role in inflammation-related signaling, potentially impacting processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis (Céspedes2023Altered).
