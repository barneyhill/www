# CLEC6A

## Overview
CLEC6A, also known as Dectin-2, is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain containing 6A protein, a receptor primarily involved in the immune response. This receptor is categorized as a C-type lectin receptor and is predominantly expressed on immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, Langerhans cells, and monocytes. The protein plays a crucial role in recognizing high-mannose polysaccharides on the surface of pathogens, including fungi and certain bacteria, thereby initiating signaling pathways that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing the immune response (Mnich2020CType). CLEC6A is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and a single transmembrane domain, which anchors it to the cell membrane. The receptor's ability to form dimers is essential for its function, facilitating effective pathogen recognition and response. Additionally, CLEC6A is involved in modulating sterile inflammation and has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including aspergillosis and autoimmune diseases (Skonieczna2017Massively; Chiffoleau2018CType).

## Structure
CLEC6A, also known as Dectin-2, is a C-type lectin receptor characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which is crucial for binding specific sugar moieties on pathogens. This domain is a key feature of its molecular structure, allowing CLEC6A to play a significant role in the immune response. The protein is anchored in the cell membrane through a single transmembrane domain, which helps maintain its position and function within the cellular environment.

The structure of CLEC6A includes potential post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which is common among lectins and may influence the protein's stability and interaction with other molecules. Glycosylation can affect the protein's folding and its ability to recognize and bind to carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens.

CLEC6A is also known to form dimers, contributing to its quaternary structure. Dimerization is important for its function, as it can enhance the receptor's ability to bind to its ligands and initiate downstream signaling pathways. The ability to form dimers is a critical aspect of CLEC6A's role in the immune system, facilitating effective pathogen recognition and response.

## Function
CLEC6A, also known as Dectin-2, is a C-type lectin receptor primarily expressed on dendritic cells, macrophages, Langerhans cells, and monocytes. It plays a significant role in the immune response by recognizing high-mannose polysaccharides on the surface of pathogens, particularly fungi and certain bacteria. This recognition triggers signaling pathways that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhancing the immune response (Mnich2020CType).

Dectin-2 contains an intracellular tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its associated FcRγ chain, which is crucial for signaling. This receptor is involved in the activation of immune cells and the production of cytokines, facilitating the immune system's ability to identify and respond to pathogens such as Hafnia alvei and E. coli O9a (Mnich2020CType).

In addition to its role in pathogen recognition, Dectin-2 is involved in modulating sterile inflammation. It binds to a putative ligand on regulatory CD4+ CD25+ T cells to mediate ultraviolet radiation-induced tolerance and recognizes glycan mannose on the lysosomal enzyme β-glucuronidase, which moderates arthritis pathogenesis by preventing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory glycosaminoglycans within inflamed joint tissue (Chiffoleau2018CType).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC6A, also known as Dectin-2, has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in the immune response. Genetic variants in CLEC6A, particularly the intronic SNP rs12099687, have been associated with increased susceptibility to aspergillosis in pediatric patients with hematological malignancies. This SNP is predicted to affect non-canonical splicing of the CLEC6A gene, potentially altering the activity of the Dectin-2 protein, which is crucial for recognizing Aspergillus fumigatus and triggering an immune response (Skonieczna2017Massively).

Alterations in CLEC6A expression have also been observed in the context of sterile inflammation and autoimmune conditions. DECTIN-2 is involved in moderating arthritis pathogenesis by preventing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory glycosaminoglycans in joint tissues. It is suggested that DECTIN-2 may act as an inhibitory loop in dendritic cells to temper inflammation, with polymorphisms in related enzymes being associated with mucopolysaccharidoses, which are characterized by a pro-inflammatory response (Chiffoleau2018CType).

In epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, a chronic skin condition, CLEC6A expression is upregulated in neutrophils infiltrating the skin, although its absence in functional studies did not reduce disease severity, indicating it may not be critical to the disease's pathogenesis (GuerreroJuarez2023Ctype).

## Interactions
CLEC6A, also known as Dectin-2, is a C-type lectin receptor that participates in various interactions crucial for modulating immune responses. It recognizes glycan mannose on the lysosomal enzyme β-glucuronidase, which plays a role in moderating arthritis pathogenesis by preventing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory glycosaminoglycans within inflamed joint tissue. This interaction suggests that β-glucuronidase released by dead myeloid cells following tissue damage may act via DECTIN-2 as an inhibitory loop in dendritic cells to temper inflammation (Chiffoleau2018CType).

DECTIN-2 is also implicated in the suppression of liver metastasis by facilitating the phagocytosis of cancer cells via CD11b F4/80 Kupffer cells during the extravasation step (Chiffoleau2018CType). It binds to a putative ligand on regulatory CD4+ CD25+ T cells to mediate ultraviolet radiation-induced tolerance, highlighting its role in immune regulation (Chiffoleau2018CType).

While DECTIN-2 is part of the group II Syk-coupled C-type lectin receptors, specific interactions of CLEC6A with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts (Sung2019CLEC2).
