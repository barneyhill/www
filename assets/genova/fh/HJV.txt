# HJV

## Overview
The HJV gene encodes the protein hemojuvelin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane protein that functions as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) co-receptor. Hemojuvelin is a member of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of iron homeostasis by modulating the BMP signaling pathway, which is crucial for the expression of hepcidin, a key hormone in iron metabolism (Camus2007Molecular; Core2014Hemojuvelin). The protein is primarily expressed in the liver and interacts with various proteins, including neogenin and BMP ligands, to facilitate hepcidin induction and maintain iron balance (Zhang2005Interaction; Corradini2009The). Mutations in the HJV gene can lead to juvenile hemochromatosis, a severe iron overload disorder, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in hereditary hemochromatosis and other iron-related conditions (Wu2015HJV; Papanikolaou2003Mutations).

## Structure
Hemojuvelin (HJV) is a member of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family, characterized by several structural features. The protein is a cysteine-rich 33-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane protein, which can exist in both membrane-bound and soluble forms (Camus2007Molecular). HJV contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a partial von Willebrand factor type D domain, and a C-terminal propeptide (Camus2007Molecular; Corradini2009The). The signal peptide is approximately 35 amino acids long (Camus2007Molecular).

The protein undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage, resulting in a disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of fragments of approximately 35 and 20 kDa (Corradini2009The). This cleavage occurs between aspartic acid and proline at amino acid 172, forming a heterodimer linked by disulfide bonds (Corradini2009The). Soluble forms of HJV, approximately 40 and 50 kDa, have been detected, with the full-length form released from the cell surface and accumulating in the extracellular medium (Corradini2009The).

HJV features a conserved RGD motif, which is important for cell attachment and signal transduction (Camus2007Molecular). The protein also includes conserved cysteine residues and potential glycosylation sites, contributing to its structural stability and function (Camus2007Molecular). These structural elements are crucial for HJV's role as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) co-receptor, enhancing BMP signaling pathways (Camus2007Molecular).

## Function
Hemojuvelin (HJV) functions as a co-receptor in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating the expression of hepcidin, a hormone that controls iron homeostasis. In healthy human cells, HJV interacts with BMP ligands, particularly BMP6, to activate the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 proteins, which then translocate to the nucleus to increase hepcidin transcription (Zhao2016Neogenin; Core2014Hemojuvelin). Hepcidin regulates iron levels by inhibiting iron efflux from enterocytes and macrophages through the degradation of ferroportin, the only known iron exporter (Zhao2016Neogenin).

HJV is primarily expressed in the liver, where it plays a critical role in systemic iron regulation. It enhances BMP signaling by binding to BMP ligands and forming a complex with BMP receptors, which is essential for the induction of hepcidin expression (Xiao2020Bone; Corradini2009The). Mutations in HJV can disrupt this pathway, leading to decreased hepcidin levels and iron overload disorders such as juvenile hemochromatosis (Zhao2016Neogenin; Corradini2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HJV gene, also known as hemojuvelin, are associated with juvenile hemochromatosis, a severe form of hereditary hemochromatosis characterized by early-onset iron overload. This condition can lead to complications such as cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and hypogonadism due to excessive iron accumulation in organs like the liver, heart, and pancreas (Niederkofler2005Hemojuvelin; Papanikolaou2003Mutations). The HJV gene is crucial for regulating hepcidin, a hormone that controls iron homeostasis. Mutations in HJV result in significantly reduced hepcidin levels, leading to increased intestinal iron absorption and severe iron overload (Niederkofler2005Hemojuvelin; Wu2015HJV).

HJV mutations disrupt the BMP/Smad signaling pathway, which is essential for hepcidin expression. This disruption results in a failure to regulate iron levels properly, contributing to the pathogenesis of juvenile hemochromatosis (Wu2015HJV). The clinical phenotype of juvenile hemochromatosis due to HJV mutations is similar to that of hepcidin-deficient juvenile hemochromatosis, highlighting the critical role of HJV in iron metabolism (Papanikolaou2003Mutations). Additionally, alterations in HJV expression or function can lead to other iron-related disorders, emphasizing its importance in maintaining iron balance (Pietrangelo2006Molecular).

## Interactions
Hemojuvelin (HJV) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein that plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis by interacting with various proteins. HJV forms a complex with neogenin, a transmembrane protein, which is essential for iron accumulation in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and the regulation of iron homeostasis (Zhang2005Interaction). This interaction is disrupted by the G320V mutation in HJV, which is linked to Type 2A hereditary hemochromatosis, indicating the importance of this interaction for HJV's function (Zhang2005Interaction).

HJV also interacts with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), such as BMP-2 and BMP-4, acting as a co-receptor to induce hepcidin expression through the BMP signaling pathway (Zhao2016Neogenin; Yang2008Neogenin). The interaction between HJV and neogenin facilitates the induction of hepcidin expression, which is crucial for maintaining iron balance (Zhao2016Neogenin). HJV can simultaneously bind BMP-2 and neogenin, forming a ternary complex that is vital for its regulatory functions (Yang2008Neogenin).

Additionally, HJV interacts with transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) and HFE, forming a multi-protein membrane complex that is important for hepcidin regulation and iron sensing (D’Alessio2012The). These interactions highlight HJV's central role in iron metabolism and its involvement in hereditary hemochromatosis.
