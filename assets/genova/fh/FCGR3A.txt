# FCGR3A

## Overview
The FCGR3A gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa), a transmembrane receptor that is integral to the immune system's ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and other immune responses. This receptor is predominantly expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and certain T lymphocytes, where it binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. The interaction facilitates the recognition and elimination of antibody-coated target cells, such as those infected by viruses or undergoing malignant transformation (Mahaweni2018A; Lassaunière2013A). The receptor's function and binding affinity are influenced by genetic polymorphisms, notably the V158F polymorphism, which affects its interaction with IgG subclasses (Koene1997FcγRIIIa158VF). FCGR3A's role in immune modulation and its implications in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders underscore its clinical significance (Wu1997A; Li2022Integrative).

## Structure
The FCGR3A gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIIa, a protein that plays a significant role in the immune response. This receptor is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains. These domains are crucial for its function as they facilitate the binding of the Fc region of IgG antibodies, albeit with low affinity. The protein is anchored to the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage, which is essential for its localization and function.

Post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation, are vital for the receptor's activity. Glycosylation affects the receptor's stability, conformation, and interaction with other molecules, thereby influencing its immune response capabilities. The FCGR3A gene also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms of the receptor. These isoforms may have variations in their extracellular domains, potentially altering their binding properties and functional roles in immune processes. The structural features of FCGR3A, including its immunoglobulin-like domains and post-translational modifications, underscore its importance in mediating immune responses through interactions with IgG antibodies.

## Function
The FCGR3A gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa), a protein expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and some T lymphocytes. This receptor plays a crucial role in the immune system by mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a process where NK cells destroy antibody-coated target cells. FcγRIIIa binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, facilitating the recognition and elimination of malignant or virally infected cells (Mahaweni2018A; Lassaunière2013A).

The receptor's function is influenced by polymorphisms, such as the V158F polymorphism, which affects its binding affinity to IgG subclasses. The presence of valine (V) at position 158 enhances the receptor's affinity for IgG1 and IgG3, leading to more effective ADCC (Koene1997FcγRIIIa158VF). FcγRIIIa is also involved in cytokine production, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), in response to antibody-coated targets (Hussain2019Impact).

FcγRIIIa is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it mediates signal transduction processes essential for immune cell activation and function. Its expression and activity are modulated by genetic variations, which can influence immune responses and clinical outcomes in conditions like cancer and autoimmune diseases (Mahaweni2018A; Lassaunière2013A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FCGR3A gene, which encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIIa (CD16A), have been linked to various autoimmune diseases and conditions. A notable polymorphism in FCGR3A involves a T to G substitution at nucleotide 559, resulting in an amino acid change from phenylalanine (F) to valine (V) at position 176. This polymorphism affects the receptor's ability to bind IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies, influencing susceptibility to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Wu1997A). The 176F allele is associated with increased risk of SLE, particularly in patients with nephritis, while the 176V allele is underrepresented in these patients (Wu1997A).

In addition to autoimmune diseases, FCGR3A expression levels have been implicated in cancer prognosis. Overexpression of FCGR3A is observed in various cancers, including bladder urothelial carcinoma and breast invasive carcinoma, and is considered a poor prognostic indicator in certain cancers like kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (Li2022Integrative). Conversely, it acts as a protective factor in skin cutaneous melanoma (Li2022Integrative). These findings suggest that FCGR3A plays a significant role in tumor immunity and could serve as a biomarker for cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
FCGR3A, also known as CD16a, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, primarily in the context of immune responses. It is known to bind to the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG), facilitating processes such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) (Li2022Integrative). The interaction with IgG is crucial for transmitting activating signals in effector cells like macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells (Li2022Integrative).

The specificity of FCGR3A interactions is highlighted by its ability to bind IgG with higher affinity compared to its closely related receptor, FCGR3B (CD16b). This difference is partly due to a single amino acid variation at position 129, where FCGR3A has a glycine, allowing for a more stable interaction with IgG, whereas FCGR3B has an aspartic acid, which distorts the binding interface and reduces affinity (Roberts2018A).

FCGR3A also interacts with Affimer proteins, such as AfF4 and AfG3, which inhibit immune complex binding to FCGR3A through competitive and allosteric mechanisms. These interactions are characterized by specific binding to the ectodomain of FCGR3A, affecting its ability to bind IgG and modulating downstream immune responses (Robinson2017Affimer).
