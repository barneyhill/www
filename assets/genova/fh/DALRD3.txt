# DALRD3

## Overview
The DALRD3 gene encodes the DALR anticodon binding domain containing 3 protein, which is integral to the post-transcriptional modification of arginine tRNAs in human cells. This protein is characterized by its unique DALR anticodon-binding domain, which is homologous to domains found in arginyl tRNA synthetases but lacks the catalytic motifs typical of tRNA synthetases, suggesting a specialized function outside of aminoacylation (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2). DALRD3 forms a complex with METTL2A/B methyltransferases, facilitating the 3-methylcytosine (m3C) modification of specific arginine tRNA isoacceptors, a process crucial for accurate protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2). The protein's role in tRNA modification is vital for neurological function, with mutations in DALRD3 linked to severe neurological disorders, including epileptic encephalopathy (Lentini2020DALRD3; Zhang2024Epileptic).

## Structure
The DALRD3 protein contains a carboxy-terminal sequence homologous to the 'DALR' anticodon-binding domain, which is found in arginyl tRNA synthetases across Archaea to Eukaryotes (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2). This domain is characterized by conserved amino acids and folds into an all alpha helical structure, similar to the structure observed in S. cerevisiae arginyl tRNA synthetase (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2). The DALR domain forms a nucleic acid binding pocket that interacts with the minor groove side of arginine tRNA anticodon stems through van der Waals, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2).

Unlike RARS1 and RARS2, DALRD3 lacks a recognizable tRNA synthetase catalytic motif, suggesting a unique function outside of tRNA aminoacylation (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2). The amino-terminal portion of DALRD3 contains no recognizable motifs or domains and is specific to DALRD3 homologs (Lentini2020DALRD3). The protein forms a complex with METTL2A/B to bind specific arginine tRNAs, indicating a role in the formation of 3-methylcytosine in these tRNAs (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2). The absence of detailed information on the primary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of DALRD3 limits further structural description.

## Function
The DALRD3 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the modification of arginine tRNAs in human cells. This protein forms a complex with the METTL2 methyltransferase to specifically target arginine tRNA isoacceptors, such as tRNA-Arg-CCU and tRNA-Arg-UCU, for 3-methylcytosine (m3C) modification. This modification is essential for the proper folding and function of the anticodon loop in tRNAs, which is crucial for accurate protein synthesis (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2).

In healthy human cells, DALRD3 is necessary for the recognition and interaction of specific arginine tRNAs by METTL2, facilitating the m3C modification process. The presence of DALRD3 enhances the specificity of METTL2A/B towards these tRNAs, ensuring efficient modification and proper cellular function (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2). The m3C modification is believed to be important for the stability, aminoacylation, and ribosomal interaction of these tRNAs, which are vital for effective translation and cellular homeostasis (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2).

The absence of DALRD3 leads to a significant reduction in m3C modification, which can impact neurological development and function, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes (Lentini2020DALRD3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DALRD3 gene are linked to severe neurological disorders, particularly epileptic encephalopathy. This condition is characterized by early-onset epilepsy, profound developmental delay, and cognitive deficiencies. A specific homozygous nonsense mutation in DALRD3 results in a truncated protein lacking the DALR tRNA anticodon-binding domain, leading to a loss of 3-methylcytosine (m3C) modification in arginine tRNAs. This loss is associated with the neurological symptoms observed in affected individuals (Lentini2020DALRD3).

A novel missense variant, R517C, has also been identified in a patient with developmental delay and multifocal epilepsy. This variant affects the protein's ability to bind tRNAs and form a complex with the METTL2 methyltransferase, crucial for m3C modification. The R517C variant is associated with reduced protein levels and stability, leading to a deficiency in m3C modification, indicating a partial loss-of-function (Zhang2024Epileptic).

The clinical significance of DALRD3 is underscored by its role in tRNA modification, which is essential for proper neurological function. Deficiencies in this process can lead to severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (Lentini2020DALRD3).

## Interactions
The DALRD3 protein interacts specifically with METTL2A and METTL2B, forming a complex that plays a crucial role in the modification of arginine tRNAs. This interaction is characterized by DALRD3's ability to bind specific arginine tRNA isoacceptors, particularly tRNA-Arg-CCU and tRNA-Arg-UCU, facilitating the formation of 3-methylcytosine (m3C) at position 32 of these tRNAs (Lentini2020DALRD3). DALRD3 contains a carboxy-terminal sequence homologous to the 'DALR' anticodon-binding domain, which forms a nucleic acid binding pocket that recognizes the minor groove side of arginine tRNA anticodon stems (Lentini2020DALRD3; Lentini2019METTL2).

When over-expressed and purified alone, DALRD3 interacts with both ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA), but in complex with METTL2A/B, it predominantly binds tRNAs, particularly those containing m3C modifications (Lentini2020DALRD3). The interaction between DALRD3 and METTL2A/B is not RNA-mediated, as it persists after RNase treatment, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction (Lentini2020DALRD3). DALRD3's interaction with METTL2A/B enhances the methylation activity of METTL2 on tRNA substrates, highlighting its role in targeting specific tRNAs for modification (Lentini2020DALRD3).
