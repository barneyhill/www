# ARL9

## Overview
ARL9 is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 9, which is part of the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. The ARL9 protein functions as a small GTPase, a category of proteins that act as molecular switches in signaling pathways. It plays a role in cellular dynamics and has been implicated in the regulation of immune cell infiltration and cancer progression. Alterations in ARL9 expression and methylation have been associated with prognostic outcomes in several cancers, including low-grade glioma and triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis (Tan2020Prognostic; Guo2022DNA; Ruan2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
ARL9 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In low-grade glioma (LGG), low ARL9 expression is associated with longer overall survival and progression-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. This association is partly due to its correlation with immune cell infiltration, where ARL9 expression is negatively correlated with CD4+ T cells and positively correlated with B cells, CD8+ T cells, and neutrophils (Tan2020Prognostic). 

In the context of DNA methylation, ARL9 is identified as a DNA methylation-driven gene in LGG, where high methylation levels correlate with better survival outcomes. This suggests that ARL9 methylation status could serve as an independent prognostic marker (Guo2022DNA). 

ARL9 is also part of a glycolysis-related prognosis risk signature in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where its expression is inversely correlated with patient prognosis. This indicates its potential role in risk stratification and prognosis prediction in TNBC (Ruan2023Identification). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ARL9 in cancer prognosis and its potential utility in developing predictive models for patient outcomes.
