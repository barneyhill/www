# IFITM5

## Overview
Interferon induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5) is a gene that encodes a small transmembrane protein, also known as BRIL, which is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts. This protein plays a critical role in bone formation and mineralization, functioning as a key regulator of osteoblast differentiation and activity. IFITM5 is characterized by a single transmembrane helix and is subject to post-translational modifications, such as S-palmitoylation, which are essential for its localization and function. The protein interacts with other molecules, including FKBP11, to form complexes that influence the expression of interferon-induced genes, thereby linking bone formation with immune system activity. Mutations in the IFITM5 gene are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta type V, a genetic disorder that affects bone strength and structure (Hanagata2015IFITM5; Hanagata2010Characterization; Tsukamoto2013Role).

## Structure
The IFITM5 protein, also known as BRIL, is a small transmembrane protein primarily expressed in osteoblasts. It consists of a short N-terminal domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (Hanagata2015IFITM5; Hanagata2010Characterization). The protein was initially thought to have two transmembrane regions, but recent findings suggest it has one transmembrane region with a type II topology (Hanagata2015IFITM5).

Post-translational modifications of IFITM5 include palmitoylation, which is crucial for its function. The conserved cysteine residues (C50, C51, and C84 in humans) are palmitoylated, serving as intramembrane anchors that are essential for targeting IFITM5 to the cell membrane and maintaining its stability (Hanagata2015IFITM5). This modification is important for the protein's localization and interaction with other proteins, such as FKBP11, which is involved in bone mineralization processes (Hanagata2015IFITM5).

There are no known splice variant isoforms of IFITM5. The protein's structure and modifications play a significant role in its function in bone mineralization, although specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure are not provided in the available context.

## Function
IFITM5 is primarily expressed in osteoblasts, where it plays a crucial role in bone formation and mineralization. It is involved in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and function, contributing to the development and maintenance of bone tissue (Hanagata2011Osteoblastenriched; Hanagata2010Characterization). IFITM5 interacts with FKBP11, forming a complex that includes CD81 and FPRP, which is essential for the expression of interferon-induced genes such as Bst2, Irgm, Ifit3, B2m, and MHC class I antigen gene. These genes are associated with both bone formation and immune system activity (Hanagata2011Osteoblastenriched; Tsukamoto2013Role).

The protein undergoes S-palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that involves the addition of palmitic acid to cysteine residues, which is crucial for its interaction with FKBP11. This modification is necessary for the proper localization and function of IFITM5 in osteoblasts, influencing bone mineralization and immune-related gene expression (Tsukamoto2013Role). IFITM5's expression is highly specific to the skeletal system, and its activity is linked to both endochondral and intramembranous ossification during embryogenesis (Hanagata2010Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFITM5 gene are primarily associated with osteogenesis imperfecta type V (OI-V), a genetic disorder characterized by bone fragility and distinctive skeletal abnormalities. OI-V is an autosomal dominant condition that accounts for approximately 4%-5% of osteogenesis imperfecta cases. It is marked by unique clinical features such as calcification of the forearm interosseous membrane, hyperplastic callus formation, and radial head dislocation (Marom2024The; Wu2020A).

The most common mutation linked to OI-V is a recurrent C-T transition (c.-14C>T) in the 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the IFITM5 gene. This mutation introduces an alternative start codon, resulting in the addition of five amino acids to the N-terminus of the protein, which affects bone mineralization and leads to the clinical manifestations of OI-V (Marom2024The; Lietman2014A). 

Other mutations, such as the IFITM5 c.119C>T mutation, have been associated with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, similar to OI type VI, by impairing osteoblast production of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and affecting bone mineralization processes (Hanagata2015IFITM5; Farber2014A).

## Interactions
IFITM5 interacts with several proteins, primarily in osteoblast cells, where it plays a significant role in bone formation and immune activity. A key interaction is with FKBP11, a member of the FK506-binding protein family. This interaction is facilitated by the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 at cysteine residues Cys52 and/or Cys53, which is crucial for the formation of the IFITM5-FKBP11 complex. This complex further associates with CD81 and FPRP, leading to the dissociation of CD9 and the induction of interferon-induced genes such as Bst2, Irgm, Ifit3, B2m, and the MHC class I antigen gene (Hanagata2011Osteoblastenriched; Tsukamoto2013Role).

In fibroblast cells, IFITM5 can interact with CD81, BCAP31, and HSD17b7, although these interactions are nonspecific and do not occur in native osteoblast cells. The S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 is insufficient in fibroblast cells, suggesting that this modification promotes specific interactions with FKBP11 in osteoblasts (Tsukamoto2013Role). The interaction with FKBP11 is significant as it suggests a unique functional mechanism for IFITM5 compared to other IFITM proteins, which have not been shown to interact with other proteins in a similar manner (Tsukamoto2013Role).
