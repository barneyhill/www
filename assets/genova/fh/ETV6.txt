# ETV6

## Overview
ETV6, also known as TEL, is a gene that encodes the ETS variant transcription factor 6, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor and is characterized by its pointed (PNT) domain and ETS DNA-binding domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and DNA binding, respectively (Green2010DNA; De2014Steric). ETV6 plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation, and is essential for the development and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Wang1998The). The protein's ability to form homodimers and heterodimers, along with its interactions with various corepressors, underscores its importance in regulating gene expression (Putnik2007The; Gerak2021Biophysical). Mutations in the ETV6 gene are associated with several hematological malignancies and conditions, including thrombocytopenia and leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance in both hematopoietic disorders and oncogenesis (Feurstein2017Germline; Di2019ETV6-related).

## Structure
ETV6, also known as TEL, is a transcriptional repressor that contains two primary domains: the pointed (PNT) domain and the ETS DNA-binding domain. The PNT domain facilitates protein-protein interactions and is capable of forming stable polymers through head-to-tail self-association, which may influence the DNA-binding properties of the full-length protein (Green2010DNA). The ETS domain is responsible for binding to DNA, specifically recognizing the ETS consensus motif 5′ GGAA 3′. This domain adopts a winged helix-turn-helix fold typical of ETS family proteins (De2014Steric).

The ETV6 protein undergoes autoinhibition through its C-terminal inhibitory domain (CID), which consists of two α-helices. One of these helices blocks the DNA-binding surface of the ETS domain, reducing DNA-binding affinity by approximately 10-fold (Green2010DNA). The inhibitory helix H5 is crucial for this autoinhibition, as it undergoes a folded-to-unfolded transition to allow DNA binding (De2014Steric).

ETV6 can form both homodimers and heterodimers, which influence its function. The protein's structure is further stabilized by specific salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, contributing to its rigidity and stability in both monomeric and heterodimeric forms (Gerak2021Biophysical).

## Function
ETV6, also known as TEL, is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation, particularly within the bone marrow. It is essential for the development and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotential progenitor cells in the bone marrow, ensuring the stable colonization and survival of these cells in the bone marrow microenvironment (Wang1998The). ETV6 is involved in the regulation of adhesive interactions between hematopoietic cells and the bone marrow stroma, which are crucial for the migration, retention, and proliferation of HSCs (Wang1998The).

ETV6 functions as a transcriptional repressor, primarily through its helix-loop-helix (HLH) and ETS domains, interacting with corepressors that recruit histone deacetylases to modulate gene expression (De2014ETV6). It is ubiquitously expressed, with higher levels in the bone marrow, spleen, and thymus, and is localized in the nucleus where it binds specific DNA sequences through its ETS domain (De2014ETV6; Montpetit2001Comparative). ETV6's role extends to embryonic development, where it is crucial for maintaining blood vessel integrity and the survival of various cell types (De2014ETV6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ETV6 gene are associated with a range of hematological malignancies and conditions. Germline mutations in ETV6 are linked to autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia, characterized by decreased platelet numbers and a tendency to bleed, often presenting in childhood (Feurstein2017Germline). These mutations also predispose individuals to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Feurstein2017Germline; Hock2017ETV6). ETV6 mutations are frequently involved in chromosomal translocations, such as the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, which occurs in 22% of children with B-cell ALL (Di2019ETV6-related).

ETV6 mutations can lead to impaired megakaryocyte maturation, contributing to thrombocytopenia (Melazzini2016Clinical). The mutations often occur in the ETS domain, responsible for DNA binding, and can result in decreased transcriptional repression and altered cellular localization (Noetzli2015Germline). In addition to hematological malignancies, ETV6 gene aberrations are implicated in non-hematological cancers through fusion genes, such as ETV6-NTRK3, associated with secretory breast cancer and other solid tumors (Biswas2020ETV6). These genetic alterations highlight ETV6's significant role in both hematopoietic disorders and broader oncogenic processes.

## Interactions
ETV6, also known as TEL, is a transcription factor that participates in various protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in hematopoiesis and oncogenesis. ETV6 interacts with the HIV Tat interacting protein (TIP60), a histone acetyltransferase, through a functional acetyltransferase domain in TIP60. This interaction acts as a corepressor of ETV6, influencing its transcriptional activity (Putnik2007The). ETV6 also interacts with other MYST domain histone acetyltransferases like MOZ and MORF, suggesting a conserved mechanism of interaction (Putnik2007The).

ETV6 forms complexes with the human l(3)mbt polycomb group protein (H-L(3)MBT) through their SPM/SAM domains, indicating a role in transcriptional repression (Boccuni2003The). It can dimerize with the ets-family transcription factor FLI1, inhibiting its transcriptional activity (Putnik2007The; Kwiatkowski1998The). ETV6 also interacts with nuclear corepressors such as mSin3a, N-CoR, and SMRT, which are involved in its function as a transcriptional repressor (Putnik2007The).

Mutations in ETV6 can lead to mislocalization of the protein and its associated repressor complex, HDAC3/NCOR2, resulting in transcriptional dysregulation (Fisher2020ETV6). These interactions highlight ETV6's critical role in regulating gene expression and maintaining normal cellular functions.
