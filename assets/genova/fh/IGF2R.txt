# IGF2R

## Overview
The IGF2R gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in cellular growth and development. This receptor is primarily involved in binding and internalizing insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), thereby regulating its availability and activity. The protein is characterized by its large extracellular region composed of mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domains, which are essential for ligand binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis (Zaccheo2006Kinetics). IGF2R functions as a clearance receptor, trafficking IGF-II to lysosomes for degradation, and is also involved in lysosomal enzyme trafficking, which is vital for cellular homeostasis (Ghosh2003Mannose). Additionally, IGF2R acts as a tumor suppressor, with its loss of function linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Hoyo2009IGF2R).

## Structure
The insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) is a type I transmembrane protein with a large extracellular region composed of 15 homologous domains. These domains are known as mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domains, which are crucial for ligand binding (Zaccheo2006Kinetics). The primary structure of IGF2R includes an N-terminal signal sequence, a transmembrane region, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Zaccheo2006Kinetics).

The secondary structure of IGF2R, particularly domain 11, is characterized by a nine-strand beta-barrel, forming two crossed beta-sheets (Brown2002Structure). This domain is responsible for high-affinity binding to IGF-II, with a hydrophobic pocket playing a key role in this interaction (Brown2007Structure).

The tertiary structure of domain 11 includes additional beta-strands forming a beta-hairpin, and it contains four disulfide bonds, one of which is unique to this domain (Brown2002Structure). The quaternary structure of IGF2R involves weak dimerization, with domain 12 playing a crucial role in this process (Brown2007Structure).

Post-translational modifications of IGF2R include glycosylation, which is common for proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal targeting (Zaccheo2006Kinetics). The protein's structure and function are essential for its role in lysosomal enzyme trafficking and IGF-II binding.

## Function
The IGF2R gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF2R), a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in regulating cell growth and development. IGF2R is primarily involved in binding and internalizing insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), thereby modulating its availability and activity. This process is crucial for maintaining normal embryonic and placental growth, as IGF-II is a key mitogenic peptide hormone involved in these processes (Ghosh2003Mannose; Zaccheo2006Kinetics).

IGF2R functions as a clearance receptor by trafficking excess IGF-II to lysosomes for degradation, preventing its excessive accumulation, which is particularly important during embryonic development (Harris2011IGF2; Ghosh2003Mannose). The receptor also plays a role in lysosomal enzyme trafficking, facilitating the delivery of newly synthesized acid hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes and lysosomes, which is essential for cellular homeostasis (Ghosh2003Mannose).

IGF2R acts as a tumor suppressor, with its loss of function being associated with various tumors. It regulates IGF-II activity by binding it at the cell surface, leading to internalization and degradation within the lysosome, thus preventing tumorigenesis (Ghosh2003Mannose; Zaccheo2006Kinetics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IGF2R gene have been implicated in various cancers and other conditions. The IGF2R gene functions as a tumor suppressor by modulating the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2). Inactivation and loss of heterozygosity of IGF2R are early events in several cancers, including breast, lung, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (Hoyo2009IGF2R). Specific polymorphisms in IGF2R, such as the c.901C>G allele, are associated with an increased risk of esophageal-gastric cardia adenocarcinoma and non-cardia gastric cancer, particularly among white males, irregular or non-users of NSAIDs, and cigarette smokers (Hoyo2009IGF2R).

In mucosal melanomas, IGF2R mutations are significantly more frequent compared to cutaneous melanomas, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of mucosal melanomas (Iida2018Predominance). These mutations may contribute to the distinct mutational landscape of mucosal melanomas, which differ from other melanoma types in their genetic profile (Iida2018Predominance). Despite the high frequency of IGF2R mutations in mucosal melanomas, their direct role in melanoma development remains complex and not fully understood (Wróblewska2021Prognostic).

## Interactions
The insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. IGF2R interacts with insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) primarily through its domain 11, which is essential for high-affinity binding. This interaction is modulated by domain 13, which stabilizes the complex (Brown2007Structure; Delaine2007A). Specific residues such as Phe48, Arg49, and Leu55 in IGF-II are critical for binding to IGF2R-d11 (Roche2006Computational).

IGF2R also binds to the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and plasminogen on domain 1. The interaction with uPAR occurs with a 1:1 stoichiometry and is unaffected by the presence of IGF-II or latent TGF-β. Plasminogen binding can be inhibited by lysine analogues, indicating a binding site involving lysine residues (Brown2009Chapter).

Additionally, IGF2R interacts with latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), although the binding site is not well-defined. The receptor's interaction with mannose-6-phosphate inhibits TGF-β activation, suggesting a competitive binding mechanism (Brown2009Chapter). IGF2R also forms homodimers at the cell surface, with domain 12 playing a significant role in this dimerization process (Brown2007Structure).
