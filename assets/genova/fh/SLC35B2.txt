# SLC35B2

## Overview
SLC35B2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member B2, which functions as a transmembrane transporter. This protein is primarily responsible for the transport of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) into the Golgi apparatus, a critical step in the sulfation of proteins and glycans. Sulfation is a vital post-translational modification that influences protein function, localization, and interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as signaling, adhesion, and growth regulation (Guo2021Sulfation; Thamamongood2020A). The activity of SLC35B2 is essential for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are involved in various biological functions, including pathogen attachment and cellular signaling (Rosmarin2012Attachment). Alterations in the expression or function of SLC35B2 have been linked to several diseases, including cancer, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting its clinical significance (Schlüter2023ClinPrior:; Chimong2014SLC35B2; Mo2020Integrative).

## Function
The SLC35B2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transporter for 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), a crucial substrate for sulfo-modifications in cells. This transporter is responsible for moving PAPS from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen, where sulfation processes occur. These processes include the sulfation of proteins and glycans, which are essential for various cellular functions (Guo2021Sulfation). 

Sulfation is a post-translational modification that affects protein localization and function. In particular, SLC35B2 is involved in the sulfation of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan that plays a significant role in cell signaling, adhesion, and growth regulation (Thamamongood2020A). The sulfation of proteins by SLC35B2 is also crucial for maintaining proper protein localization within the cell, as evidenced by its role in the retention of certain proteins in the Golgi apparatus (Guo2021Sulfation).

In healthy human cells, SLC35B2's activity is vital for the proper functioning of cellular proteoglycans, such as heparan sulfate, which are involved in various biological processes, including pathogen attachment and cellular signaling (Rosmarin2012Attachment). The gene's function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC35B2 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In invasive ductal breast carcinoma, over-expression of SLC35B2 is linked to poor prognosis and is significantly associated with advanced TNM stages III and IV, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker for aggressive breast cancer (Chimong2014SLC35B2). 

In the context of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and cerebellar ataxia (CA), a frameshift deletion variant in SLC35B2 has been identified, indicating its involvement in these genetic disorders (Schlüter2023ClinPrior:). The pathogenicity of SLC35B2 variants has been confirmed through mRNA and protein quantification, classifying them as deleterious (Schlüter2023ClinPrior:).

SLC35B2 has also been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where it was identified as a gene with a potential causal role in the disease through integrative analysis (Mo2020Integrative). Additionally, mutations in SLC35B2 have been linked to skeletal abnormalities in zebrafish models, suggesting potential implications for human skeletal disorders (Wiweger2011Cartilage).

## Interactions
SLC35B2 is involved in the transport of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) into the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in the sulfation of proteins and proteoglycans. This process is essential for the synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are important for various cellular interactions and functions. SLC35B2's role in heparan sulfate biosynthesis implicates it in interactions with other proteins involved in this pathway, such as B4GALT7, which is also essential for heparan sulfate synthesis (Petitjean2020GenomeWide).

In the context of viral infections, SLC35B2 is necessary for the synthesis of heparan sulfate, which acts as a receptor for viral entry. This interaction is crucial for the infection process of viruses like the Schmallenberg virus and Sindbis virus, as heparan sulfate facilitates the initial binding and entry of these viruses into host cells (Petitjean2020GenomeWide; Thamamongood2020A).

SLC35B2 also plays a role in cancer biology, particularly in melanoma, where it affects receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. The gene's involvement in heparan sulfate synthesis influences the activation of RTKs such as ERBB3, EGFR, and AXL, which are associated with drug resistance mechanisms in melanoma (Dieter2022Suppression).
