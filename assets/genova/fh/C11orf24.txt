# C11orf24

## Overview
C11orf24 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 24. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular signaling or transport processes across the cell membrane. The specific biological functions and pathways associated with C11orf24 remain under investigation, but its expression and potential interactions indicate a role in cellular homeostasis and possibly in disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise functions and clinical implications of this gene and its encoded protein.
