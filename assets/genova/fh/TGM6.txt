# TGM6

## Overview
The TGM6 gene encodes the enzyme transglutaminase 6 (TG6), which is a member of the transglutaminase family of proteins. These enzymes are involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through the formation of covalent cross-links, a process essential for maintaining protein function and stability. TG6 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a critical role in neuronal differentiation and development, particularly during neurogenesis. The enzyme is allosterically regulated by calcium ions and guanine nucleotides, which modulate its activity in various cellular processes. Mutations in the TGM6 gene have been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 35 (SCA35), although the pathogenicity of these mutations is still under investigation. Additionally, TG6 is expressed in the skin, contributing to epidermal differentiation and the formation of the cornified cell envelope, which is vital for skin barrier function (Thomas2011Transglutaminase; Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase).

## Structure
The TGM6 gene encodes the transglutaminase 6 (TG6) protein, which consists of 706 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 79,276 Da (Thomas2011Transglutaminase). The primary structure of TG6 includes a sequence of amino acids that form four distinct domains: a β-sandwich, a catalytic core, and two β-barrel domains (Thomas2011Transglutaminase). The catalytic core domain is crucial for the enzyme's activity and shares 59% sequence identity with the catalytic core of TG3 (Thomas2011Transglutaminase).

The tertiary structure of TG6 is modeled based on the high-resolution X-ray structure of human TG3, which includes three bound calcium ions essential for its enzymatic activity (Thomas2011Transglutaminase). The active site of TG6 contains a catalytic triad of residues (C274, H333, and D356) located at the base of a cavity formed by the catalytic core and β-barrel 1 domains (Thomas2011Transglutaminase).

TG6 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in a shorter transcript, TG6-S, which lacks exon 12 and encodes a protein of 625 amino acids (Thomas2011Transglutaminase). This alternative splicing leads to a frame shift and premature termination, potentially affecting the protein's function.

## Function
Transglutaminase 6 (TG6) is an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through the formation of covalent cross-links, which is crucial for maintaining protein function and stability. TG6 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation and development, particularly during neurogenesis. It is abundantly present in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord, suggesting its involvement in motor function and central nervous system development (Thomas2011Transglutaminase).

TG6 is allosterically regulated by calcium ions and guanine nucleotides, with its enzymatic activity being calcium-dependent. This regulation allows TG6 to participate in specific cellular processes, potentially acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor in receptor signaling (Thomas2011Transglutaminase). The enzyme's activity is also influenced by its substrate specificity, which shows a broad tolerance to sequence changes, unlike other transglutaminases such as TG2 (Thomas2011Transglutaminase).

In addition to its role in the central nervous system, TG6 is expressed in the skin, where it contributes to epidermal differentiation and the formation of the cornified cell envelope, which is essential for skin barrier function (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TGM6 gene have been implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 35 (SCA35), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia and cerebellar degeneration. Specific mutations, such as c.1550T-G (L517W) and c.980A-G (D327G), have been identified in families with SCA, suggesting a pathogenic role (Wang2010TGM6). These mutations are located in highly conserved regions of the gene, indicating their potential impact on protein function (Wang2010TGM6).

However, the pathogenicity of TGM6 mutations has been questioned. Some studies have found TGM6 variants in individuals without SCA35 symptoms, suggesting these variants might not be causative (Cheng2021TGM6; Fung2019A). The TGM6 p.L517W variant, in particular, has been found in individuals with other neurological conditions, raising doubts about its specific role in SCA35 (Chen2020TGM6).

Alterations in TGM6 expression have also been associated with immune-mediated ataxia linked to gluten sensitivity, indicating a broader role in neurological disorders (Thomas2011Transglutaminase). Despite these associations, the clinical significance of TGM6 mutations remains uncertain, necessitating further research to clarify their role in neurodegenerative diseases (Cheng2021TGM6).
