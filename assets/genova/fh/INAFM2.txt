# INAFM2

## Overview
INAFM2 is a gene that encodes the protein InaF motif containing 2, which is currently not categorized into a specific protein family such as kinases or receptors due to limited functional characterization. The gene has garnered attention primarily due to its association with various health conditions, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV). Genome-wide association studies have identified significant links between INAFM2 and T2D across diverse populations, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Imamura2016Genomewide). Additionally, INAFM2 is among the top upregulated genes in CTEV, although its specific function in this condition remains to be elucidated (Wang2022Regulation). Despite these associations, the precise biological role of the InaF motif containing 2 protein and its involvement in these diseases are not yet fully understood, necessitating further research to clarify its functional and clinical significance.

## Clinical Significance
The INAFM2 gene has been implicated in the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D). A genome-wide association study identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs67839313 near INAFM2 as significantly associated with T2D across multiple ethnic groups, including Japanese, East Asian, South Asian, European, and Mexican/Latino populations (Imamura2016Genomewide). The study suggests that INAFM2 may play a role in T2D pathogenesis, although the specific function of the protein encoded by INAFM2 remains unknown (Imamura2016Genomewide).

In addition to its association with T2D, INAFM2 has been identified as one of the top 10 significantly upregulated genes in congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), a condition characterized by clubfoot. However, the clinical significance of INAFM2 in CTEV is not fully detailed, and further research is needed to understand its role in this condition (Wang2022Regulation).

Overall, while INAFM2 is associated with certain diseases, its precise clinical significance and the mechanisms by which it influences these conditions require further investigation.
