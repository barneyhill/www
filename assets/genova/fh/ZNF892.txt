# ZNF892

## Overview
ZNF892 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 892, a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are often involved in DNA binding and play critical roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation, and development. The specific functions of zinc finger protein 892 remain to be fully elucidated, but it is believed to participate in gene expression regulation through its interaction with DNA and possibly other proteins. The study of ZNF892 and its encoded protein is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential roles in various cellular pathways and its implications in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
