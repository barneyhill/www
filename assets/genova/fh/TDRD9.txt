# TDRD9

## Overview
TDRD9 is a gene that encodes the protein tudor domain containing 9, which is a crucial component of the piRNA pathway involved in the silencing of transposable elements and the maintenance of genomic integrity in germline cells. The TDRD9 protein is characterized by its extended Tudor (eTudor) domain and RNA helicase domain, classifying it as an RNA helicase. These structural features enable TDRD9 to interact with PIWI proteins and facilitate its role in RNA processing and transposon silencing, particularly in male germ cells. The protein is predominantly expressed in the testis and plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, with its activity being essential for the proper functioning of the piRNA-mediated retrotransposon silencing mechanism. Mutations in the TDRD9 gene have been associated with male infertility conditions, such as oligozoospermia, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health (Shoji2009The; Wang2024A; Babakhanzadeh2020Testicular).

## Structure
The TDRD9 protein is characterized by the presence of an extended Tudor (eTudor) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with PIWI proteins. This domain is composed of a canonical Tudor domain, an alpha-helix linker, and a staphylococcal nuclease-like (SN-like) domain. The canonical Tudor domain forms a barrel-like structure with four to five beta-strands, which facilitates the recognition of methylated arginine or lysine residues through aromatic binding pockets (Gan2019Structure). The eTudor domain of TDRD9 shows a preference for asymmetric dimethylarginine (aDMA) (Gan2019Structure).

TDRD9 also contains an RNA helicase domain, which is essential for its ATPase activity. This activity is crucial for its role in piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing, particularly in male germ cells (Wenda2017Distinct). The helicase domain is encoded by exons 3-18, while the C-terminal Tudor domain is encoded by exons 25-28 (Wenda2017Distinct).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as methylation, which could influence its function. TDRD9 is involved in RNA processing and gene regulation, and its structure supports its role in these processes (Gan2019Structure).

## Function
The TDRD9 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the piRNA pathway, which is essential for silencing transposable elements and maintaining genomic integrity in germline cells. TDRD9 is primarily expressed in the testis and is involved in spermatogenesis, being active in mitotic spermatogonia, meiotic spermatocytes, and haploid spermatids (Wang2024A). The protein functions as an RNA helicase and is part of a complex with MIWI2, crucial for piRNA-mediated retrotransposon silencing, particularly of LINE-1 elements, in the male germline (Shoji2009The).

TDRD9's ATPase activity is vital for its function, facilitating the nuclear accumulation of piRNAs and the transcriptional silencing of transposable elements, although it is not required for piRNA biogenesis itself (Wenda2017Distinct). The protein is involved in maintaining DNA methylation in spermatogonial stem cells, which is crucial for the epigenetic regulation of retrotransposons (Shoji2009The). TDRD9 interacts with PIWI proteins through its Tudor domain, which is essential for its role in RNA processing and transposon silencing (Gan2019Structure). These molecular activities are critical for normal sperm production and function, with mutations in TDRD9 being linked to male infertility conditions such as oligozoospermia (Wang2024A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TDRD9 gene have been linked to oligozoospermia, a condition characterized by a low sperm count, which contributes to male infertility. A study identified a novel compound heterozygous mutation in TDRD9, consisting of a frameshift mutation (c.958delC) and a splicing mutation, in a patient with oligozoospermia. These mutations disrupt the normal splicing and structure of the TDRD9 protein, leading to reduced sperm production (Wang2024A).

TDRD9 is also implicated in the silencing of retrotransposons, such as Line-1, in the male germline. Mutations in TDRD9 can lead to the activation of these retrotransposons, resulting in genomic instability and male sterility due to meiotic failure. This is evidenced by increased levels of DNA double-strand breaks and altered piRNA profiles in TDRD9-deficient models (Shoji2009The).

In non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients, TDRD9 expression is significantly lower, particularly in cases of Sertoli cell-only syndrome, indicating its crucial role in spermatogenesis and fertility (Babakhanzadeh2020Testicular).

## Interactions
TDRD9 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in the piRNA pathway. It forms a complex with MIWI2, essential for piRNA-mediated retrotransposon silencing in the mouse male germline. This interaction is facilitated by the eTudor domains of TDRD9, which recognize symmetrically dimethylated arginine residues on PIWI proteins, including MIWI2 (Shoji2009The; Gan2019Structure). TDRD9 also interacts with MILI, another PIWI protein, forming distinct subcellular compartments that are involved in the piRNA pathway (Shoji2009The).

In addition to its interactions with PIWI proteins, TDRD9 is associated with processing bodies in spermatocytes, where it is enriched with DDX6 and GWB antigens, markers of these cellular structures (Shoji2009The). TDRD9's interaction with MIWI2 is independent of germ-cell-specific factors, but its localization is influenced by MILI, as evidenced by the loss of granular localization in Mili mutants (Shoji2009The). These interactions highlight TDRD9's role in maintaining genomic integrity by repressing retrotransposon activity and facilitating piRNA biogenesis (Shoji2009The; Babakhanzadeh2020Testicular).
