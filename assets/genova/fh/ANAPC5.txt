# ANAPC5

## Overview
ANAPC5 is a gene that encodes the protein anaphase-promoting complex subunit 5, which is a critical component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is a multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation by facilitating the transition from metaphase to anaphase through targeted protein degradation. ANAPC5 is part of the scaffolding sub-complex within the APC/C, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the complex by connecting the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) arm to the catalytic core (Zhou2016Insights). Beyond its role in mitosis, ANAPC5 is involved in non-mitotic functions, including neuronal structure and function, and acts as a negative regulator in IL-17 signaling pathways, highlighting its broader significance in cellular homeostasis and immune response (Manchado2010The; Ho2013The).

## Function
ANAPC5 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. The APC/C is responsible for the transition from metaphase to anaphase by targeting specific proteins for degradation, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability (Manchado2010The; Zhou2016Insights). ANAPC5 is part of the scaffolding sub-complex within the APC/C, which connects the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) arm to the catalytic core, playing a critical role in the structural integrity and function of the complex (Zhou2016Insights).

In healthy human cells, ANAPC5 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell division, differentiation, and genome stability (Zhou2016Insights). The APC/C, with ANAPC5 as a component, is also involved in non-mitotic functions such as neuronal structure and function, highlighting its broader role in cellular homeostasis (Manchado2010The). Through its involvement in the APC/C, ANAPC5 plays a vital role in maintaining cellular order and preventing genomic instability, which is crucial for normal cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANAPC5 gene have been associated with various cancers. ANAPC5 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is crucial for cell cycle regulation. Studies have shown that mutations in ANAPC5 and other APC/C subunits occur in a significant percentage of cancer patients, with 14% of queried samples showing at least one APC/C mutation. These mutations are linked to several cancer types, including kidney, breast, bowel, prostate, pancreatic, lung, cervical, ovarian, liver cancer, melanoma, and glioma (Melloy2019The). ANAPC5 mutations often co-occur with alterations in other APC/C subunits, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Melloy2019The).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), alterations in ANAPC5 have been implicated in resistance to TTK inhibitors, a class of drugs used in cancer treatment. The impairment of APC/C components, including ANAPC5, is associated with drug resistance, indicating that changes in ANAPC5 may affect treatment outcomes in TNBC (Thu2018Disruption).

ANAPC5 also plays a role in IL-17-mediated signal transduction, acting as an inhibitor. Alterations in its expression can enhance IL-17-dependent signaling, which is involved in inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases (Ho2013The).

## Interactions
ANAPC5 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involved in cell cycle regulation. ANAPC5 is part of the scaffolding platform of the APC/C, which connects the TPR arm to the catalytic core, facilitating the ubiquitination process (Zhou2016Insights). It interacts with other APC/C subunits, such as ANAPC3 and ANAPC6, and is involved in the microtubule localization of the complex (Cao2022Proximity).

ANAPC5 also participates in inhibitory interactions within the IL-17 signaling pathway. It associates with IL-17RA and IL-17RC receptors, forming a complex that includes AnapC7, and specifically binds to the C-terminal domain of IL-17RA, known as the C/EBPb-activation domain (CBAD) (Ho2013The). This interaction is linked to inhibitory signaling, as knockdown of ANAPC5 results in increased IL-17-dependent IL-6 expression, indicating its role as a negative regulator (Ho2013The).

ANAPC5 interacts with the deubiquitinating enzyme A20, a known negative regulator of IL-17 signaling, suggesting that ANAPC5 may facilitate the recruitment of A20 to the CBAD domain of IL-17RA, enhancing its inhibitory function (Ho2013The). This interaction highlights ANAPC5's role as a novel adaptor and negative regulator in IL-17 signaling pathways (Ho2013The).
