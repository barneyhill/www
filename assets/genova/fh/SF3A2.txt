# SF3A2

## Overview
SF3A2, or splicing factor 3a subunit 2, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by SF3A2 is categorized as a splicing factor and plays a pivotal role in the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNA, a critical step in mRNA maturation and gene expression regulation (Pellacani2018Splicing). Beyond its primary function in splicing, the SF3A2 protein is also involved in mitotic chromosome segregation, where it interacts with the Ndc80 complex to ensure proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment during cell division (Pellacani2018Splicing). This dual functionality underscores its importance in both gene expression and cell cycle regulation. Additionally, SF3A2 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including myelodysplastic syndromes and myocardial infarction, highlighting its potential as a disease modifier and its involvement in pathogenesis (Nandakumar2018Genecentric; Hirokawa2014A).

## Function
SF3A2 (splicing factor 3a subunit 2) is a crucial component of the spliceosome, primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It plays a significant role in the assembly of the spliceosome, facilitating the accurate removal of introns from pre-mRNA, which is essential for the regulation of gene expression and mRNA maturation (Pellacani2018Splicing). Beyond its canonical role in splicing, SF3A2 has been implicated in mitotic chromosome segregation. In human HeLa cells, SF3A2 localizes to the nucleus during interphase and associates with the spindle during metaphase. Its interaction with the Ndc80 complex, particularly with the kinetochore protein HEC1, is crucial for proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment during mitosis (Pellacani2018Splicing). Depletion of SF3A2 leads to mitotic defects, such as irregular spindles and reduced metaphase frequency, indicating its role in maintaining spindle function and chromosome alignment (Pellacani2018Splicing). These findings suggest that SF3A2 has a direct and conserved role in mitosis, independent of its splicing functions, highlighting its importance in cell cycle regulation and proper cell division (Pellacani2018Splicing).

## Clinical Significance
The SF3A2 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in pre-mRNA splicing. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), SF3A2 acts as a potential disease modifier. Studies have shown that suppression of SF3A2 in cells leads to differential expression of genes involved in ribosomal structure, worsening erythroid differentiation and cell growth defects in mouse models with the Sf3b1 K700E mutation, which mimics MDS (Nandakumar2018Genecentric). Genetic variations at the SF3A2 locus may influence phenotypic variation in MDS, suggesting its role in modulating erythropoiesis defects (Nandakumar2018Genecentric).

SF3A2 has also been identified as part of a susceptibility locus for myocardial infarction in a Japanese population. The AP3D1-DOT1L-SF3A2 locus on chromosome 19p13.3 was associated with myocardial infarction, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of this condition through mechanisms related to atherosclerosis (Hirokawa2014A).

In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), SF3A2 is involved in the spliceosome pathway, which is enriched in KIT-mutant GISTs. This suggests a possible link between SF3A2 and the progression of these tumors (Heinrich2019Genomic).

## Interactions
SF3A2 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in mitotic chromosome segregation and pre-mRNA splicing. It physically interacts with the Ndc80 complex, specifically binding to Ndc80 and Nuf2 subunits, which are essential for kinetochore function during mitosis. These interactions have been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown experiments, demonstrating that SF3A2 binds directly to these components (Pellacani2018Splicing). In HeLa cells, SF3A2 also interacts with HEC1, the human ortholog of Ndc80, during the M phase of the cell cycle, indicating a specific role in mitotic progression (Pellacani2018Splicing).

SF3A2's interaction with spindle microtubules is also significant. It binds to taxol-stabilized microtubules in vitro, with over 80% of the protein co-sedimenting with microtubules, suggesting a direct role in mitotic chromosome segregation (Pellacani2018Splicing). This binding is ionic, as it is reduced by increasing NaCl concentration, indicating that the interaction is not mediated by RNA molecules (Pellacani2018Splicing).

In addition to its mitotic roles, SF3A2 is a component of the spliceosome, interacting with other spliceosomal proteins such as SF3B1, SF3B2, and SF3B3, forming part of the U2 snRNP complex. These interactions facilitate splice site recognition and catalysis, highlighting SF3A2's dual role in splicing and mitosis.
