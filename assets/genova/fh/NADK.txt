# NADK

## Overview
NADK is a gene that encodes the enzyme NAD kinase, a critical component in cellular metabolism. NAD kinase is a cytoplasmic enzyme that functions as a kinase, specifically catalyzing the phosphorylation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to produce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). This reaction is essential for maintaining the cellular pool of NADPH, a vital cofactor involved in biosynthetic processes and the cellular defense against oxidative stress (Lerner2001Structural; Pollak2007NAD). The enzyme operates as a homotetramer and exhibits high substrate specificity for NAD and ATP, requiring divalent cations such as zinc and manganese for its activity (Lerner2001Structural). Regulation of NAD kinase activity is influenced by the redox state of the cell, with NADPH acting as an inhibitor, and it is also modulated by signaling pathways such as the PI3K-Akt pathway (Hoxhaj2019Direct). The gene and its encoded enzyme play significant roles in cellular redox balance and have been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer, where alterations in NADK expression can affect tumor growth and survival (Ju2020NADPH).

## Structure
The human NAD kinase (NADK) is a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 49 kDa, consisting of 446 amino acids (Lerner2001Structural). The primary structure of NADK was identified through sequence homology with prokaryotic NAD kinases, revealing significant similarities with a hypothetical human protein, FLJ13052 (Lerner2001Structural). The enzyme forms a homotetramer, with a total molecular mass of about 200 kDa, as determined by gel filtration experiments (Lerner2001Structural). 

The quaternary structure of NADK is a catalytically active homotetramer, which contrasts with the hexameric forms found in some prokaryotic organisms like E. coli (Lerner2001Structural). The enzyme's catalytic properties include high substrate specificity for NAD and ATP, and it does not phosphorylate NAD analogs under the assay conditions used (Lerner2001Structural). 

NADK activity is regulated by the redox state of the cell, with NADPH acting as an inhibitor (Lerner2001Structural). The enzyme's activity may also be stimulated by calcium/calmodulin in certain cells, although this response is not universal across all species (Love2015NAD).

## Function
NAD kinase (NADK) is a crucial enzyme in human cells responsible for the phosphorylation of NAD+ to form NADP+, which is essential for maintaining the cellular NADPH pool. NADPH is a key cofactor in various biosynthetic reactions and plays a vital role in cellular defense against oxidative stress (Lerner2001Structural; Pollak2007NAD). NADK is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it preferentially phosphorylates NAD+ over NADH, although it can phosphorylate NADH under certain conditions (Pollak2007NAD).

The enzyme functions as a homotetramer and is highly selective for its substrates, NAD and ATP, requiring divalent cations such as zinc and manganese for its activity (Lerner2001Structural). NADK activity is regulated by the redox state of the cell, with NADPH inhibiting its catalytic activity, thus playing a critical role in maintaining cellular redox balance (Lerner2001Structural).

NADK's activity is also influenced by signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-Akt pathway, which can enhance its activity through phosphorylation, thereby increasing NADP+ and NADPH production in response to growth signals (Hoxhaj2019Direct). This regulation is crucial for supporting cellular metabolic functions and oxidative stress responses (Pollak2007NAD).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NADK gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. Overexpression of cytosolic NADK (cNADK) is observed in various tumor types, as indicated by data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This overexpression is associated with increased NADPH levels, which can reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promote cancer cell survival. A specific cNADK mutant, NADK-I90F, found in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients, exhibits heightened enzyme activity, leading to elevated NADPH and decreased ROS levels, thereby supporting tumor growth (Ju2020NADPH).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and colon cancer, silencing cNADK with shRNA impairs NADPH levels and suppresses cancer cell growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ju2020NADPH). Alterations in NADK expression also affect oxidative stress responses. Overexpression of NADK decreases ROS levels by 20%, while knockdown increases ROS by 25%, impacting cell survival under oxidative stress conditions (Pollak2007NAD). These findings suggest that NADK plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox balance, and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer and other oxidative stress-related conditions.

## Interactions
NAD kinase (NADK) in humans is involved in several interactions that influence its activity and function. One significant interaction is with protein kinase C (PKC), particularly the PKCδ isoform, which phosphorylates NADK. This phosphorylation does not directly alter NADK's enzymatic activity but may affect its interaction with other molecules, potentially increasing its activity indirectly by promoting the dissociation of an inhibitory molecule (Rabani2020Protein). 

NADK is also regulated by calcium/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent mechanisms, although human NADK is generally insensitive to direct Ca2+/CaM activation. In other species, such as sea urchins, NADK activity is modulated by Ca2+/CaM, suggesting evolutionary divergence in regulatory mechanisms (Love2015NAD). 

The enzyme forms a homotetramer, which is a common structural feature that may facilitate interactions with other proteins or complexes (Lerner2001Structural). These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative damage, as NADK levels influence the concentration of NADPH, a key molecule in oxidative stress response (Pollak2007NAD).
