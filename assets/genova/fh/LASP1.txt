# LASP1

## Overview
LASP1 (LIM and SH3 protein 1) is a gene that encodes a cytoskeletal protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, proliferation, and cytoskeletal organization. The LASP1 protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes an N-terminal LIM domain, a C-terminal SH3 domain, and two internal nebulin-like actin-binding repeats. These domains facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its binding to actin, playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling pathways (Schreiber1998Lasp1; Grunewald2008The). LASP1 is expressed in multiple tissues and is implicated in several physiological functions, such as synaptic transmission in neurons and kidney function. Additionally, LASP1 is involved in chemokine signaling and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which are vital for cell cycle control and survival (Butt2022LASP1). Dysregulation of LASP1 expression and function is associated with various cancers and diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology and other medical fields (Beckmann2021Lasp1; Zhao2015LASP1).

## Structure
The LASP1 protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes an N-terminal LIM domain, a C-terminal SH3 domain, and two internal nebulin-like actin-binding repeats (Schreiber1998Lasp1; Chew2002Lasp1). The LIM domain is a zinc-finger-like structure involved in protein-protein interactions, while the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences, facilitating interactions with other proteins (Schreiber1998Lasp1; Grunewald2008The). The nebulin-like repeats, R1 and R2, enable LASP1 to bind actin, which is crucial for its role in cytoskeletal dynamics (Schreiber1998Lasp1; Grunewald2008The).

LASP1 is subject to phosphorylation, which modulates its interaction with actin and affects its localization within the cell. Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) influences its binding affinity to actin, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for its function in actin assembly (Chew2000The; Chew2002Lasp1). The protein is also phosphorylated at serine 146, affecting its cytosolic localization (Grunewald2008The).

LASP1 is expressed in various tissues and is involved in cell migration, proliferation, and cytoskeletal organization, indicating its importance in cellular processes and cancer progression (Grunewald2008The).

## Function
The LASP1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, particularly during cell motility. It is localized at the plasma membrane and in actin-rich subcellular structures such as lamellipodia, filopodia, pseudopodia, and invadopodia. LASP1 binds to F-actin via its SH3 domain and the first nebulin repeat, although it does not bind to G-actin. Phosphorylation of LASP1 at specific sites by PKA and PKG can alter its binding to F-actin and its localization within the cell (Butt2022LASP1).

In addition to its role in cytoskeletal dynamics, LASP1 is involved in synaptic transmission in neurons, where it is concentrated in synaptic sites of hippocampal neurons and is necessary for the development and maintenance of neuronal circuitry. It is also crucial for kidney function, particularly in maintaining the integrity of the slit membrane in podocytes, which are part of the kidney's filtration unit (Butt2022LASP1).

LASP1 is involved in chemokine signaling, interacting with chemokine receptors such as CXCR2 and CXCR4, and is implicated in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is vital for cell cycle control and survival. It is also part of the cadherin-catenin adhesion complex, essential for cell-cell adherens junctions (Butt2022LASP1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the LASP1 gene are implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), LASP1 is a target gene of HIF-1α and is critical for cancer metastasis. Its overexpression is associated with larger primary tumors, more metastatic lesions, and worse overall survival in PDAC patients (Zhao2015LASP1). In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), LASP1 down-regulation promotes cell persistence, proliferation, and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, contributing to treatment resistance and disease progression (Herrmann2020Knockout).

In lung cancer, LASP1 is overexpressed and associated with increased cell proliferation and invasion. Silencing LASP1 reduces these processes, indicating its role in cancer progression (Shi2017Role). In breast cancer, LASP1 overexpression correlates with poor long-term survival and is linked to increased cell proliferation during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Frietsch2010Nuclear). LASP1 also plays a role in rheumatoid arthritis, where its increased expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes is associated with aggressive joint inflammation (Beckmann2021Lasp1). These findings highlight LASP1's involvement in cancer progression, metastasis, and other disease phenotypes.

## Interactions
LASP1 (LIM and SH3 protein 1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. It interacts with the 140 kDa isoform of palladin through its SH3 domain, which binds to a poly-proline motif in palladin. This interaction is isoform-specific, as the 90 kDa isoform of palladin does not bind to LASP1. The 140 kDa isoform is essential for recruiting LASP1 to stress fibers, which are actin-rich structures required for cell motility (Rachlin2006Identification).

LASP1 also interacts with ZO-2, a cytosolic scaffold protein, through its SH3 domain. This interaction is part of a signal transduction pathway that involves the phosphorylation of LASP1 by PKA at serine 146, facilitating the translocation of the LASP1/ZO-2 complex into the nucleus. ZO-2 acts as a nuclear shuttling partner for LASP1, and their interaction is crucial for the nuclear import of LASP1 (Mihlan2012Nuclear).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, LASP1 directly interacts with HSPA1A, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays and Western blot analysis. This interaction is associated with the promotion of cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion (Chen2019LASP1).
