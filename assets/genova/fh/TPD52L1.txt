# TPD52L1

## Overview
TPD52L1 is a gene that encodes the protein TPD52-like 1, which is part of the tumor protein D52 (TPD52) family. This family of proteins is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and apoptosis. TPD52-like 1 is implicated in oncogenic activities, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC), where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics (Hong2021Transcriptomic). The protein is also involved in the molecular mechanisms of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), suggesting a broader role in disease pathology (Khayer2024S100a9). As a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, TPD52L1 is of significant interest in cancer research and other disease contexts.

## Clinical Significance
The TPD52L1 gene is clinically significant in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). High expression levels of TPD52L1 are associated with poor prognosis, as indicated by a hazard ratio of 3.218, and correlate with lower overall survival rates and earlier relapse in CRC patients (Hong2021Transcriptomic). Immunohistochemistry analysis has shown that the protein encoded by TPD52L1, hD53, is present in all CRC tumor tissues but rarely in normal colon epithelium. High expression of hD53 is significantly linked to lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and advanced clinical stages of CRC (Hong2021Transcriptomic).

TPD52L1 overexpression promotes oncogenic behaviors such as increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation in CRC cell lines, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Hong2021Transcriptomic). The gene's expression patterns during the adenoma to carcinoma transition are significant, potentially playing a critical role in malignant transformation (Hong2021Transcriptomic). These findings suggest that TPD52L1 could serve as a biomarker for CRC prognosis and treatment response, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Hong2021Transcriptomic). 

In chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), TPD52L1 is part of a gene triplet with S100a9 and Cd14, which may play a role in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Khayer2024S100a9).
