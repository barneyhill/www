# CD72

## Overview
CD72 is a gene that encodes the CD72 protein, a type II transmembrane protein predominantly expressed on B cells. The CD72 protein functions as an inhibitory receptor, playing a crucial role in the regulation of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. It contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic domain, which, upon phosphorylation, recruit the phosphatase SHP-1 to attenuate BCR signaling pathways. This regulatory mechanism is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing overactivation of B cells. Beyond B cells, CD72 is also expressed on other immune cells, including T cells, NK cells, and mast cells, where it similarly modulates cellular responses. The interaction of CD72 with its ligand, CD100, further influences immune responses by modulating cytokine production and cell proliferation. Additionally, CD72 has been implicated in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where genetic variations in the CD72 gene may affect disease susceptibility and progression (Ishida2003Involvement; Hitomi2012Human; Tsubata2019CD72).

## Structure
The CD72 protein is a type II transmembrane protein primarily expressed on B cells. It is composed of an extracellular C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) (Bie2007Various). The primary structure of CD72 includes a sequence of 365 amino acids, with alternative transcripts differing slightly at the C-terminal end (Bie2007Various). 

The secondary structure features a coiled coil domain predicted between residues 120-218, which may stabilize homodimerization, and the CTLD located at residues 237-351 (Bie2007Various). The tertiary structure involves the spatial arrangement of these domains, contributing to the protein's functional conformation. CD72 forms a disulfide-linked homodimer on the cell membrane, indicating a quaternary structure that facilitates its role in B-cell regulation (Bie2007Various).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation of the ITIM domain, which is crucial for its inhibitory function. This phosphorylation recruits the phosphatase SHP1, leading to inhibition of B-cell receptor signaling (Bie2007Various). CD72 also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may affect its function (Ying1995Structure).

## Function
CD72 is a type II transmembrane protein expressed primarily on B cells, where it functions as an inhibitory co-receptor. It contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic region, which recruits the phosphatase SHP-1 upon phosphorylation. This interaction negatively regulates B cell receptor (BCR) signaling by decreasing the phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and reducing calcium influx, thereby modulating B cell activation and proliferation (Hitomi2012Human).

CD72 is also expressed on other immune cells, including T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells. In mast cells, CD72 negatively regulates KIT-mediated responses, such as growth, chemotaxis, and degranulation, by recruiting SHP-1 and inhibiting the phosphorylation of signaling molecules like Src family kinases and ERK1/2 MAPKs (Kataoka2010CD72). This regulatory function helps maintain immune homeostasis and prevents excessive activation of immune cells.

The interaction between CD72 and its natural ligand, CD100, can modulate immune responses by influencing cytokine production and B cell proliferation, highlighting its role in both humoral and cellular immunity (Ishida2003Involvement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD72 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly lupus nephritis. CD72 functions as a negative regulator of B cell responses, and its deficiency or altered expression can lead to the development of severe lupus-like disease in mice, characterized by glomerulonephritis and the production of autoantibodies (Tsubata2019Inhibitory; Tsubata2019CD72). In humans, an intronic polymorphism in the CD72 locus has been associated with lupus nephritis, although genome-wide association studies have not confirmed a strong link between CD72 and SLE, possibly due to the lack of common variants with significant functional differences (Tsubata2019CD72).

CD72 polymorphisms, particularly those affecting alternative splicing, have been shown to modify susceptibility to SLE through interactions with the FCGR2B gene. The presence of specific CD72 alleles can influence the risk of SLE and lupus nephritis, with certain alleles potentially reducing susceptibility conferred by other genetic factors (Hitomi2004CD72). These findings suggest that CD72 polymorphisms and their interactions with other genes play a significant role in the clinical manifestation of autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
CD72 is a type II membrane protein primarily expressed on B lineage cells and functions as a negative regulator of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. It contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic region, which, upon phosphorylation, recruits the SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). This interaction leads to the downmodulation of BCR signaling by dephosphorylating various signaling molecules activated by BCR ligation (Nitschke2004Molecular; Tsubata2019CD72).

CD72 also interacts with Grb2, although the functional significance of this interaction is not fully understood (Nitschke2004Molecular). CD100, a membrane-bound semaphorin, has been identified as a ligand for CD72. Interaction with CD100 reduces phosphorylation of CD72 and its recruitment of SHP-1, suggesting that CD100 positively regulates B-cell activation by reducing signal inhibition by CD72 (Nitschke2004Molecular).

In addition to its membrane-bound form, CD72 has a soluble form (sCD72) that interacts with CD6 on CD4+ T cells. This interaction induces proliferation and enhances the activity of CD4+ T cells by activating the SLP-76, AKT, and mTOR signaling pathways (Eiza2024Soluble).
