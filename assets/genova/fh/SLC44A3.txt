# SLC44A3

## Overview
SLC44A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 44 member 3, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of choline and other molecules across cellular membranes. This protein is characterized by its eight transmembrane domains and is part of the solute carrier family, which is known for facilitating the movement of various substrates across biological membranes (yaworski2017regulation). SLC44A3 is expressed in several tissues, including the kidneys and digestive tract, and plays a role in choline absorption and transport, although its precise function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Hartiala2021Genomewide; Hedtke2019Choline). The gene's expression is subject to circadian regulation, with its mRNA stability and translation being influenced by interactions with cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding proteins (Kojima2012Circadian). SLC44A3 has also been implicated in clinical conditions such as exertional rhabdomyolysis, particularly in individuals with sickle cell trait, highlighting its potential significance in muscle physiology and pathology (Ren2024GenomeWide).

## Structure
The SLC44A3 gene encodes a protein that is 653 amino acids in length with a molecular weight of 73.7 kDa. This protein is characterized by the presence of 8 transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function in the plasma membrane (yaworski2017regulation). These transmembrane domains suggest a role in transporting molecules across cellular membranes, typical of solute carrier family proteins. The protein also contains 5 glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that can influence protein folding, stability, and function (yaworski2017regulation).

There are 5 predicted splice variants of the SLC44A3 gene, although these have not been experimentally confirmed (yaworski2017regulation). The expression of SLC44A3 is notably higher in the kidneys and along the digestive tract, indicating a potential role in choline absorption from food (yaworski2017regulation). Despite the detailed information on its transmembrane domains and glycosylation sites, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of the SLC44A3 protein are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The SLC44A3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the solute carrier family, specifically involved in choline transport. This protein is suggested to function as a choline-like transporter, although its specific role in choline transport in healthy human cells remains unclear (Hartiala2021Genomewide; Hedtke2019Choline). SLC44A3 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, ileum, and colon, but is not prominently detected in the nervous system (Traiffort2013The).

In terms of molecular processes, SLC44A3 is implicated in the transport of inorganic cations and anions, potentially playing a role during exercise and muscle contraction (Ren2024GenomeWide). The protein is expressed in skeletal muscle and kidney tissues, which are often affected in exertional rhabdomyolysis, suggesting its involvement in these processes (Ren2024GenomeWide).

The gene's expression is regulated by circadian mechanisms, with its mRNA poly(A) tail length being influenced by cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, particularly CPEB2, which affects its protein expression levels (Kojima2012Circadian). Despite these insights, the precise function of SLC44A3 in healthy human cells requires further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC44A3 gene has been implicated in exertional rhabdomyolysis (ERM), particularly in individuals with sickle cell trait (SCT). A genome-wide association study identified a significant association between the SLC44A3 gene variant rs115958260 and ERM in SCT-positive African Americans. This variant showed a tenfold difference in minor allele frequency between cases and controls, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of ERM (Ren2024GenomeWide). The SLC44A3 gene is involved in choline transport, which is crucial for membrane integrity and function. Mutations in related genes have been linked to muscle damage and neurodegenerative diseases, indicating that SLC44A3 may contribute to ERM through similar mechanisms (Ren2024GenomeWide).

The study suggests that the SLC44A3 gene's role in choline transport and membrane integrity could be crucial during exercise and muscle contraction, potentially leading to ERM in susceptible individuals (Ren2024GenomeWide). However, the exact functional role of SLC44A3 in ERM and its interaction with environmental factors like strenuous physical activity require further investigation (Ren2024GenomeWide).

## Interactions
SLC44A3, a member of the solute carrier family, is involved in specific interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that regulate its function and expression. Notably, SLC44A3 mRNA interacts with CPEB2, a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the poly(A) tail length of SLC44A3 mRNA, which in turn affects its protein expression levels. The interaction between CPEB2 and SLC44A3 mRNA has been confirmed through cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and PCR analysis, demonstrating that CPEB2 binds specifically to SLC44A3 mRNA, influencing its translation and stability (Kojima2012Circadian).

CPEB1 also plays a role in modulating the poly(A) tail length of SLC44A3 mRNA, although it does not directly interact with the mRNA as CPEB2 does. The presence of CPEB1 and CPEB2 increases the poly(A) tail length, leading to enhanced protein expression, while their knockdown results in reduced poly(A) tail length and protein levels (Kojima2012Circadian). These interactions highlight the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in the expression of SLC44A3.
