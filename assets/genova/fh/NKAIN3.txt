# NKAIN3

## Overview
NKAIN3 is a gene that encodes the sodium/potassium transporting ATPase interacting 3 protein, a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of ion transport across cell membranes. This protein is part of the NKAIN family and is known for its interaction with the β subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, an enzyme critical for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions. These gradients are essential for various cellular processes, including nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction (Gorokhova2007A; Wu2023Association). NKAIN3 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in neurons, where it is implicated in neuronal membrane processes and potentially in forming channels or affecting other membrane proteins (Gorokhova2007A). The protein's role in maintaining Na+/K+ gradients is crucial for cellular homeostasis, energy metabolism, and signaling pathways, highlighting its importance in cellular viability and function (Major2012GenomeWide). Additionally, genetic studies have suggested a potential regulatory role of NKAIN3 in male sexual orientation, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully understood (Sanders2017Genome-Wide).

## Function
NKAIN3 is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of ion transport across cell membranes. This protein interacts with the β subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, a crucial enzyme for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This interaction is essential for various cellular processes, including nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction (Gorokhova2007A; Wu2023Association).

In healthy human cells, NKAIN3 is expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in neurons, where it is thought to play a role in neuronal membrane processes. Although the specific functions of NKAIN3 in healthy cells are not fully defined, it is suggested to be involved in membrane-related functions, possibly forming channels or affecting other membrane proteins (Gorokhova2007A).

NKAIN3's role in maintaining Na+/K+ gradients is critical for cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways. Its interaction with Na,K-ATPase is important for energy metabolism and ion regulation, which are essential for cellular functions such as sperm motility and metabolism (Wu2023Association). The protein's activity in the plasma membrane underscores its significance in maintaining cellular viability and function (Major2012GenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
NKAIN3 is a member of the NKAIN protein family, which interacts with the β subunits of the Na,K-ATPase, a crucial enzyme for maintaining ion gradients across cellular membranes. This interaction is significant for cellular functions such as ion regulation and energy metabolism. In sperm cells, NKAIN3 interacts with the β1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase, playing a crucial role in sperm motility and metabolism by regulating ion gradients and energy metabolism (Wu2023Association).

While specific interactions of NKAIN3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, the NKAIN family, including NKAIN3, is known for its evolutionary conservation and potential membrane-related functions. These proteins are expressed in the central nervous system and are localized to cell membranes, suggesting a role in neuronal function (Gorokhova2007A). The NKAIN proteins, including NKAIN3, are characterized by highly conserved transmembrane domains, indicating their involvement in membrane-associated processes (Gorokhova2007A).

In a genome-wide association study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the NKAIN3 gene was associated with male sexual orientation, suggesting a potential regulatory role in this context (Sanders2017Genome-Wide). However, the specific mechanisms and interaction partners of NKAIN3 in this regard remain to be fully elucidated.
