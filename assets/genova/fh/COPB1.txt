# COPB1

## Overview
The COPB1 gene encodes the β-COP protein, a critical component of the coatomer protein complex I (COPI), which is involved in intracellular transport processes. The β-COP protein functions as a subunit within the COPI complex, which is essential for retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum. This transport is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by recycling proteins and lipids. The β-COP protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a trunk domain with an α-solenoid structure, which facilitates its interaction with other COPI subunits and the small GTPase ARF1. These interactions are vital for vesicle formation and trafficking. Beyond its role in vesicular transport, COPB1 is implicated in lipid metabolism and mRNA transport, particularly in neurons, where it aids in the transport and translation of specific mRNAs. Mutations in COPB1 have been linked to severe developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in human health and development (Bi2007Copb1facilitated; Macken2021Biallelic; Chen2021An).

## Structure
The COPB1 gene encodes the β-COP protein, a subunit of the coatomer protein complex I (COPI), which is essential for retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum. The β-COP protein is composed of two main structural domains: the trunk domain and the appendage domain. The trunk domain features an α-solenoid structure, which includes a helix-turn-helix motif crucial for its function (Macken2021Biallelic).

A specific splice site mutation, c.957+1G>T, leads to the skipping of exon 8, resulting in a 108-bp deletion and an in-frame deletion of 36 amino acids. This mutation causes the loss of a helix-turn-helix motif from the α-solenoid structure, affecting the interaction between β-COP and β'-COP (COPB2) within the COPI complex (Macken2021Biallelic). Another variant, p.Phe551Val, is a missense mutation located in a turn or loop connecting two alpha helices, potentially impacting the protein's folding and structural integrity (Macken2021Biallelic).

The β-COP protein is part of the quaternary structure of the COPI complex, which consists of seven subunits. This complex plays a critical role in vesicle formation and trafficking, associating with ARF1 molecules to select cargo and facilitate vesicle budding and scission (Macken2021Biallelic).

## Function
The COPB1 gene encodes the beta-subunit of the coatomer protein I (COPI) complex, which is essential for retrograde trafficking of proteins and lipids from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Macken2021Biallelic). The COPI complex, composed of seven subunits including β-COP, plays a critical role in returning ER-resident proteins from the Golgi to the ER, recycling transmembrane cargo receptors, and facilitating intra-Golgi retrograde transport (Macken2021Biallelic). The β-COP subunit is part of the adaptor-like subcomplex of COPI, analogous to clathrin adaptor AP subcomplexes, and is recruited to vesicles by ARF1, a small GTPase, which binds to the trunk domains of β-COP and γ-COP subunits, leading to vesicle formation and scission (Macken2021Biallelic).

COPB1 is also involved in lipid droplet formation and lipolysis, highlighting its role in lipid homeostasis (Macken2021Biallelic). In neurons, COPB1 facilitates the transport and translation of κ opioid-receptor mRNA, indicating its involvement in mRNA transport and localized protein synthesis (Bi2007Copb1facilitated). The gene's expression is notably high in immune cells, suggesting a role in immune function and regulation (Chen2021An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COPB1 gene are associated with a novel genetic disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, cataracts, and variable microcephaly. This condition is linked to biallelic variants in COPB1, which encodes the beta-subunit of the coat protein complex I (COPI) (Macken2021Biallelic). In one family, a homozygous splice donor site variant leads to aberrant transcripts and a 36 amino acid in-frame deletion, disrupting the interaction between β-COP and β'-COP, crucial components of the COPI complex (Macken2021Biallelic). In another family, a missense variant results in defective Golgi to ER recycling, with the mutant β-COP protein being retained in the Golgi, indicating a potential impairment in its function (Macken2021Biallelic).

The study also highlights the role of COPB1 mutations in causing severe developmental disorders, as evidenced by experiments in Xenopus tropicalis, which replicated human phenotypes such as microcephaly and cataracts (Macken2021Biallelic). These findings underscore the essential role of COPI subunits in brain development and human health, situating COPB1 within the broader context of 'coatopathies,' a group of conditions linked to coat protein complex dysfunctions (Macken2021Biallelic).

## Interactions
The COPB1 gene encodes the β-COP protein, a subunit of the COPI complex, which is involved in retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum. β-COP interacts with other subunits of the COPI complex, including γ-COP, forming part of the F-subcomplex that is crucial for vesicle formation and scission. This interaction is facilitated by the binding of ARF1, a small GTPase, to the trunk domains of β-COP and γ-COP, which is essential for COPI recruitment to vesicles (Macken2021Biallelic).

β-COP is also involved in the transport and translation of κ opioid-receptor (KOR) mRNA in neurons. It forms a complex with the RNA-binding protein HuR and kinesin motor proteins, which stabilizes and mobilizes KOR mRNA along microtubules. HuR binds to KOR mRNA, repressing its translation, while kinesin facilitates its transport (Bi2007Copb1facilitated).

Additionally, β-COP has been shown to interact with the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is involved in RNA transport within neurons. This interaction suggests a role for β-COP in mRNA transport, potentially serving as a scaffold for RNA-binding proteins (Peter2011The).
