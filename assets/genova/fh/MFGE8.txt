# MFGE8

## Overview
MFGE8, or milk fat globule-EGF factor 8, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional glycoprotein known as lactadherin. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and two coagulation domains, C1 and C2. Lactadherin plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, primarily through its involvement in the clearance of apoptotic cells. It achieves this by binding to phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cell membranes and integrins on phagocytes, facilitating the engulfment and removal of dying cells, which is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing autoimmune responses (Unknownauthors2014MFGE8; Hanayama2005MFGE8Dependent). Beyond its role in apoptosis, MFGE8 is implicated in vascular biology, immune regulation, and cancer progression, making it a significant focus of research in understanding its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases (Ruotsalainen2021Lossoffunction; Jinushi2008Milk).

## Structure
The MFGE8 protein, also known as lactadherin, is a glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure. It consists of a signal peptide, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and two coagulation domains (C1 and C2) (Mesdaghi2024Investigating). The EGF-like domain contains an RGD motif crucial for integrin binding, while the C2 domain interacts with phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cell membranes (Mesdaghi2024Investigating). 

The secondary structure of MFGE8 is characterized by a high proportion of β-type structures, contributing to its stability. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy have shown that the protein consists of β-sheets, α-helices, β-turns, and random coils (Li2021The). The high β-sheet content is suggested to play a role in its biological functions (Li2021The).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are present and may influence the protein's folding and interactions (Mesdaghi2024Investigating). These modifications, along with the protein's compact conformation, may protect certain regions from cleavage, such as the medin region within the C2 domain (Mesdaghi2024Investigating). The protein's structure and modifications are essential for its function in various biological processes.

## Function
The MFGE8 gene encodes a glycoprotein known as Milk-fat globule-EGF 8 (MFG-E8), or lactadherin, which plays a crucial role in the clearance of apoptotic cells. MFG-E8 functions by binding to phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells through its C1 and C2 domains and to integrins on phagocytes via an RGD motif in its EGF domain. This bridging action facilitates the engulfment of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, which is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity (Unknownauthors2014MFGE8; Hanayama2005MFGE8Dependent).

In healthy human cells, MFG-E8 is secreted by various phagocytes, including macrophages and dendritic cells, and is involved in the clearance of other biological materials, such as amyloid beta-peptide in the brain and photoreceptor outer segment fragments in the retina (Unknownauthors2014MFGE8). It also plays a role in the uptake of microvesicles and exosomes, which are involved in intercellular communication and immune responses (Unknownauthors2014MFGE8).

MFG-E8 is expressed in various tissues, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages, and its expression increases with age in arterial walls and hearts across various species. It is implicated in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and invasion, contributing to arterial stiffness and remodeling associated with age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis (Ruotsalainen2021Lossoffunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MFGE8 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of cardiovascular health, loss-of-function (LoF) variants in MFGE8 are associated with a reduced risk of coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. These variants, particularly rs534125149, are linked to a 28% lower risk of myocardial infarction and are enriched in the Finnish population. This suggests that MFGE8 could be a potential target for coronary heart disease interventions (Ruotsalainen2021Lossoffunction).

In cancer, MFGE8 is involved in tumor progression and metastasis. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), knockout of MFGE8 reduces lung metastasis and increases sensitivity to COX-2 inhibitors, indicating its role in drug resistance and tumor growth (Tian2021Identification). In melanoma, MFGE8 promotes tumor progression by enhancing cell survival and resistance to apoptosis, and by mediating immune suppression through regulatory T cells (Jinushi2008Milk).

In autoimmune diseases, MFGE8 deficiency can lead to a systemic lupus erythematosus-like phenotype due to impaired clearance of apoptotic cells, resulting in autoantibody production (Oshima2014MFGE8:). These findings highlight the diverse clinical implications of MFGE8 in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
MFGE8, also known as milk fat globule-EGF factor 8, is a glycoprotein that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to interact with integrins, particularly αvβ3 and αvβ5, through its integrin-binding Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif. This interaction facilitates the binding and uptake of extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo into spermatozoa, playing a crucial role in sperm maturation and function (Trigg2021A). MFGE8 also engages with α8β1 integrin, influencing smooth muscle contractility and gastrointestinal motility by modulating PI3K and PTEN activity, which affects RhoA activation and signaling pathways (KhalifehSoltani2016α8β1).

In the immune system, MFGE8 mediates the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by antigen-presenting cells, linking pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. This process is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and involves interactions with cytokines such as TGF-β (Jinushi2007MFGE8–mediated). MFGE8's ability to bind phosphatidylserine on cell membranes further supports its role in apoptotic cell clearance and immune regulation. These interactions highlight MFGE8's multifaceted role in cellular communication and physiological processes.
