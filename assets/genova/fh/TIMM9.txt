# TIMM9

## Overview
The TIMM9 gene encodes the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 9 (TIMM9) protein, a crucial component of the mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly machinery. This protein is categorized as a molecular chaperone and is integral to the import and insertion of hydrophobic membrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane, a process vital for mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Kang2019Function). TIMM9 forms a heterohexameric complex with TIMM10, facilitating the translocation of carrier proteins across mitochondrial membranes, and is part of the TIM22 complex biogenesis pathway (Zhang2024TIMM9). The structural integrity and function of TIMM9 are maintained through post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation, which stabilize its alpha-helical structures within the hexameric complex (Weinhäupl2021Architecture). TIMM9's role extends to interactions with other mitochondrial components, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial protein stability and function, with implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Bogorodskiy2021Role; Zhang2024TIMM9).

## Structure
The TIMM9 protein is a component of the mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly machinery, forming a hexameric complex with TIMM10. This complex is crucial for the import of hydrophobic proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane (Weinhäupl2021Architecture). The TIMM9 protein is primarily composed of alpha-helix motifs and a loop, which are essential for its function in mediating mitochondrial protein transport (Zhang2024TIMM9).

In terms of quaternary structure, TIMM9 forms a heterohexameric complex with TIMM10, which is its functional form (Zhang2024TIMM9). The stoichiometry of the TIM9·10·12 complex, which includes TIMM9, is 2:3:1 (Tim9:Tim10:Tim12), forming a stable hexameric structure (Weinhäupl2021Architecture). The complex exhibits a dynamic equilibrium with unassembled subunits, allowing for rapid adaptation to cellular needs (Weinhäupl2021Architecture).

Post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation, play a critical role in the stability and activity of TIMM9. These modifications induce structural changes, leading to the formation of alpha-helical structures that stabilize the protein within the hexameric complex (Weinhäupl2021Architecture). The dynamic nature of TIMM9, including its ability to exchange subunits, is essential for its function in mitochondrial protein import (Weinhäupl2021Architecture).

## Function
The TIMM9 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the mitochondrial intermembrane space assembly machinery. It plays a vital role in the import and insertion of hydrophobic membrane proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane, a process essential for mitochondrial function and energy production in cells (Kang2019Function). TIMM9 forms a heterohexameric complex with TIMM10, which acts as a molecular chaperone facilitating the translocation of carrier proteins across the mitochondrial membranes (Zhang2024TIMM9). This complex is part of the TIM22 complex biogenesis pathway, which is responsible for the import and insertion of specific proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane (Kang2019Neuronalspecific).

In healthy human cells, TIMM9 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial protein stability and function. The depletion of TIMM9 leads to reduced levels of TIM22 complex subunits and substrate proteins, resulting in severe assembly defects of the TIM22 complex (Kang2019Neuronalspecific). This highlights the importance of TIMM9 in ensuring the proper assembly and function of mitochondrial complexes, which are essential for cellular energy production and overall cell health (Kang2019Function).

## Clinical Significance
The TIMM9 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function and protein translocation. Alterations in TIMM9 expression are associated with several types of cancer. Overexpression of TIMM9 is linked to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and poor prognosis in cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) (Zhang2024TIMM9). In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), however, high TIMM9 expression is associated with a more favorable prognosis, indicating a complex relationship with the tumor microenvironment (Zhang2024TIMM9).

Genomic instabilities in TIMM9, such as the S49L missense mutation, enhance its binding with TIMM10 and are linked to poor cancer prognosis (Zhang2024TIMM9). High copy number variations (CNV) and decreased methylation levels of TIMM9 are also associated with poor outcomes in various cancers (Zhang2024TIMM9).

In addition to cancer, TIMM9 is involved in mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a critical factor in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. The TIMM9 protein, as part of the TIM/TOM complex, is essential for mitochondrial protein import, and its dysfunction can exacerbate mitochondrial-related pathologies (Bogorodskiy2021Role).

## Interactions
TIMM9 is a component of the mitochondrial inner membrane translocase complex and plays a crucial role in protein import and insertion into the mitochondrial inner membrane. It forms a hexameric chaperone complex with TIMM10, which is essential for the translocation of hydrophobic precursor proteins. This complex is stabilized by intersubunit salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions, and its formation involves a series of kinetic steps, including the formation of a heterodimer, tetramer, and hexamer (CehPavia2013Folding).

TIMM9 also interacts with other components of the TIM22 complex, such as TIM10A, TIM29, and AGK. These interactions are crucial for the import of specific substrates, with AGK involved in carrier protein import and TIM29 related to the import of TIM17 family members (Valpadashi2024Structural). The TIMM9-TIMM10 complex is involved in the insertion of carrier proteins into the inner membrane, and its interaction with the TIM22 complex is facilitated by crosslinking to specific regions within the complex (CehPavia2013Folding; Valpadashi2024Structural).

In cancer, TIMM9 is part of a protein-protein interaction network, notably forming a complex with ITFG1, which shows strong binding affinity and stability (Zhang2024TIMM9).
