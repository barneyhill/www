# TLE3

## Overview
TLE3, or Transducin-Like Enhancer of Split 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) family, which functions primarily as a transcriptional corepressor. The TLE3 protein is characterized by its conserved N-terminal Q domain and C-terminal WD40 domain, which facilitate oligomerization and protein-protein interactions, respectively (Villanueva2011TLE3). As a corepressor, TLE3 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression across various biological processes, including adipogenesis, tissue development, and immune regulation. It interacts with key transcription factors such as PPARγ, Hesx1, and Prop1, influencing pathways that govern cell differentiation and development (Carvalho2010Corepressors; Villanueva2011TLE3). TLE3's involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression underscores its significance in cellular function and its potential implications in clinical contexts, such as cancer and metabolic disorders (Kaltenbrun2013A; Ring2018TransducinLike).

## Structure
TLE3, a member of the Groucho/TLE family, is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes a conserved N-terminal Q domain and a C-terminal WD40 domain. The Q domain is crucial for oligomerization, allowing TLE3 to form complexes with other proteins, while the WD40 domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in its function as a transcriptional corepressor (Villanueva2011TLE3).

The protein's structure is further defined by its primary sequence, which shares approximately 80% amino acid identity with TLE1, another member of the TLE family. Despite this similarity, TLE3 lacks a specific MAPK/Erk phosphorylation site present in TLE1, which is a key difference affecting their functional activities (Kornspan2021Differential). This absence of a phosphorylation site in TLE3 is evolutionarily conserved and contributes to its distinct role in cellular processes (Kornspan2021Differential).

TLE3 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and functions. Additionally, TLE3 has multiple splice variant isoforms, which could further diversify its functional capabilities and regulatory roles in different cellular contexts (Villanueva2011TLE3).

## Function
TLE3, a member of the Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split protein family, functions as a transcriptional coregulator involved in various biological processes, particularly adipogenesis. In adipocytes, TLE3 acts as a direct target of the transcription factor PPARγ, enhancing its activity and promoting adipocyte differentiation. It functions in a feed-forward loop with PPARγ, facilitating the expression of PPARγ target genes and promoting lipid accumulation in white adipose tissue (Villanueva2011TLE3). TLE3 also plays a role in repressing Wnt signaling, a negative regulator of adipogenesis, thereby allowing adipocyte differentiation to proceed (Agarwal2015The; Villanueva2011TLE3).

In addition to its role in adipogenesis, TLE3 is involved in the development of various tissues. It interacts with transcription factors such as Hesx1 and Prop1 in pituitary development, acting as a corepressor to regulate gene expression and cell differentiation (Carvalho2010Corepressors). TLE3 also participates in chromatin remodeling processes, interacting with T-box transcription factors to facilitate transcriptional repression (Kaltenbrun2013A). These interactions highlight TLE3's role in transcriptional regulation and its impact on cell differentiation and development across different tissues.

## Clinical Significance
TLE3 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In non-serous ovarian carcinoma, high TLE3 expression is associated with increased sensitivity to taxane-based chemotherapy, particularly in clear cell carcinoma. This suggests that TLE3 could serve as a biomarker for predicting taxane sensitivity, potentially guiding treatment strategies for ovarian cancer patients (Ring2018TransducinLike).

In prostate cancer, TLE3 loss is linked to resistance against androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors such as enzalutamide. The absence of TLE3 leads to increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, which compensates for AR function and contributes to drug resistance. This relationship highlights TLE3's potential role in overcoming resistance to AR-directed therapies in prostate cancer (Palit2019TLE3).

TLE3 is also involved in adipogenesis, where it acts as a coactivator for PPARg, promoting adipocyte differentiation. Its expression is upregulated during preadipocyte differentiation, suggesting a role in metabolic regulation. Alterations in TLE3 expression could impact conditions like insulin resistance (Villanueva2011TLE3).

## Interactions
TLE3 interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in multiple cellular processes. It acts as a transcriptional coregulator in adipogenesis by interacting with PPARg, enhancing adipogenic gene expression and differentiation in cooperation with PPARg (Villanueva2011TLE3). TLE3 is also involved in Wnt signaling, where it is targeted for ubiquitylation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5. This interaction is mediated through the WD40 domain of TLE3, which is crucial for its ubiquitylation and subsequent regulation of Wnt signaling (Flack2017WntDependent).

In the context of heart development, TLE3 interacts with the Tbx20 transcription factor. This interaction involves the recruitment of the NuRD complex, facilitating transcriptional repression necessary for heart morphogenesis (Kaltenbrun2013A). TLE3 also binds to transcription factors such as HESX1 and PROP1, enhancing the repression of PROP1 activity, which is crucial for pituitary development (Carvalho2010Corepressors).

TLE3's interactions extend to immune regulation, where it influences T-cell differentiation by interacting with RUNX1 and RUNX3, promoting CD8+ T-cell lineage differentiation (Yu2022Roles). These interactions highlight TLE3's multifaceted role in regulating gene expression across different biological contexts.
