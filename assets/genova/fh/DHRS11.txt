# DHRS11

## Overview
The DHRS11 gene encodes the protein dehydrogenase/reductase 11, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to catalyze the oxidation and reduction of a wide range of substrates, including steroids, retinoids, and xenobiotics. Dehydrogenase/reductase 11 is involved in various metabolic pathways and plays a crucial role in the regulation of biological processes through its enzymatic activity. The protein's function and interactions are significant in understanding its contribution to cellular homeostasis and potential implications in disease states.
