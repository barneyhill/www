# LACRT

## Overview
LACRT is a gene that encodes the protein lacritin, a multifunctional glycoprotein primarily involved in ocular surface health. Lacritin is secreted by lacrimal and salivary glands and plays a crucial role in promoting tear secretion and maintaining tear film stability. It is characterized by its glycosylation and the presence of amphipathic alpha-helices, which are essential for its interactions with cell surface receptors and its mitogenic activity (Sanghi2001cDNA; Wang2006Restricted). Lacritin's interaction with syndecan-1, facilitated by heparanase, is vital for its role in cell survival and proliferation, particularly under stress conditions (DiasTeixeira2020The; Ma2006Heparanase). Alterations in LACRT expression or lacritin function are associated with dry eye disease, highlighting its clinical significance in ocular health (Georgiev2021Lacritin).

## Structure
Lacritin, encoded by the LACRT gene, is a glycoprotein primarily found in human tears. The primary structure of lacritin includes a 19 amino acid signal peptide, resulting in a mature protein of approximately 12.3 kDa (Sanghi2001cDNA). The protein is moderately glycosylated, with six O-glycosylation sites and one N-glycosylation site (Sanghi2001cDNA). 

The secondary structure of lacritin features amphipathic alpha-helices, particularly in its C-terminal region, which are crucial for its function. These helices are involved in interactions with cell surface receptors and contribute to the protein's mitogenic activity (Georgiev2021Lacritin; Wang2006Restricted). The C-terminal region also contains a sequence similar to a potent bactericidal fragment of dermcidin, suggesting a role in antimicrobial activity (McKown2014A).

Lacritin can form various quaternary structures, including monomers, dimers, and trimers, with molecular weights of approximately 25 kDa, 50 kDa, and 75 kDa, respectively (McKown2014A). These forms are natural constituents of basal tears and are involved in maintaining tear film stability and epithelial homeostasis (Georgiev2021Lacritin). The protein's structure and post-translational modifications are essential for its role in ocular surface health.

## Function
Lacritin, encoded by the LACRT gene, is a multifunctional glycoprotein primarily involved in promoting tear secretion and maintaining ocular surface health. In healthy human cells, lacritin enhances unstimulated tear secretion by lacrimal acinar cells and promotes ductal cell proliferation (Sanghi2001cDNA). It plays a crucial role in cell survival, particularly under stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation and exposure to inflammatory cytokines. Lacritin achieves this by stimulating autophagic flux, a process that helps degrade stress-damaged proteins and organelles, thereby restoring cellular homeostasis (Karnati2016Lacritin).

Lacritin's mechanism involves the acetylation of transcription factors FOXO1 and FOXO3, facilitating the binding of autophagy mediators like ATG7 and ATG101, which are essential for initiating autophagy (Karnati2016Lacritin). It also stimulates calcium signaling in corneal epithelial cells, which is crucial for its mitogenic activity and cell proliferation (Sanghi2001cDNA; Wang2006Restricted). Lacritin is secreted by lacrimal and salivary glands and is active in the extracellular space, where it binds to components of the extracellular matrix, such as collagen IV and laminin-1, influencing cell signaling and proliferation (Sanghi2001cDNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the LACRT gene, which encodes the protein lacritin, have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of dry eye disease. Lacritin is crucial for maintaining tear film stability and epithelial homeostasis. Deficiencies in lacritin, especially its C-terminal proteoforms, are associated with tear film instability, a hallmark of dry eye conditions, including Sjögren's Syndrome (Georgiev2021Lacritin). The absence of these proteoforms can lead to premature tear film collapse, similar to what is observed in dry eye syndrome (Georgiev2021Lacritin).

In dry eye disease, lacritin is often downregulated, which exacerbates tear film instability and may contribute to inflammation or infection (DiasTeixeira2020The). The protein's interaction with syndecan-1, a co-receptor, is essential for its biological activity, and disruptions in this interaction can impair lacritin's function, further affecting tear secretion and ocular surface health (Zhang2013Targeting). These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring lacritin levels or function could be beneficial in treating dry eye and related ocular surface disorders.

## Interactions
Lacritin (LACRT) is a human protein that interacts with syndecan-1 (SDC1), a cell surface proteoglycan, to promote cell survival and proliferation. This interaction is facilitated by the deglycanation of syndecan-1 by heparanase, which removes heparan sulfate (HS) chains, allowing lacritin to bind to the core protein of syndecan-1. The binding site on lacritin is located between amino acids 100 and 109, which coincides with its mitogenic domain (Ma2006Heparanase). 

Lacritin's interaction with syndecan-1 is crucial for its mitogenic signaling, which involves pathways independent of ERK1 and ERK2, potentially through a G protein-coupled receptor or ion channel (Ma2006Heparanase). The interaction is specific to syndecan-1 and does not occur with other syndecans like SDC2 or SDC4 (Ma2006Heparanase). 

Heparanase acts as an 'on-switch' for the lacritin-syndecan-1 interaction, and its knockdown inhibits lacritin's effects (DiasTeixeira2020The). The binding involves lacritin's C-terminal amphipathic α-helix and specific residues, with heparanase-generated heparan sulfate stubs and chondroitin sulfate chains playing roles in the binding process (DiasTeixeira2020The).
