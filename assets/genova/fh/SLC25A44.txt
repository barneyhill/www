# SLC25A44

## Overview
SLC25A44 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 44, a mitochondrial carrier protein involved in the transport of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and other metabolites across the mitochondrial membrane. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane structure, which facilitates the movement of small molecules essential for energy metabolism and thermogenesis (Palmieri2013The; Darbani2021Genome). SLC25A44 is ubiquitously expressed, with particularly high levels in the brain, kidney, and liver, underscoring its critical role in mitochondrial function and cellular energy homeostasis (Darbani2021Genome). The protein's activity is crucial for metabolic flexibility, allowing cells to adapt to varying energy demands by switching between different fuel sources, such as glucose and fatty acids (Yoneshiro2021Metabolic). Additionally, SLC25A44 has been implicated in various health conditions, including Parkinson's disease and pancreatic cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic disorders and potential therapeutic applications (Zhang2022An; Goldstein2021The).

## Structure
The SLC25A44 protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, characterized by a tripartite structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices. These helices form a funnel-shaped cavity that is open towards the cytosol, facilitating the transport of small molecules across the mitochondrial membrane (Palmieri2013The). The protein contains a conserved three-amino acid signature (V/I/L/AWW) located on the cytosolic face of the transport cavity at the C-terminal end of transmembrane helix 4, which is crucial for its transport function and potential engineering applications (Darbani2021Genome).

SLC25A44 is involved in the transport of branched-chain amino acids and other metabolites, playing a role in energy metabolism and thermogenesis (Darbani2021Genome). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels in the brain, kidney, and liver, indicating its essential role in mitochondrial function (Darbani2021Genome). While specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the provided context, the protein's structure and function suggest it may undergo such modifications typical of mitochondrial carriers.

## Function
SLC25A44 is a mitochondrial carrier protein that plays a crucial role in the transport and catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) within the mitochondria. It is essential for importing BCAAs into the mitochondrial matrix, where they undergo catabolic reactions necessary for energy production and metabolic flexibility (Yoneshiro2021Metabolic). This process is particularly important in brown adipose tissue (BAT), where SLC25A44 facilitates mitochondrial BCAA oxidation, contributing to thermogenesis and the adaptive response to fever (Yoneshiro2021Metabolic).

In healthy human cells, SLC25A44 supports the synthesis of mitochondrial amino acids and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, which are vital for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic processes (Yoneshiro2021Metabolic). The protein's activity is linked to metabolic flexibility, allowing cells to switch between different fuel sources, such as glucose and fatty acids, to meet metabolic demands (Yoneshiro2021Metabolic). This flexibility is crucial for optimal thermogenic activity and energy utilization, particularly under conditions requiring increased energy expenditure, such as during fever or cold exposure (Yoneshiro2021Metabolic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC25A44 gene have been implicated in several health conditions. A specific variant in SLC25A44, involving a methionine-27 to valine substitution, has been identified as part of a haplotype associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. This variant is considered potentially pathogenic due to its significant predicted impact on protein function (Goldstein2021The).

In pancreatic cancer, SLC25A44 is significantly overexpressed and is involved in metabolic remodeling of cancer cells. Its expression is associated with various cellular pathways, including those related to energy metabolism and immune infiltration. The gene's role in enhancing sensitivity to certain anticancer drugs suggests it could be a significant factor in pancreatic cancer progression and treatment (Zhang2022An).

Alterations in SLC25A44 expression also affect metabolic processes in other tissues. In the heart, low expression of SLC25A44 may regulate the reamination of branched-chain α-ketoacids, potentially influencing cardiac protein synthesis and contributing to cardiometabolic diseases (Walejko2021Branchedchain). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in various metabolic disorders and its importance in maintaining cellular energy balance.

## Interactions
SLC25A44 is involved in various interactions that play a role in metabolic processes. It is part of a network of interactions that connect it to specific metabolic pathways, particularly amino acid metabolism. SLC25A44 interacts with CPS1, a mitochondrial enzyme in the urea cycle, where the loss of CPS1 can lead to hyperammonemia, a condition that can be alleviated by interactions involving SLC25A44 and other transporters (Girardi2020A).

In the context of pancreatic cancer, SLC25A44 is significantly overexpressed and is involved in co-expression networks that influence tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. It is associated with the recruitment of immune cells and contributes to the tumor microenvironment. SLC25A44 is also linked to the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to certain anticancer drugs, such as OSI-027, suggesting its role in drug interactions and potential therapeutic applications (Zhang2022An).

SLC25A44 is also involved in the transport of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) to the mitochondrial matrix, where they are catabolized into acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, feeding into the TCA cycle. This transport activity highlights its role in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function (Zhang2022An).
