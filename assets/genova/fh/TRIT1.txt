# TRIT1

## Overview
TRIT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme tRNA isopentenyltransferase 1, which is a critical component in the post-transcriptional modification of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. This enzyme belongs to the class of transferases and is responsible for catalyzing the addition of an isopentenyl group to adenosine at position 37 in the anticodon loop of specific tRNAs, a modification essential for the accuracy and efficiency of protein synthesis. The TRIT1 protein is active in both the cytosol and mitochondria, where it modifies tRNAs to support cellular translation and mitochondrial function, particularly in oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in the TRIT1 gene can lead to deficiencies in this modification, resulting in mitochondrial disorders and highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Spinola2005Identification; Khalique2020Targeting; Yarham2014Defective).

## Structure
The TRIT1 protein, encoded by the TRIT1 gene, is a tRNA isopentenyltransferase involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules. The primary structure of TRIT1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific functional domains. Notably, TRIT1 contains a matrin-type zinc finger domain located in exons 10 and 11, which may play a role in its interaction with tRNA substrates (Yarham2014Defective). The protein also features an ATP/GTP motif A in the amino-terminal portion, which is thought to have a regulatory role (Spinola2005Identification).

The secondary structure of TRIT1 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of many enzymes, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its catalytic activity, with structural modeling suggesting interactions with tRNA substrates (Yarham2014Defective).

TRIT1's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins or RNA, but specific details are not available. The protein is known to have multiple splice variant isoforms, some of which are truncated and may affect its function and localization (Spinola2005Identification). These isoforms result from alternative splicing, which can lead to different protein products with varying activities.

## Function
The TRIT1 gene encodes the enzyme tRNA isopentenyltransferase 1, which plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of an isopentenyl group to the N6 position of adenosine at position 37 (i6A37) in the anticodon loop of specific tRNAs. This modification is essential for maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of protein synthesis by enhancing the correct reading frame during translation (Spinola2005Identification; Khalique2020Targeting).

TRIT1 is active in both the cytosol and mitochondria, where it modifies cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs, respectively. The enzyme's activity is crucial for proper mitochondrial function, as it supports the synthesis of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a key process for ATP production (Khalique2020Targeting; Yarham2014Defective). In healthy cells, TRIT1 ensures the stability and proper functioning of tRNAs, which is vital for cellular translation and mitochondrial respiratory efficiency (Yarham2014Defective).

Mutations in TRIT1 can lead to a deficiency in the i6A37 modification, resulting in impaired mitochondrial translation and associated diseases, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal health (Yarham2014Defective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIT1 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, primarily due to its role in tRNA modification. Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 35 (COXPD 35) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder linked to TRIT1 mutations, characterized by symptoms such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and central nervous system involvement (Yoo2021The; Yıldırım2021A). Specific mutations, such as c.979G > A (p.Glu327Lys) and c.682 + 2 T > C, have been identified in affected individuals, impacting the splicing and structural integrity of the tRNA isopentenyltransferase protein (Yoo2021The).

TRIT1 mutations also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction by impairing the i6A37 modification of tRNAs, which is crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This dysfunction is linked to conditions such as encephalopathy, myoclonic epilepsy, and multiple oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies (Yarham2014Defective). The p.Arg323Gln mutation, for example, results in a severe deficiency of i6A37 in both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs, contributing to mitochondrial myopathy (Yarham2014Defective).

Noninvasive diagnostic methods, such as measuring i6A37 and ms2i6A37 modifications in blood and urine, have been developed to identify TRIT1-related disorders, potentially avoiding the need for muscle biopsies (Takenouchi2019Noninvasive). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TRIT1 in mitochondrial diseases.

## Interactions
TRIT1, a tRNA isopentenyltransferase, is involved in the modification of tRNAs by adding an isopentenyl group to adenosine at position 37, which is crucial for the proper function of both mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNAs. This modification enhances the efficiency and fidelity of protein synthesis. TRIT1 interacts with tRNA molecules, recognizing specific sequences such as the A36-A37-A38 sequence, which is essential for the i6A37 modification (Khalique2020Targeting). 

The enzyme is localized in both the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix, where it interacts with tRNA substrates during protein synthesis (Yarham2014Defective). The mutation p.Arg323Gln in TRIT1 affects its interaction with tRNA by altering the chemical nature of the amino acid at position 323, which may impair the enzyme's binding to its tRNA substrates (Yarham2014Defective). 

TRIT1's role extends beyond tRNA modification, as it is suggested to participate in tRNA gene-mediated silencing of RNA polymerase II promoters, a process that involves its C-terminal zinc finger domain. This domain allows TRIT1 to bind to both substrate and non-substrate tRNA, influencing the accessibility of neighboring promoters for transcription machinery (Dabravolski2020Multifaceted). However, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its role in modifying tRNAs are not detailed in the provided context.
