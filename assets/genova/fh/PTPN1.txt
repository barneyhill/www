# PTPN1

## Overview
PTPN1 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTP1B), a critical enzyme involved in the regulation of various cellular signaling pathways. PTP1B is a non-receptor type phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in modulating receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and insulin signaling, thereby influencing glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism (Stuible2010In; He2014Protein). The protein is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates RTKs during their biosynthesis and affects their signaling through dephosphorylation (Frangioni1992The). PTP1B's activity is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cancer (Hoekstra2016Increased; Dubé2005Involvement). As a result, PTP1B is a significant target for therapeutic interventions aimed at treating metabolic disorders and malignancies.

## Structure
PTPN1 encodes protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a non-receptor type phosphatase involved in regulating signaling pathways. The primary structure of PTP1B consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, which includes a catalytic domain characterized by the PTP signature motif [I/V]HCXXGXXR[S/T] (Moon2017Identification). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the formation of the catalytic domain (Tautz2013Protein).

The tertiary structure of PTP1B is defined by several loops that are crucial for its function. These include the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop), the WPD-loop containing a catalytic aspartate (Asp181), the Q-loop with a conserved glutamine, and the pTyr-recognition loop, which ensures substrate specificity (Moon2017Identification; Tautz2013Protein). The WPD-loop acts as a flexible gate to the active site, and its mobility is essential for catalytic activity (Tautz2013Protein).

PTP1B can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure. Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and oxidation, which can affect its activity and function (Tonks2006Protein). Splice variants may result in isoforms with different regulatory functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1) encodes PTP1B, a key regulator of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and insulin signaling pathways in healthy human cells. PTP1B modulates RTK activity by dephosphorylating phosphorylated tyrosine residues, which are crucial for RTK signaling. This dephosphorylation process is essential for the regulation of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrates (IRS), impacting glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure (Stuible2010In; He2014Protein).

PTP1B is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it regulates RTKs during their biosynthesis and affects immature RTKs activated in a ligand-independent manner (Frangioni1992The; Stuible2010In). It also influences the endocytic down-regulation of RTKs, affecting their internalization into multivesicular bodies, which attenuates RTK signaling (Stuible2010In).

In the context of insulin signaling, PTP1B decreases IR phosphorylation, reducing glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation, thereby modulating insulin sensitivity (Dubé2005Involvement). PTP1B's activity is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, as its inhibition has been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity and leptin response, which are important for metabolic balance (He2014Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTPN1 gene, which encodes protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), have been implicated in various diseases. In type 2 diabetes, polymorphisms in the PTPN1 gene promoter, such as Ϫ467TϾC and Ϫ1023CϾA, are associated with increased risk and altered metabolic traits (Meshkani2007Polymorphisms; Mackawy2015Association). PTPN1 is also linked to insulin resistance, with specific SNPs affecting insulin sensitivity and glucose levels (Hendriks2013Protein).

In cancer, PTPN1 overexpression is associated with colorectal cancer, where it contributes to a more invasive phenotype and poorer patient outcomes (Hoekstra2016Increased). Similarly, in glioma, PTPN1 amplification and overexpression are linked to poor prognosis, promoting tumor progression through the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways (Jin2019PTPN1). In Hodgkin lymphoma, PTPN1 mutations and splice variants enhance JAK/STAT signaling, contributing to oncogenesis (Zahn2020The).

PTPN1 deletion has been associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms, suggesting its role in hematopoietic disorders (Jobe2017Deletion). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in metabolic disorders and cancer, making it a significant focus for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
PTPN1, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1, is involved in numerous protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It is known to interact with the insulin receptor, forming complexes that suggest substrate recruiting strategies, which are crucial for modulating insulin signaling (Ren2011Substrate). PTPN1 also interacts with the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) in multiple myeloma cells, where it regulates FGFR3 activity by dephosphorylating it, affecting the levels of phosphorylated tyrosine proteins (St‐Germain2014Differential).

PTPN1 is identified as a negative regulator of the JNK MAPK pathway by directly dephosphorylating JNK, thereby reducing JNK phosphorylation and inhibiting the cell death response (Moon2017Identification). It interacts with components of the JNK MAPK pathway, including MLK3, MKK7, and JNK, indicating its role in modulating this signaling pathway (Moon2017Identification).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, PTPN1 is part of a protein network involving HSP90AA1 and KCNH2, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis (Zhang2023Curcumin). PTPN1 also interacts with the rhomboid protease RHBDL4, potentially modifying its tyrosine phosphorylation, which may play a role in ER stress and receptor recycling (Ikeda2019Spatial).
