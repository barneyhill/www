# MARK4

## Overview
MARK4, or microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. The protein product of MARK4 plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell division, cell cycle control, and cell polarity determination. It achieves this by phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins, thereby modulating their interaction with microtubules and enhancing microtubule dynamics (Naz2013Microtubule). MARK4 is also implicated in ciliogenesis, where it facilitates axoneme extension, and acts as a negative regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, influencing cellular responses to stress (Li2013Microtubuleassociated; Kuhns2013The). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (rovin2014new; Yu2021MARK4; Ahmed2022A).

## Structure
The MARK4 protein is a serine/threonine kinase involved in microtubule dynamics. Its molecular structure includes several key domains: a catalytic domain, a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, a spacer domain, and a C-terminal tail known as the KA1 domain (Naz2013Microtubule). The catalytic domain of MARK4 exhibits a bilobed structure typical of many kinases, forming a cleft for substrate and ATP binding (Sack2016Crystal; Naz2013Microtubule). The UBA domain, although not binding ubiquitin, is structurally conserved and plays roles in auto-inhibition and regulation of kinase activity (Naz2013Microtubule). The spacer domain contains phosphorylation sites that regulate MARK4's cellular localization (Naz2013Microtubule). The KA1 domain is involved in subcellular localization and protein interactions (Naz2013Microtubule).

MARK4 has two isoforms, MARK4L and MARK4S, which differ in their C-terminal regions (Naz2013Microtubule). The MARK4L isoform includes a Ser/Thr protein kinase catalytic domain, a ubiquitin-associated domain, and a kinase-associated domain 1 (Naz2013Microtubule). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in regulating MARK4's activity, with specific sites like Thr214 and Ser218 being critical for its activation and inhibition (Naz2013Microtubule).

## Function
MARK4 (microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in regulating microtubule dynamics, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as cell division, cell cycle control, and cell polarity determination (Naz2013Microtubule). MARK4 is involved in phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins, leading to their detachment from microtubules and increasing microtubule dynamics (Naz2013Microtubule). This kinase is expressed throughout the cell cycle and is particularly active during mitosis, where it localizes at the centrosome and midbody, indicating its involvement in cell proliferation and cytoskeletal dynamics (Rovina2014Microtubuleassociated).

MARK4 is also crucial for ciliogenesis, particularly in promoting axoneme extension during early stages. It is localized to the basal body and centrioles in ciliated cells, and its kinase activity is necessary for the initiation of axoneme extension after the docking of ciliary vesicles to the mother centriole (Kuhns2013The). The depletion of MARK4 results in the arrest of the ciliary program, highlighting its role as a positive regulator of ciliogenesis (Kuhns2013The). Additionally, MARK4 acts as a negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), influencing cellular responses to osmotic stress (Li2013Microtubuleassociated).

## Clinical Significance
The MARK4 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases, primarily through mutations and alterations in its expression. In cancer, MARK4 is overexpressed in several types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), glioma, and metastatic breast cancer. This overexpression is linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis, as it disrupts cellular pathways such as mTOR and NF-kB, contributing to cancer cell growth and proliferation (Pardo2016miR‐515‐5p; Ahmed2022A). In glioma, the MARK4L isoform is upregulated in undifferentiated neural progenitor cells, correlating with higher malignancy grades, while the MARK4S isoform is downregulated in glioma, suggesting a role in tumor transformation (rovina2014new).

In neurodegenerative diseases, MARK4 is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its role in tau hyperphosphorylation, a hallmark of AD pathology. Elevated MARK4 expression in AD cases contributes to synaptic and dendritic spine defects, highlighting its potential as a drug target (Anwar2020Structural; rovina2014new).

In cardiovascular conditions, MARK4 influences cardiac function post-myocardial infarction by regulating microtubule detyrosination. MARK4 deficiency in mice has been shown to preserve cardiac function, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for ischemic heart failure (Yu2021MARK4).

## Interactions
MARK4 (microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. MARK4 interacts with the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component in the innate immune response. It binds directly to NLRP3, facilitating its transport to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and enabling the assembly of the inflammasome complex. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the inflammasome and subsequent inflammatory responses (Li2017MARK4).

MARK4 also interacts with MFN2 (Mitofusin 2), a protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics. This interaction affects mitochondrial fusion and function, with MARK4 regulating mitochondrial hyperfusion induced by MFN2 overexpression. The physical association between MARK4 and MFN2 has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays (Cheon2023A).

In the context of mTORC1 signaling, MARK4 phosphorylates Raptor, a component of the mTORC1 complex, at Ser-792. This phosphorylation inhibits mTORC1 activation by interfering with the Raptor-Rag interaction, highlighting MARK4's role as a negative regulator of mTORC1 (Li2013Microtubuleassociated).
