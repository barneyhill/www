# PTPMT1

## Overview
PTPMT1, or protein tyrosine phosphatase mitochondrial 1, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein tyrosine phosphatase. This enzyme is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and energy production within cells, playing a crucial role in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, a key phospholipid necessary for mitochondrial integrity and function (Xiao2011Structural; Pulido2013PTPs). The protein is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it dephosphorylates phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) to facilitate cardiolipin synthesis, thereby supporting the electron transport chain and maintaining mitochondrial morphology (Xiao2011Structural). Beyond its metabolic functions, PTPMT1 is implicated in regulating mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and pulmonary arterial hypertension, due to its influence on mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism (Bao2021Genomewide; Russomanno2021miR150PTPMT1cardiolipin; Niemi2013Downregulation).

## Structure
PTPMT1 is a mitochondrial phosphatase with a primary structure consisting of a 261 amino acid sequence, although residues 1-68 are absent in most orthologs, including humans (Xiao2011Structural). The secondary structure of PTPMT1 includes six α-helices and five β-strands, forming a canonical protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain fold (Xiao2011Structural). This structure is similar to that of other dual-specificity phosphatases, despite limited sequence similarity (Xiao2011Structural).

The tertiary structure of PTPMT1 reveals a phosphatase domain that is crucial for its enzymatic activity, with a P-loop and a WPD loop in the active site. A conserved aspartate residue within the WPD loop is critical for enzyme activity (Xiao2011Structural). The protein undergoes significant conformational changes during catalysis, particularly in the WPD and EEYE loops, which are essential for its function (Xiao2011Structural).

PTPMT1 is anchored at the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its phosphatase domain located in the matrix (Xiao2011Structural). It is involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis by dephosphorylating phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP), an essential intermediate in this pathway (Xiao2011Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and localization. There are also splice variant isoforms that can alter its activity and interactions.

## Function
PTPMT1 is a mitochondrial protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and energy production within healthy human cells. It is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its catalytic domain facing the mitochondrial matrix, where it functions primarily in the cardiolipin biosynthetic pathway (Xiao2011Structural; Pulido2013PTPs). Cardiolipin is a glycerophospholipid essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and is involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a key process in cellular energy production (Xiao2011Structural).

PTPMT1 dephosphorylates phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) to produce phosphatidylglycerol (PG), an essential step in cardiolipin synthesis (Xiao2011Structural). This activity is crucial for the proper functioning of the electron transport chain and maintaining the structure of membrane-embedded proteins (Xiao2011Structural). Disruption of PTPMT1 expression can lead to impaired mitochondrial respiration and altered mitochondrial morphology, highlighting its importance in cellular physiology (Xiao2011Structural).

In addition to its role in cardiolipin metabolism, PTPMT1 is involved in regulating mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis by influencing the binding of cytochrome c, a process necessary for programmed cell death (Niemi2013Downregulation). Its activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis, impacting various cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Niemi2013Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
PTPMT1 is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. In liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PTPMT1 is overexpressed in a significant number of patients, with 71.67% of HCC cases showing increased expression. This overexpression is associated with poor disease-free and overall survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Bao2021Genomewide). The gene's role in cardiolipin synthesis is crucial for cancer cell survival under hypoxic conditions, making it a targetable metabolic vulnerability in hypoxic solid tumors (Bao2021Genomewide).

In breast cancer, PTPMT1 splicing alterations, mediated by the splicing factor SRSF1, affect cancer cell proliferation and migration. The splice isoform PTPMT1-L promotes tumorigenesis, while PTPMT1-S suppresses it, indicating the clinical relevance of its splicing in cancer progression (Du2021Splicing).

PTPMT1 is also involved in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), where its expression is linked to mitochondrial function and cardiolipin levels. Alterations in PTPMT1 expression can lead to mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased mitochondrial content, contributing to the pathology of PAH (Russomanno2021miR150PTPMT1cardiolipin).

## Interactions
PTPMT1 interacts with the pseudophosphatase MK-STYX, a relationship identified through proteomic approaches and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is significant as it does not depend on the enzymatic activity of PTPMT1, suggesting a regulatory role for MK-STYX independent of PTPMT1's catalytic function (Niemi2014The). MK-STYX acts as a competitive inhibitor, reducing the phosphatase activity of PTPMT1 by increasing its apparent K_m, which indicates that MK-STYX disrupts substrate binding to PTPMT1 (Niemi2014The). This interaction is crucial in the context of chemoresistance and apoptosis in cancer cells, where PTPMT1 expression is necessary for chemoresistance in cells with depleted MK-STYX. Knocking down PTPMT1 can restore apoptosis, highlighting the opposing roles of these proteins in mitochondrial-dependent cell death (Niemi2014The).

PTPMT1 is also involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis, interacting with substrates like phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP). The structural analysis of PTPMT1 suggests that its active site accommodates the head group of PGP, forming hydrogen bonds with phosphate groups, while the diacylglycerol moiety interacts with a hydrophobic surface patch, enhancing substrate binding affinity (Xiao2011Structural).
