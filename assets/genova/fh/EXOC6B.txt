# EXOC6B

## Overview
EXOC6B is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 6B, which is a crucial part of the exocyst complex involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. The exocyst complex is an octameric protein assembly that plays a significant role in tethering secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, facilitating their fusion and subsequent release of contents. This process is vital for various cellular functions, including membrane trafficking, cell signaling, and maintaining cell polarity. EXOC6B is particularly important in the central nervous system, where it contributes to neurite outgrowth and the branching of embryonic neurons, as well as in primary ciliogenesis, which is essential for the formation and maintenance of primary cilia (Evers2014Mosaic; Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic). The protein's interactions with small GTPases like Rab10 and Rab8 further underscore its role in insulin signaling and cilia biogenesis, respectively (Sano2015A; Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic). Disruptions in EXOC6B function are linked to various developmental and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and human health.

## Function
The EXOC6B gene encodes a component of the exocyst complex, which is crucial for tethering secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, facilitating exocytosis. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including membrane trafficking, cell signaling, and maintaining cell polarity (Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic). The exocyst complex, including EXOC6B, is involved in the docking and fusion of cargo-laden vesicles to target membranes, which is vital for cell growth, proliferation, signaling, differentiation, and homeostasis (Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic). 

EXOC6B is widely expressed in human tissues, with notable expression in the central nervous system, where it plays a role in neurite outgrowth and the branching of embryonic neurons (Evers2014Mosaic). It is also implicated in primary ciliogenesis, a process essential for the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, which are critical for various cellular signaling pathways (Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic). The exocyst complex, including EXOC6B, is active at the trans-Golgi, recycling endosomes, and plasma membrane, where its assembly into an octameric state is necessary for membrane fusion (Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic). 

In healthy human cells, EXOC6B's role in primary ciliogenesis is crucial for normal cellular function and development, with disruptions potentially leading to skeletal disorders (Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EXOC6B gene are associated with several developmental and neurological disorders. Pathogenic variants in EXOC6B have been linked to spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity (SEMDJL), a condition characterized by skeletal abnormalities and joint dislocations (Halim2023The; Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic). Biallelic loss-of-function variants in EXOC6B disrupt primary ciliogenesis, contributing to SEMDJL type 3, which includes features like spine anomalies and multiple joint dislocations (Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic).

EXOC6B has also been implicated in intellectual disability (ID) and developmental delay. Haploinsufficiency of EXOC6B is suggested to cause intellectual impairment, as evidenced by cases involving deletions or translocations affecting the gene (Wen2013Phenotypic; Evers2014Mosaic). Patients with such genetic alterations often present with additional symptoms like speech delay, hyperactivity, and dysmorphic features (Evers2014Mosaic).

In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), EXOC6B is involved in insulin granule docking and secretion. Alterations in its expression or function can impair insulin secretion and glucose uptake, contributing to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction (Sulaiman2022EXOC6). These findings highlight the gene's role in various cellular processes and its potential impact on disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
EXOC6B, a component of the exocyst complex, participates in several critical interactions with other proteins. It interacts with Sec4, a Rab small GTPase, in its GTP-bound state, anchoring the exocyst complex to secretory vesicles, which is essential for exocytosis and membrane expansion (Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic). EXOC6B also binds strongly to Rab10 in its GTP form, suggesting a role in insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes (Sano2015A). This interaction is crucial for the exocytosis of GLUT4 vesicles, linking insulin signaling to glucose transport (Sano2015A).

In the context of primary ciliogenesis, EXOC6B colocalizes with Rab8, another small GTPase, at the primary cilium. This interaction is vital for cilia biogenesis, and inhibition of EXOC6B leads to reduced primary ciliogenesis (Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic). Additionally, EXOC6B is involved in the recruitment of SNAREs through EXOC7, facilitating membrane fusion (Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of EXOC6B in cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, insulin signaling, and ciliogenesis, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.
