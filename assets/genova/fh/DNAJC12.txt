# DNAJC12

## Overview
DNAJC12 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C12, which is a co-chaperone involved in the proper folding and stabilization of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (AAAHs) such as phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylases. This protein is crucial for the synthesis of monoamines, including neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, by ensuring the stability and functionality of these enzymes (Deng2023DNAJC12; Gallego2020Pathogenic). DNAJC12 is predominantly expressed in the brain, adrenal glands, and liver, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing neurodegenerative diseases (Deng2023DNAJC12; Martinez2023Structural). As a member of the Hsp40 family, DNAJC12 interacts with Hsp70, enhancing its ATPase activity and contributing to a client-regulated mechanism that ensures energy efficiency during protein stabilization (Martinez2023Structural). Mutations in the DNAJC12 gene are linked to various neurological and developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as hyperphenylalaninemia, infantile dystonia, and young-onset parkinsonism (Deng2023DNAJC12; Straniero2017DNAJC12).

## Structure
DNAJC12 is a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of approximately 23.4 kDa, although it appears larger on SDS-PAGE due to its intrinsically disordered regions (Martinez2023Structural). The protein contains a J-domain (JD) spanning residues 14-79, characterized by a tetra-helical structure, which is crucial for its interaction with Hsp70 (Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40; Martinez2023Structural). The N-terminal tail and the C-terminal half of the protein are disordered, with the C-terminal heptapeptide (KFRNYEI) being highly conserved across species and essential for client binding (Martinez2023Structural; Gallego2020Pathogenic).

The tertiary structure of DNAJC12 includes a disordered N-terminal tail, the JD, and an additional helix (helix V; residues 87-95) (Martinez2023Structural). The quaternary structure involves DNAJC12 binding as two monomers per TH tetramer, with each monomer interacting with opposite sides of the TH tetramer (Martinez2023Structural).

DNAJC12 has two transcript variants: the primary isoform encodes 198 amino acids, while the other encodes 107 amino acids (Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40). The protein is expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein and purified, showing a single band on SDS-PAGE (Martinez2023Structural).

## Function
DNAJC12 is a co-chaperone protein that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of monoamines, including neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. It functions as a co-chaperone for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (AAAHs) like phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and tryptophan hydroxylases (TPH1 and TPH2), ensuring their proper folding and stability (Deng2023DNAJC12; Gallego2020Pathogenic). DNAJC12 interacts with TH by stabilizing it and preventing its aggregation, which is essential for maintaining TH activity and its regulatory inhibition by dopamine (Martinez2023Structural). This interaction is crucial for dopamine biosynthesis, as TH is a key enzyme in this process (Martinez2023Structural).

In healthy human cells, DNAJC12 supports the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin by facilitating the proper function of these enzymes, which are essential for the production of these neurotransmitters (Deng2023DNAJC12). DNAJC12 is predominantly expressed in the brain, adrenal glands, and liver, where it supports the function of AAAHs (Deng2023DNAJC12). Its role in maintaining protein stability and preventing aggregation is crucial for cellular homeostasis and the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases (Martinez2023Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJC12 gene are associated with a range of neurological and developmental disorders. Biallelic pathogenic variants in DNAJC12 can lead to conditions such as hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), infantile dystonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and young-onset parkinsonism. These mutations result in reduced levels of dopamine and serotonin, as DNAJC12 functions as a co-chaperone for enzymes crucial in the synthesis of these neurotransmitters (Deng2023DNAJC12).

Patients with DNAJC12 mutations often present with symptoms resembling BH4 deficiency syndrome, including hyperphenylalaninemia, neurodevelopmental delay, and movement disorders. Early treatment with neurotransmitter precursors can prevent neurological deficits (Deng2023DNAJC12). The gene's mutations are included in newborn genetic testing due to their association with HPA (Deng2023DNAJC12).

DNAJC12 mutations are also linked to young-onset L-DOPA-responsive parkinsonism, characterized by mild intellectual disability and non-progressive motor symptoms (Straniero2017DNAJC12). The gene's role in dopamine and serotonin synthesis implicates it in various neuropsychiatric and mood disorders, including autism, anxiety, and depression (Deng2023DNAJC12).

## Interactions
DNAJC12, a member of the Hsp40 family, interacts with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to stabilize the enzyme and prevent its misfolding and aggregation. This interaction occurs with a moderate affinity (KD ~150 nM) and involves a 1:2 stoichiometry of TH tetramer to DNAJC12 monomer, allowing DNAJC12 to stabilize TH while permitting interactions with other regulatory proteins like 14-3-3 (Martinez2023Structural). DNAJC12 binds to the regulatory domains of TH, particularly through its C-terminal domain (CTD) and J-domain (JD), which are crucial for high-affinity binding (Martinez2023Structural). The binding of DNAJC12 to TH does not interfere with TH's active site or regulatory helix, allowing simultaneous binding with dopamine without affecting enzyme activity (Martinez2023Structural).

DNAJC12 also interacts with Hsp70, enhancing its ATPase activity when bound to TH, which suggests a client-regulated mechanism that ensures energy efficiency (Martinez2023Structural). The interaction with Hsp70 is not efficient in the absence of TH, indicating a specific role for DNAJC12 in stabilizing TH rather than general protein refolding (Martinez2023Structural). DNAJC12's role in protein stabilization extends to delaying the aggregation of other proteins, such as Tau (Martinez2023Structural).
