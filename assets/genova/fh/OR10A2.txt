# OR10A2

## Overview
The OR10A2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily A member 2, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odorants, facilitating the sense of smell. The olfactory receptor proteins, including OR10A2, are characterized by their seven transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The OR10A2 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the complex process of odor recognition and signal transduction, ultimately leading to the perception of smell (Qiu2020aarFDC).
