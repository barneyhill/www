# FGF17

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 17 (FGF17) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the fibroblast growth factor family, which is known for its involvement in a wide range of biological processes, including development, cellular growth, and differentiation. The protein product, fibroblast growth factor 17, is categorized as a growth factor and functions primarily through paracrine and autocrine signaling by interacting with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are receptor tyrosine kinases (Belov2013Molecular; Imamura2014Physiological). FGF17 is part of the FGF8 subfamily, sharing functional similarities with FGF8 and FGF18, and plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in brain and limb formation (Belov2013Molecular). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are essential for normal developmental processes, and alterations in FGF17 have been associated with various developmental and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Zanni2011FGF17; Men2020Genotypic).

## Structure
FGF17 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, characterized by a conserved core of approximately 140 amino acids forming a beta-trefoil structure. This structure consists of 12 beta-strands arranged into six two-stranded beta-hairpins, which is one of the oldest protein folds (Szybowska2021The). FGF17 is part of the FGF8 subfamily, which also includes FGF8 and FGF18 (Beenken2009The). 

FGF17 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in at least two isoforms: FGF17a and FGF17b. These isoforms have varying N-terminal sequences that influence their biological activity (Goetz2013Exploring). The protein interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are receptor tyrosine kinases with three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (D1, D2, and D3), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The D2 and D3 domains are crucial for ligand binding and specificity (Belov2013Molecular).

FGF17 has a high affinity for heparan sulfate and heparin, which stabilize the ligand-receptor complex and enhance resistance to proteolysis (Szybowska2021The). The interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans at the cell surface acts as a low-affinity receptor and storage reservoir (Szybowska2021The). Specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FGF17 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
FGF17, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, plays a significant role in various biological processes, particularly in development and cellular regulation. It is part of the FGF8 subfamily, which includes FGF8 and FGF18, and primarily functions through paracrine and autocrine signaling by activating fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are receptor tyrosine kinases (Belov2013Molecular; Imamura2014Physiological). The interaction of FGF17 with FGFRs involves the presence of heparan sulfate, which is necessary for receptor activation (Imamura2014Physiological).

FGF17 is involved in crucial cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and survival. It influences these processes by activating downstream signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and PLCγ, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Farooq2021The). The protein is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it influences nearby cells through paracrine signaling (Belov2013Molecular).

In terms of organismal outcomes, FGF17 is particularly important in embryonic development, including brain and limb formation, highlighting its role in regulating developmental processes (Belov2013Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FGF17 gene have been associated with several developmental and neurological disorders. A significant clinical condition linked to FGF17 is Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM), a cerebellar malformation characterized by developmental anomalies of the posterior fossa, including agenesis of the cerebellar vermis. A study identified a de novo deletion on chromosome 8p21.2-p21.3 in a patient with DWM, which resulted in reduced FGF17 expression, marking the first report of a human cerebellar malformation associated with FGF17 downregulation (Zanni2011FGF17).

FGF17 is also implicated in idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal puberty and infertility. Novel mutations in FGF17 were identified in a cohort of patients with IHH, highlighting its role in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuron ontogeny and its interaction with FGFR1c (Men2020Genotypic).

In neurological contexts, FGF17 is involved in the patterning of the frontal cortex. Alterations in FGF17 expression have been linked to cortical abnormalities, potentially contributing to conditions such as autism spectrum disorders and epileptogenesis (Turner2016Dysregulated).

## Interactions
FGF17 interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), specifically FGFR2 and FGFR3, in the presence of heparin, but not with FGFR1. This interaction is crucial for its role in midbrain and cerebellum development (Liu2003FGF17b). The binding of FGF17 to these receptors is similar to that of FGF8b, although FGF17 does not induce the same changes in gene expression and proliferation as FGF8b, which may be due to differences in protein production or secretion (Liu2003FGF17b).

FGF17 is part of the FGF8/17/18 subgroup and shares functional similarities with FGF8, as both can activate the same FGF receptors. However, FGF17 and FGF8 have distinct expression patterns and developmental roles, suggesting some level of functional redundancy but also unique functions (Reifers2000Overlapping). In zebrafish, FGF17 expression is dependent on FGF signaling, particularly FGF8, which is necessary and sufficient to induce FGF17 expression at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (Reifers2000Overlapping). Despite these interactions, specific details on the physical interactions of FGF17 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented in the provided context.
