# WDR46

## Overview
WDR46 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 46 protein, which is categorized as a nucleolar scaffold protein. This protein is integral to the structural organization and function of the nucleolus, particularly within the granular component, where it facilitates the localization and assembly of other nucleolar proteins. The WD repeat domain 46 protein is characterized by its intrinsically disordered regions at both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends, which are essential for its nucleolar localization and interaction with proteins such as nucleolin, DDX21, NOP2, EBP2, and fibrillarin. These interactions are crucial for processes like 18S rRNA processing and the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its involvement in gene expression regulation through upstream open reading frames (uORFs), with implications for conditions such as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (Hirai2013Nucleolar; Barbosa2013Gene).

## Structure
The WDR46 protein is characterized by intrinsically disordered regions at its N-terminal (amino acid residues 1-146) and C-terminal (536-610) ends, which are crucial for its nucleolar localization and interaction with other nucleolar proteins (Hirai2013Nucleolar). These regions contain putative nuclear localization signals and are exclusively localized to the nucleolus, functioning as hubs for molecular interactions (Hirai2013Nucleolar). The central part of WDR46 contains WD40 domain-repeats (147-535), a common structural motif involved in protein-protein interactions, which contributes to its tertiary structure by forming a beta-propeller (Hirai2013Nucleolar). 

WDR46 acts as a nucleolar scaffold protein, remaining in the insoluble fraction after biochemical treatments, similar to lamin B1, indicating its role in the fundamental nucleolar structure independent of DNA/RNA (Hirai2013Nucleolar). The protein's interactions with nucleolar proteins such as nucleolin, DDX21, NOP2, EBP2, and fibrillarin are facilitated by its intrinsically disordered regions, although the mechanism of association with NOP2 differs from that with other proteins (Hirai2013Nucleolar). The study does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of WDR46.

## Function
WDR46 is a nucleolar scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in the localization and assembly of other nucleolar proteins, particularly within the granular component (GC) of the nucleolus. It is essential for the proper localization of nucleolin and DDX21, which are involved in 18S rRNA processing and the assembly of the 40S small ribosomal subunit. When WDR46 is depleted, these proteins are mislocalized to the edge of the nucleoli, indicating its importance in maintaining their normal distribution within the GC (Hirai2013Nucleolar).

WDR46 contains intrinsically disordered regions that facilitate its interactions with other nucleolar proteins, such as nucleolin, DDX21, NOP2, EBP2, and fibrillarin. These regions are crucial for its nucleolar localization and function as a platform for RNA-unbound forms of these RNA-binding proteins (Hirai2013Nucleolar). The protein's role is independent of DNA or RNA, highlighting its function as a stable scaffold protein within the nucleolus, comparable to known nuclear scaffold proteins like lamin B1 (Hirai2013Nucleolar).

WDR46 is also involved in nucleolar reassembly during cell division, being recruited to nascent nucleoli in the early G1 phase to facilitate the proper recruitment of nucleolin and DDX21 (Hirai2013Nucleolar).

## Clinical Significance
The WDR46 gene has been implicated in various diseases through mutations and alterations in its expression. A notable variant in the WDR46 gene involves a G to A transition, leading to an amino acid change from glycine to arginine at codon 18 of an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the WDR46 transcript. This specific mutation is associated with an increased risk of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. The presence of this variant highlights the role of uORFs in modulating gene expression and their potential impact on disease susceptibility (Barbosa2013Gene).

While the WDR46 gene is located within the extended class II region of the HLA genomic loci, which is known for its association with autoimmune diseases, there is no direct evidence linking WDR46 mutations to specific autoimmune conditions. The region's diversity and genomic variations, such as SNPs, are important for constructing HLA haplotypes and mapping disease-related genes, but WDR46 itself has not been specifically associated with these diseases (Shiina2009The).

Overall, the clinical significance of WDR46 is primarily linked to its role in gene expression regulation through uORFs, with potential implications for respiratory diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand its involvement in other conditions.

## Interactions
WDR46 is a nucleolar scaffold protein that plays a significant role in the localization and interaction of various nucleolar proteins. It interacts directly with nucleolin and DDX21, both of which are crucial for 18S rRNA processing. These interactions are mediated by the intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal regions of WDR46, which serve as binding sites for these proteins (Hirai2013Nucleolar). WDR46 also interacts with other nucleolar proteins such as NOP2, EBP2, and fibrillarin, although the nature of these interactions is less clear. The interaction with NOP2 appears to differ from those with nucleolin and DDX21 (Hirai2013Nucleolar).

WDR46 is part of a complex that includes 18S rRNA, indicating its involvement in ribosomal RNA processing and assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This interaction is independent of DNA or RNA, suggesting that WDR46 functions as a scaffold protein, organizing RNA-unbound forms of these RNA-binding nucleolar proteins (Hirai2013Nucleolar). The protein's role in nucleolar organization is further supported by its ability to remain in the insoluble fraction after biochemical treatments, highlighting its structural importance in the nucleolus (Hirai2013Nucleolar).
