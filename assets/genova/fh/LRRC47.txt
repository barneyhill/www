# LRRC47

## Overview
The LRRC47 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 47 protein, which is a crucial component in the regulation of ribosomal protein translation. This protein is characterized by its N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a C-terminal B3/B4 tRNA-binding domain, which facilitate its interaction with the 18S rRNA and involvement in the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex. Functionally, LRRC47 acts as an anti-association factor, maintaining the 40S ribosomal subunit in a translationally inactive state by preventing the joining of the 60S subunit (Saba2023LARP1). Beyond its role in ribosomal function, LRRC47 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune response regulation. It interacts with proteins such as PDZ-binding kinase (PBK), influencing cancer prognosis and immune infiltration, particularly in liver and prostate cancers (Wang2024Identification). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm underscores its potential therapeutic significance in oncology and cellular biology.

## Function
The LRRC47 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of ribosomal protein translation. It is involved in the regulation of TOP (terminal oligopyrimidine tract) translation, which is crucial for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. The LRRC47 protein contains an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a C-terminal B3/B4 tRNA-binding domain. These domains interact with specific regions of the 18S rRNA, suggesting that LRRC47 may interfere with the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex, acting as an anti-association factor. This interaction potentially prevents the joining of the 60S subunit, maintaining the 40S subunit in a translationally inactive state (Saba2023LARP1).

In addition to its role in ribosomal function, LRRC47 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune response regulation. It interacts significantly with PDZ-binding kinase (PBK) and influences the prognosis and immune infiltration of liver cancer. LRRC47 is also closely related to the growth of prostate cancer cells, indicating its potential therapeutic significance (Wang2024Identification). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it may contribute to maintaining cellular structure and function.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
LRRC47 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in ribosomal protein interactions and cellular processes. It is part of the TOP-40S ribosomal complex, where it interacts with the 40S ribosomal subunit. This interaction is crucial for the formation and stabilization of the TOP-40S complex, as LRRC47's structure includes an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a C-terminal B3/B4 tRNA-binding domain, which interact with specific regions of the 18S rRNA. These interactions suggest that LRRC47 may act as an anti-association factor, preventing the joining of the 60S subunit and interfering with the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex (Saba2023LARP1).

LRRC47 also interacts with LARP1 within the ribosomal complex, as identified in cryo-electron microscopy studies. This interaction is part of the LARP1-LRRC47-40S ribosome complex, indicating a role in ribosomal structure and function (Saba2023LARP1).

In addition to its role in ribosomal interactions, LRRC47 is involved in protein-protein interactions related to cellular processes such as cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune response regulation. It significantly interacts with PDZ-binding kinase (PBK), influencing the prognosis and immune infiltration of liver cancer (Wang2024Identification).
