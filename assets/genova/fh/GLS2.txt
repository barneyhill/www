# GLS2

## Overview
The GLS2 gene encodes the enzyme glutaminase 2, a mitochondrial protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism and energy production. As a member of the serine-dependent beta-lactamase/transpeptidase-like superfamily, glutaminase 2 is categorized as a phosphate-activated enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate and ammonia, a critical step in the citric acid cycle (Hu2010Glutaminase; Suzuki2010Phosphateactivated). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining cellular energy balance and redox homeostasis, as it influences the levels of reduced glutathione and the GSH/GSSG ratio (Hu2010Glutaminase; Suzuki2010Phosphateactivated). The expression of GLS2 is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, linking it to cellular responses to oxidative stress and its potential role in tumor suppression (Hu2010Glutaminase; Suzuki2010Phosphateactivated). Additionally, GLS2 interacts with various cellular proteins, influencing processes such as cell migration and transcriptional regulation, further underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (López2020Nuclear; Zhang2016Glutaminase).

## Structure
The human GLS2 protein, also known as liver-type glutaminase, has a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of GLS2 consists of a polypeptide chain that forms a glutaminase domain spanning residues Ile154 to Gly479, which is common to both the LGA and GAB isoforms (Ferreira2021Structure). This domain is part of the serine-dependent beta-lactamase/transpeptidase-like superfamily and features an active site with a volume of approximately 500 Å³, located between an alpha/beta/alpha sandwich and a purely alpha subdomain (Ferreira2021Structure).

The secondary structure of GLS2 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with the glutaminase domain forming a tetrameric quaternary structure, similar to glutaminases from other organisms like Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli (Ferreira2021Structure). The GLS2 protein also contains three C-terminal ankyrin (ANK) repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and form atypical dimers (Pasquali2017The).

GLS2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as LGA and GAB, each with distinct tissue expression patterns and functions (Pasquali2017The). The protein's structure is conserved across various species, indicating an ancient origin (Pasquali2017The). The electrostatic landscape of the catalytic site in GLS2 is less positively charged compared to GLS, affecting its affinity for L-glutamine (Ferreira2021Structure).

## Function
The GLS2 gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme known as phosphate-activated glutaminase, which plays a crucial role in glutamine metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of glutamine to glutamate and ammonia. This process is essential for energy metabolism, as glutamate can be further converted into α-ketoglutarate, a key substrate for the citric acid cycle, enhancing mitochondrial respiration and ATP production (Hu2010Glutaminase; Suzuki2010Phosphateactivated). GLS2 is primarily localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to maintaining cellular energy balance and antioxidant defense by regulating the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and the GSH/GSSG ratio, which are critical for cellular redox homeostasis (Hu2010Glutaminase; Suzuki2010Phosphateactivated).

GLS2 expression is induced by the tumor suppressor protein p53, which enhances its role in reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced damage and apoptosis (Hu2010Glutaminase; Suzuki2010Phosphateactivated). This function is significant in preventing oxidative DNA damage and maintaining cellular homeostasis, highlighting GLS2's importance in both normal cellular function and its potential tumor-suppressive role (Hu2010Glutaminase; Suzuki2010Phosphateactivated).

## Clinical Significance
GLS2 (glutaminase 2) plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and mutations impacting clinical outcomes. In breast cancer, GLS2 expression varies by subtype, promoting tumor growth in luminal-subtype cells while being repressed in basal-subtype cells due to promoter methylation. Overexpression in triple-negative breast cancer is linked to increased invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), correlating with decreased survival rates (Buczkowska2023Two). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GLS2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with lower expression in tumors associated with shorter survival times. Its overexpression inhibits tumor growth and migration, while knockdown enhances tumorigenic properties (Buczkowska2023Two).

In glioblastoma, GLS2 is downregulated, contrasting with the upregulation of GLS, suggesting opposing roles. Ectopic expression of GLS2 reduces cell viability and increases sensitivity to chemotherapy, indicating potential therapeutic benefits (Buczkowska2023Two). In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), decreased GLS2 expression in CD4+ T cells is linked to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and insufficient interleukin-2 production, suggesting a role in disease development (Hisada2022Role). GLS2 mutations are also associated with complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, affecting immune responses and nitric oxide regulation (Scott2018Human).

## Interactions
GLS2 (glutaminase 2) is known to interact with the small GTPase Rac1, acting as a novel negative regulator. This interaction is specific to the inactive GDP-bound form of Rac1 (Rac1-GDP), where GLS2 inhibits Rac1's activity by preventing its activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Tiam1 and VAV1. The C-terminus of GLS2, referred to as GLS2-C139, is necessary and sufficient for this interaction, which is independent of GLS2's glutaminase activity (Zhang2016Glutaminase).

GLS2 competes with Rac1 GEFs for binding to the Switch I & II regions of Rac1-GDP, blocking the exchange of GDP for GTP and thus inhibiting Rac1 activation. This interaction is crucial for the suppression of cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, highlighting GLS2's role in tumor suppression (Zhang2016Glutaminase).

In addition to its interaction with Rac1, GLS2 is involved in nuclear translocation in cancer cells, where it associates with proliferation arrest and differentiation. This nuclear role is linked to transcriptional regulation through interactions with proteins such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), independent of its catalytic activity (López2020Nuclear).
