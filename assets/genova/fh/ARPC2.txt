# ARPC2

## Overview
The ARPC2 gene encodes the actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2, a critical component of the Arp2/3 complex, which is involved in the regulation of actin filament nucleation and branching. This protein plays a pivotal role in the formation of branched actin networks, essential for various cellular processes such as cell migration, invasion, and maintaining structural integrity (Cheng2019ARPC2). As a structural protein, ARPC2 interacts with other subunits within the Arp2/3 complex, facilitating its function in actin cytoskeleton remodeling. The protein's interactions with microtubules and actin filaments underscore its importance in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility (Havelková2015Arp23). Clinically, ARPC2 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced metastatic potential (Cheng2019ARPC2). Additionally, genetic variants of ARPC2 have been linked to ulcerative colitis, suggesting a broader role in human disease (Franke2008Sequence).

## Structure
The ARPC2 protein, also known as p34, is a component of the Arp2/3 complex and plays a crucial role in actin filament nucleation and branching. Structurally, ARPC2 forms a dimer with ARPC4 (p20) at the core of the Arp2/3 complex. The protein consists of two main domains, each featuring an α/β fold. These domains begin with a four-turn helix followed by an antiparallel β sheet of five strands, with an α helix inserted between strands 3 and 4, and completed by a short helix (Robinson2001Crystal).

The long COOH-terminal helices of ARPC2 and ARPC4 associate in an antiparallel fashion, forming a loosely packed interface compared to true antiparallel coiled coils. This interface is characterized by hydrophobic interactions and two salt bridges, although the residues are not arranged in a regular heptad repeat or packed in a knob-in-hole fashion (Robinson2001Crystal).

ARPC2 interacts extensively with ARPC4 and Arp3, embracing Arp3 between its NH2-terminal α/β1 domain and its COOH-terminal helix, forming a C-shaped clamp that cradles the Arp subunits (Robinson2001Crystal). The protein's interaction with microtubules is facilitated by its C-terminal half, particularly the region between amino acids 148 and 296, which is crucial for microtubule binding (Havelková2015Arp23).

## Function
The ARPC2 gene encodes a subunit of the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3 complex), which is essential for actin filament nucleation and branching in cells. This complex is composed of seven subunits, including ARPC2, and plays a crucial role in the formation of branched actin networks by binding to actin filaments. These networks are vital for various cellular processes such as cell migration, invasion, and maintaining structural integrity (Cheng2019ARPC2). In healthy human cells, ARPC2 is fundamental in the nucleation of actin filaments and participates in the polarization of the Golgi apparatus, which is critical for cell movement and structural integrity (Cheng2019ARPC2).

The Arp2/3 complex, with ARPC2 as a component, is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at sites of dynamic actin remodeling. It is involved in processes such as lamellipodia formation, phagocytosis, cell adhesion, and cell motility, which are essential for normal cellular activities, including cell shape changes and locomotion (Huang2022ARPC2:). The regulation of actin polymerization by ARPC2 is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and structure (Cheng2019ARPC2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ARPC2 gene have been implicated in the progression of breast cancer. Studies have shown that ARPC2 is highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines and tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor overall survival in breast cancer patients and is linked to clinicopathological characteristics such as lymph node metastasis, tumor size, and grade of breast cancer (Cheng2019ARPC2). Functional assays have demonstrated that silencing ARPC2 inhibits migration, invasion, and proliferation of breast cancer cells, while overexpression promotes these processes, suggesting that ARPC2 plays a significant role in breast cancer progression (Cheng2019ARPC2).

ARPC2 is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis. It activates the TGF-β pathway, leading to changes in EMT-related protein expression, such as increased vimentin and decreased E-cadherin levels, which are markers of mesenchymal and epithelial cells, respectively (Cheng2019ARPC2). These findings suggest that ARPC2 could be a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment (Cheng2019ARPC2).

In addition to its role in cancer, sequence variants in ARPC2 have been studied in the context of ulcerative colitis, indicating a potential genetic susceptibility to this condition (Franke2008Sequence).

## Interactions
ARPC2, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, is involved in various protein interactions essential for its function in actin polymerization and cytoskeletal dynamics. It interacts with microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AFs), forming filaments and co-sedimenting with these structures in vitro. Approximately 15% of ARPC2 co-sediments with MTs, while 37% co-sediments with AFs, indicating a direct binding to these cytoskeletal components (Havelková2015Arp23). In tobacco BY-2 cells, ARPC2 co-localizes with MTs and AFs, with a significant portion associating with MTs (Havelková2015Arp23).

ARPC2 also interacts with vinculin, a protein that links integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for the localization of the Arp2/3 complex to focal adhesions and the extension of lamellipodia. This interaction is disrupted by pimozide, an ARPC2 inhibitor, which suppresses cancer cell migration by blocking the ARPC2-vinculin interaction (Choi2019Pimozide). Benproperine (Benp), another ARPC2 inhibitor, binds specifically to ARPC2, involving hydrophobic interactions with residues F225, L243, and F247, and impairs the function of the Arp2/3 complex, thereby affecting actin polymerization and cell migration (Yoon2019Benproperine). These interactions highlight ARPC2's role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and its potential as a target for anti-metastatic therapies.
