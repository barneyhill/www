# TMEM154

## Overview
TMEM154 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 154, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to membrane structure and function. It is implicated in immune response regulation and has been associated with susceptibility to viral infections, such as small ruminant lentiviruses in sheep. Variants of TMEM154 have been linked to differences in disease susceptibility, making it a significant focus for genetic studies and breeding programs aimed at enhancing disease resistance in livestock. Additionally, TMEM154 has been associated with metabolic processes in humans, including the regulation of beta cell function in the context of type 2 diabetes, although its precise role in normal physiological processes remains to be fully understood (Harder2015The; Heaton2012Reduced; Heaton2013Genetic).

## Function
TMEM154, or transmembrane protein 154, is involved in cellular processes related to membrane structure and function. It is a protein that spans the cell membrane, potentially playing a role in cell signaling or interaction. TMEM154 is implicated in immune response regulation, particularly in the context of viral infections, and is active in the cell membrane. In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), the TMEM154-rs6813195 variant has been associated with decreased beta cell function, as indicated by lower insulinogenic and disposition indexes, which measure early insulin response and the ability of beta cells to respond to insulin resistance, respectively (Harder2015The). This suggests that TMEM154 may influence pancreatic beta cells by affecting intestinal hormone secretion, given its high mRNA expression in B lymphocytes and strong cytoplasmic and membranous positivity in glandular cells of the digestive tract, including the duodenum (Harder2015The). However, the specific function of TMEM154 in healthy human cells is not directly addressed in the available studies, and its role in normal physiological processes remains to be fully elucidated (Harder2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM154 gene are associated with increased susceptibility to small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs), such as the ovine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV) and Visna/Maedi virus (VMV), which affect sheep globally. Specific TMEM154 haplotypes, particularly those encoding the E35 allele, are linked to higher susceptibility to these infections. Sheep with the ancestral haplotype encoding glutamate at position 35 are more prone to infection, while those homozygous for the K35 variant exhibit reduced susceptibility (Heaton2012Reduced; Rodrigues2022Lentivirus).

The presence of TMEM154 mutations, such as the K35 variant, has clinical significance in reducing susceptibility to these viral infections. Selective breeding to increase the frequency of the K35 variant in sheep populations is suggested as a strategy to manage and potentially reduce infection rates (Yaman2019Association; Heaton2013Genetic). The TMEM154 gene's role in disease susceptibility highlights its potential as a genetic marker for breeding programs aimed at improving disease resistance in livestock (Heaton2012Reduced; Arcangeli2021First).
