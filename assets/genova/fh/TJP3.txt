# TJP3

## Overview
TJP3, or tight junction protein 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, which plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. The protein encoded by TJP3 is a scaffold protein that facilitates the assembly of tight junction complexes by linking transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby maintaining cell polarity and regulating paracellular permeability (Zihni2016Tight; Zhang2018The). TJP3 interacts with other tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and ZO-2, to form a complex network essential for the structural integrity and function of cell-cell contacts (Dithmer2024The). While not critical for embryonic development, TJP3 is significant in maintaining the functional integrity of tight junctions under normal physiological conditions and has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels may influence tumor progression and treatment response (Zhang2018The; Sun2023Rational).

## Structure
Tight Junction Protein 3 (TJP3) is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, characterized by its involvement in cell-cell adhesion. TJP3 contains several key domains, including PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in tight junctions (Heinemann2019Structural). The PDZ domains are particularly important for binding to other tight junction proteins, allowing TJP3 to participate in the assembly and maintenance of tight junction complexes (Heinemann2019Structural).

The PDZ domains of TJP3 are structured as a β-sandwich capped by two α-helices, which bind ligand peptides in a groove between helix α2 and strand β2. These domains can dimerize via domain swapping, a feature observed in similar proteins like ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 (Heinemann2019Structural). TJP3 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and localization within the cell (Heinemann2019Structural).

Splice variants of TJP3 may exist, potentially altering its interaction capabilities and cellular roles, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (Heinemann2019Structural).

## Function
TJP3 (tight junction protein 3) is a component of the tight junctions that are crucial for maintaining the integrity and selective permeability of epithelial and endothelial cell layers. As a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, TJP3 functions as a scaffold protein, linking transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the assembly and stability of tight junctions (Zhang2018The). TJP3 is involved in maintaining cell polarity and barrier function, contributing to the regulation of paracellular permeability and intracellular signaling pathways (Zhang2018The).

In healthy human cells, TJP3 interacts with other tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and ZO-2, to form a complex network that supports the structural integrity of cell-cell contacts. This interaction is vital for the regulation of cell morphology and adhesion, influencing processes like cell proliferation and differentiation (Zihni2016Tight). Although TJP3 is not essential for embryonic development, as its knockout in mice results in viable and fertile offspring, it plays a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of tight junctions under normal physiological conditions (Zhang2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TJP3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In a pan-cancer analysis, TJP3 was identified as one of the over-expressed genes in cancer, classified as a CAL protein-coding gene. This study highlighted that TJP3 is among the top 10 mutated genes, although it is rarely mutated compared to others like GATA3. The transcriptional level of TJP3 is associated with an increased risk of unfavorable prognosis in certain cancers, with high GSVA scores correlating with poor outcomes (Sun2023Rational).

In bladder cancer, TJP3 mRNA expression is upregulated in multiple cancer cell types, with a 1.7% genetic alteration ratio observed in bladder cancer patients. This upregulation is linked to the IC50 of mitomycin C, suggesting a potential role in chemotherapy response (Lee2022High). The study also notes that TJP3, along with other tight junction proteins, plays a role in the formation of tight junctions and modulates signaling pathways in cancer cells, although its specific role in bladder cancer progression remains unclear (Lee2022High).

These findings suggest that TJP3 may contribute to tumor progression and could serve as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment response.

## Interactions
TJP3, also known as tight junction protein 3, is a component of the tight junction complex in epithelial and endothelial cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cell polarity and regulating paracellular permeability. TJP3 interacts with other tight junction proteins, including ZO-1 (TJP1) and ZO-2 (TJP2), forming a scaffold that supports the tight junction structure (Zihni2016Tight; Dithmer2024The). These interactions are essential for the organization of the cytoskeleton and the recruitment of transmembrane proteins such as claudins and occludins, which are vital for the barrier function of tight junctions (Dithmer2024The).

In the context of the epithelial junctional complex, TJP3 is involved in binding interactions with structural components like cingulin and junction-associated coiled-coil protein (JACOP), as well as regulatory proteins such as protein kinase C (PRKCA) and SRC, which are part of a signaling platform that integrates regulatory interactions across different junctions (Zihni2016Tight; Paris2008The). These interactions highlight the multifunctional role of TJP3 in both structural and signaling capacities within tight junctions.
