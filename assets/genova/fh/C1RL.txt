# C1RL

## Overview
C1RL is a gene that encodes the complement C1r-like protein, a serine protease that plays a significant role in the human immune system. This protein is a component of the complement system, which is crucial for innate immunity and inflammation. The complement C1r-like protein is involved in the cleavage of peptide bonds, a key function in the activation of the complement cascade, which helps in the clearance of pathogens and damaged cells. The gene exhibits multiple splice variant isoforms, leading to different protein forms that may have distinct roles in immune responses. Alterations in C1RL expression have been linked to various diseases, including gliomas and age-related macular degeneration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (de2021Implications; Wang2020Immunological).

## Structure
C1RL encodes a protein that is part of the complement system, which plays a role in the immune response. The protein structure of C1RL includes a primary sequence of amino acids that folds into secondary structures such as alpha helices and beta sheets. These secondary structures contribute to the protein's tertiary structure, forming a three-dimensional shape essential for its function. C1RL may also participate in quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, enhancing its functional capabilities.

The protein contains specific domains, including serine protease domains, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity. These domains are involved in the cleavage of peptide bonds, a key function in the complement cascade. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in C1RL and can affect its stability, activity, and interactions with other molecules. Glycosylation involves the addition of carbohydrate groups to the protein, which can influence its folding and function.

C1RL also exhibits splice variant isoforms, resulting in different protein forms with distinct functions. These isoforms can lead to variations in the protein's activity and its role in the immune response, highlighting the complexity and adaptability of C1RL in human physiology.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The C1RL gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), C1RL expression is significantly upregulated. This upregulation is most pronounced in mesenchymal and primary GBM, as well as in IDH1-wild-type GBM, correlating with more advanced malignancy and poor prognosis. High C1RL expression is associated with reduced tumor purity, increased infiltration of M2 macrophages, and resistance to standard therapies, leading to unfavorable survival outcomes for patients (Wang2020Immunological).

C1RL is also linked to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where its expression is increased in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells derived from AMD patients. This suggests a role in the inflammatory processes associated with AMD, although specific functional studies on C1RL in this context are lacking (de2021Implications).

Beyond gliomas and AMD, C1RL has been associated with other conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, indicating its broader involvement in cancer and immune-related disorders (Wang2020Immunological). These associations highlight C1RL as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these diseases.
