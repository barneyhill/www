# MAML1

## Overview
MAML1 (Mastermind-like 1) is a gene that encodes the protein mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 1, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional coactivator and is integral to the Notch signaling pathway, where it interacts with the Notch intracellular domain and the CSL transcription factor to facilitate the transcription of Notch target genes (Wu2000MAML1; Just2009Transcriptional). MAML1 is also involved in other cellular processes, such as muscle differentiation and p53-mediated gene expression, by interacting with various transcription factors and coactivators like MEF2C and p300 (Shen2006The; McElhinny2008Mastermindlike). The protein's ability to modulate chromatin structure and transcriptional activity underscores its significance in cell fate determination, proliferation, and apoptosis. Alterations in MAML1 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Forghanifard2020MAML1; Shi2019Methylationmediated).

## Structure
The MAML1 protein is characterized by its N-terminal domain, which is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as the Notch intracellular domain (ICN) and p300, a histone acetyltransferase (Saint2007A; Nam2003Structural). This domain contains a proline-rich motif that is important for the acetylation of MAML1 by p300, influencing its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation (Saint2007A). The N-terminal region also includes a basic domain necessary for interaction with the Notch receptor's intracellular domain (Wu2004Cloning).

MAML1 contains two acidic domains in the middle and C-terminal regions, which contribute to its transcriptional activities (Wu2004Cloning). The protein is involved in forming a transcriptional activation complex with CSL and Notch ICN, where it acts as a scaffold to recruit additional co-activators (Nam2003Structural). MAML1 is acetylated at conserved lysine residues, which are crucial for its function and interaction with p300 (Saint2007A).

The protein's structure facilitates its role in the Notch signaling pathway, with its N-terminal domain being essential for recruiting p300 to promoter regions of Notch-regulated genes (Saint2007A). MAML1's interaction with histones H3 and H4 suggests its involvement in specific histone acetylation patterns, which are important for transcriptional regulation (Saint2007A).

## Function
MAML1 (Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 1) is a crucial coactivator involved in several signaling pathways, most notably the Notch signaling pathway. In the Notch pathway, MAML1 interacts with the intracellular domain of Notch receptors and the CSL transcription factor to enhance the transcription of Notch target genes, such as HES1. This interaction is essential for regulating cell fate decisions, proliferation, and apoptosis in healthy human cells (Wu2000MAML1; Just2009Transcriptional).

Beyond Notch signaling, MAML1 also plays a significant role in muscle differentiation by coactivating MEF2C, a transcription factor critical for myogenesis. MAML1 enhances the transcriptional activity of MEF2C, promoting the transition from myoblasts to myotubes, which is vital for muscle development and function (Shen2006The; McElhinny2008Mastermindlike).

MAML1 interacts with the histone acetyltransferase p300, enhancing its activity and facilitating histone acetylation, which is crucial for transcriptional activation. This interaction underscores MAML1's role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Hansson2009The; Just2009Transcriptional).

MAML1 is also involved in p53-mediated gene expression, enhancing p53-dependent responses, which are important for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to cellular stress (McElhinny2008Mastermindlike). These diverse roles highlight MAML1's importance in various cellular processes and its ability to mediate crosstalk among multiple signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAML1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, MAML1 is a direct target of miR-133a-3p, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. The silencing of miR-133a-3p leads to increased MAML1 expression, promoting cancer cell migration, invasion, and proliferation through the activation of Notch signaling and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process (Shi2019Methylationmediated). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), MAML1 overexpression correlates with advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, acting as an upstream regulator of TWIST1, a key EMT marker (Forghanifard2020MAML1; Forghanifard2011Expression).

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), MAML1 is crucial for Notch receptor activation, and its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Cheng2018Knockdown). MAML1 also influences the aggressiveness of breast cancer by affecting miR-133a-3p promoter methylation, creating a feedback loop that enhances tumor progression (Shi2019Methylationmediated). These findings highlight MAML1's potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers due to its involvement in critical signaling pathways and tumor progression mechanisms.

## Interactions
MAML1, a transcriptional co-activator, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathway. It forms a ternary complex with the intracellular domain of Notch receptors (ICN) and the DNA-binding protein CSL, enhancing Notch-induced transcription of target genes like HES-1 (Wu2004Cloning; Wu2000MAML1). MAML1 directly binds to the ankyrin repeats of Notch receptors, stabilizing the interaction between Notch IC and CSL (Wu2000MAML1; Hansson2009The).

MAML1 also interacts with the histone acetyltransferase p300, which acetylates MAML1 and histones H3 and H4, facilitating chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation (Saint2007A; Hansson2009The). The N-terminal domain of MAML1 is crucial for recruiting p300 to promoter regions of Notch-regulated genes (Saint2007A). MAML1's interaction with p300 is mediated by a proline-rich motif, which is essential for p300-mediated acetylation of MAML1 (Saint2007A).

Additionally, MAML1 interacts with GSK3b, which negatively regulates MAML1's transcriptional activity by phosphorylating it (Saint2009GSK3). These interactions highlight MAML1's role in modulating transcriptional activity through various signaling pathways.
