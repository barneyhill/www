# DTX3L

## Overview
DTX3L is a gene that encodes the deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 3L, a member of the Deltex family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by its RING-HC domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, allowing it to mediate the ubiquitination of specific substrates involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA damage repair and antiviral responses (Wang2021Functions; Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L). Unlike other Deltex proteins, DTX3L lacks WWE domains but contains unique domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions and oligomer formation (VelaRodríguez2022Activities). The protein's ability to form complexes with other proteins, such as PARP9, underscores its role in post-translational modifications and cellular signaling pathways (Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L). DTX3L's involvement in processes like endosomal sorting and immune responses highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory disorders (Wang2021Functions; Holleman2014The).

## Structure
The DTX3L protein is a member of the Deltex family of ubiquitin E3 ligases, characterized by its unique domain structure. It contains a RING-HC domain, which is a non-classical RING domain with a single histidine, differing from the classical RING-H2 domain found in other DTX proteins (Wang2021Functions). This domain is crucial for its E3 ligase activity, enabling the ubiquitination of specific substrates, such as histones H2BJ and H4, and viral proteases (VelaRodríguez2022Activities; Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L).

DTX3L also features a unique N-terminal region with nuclear localization signals (L1 and L2) and a nuclear export signal (E), which distinguishes it from other DTX family members (Wang2021Functions). The protein lacks the WWE domains found in other Deltex proteins, which are associated with PAR binding activity, and instead contains two small domains, D1 and D2, involved in oligomer formation (VelaRodríguez2022Activities).

DTX3L can form complexes with other proteins, such as PARP9, through its D3 domain, which replaces the proline-rich domain found in other family members (VelaRodríguez2022Activities; Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L). The protein is involved in post-translational modifications, including mono-ubiquitination and ADP-ribosylation, which are essential for its role in cellular processes like DNA damage repair and antiviral responses (Wang2021Functions; Zhang2015PARP9DTX3L).

## Function
The DTX3L gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, including DNA damage response and endosomal sorting. In the context of DNA repair, DTX3L is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by regulating the ubiquitination of proteins involved in this process. It interacts with the deubiquitinase USP28, forming a regulatory complex that influences the stability and activity of proteins such as TP53, c-MYC, and HIF-1α, which are critical for maintaining genomic stability (Ashok2023DTX3L). DTX3L also facilitates the recruitment of tumor suppressor proteins to DNA damage sites by monoubiquitinating histone 4, thereby fine-tuning cellular responses to DNA damage (Ashok2023DTX3L).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, DTX3L is involved in the endosomal sorting of the G protein-coupled receptor CXCR4. It mediates the degradation of CXCR4 by facilitating its sorting from early endosomes to lysosomes, a process essential for proper cellular trafficking and degradation pathways (Holleman2014The). DTX3L's activity in these processes underscores its importance in cellular differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
DTX3L is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In gliomas, DTX3L is upregulated, correlating with higher malignancy grades and poor prognosis. Its knockdown reduces glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and increases sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide (Xu2017DTX3L). In metastatic prostate cancer, DTX3L acts as an oncogenic survival factor, promoting proliferation and chemoresistance. It is involved in STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways, repressing tumor suppressor IRF1 and enhancing cell migration (Bachmann2014DTX3L). 

DTX3L is also overexpressed in cervical carcinoma, where it promotes tumor growth through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and tumor progression (Hu2023Silencing). In melanoma, DTX3L regulates invasion and metastasis via the FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway (Wang2021Functions). 

Beyond cancer, DTX3L is linked to inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, where it induces cytokine production through the STAT1 pathway (Wang2021Functions). These findings suggest DTX3L as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
DTX3L, a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It forms a complex with PARP9, mediated by the DTX3L D3 domain, which enhances ubiquitination and ADP-ribosylation activities. This complex is involved in DNA damage repair and chemoresistance in cancers such as lymphoma and glioma (Ashok2021Reconstitution; VelaRodríguez2022Activities). DTX3L also interacts with PARP14 in a PAR-independent manner, contributing to cancer proliferation and chemoresistance (VelaRodríguez2022Activities).

DTX3L forms heterodimers with DTX1, enhancing ubiquitination activity and regulating the NOTCH signaling pathway (VelaRodríguez2022Activities). It interacts with AIP4, a HECT-type E3 ligase, reducing AIP4's activity and affecting the ubiquitination of ESCRT-0 subunits, which are crucial for endosomal sorting (Holleman2014The).

DTX3L also interacts with USP28, a deubiquitinating enzyme, in a reciprocal regulatory relationship that influences DNA double-strand break repair. DTX3L ubiquitinates USP28, promoting its degradation, while USP28 deubiquitinates DTX3L, affecting their respective protein levels and functions (Ashok2023DTX3L). These interactions highlight DTX3L's role in modulating protein ubiquitination and cellular responses to DNA damage.
