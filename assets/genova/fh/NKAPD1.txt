# NKAPD1

## Overview
NKAPD1 is a gene that encodes the protein NKAP domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. The NKAPD1 protein is characterized by the presence of a NKAP domain, which suggests a role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. Although the precise biological functions of NKAPD1 are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in pathways that influence cell proliferation and differentiation. Research indicates that NKAPD1 may interact with other proteins to modulate gene expression, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further studies are required to fully understand the clinical significance and potential therapeutic applications of targeting NKAPD1 in disease contexts.
