# WSCD1

## Overview
The WSCD1 gene encodes the protein WSC domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of a WSC domain, a motif known to be involved in carbohydrate binding. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell wall integrity and stress response, due to its role in signaling pathways. The WSC domain containing 1 protein is categorized as a signaling protein, and its function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Research has suggested that it may interact with other proteins to modulate pathways related to cellular growth and differentiation, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Understanding the precise role of WSCD1 and its encoded protein could have significant implications for therapeutic strategies targeting related pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
