leader peptide, a short N-terminal segment, followed by a collagen-like region, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. The collagen-like and the fibrinogen-like domains are also found separately in other proteins such as complement protein C1q, C-type lectins known as collectins, and tenascins.  However, all these proteins recognize different targets, and are functionally distinct.  Ficolin 1 encoded by FCN1 is predominantly expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes, and has been postulated to function as a plasma protein with elastin-binding activity.
