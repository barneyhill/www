# AQP2

## Overview
Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) is a gene that encodes the aquaporin 2 protein, a crucial component of the water channel family of proteins. This transmembrane protein is primarily expressed in the kidney's collecting ducts, where it plays a vital role in water reabsorption and urine concentration. The aquaporin 2 protein facilitates the movement of water across cell membranes in response to the hormone vasopressin, thereby maintaining water homeostasis in the body (Sasaki2012Aquaporin). Structurally, aquaporin 2 forms a homo-tetrameric assembly, with each monomer containing a water-conducting pore, and is regulated through various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its trafficking and function (Moeller2011Regulation; Frick2014Xray). Mutations in the AQP2 gene are linked to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a condition characterized by impaired water reabsorption, leading to excessive urination and thirst (SchernthanerReiter2017Genetics).

## Structure
Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) is a water channel protein encoded by the human AQP2 gene, consisting of 271 amino acids. The primary structure of AQP2 includes a sequence that is 91% identical to the rat AQP2 (Sasaki2012Aquaporin). The secondary structure features six transmembrane alpha-helices connected by five loops, forming a single narrow aqueous pathway (Sasaki2012Aquaporin; Frick2014Xray). The tertiary structure of AQP2 is characterized by a water-conducting pore, which includes the Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs and an aromatic/arginine selectivity filter crucial for transport specificity (Frick2014Xray). AQP2 assembles into a homo-tetrameric structure, similar to other aquaporins, with each monomer containing a water-conducting pore (Sasaki2012Aquaporin; Frick2014Xray).

Post-translational modifications of AQP2 include N-glycosylation at asparagine 124, resulting in higher molecular mass forms of 35-50 kDa, although this glycosylation is not required for its water channel function (Sasaki2012Aquaporin; Bai1996Structure). Phosphorylation at serine 256 by PKA is crucial for its trafficking and water permeability (Sasaki2012Aquaporin). The protein's structure is consistent with the hourglass model, with unique features such as a layer of densities between crystal sheets, possibly representing the N-and C-termini (Sasaki2012Aquaporin).

## Function
Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) is a vasopressin-regulated water channel protein primarily expressed in the kidney's collecting ducts. It plays a crucial role in water reabsorption and urine concentration by facilitating the movement of water across cell membranes in response to vasopressin, a hormone that regulates water balance (Sasaki2012Aquaporin). AQP2 is located in the apical membrane and subapical vesicles of collecting duct principal cells and inner medullary collecting duct cells. Its presence in the plasma membrane is regulated by a balance between endocytosis and exocytosis, processes influenced by phosphorylation and ubiquitination (Sasaki2012Aquaporin; Moeller2011Regulation).

Phosphorylation at serine 256 is particularly important for AQP2's trafficking to the plasma membrane, enhancing its water channel activity and facilitating water reabsorption (Moeller2011Regulation; Brown2003The). Upon vasopressin stimulation, AQP2 is translocated to the apical membrane, increasing water permeability and allowing the kidney to concentrate urine effectively (Valenti1996Expression). This function is essential for maintaining body water homeostasis and is critical in conditions of water deprivation (Sasaki2012Aquaporin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AQP2 gene are associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a condition characterized by the kidney's inability to concentrate urine, leading to excessive urination and thirst. AQP2 mutations account for about 10% of congenital NDI cases, with most being autosomal recessive, though some are autosomal dominant (SchernthanerReiter2017Genetics). Autosomal dominant NDI is often caused by mutations in the C-terminus of AQP2, which result in a dominant-negative effect where mutant proteins interact with wild-type proteins, preventing proper translocation to the cell surface (Sasaki2012Aquaporin). Specific mutations, such as 721delG, 763-772del, and 812-818del, lead to frameshift mutations that impair the trafficking of AQP2, reducing its surface expression and function (Kuwahara2001Three).

In dominant NDI, mutant AQP2 proteins can form mixed oligomers with wild-type AQP2, leading to misrouting to late endosomes/lysosomes instead of the apical membrane, which is crucial for water reabsorption (Marr2002Heteroligomerization). This misrouting disrupts normal water reabsorption processes, contributing to the symptoms of NDI (Marr2002Heteroligomerization).

## Interactions
Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that regulate its trafficking and function in the kidney's collecting ducts. AQP2 interacts with heat shock proteins Hsc70 and Hsp70, which act as chaperones and are involved in its degradation and trafficking (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight; Lu2007Heat). The interaction with Hsc70 is particularly important for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process that is enhanced by vasopressin stimulation (Lu2007Heat).

AQP2 also forms complexes with proteins involved in its phosphorylation and trafficking, such as protein kinase A (PKA) and 14-3-3 proteins, which influence its phosphorylation state and membrane localization (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight). The ubiquitin-specific peptidase 4 (USP4) and E3 ubiquitin ligases NEDD4 and NEDD4L are involved in AQP2's deubiquitination and degradation (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight).

The cytoskeletal protein actin and SPA-1, a GTPase-activating protein, are part of a multiprotein complex that facilitates AQP2 trafficking (Noda2005Identification). AQP2 also interacts with annexin II, which is involved in its endocytosis and exocytosis processes (Zwang2009Identification). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of AQP2's role in water reabsorption and urine concentration.
