# IER5L

## Overview
IER5L, or Immediate Early Response 5 Like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of phosphorylation processes within cells. The protein encoded by IER5L is primarily active in the nucleus and plays a significant role in modulating the phosphorylation status of various proteins, thereby influencing cell cycle progression and stress responses. It interacts with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), particularly binding to the B55β subunit, which is crucial for its function in dephosphorylating target proteins such as CDC25A, S6K, and HSF1. These interactions suggest that IER5L is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stressors by affecting transcriptional regulation and cell proliferation (Ueda2019IER).

## Function
IER5L is involved in regulating the phosphorylation status of several proteins, impacting cell cycle progression and stress responses. It interacts with protein phosphatase PP2A, specifically binding to the B55β subunit, which suggests a role in modulating the phosphorylation of target proteins such as CDC25A, S6K, and HSF1 (Ueda2019IER). IER5L promotes the hypophosphorylation of CDC25A, reducing its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation (Ueda2019IER). This hypophosphorylation is also observed in S6K, where IER5L induces dephosphorylation at specific threonine and serine residues, potentially affecting protein synthesis pathways (Ueda2019IER).

IER5L's interaction with HSF1 leads to its hypophosphorylation, enhancing HSF1's transcriptional activity and increasing the expression of heat shock proteins like HSP70, which are vital for cellular stress responses (Ueda2019IER). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional regulation and cell proliferation. Although specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, IER5L's role in modulating phosphorylation and transcriptional activity suggests it is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stressors (Ueda2019IER).

## Interactions
IER5L interacts with several proteins, primarily through its N-terminal region. It binds to the B55 subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), specifically the α, β, γ, and δ subunits, as demonstrated by GST pull-down assays. This interaction is dependent on the N-terminal 110 amino acids of IER5L, as deletion of the first 55 amino acids abolishes binding. The interaction with PP2A is specific, as IER5L does not bind to the PP1 catalytic subunit (Ueda2019IER). 

IER5L also interacts with CDC25A, a cell cycle regulator, binding to its C-terminal catalytic domain. This interaction affects the phosphorylation status of CDC25A, particularly at the T507 residue, which is crucial for CDC25A's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. IER5L enhances the dephosphorylation of T507, inhibiting CDC25A's binding to 14-3-3 proteins and impacting cell cycle regulation (Ueda2019IER).

Additionally, IER5L interacts with ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), leading to their hypophosphorylation. This interaction with HSF1 is linked to increased transcriptional activity, as evidenced by enhanced expression of HSP70, an HSF1-controlled gene (Ueda2019IER).
