# GBP1

## Overview
Guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) is a gene that encodes a large GTPase protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the immune response. The GBP1 protein is characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, a function facilitated by its large GTPase domain, which is a hallmark of the dynamin superfamily (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding). This protein is primarily activated by interferons, especially interferon-γ, and plays a crucial role in regulating membrane dynamics, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell cycle progression (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding). GBP1 is also implicated in antiviral defense mechanisms and the modulation of immune responses, making it significant in both health and disease contexts, including cancer and viral infections (Zhao2022GuanylateBinding; Itsui2009Antiviral). The structural complexity of GBP1, including its ability to form homodimers and undergo post-translational modifications, underpins its diverse functional roles in cellular signaling and immune defense (Sistemich2021Structural).

## Structure
The human guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) is a large GTPase characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of GBP1 is encoded by the GBP1 gene and includes a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure of GBP1 consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Vestal2011The).

The tertiary structure of GBP1 forms a globular shape, featuring a large GTPase (LG) domain at the N-terminus, which is involved in GTP binding and hydrolysis. This domain is shared among the dynamin superfamily and is crucial for regulating membrane trafficking (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding). The protein also includes an elongated α-helical domain connected to the LG domain by a short intermediate region composed of a helix and a two-stranded β-sheet (Prakash2000Triphosphate).

GBP1 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure. Dimerization involves interactions between specific helices, such as the α12/13 domains of one monomer and the α4' helix of another (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding). Post-translational modifications, such as farnesylation at the C-terminal CaaX motif, are crucial for its membrane-binding capabilities and function (Sistemich2021Structural). These structural features enable GBP1 to play a significant role in the immune response.

## Function
Guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) is a large GTPase that plays a significant role in the immune response and cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily activated by interferons, particularly interferon-γ (IFNγ), and is involved in the regulation of membrane dynamics, cytoskeleton, and cell cycle progression (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding). GBP1 is rapidly upregulated in response to type-I and type-II interferon stimulation, acting as a critical interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that modulates the activity of other ISGs (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding).

In cellular biology, GBP1 is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and endosome trafficking, which are essential for the early inflammatory response (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding). It interacts with various binding partners, including TUBB3, PIM1, ATG8, and p62, facilitating diverse cellular effects (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding). GBP1's activity is regulated by its GTP binding status, which influences its self-assembly and interaction with these partners (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding).

GBP1 also plays a role in inhibiting cellular proliferation and apoptosis, promoting cell survival during inflammation (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding). It is involved in the clearance of intracellular pathogens and protects cells from inflammation-induced apoptosis (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding). In endothelial and epithelial cells, GBP1's C-terminal region restrains proliferation, while its N-terminal GTPase function inhibits matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), reducing cellular spreading and proliferation (Honkala2020Guanylate-Binding).

## Clinical Significance
Guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) has significant clinical implications in various cancers due to its role in immune response modulation. In uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), GBP1 mutations are associated with improved overall survival and progression-free survival, linked to increased infiltration of immune cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Zhao2022GuanylateBinding). In colorectal cancer, GBP1 mutations correlate with higher infiltration of CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and myeloid dendritic cells, suggesting a role in enhancing anti-tumor immunity (Zhao2022GuanylateBinding).

In cervical cancer, GBP1 is widely expressed and associated with poor prognosis. High GBP1 expression correlates with drug sensitivity and immune cell infiltration, particularly CD8+ T cells and macrophages. It is also linked to immune checkpoint genes, indicating a role in immune escape mechanisms (Wang2024Function). GBP1 expression in prostate cancer is associated with aggressive cancer features and poor survival, despite some data suggesting better survival outcomes (Zhao2020Oncogenic).

GBP1's expression is also significant in predicting responses to immunotherapy across various cancer types. High GBP1 expression is linked to better clinical responses to immunotherapy, as it is associated with 'hot' anti-tumor immune phenotypes and lower tumor immune dysfunction (Zhao2022GuanylateBinding).

## Interactions
Guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1) is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in immune response and cellular processes. GBP1 interacts with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein NS5B, where its GTPase domain binds to the finger domain of NS5B, playing a crucial role in its antiviral effect against HCV (Itsui2009Antiviral). GBP1 also interacts with actin, a key component of the cytoskeleton, and is involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling. This interaction is direct and does not require additional factors, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Ostler2014Gamma). GBP1 binds robustly to globular actin and slightly to filamentous actin, suggesting it may induce actin remodeling through globular actin sequestering and/or filament capping (Ostler2014Gamma).

GBP1 also interacts with the prosurvival kinase PIM1, forming a complex that is modulated by GTP binding, which decreases the formation of the GBP1:PIM1 complex through an allosteric mechanism (Persico2015GTP). Additionally, GBP1 is involved in T cell signaling, where it binds to cytoskeletal proteins such as β-IIITubulin and PIM1, influencing T cell activation (Forster2014Guanylate). These interactions highlight GBP1's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and immune defense.
