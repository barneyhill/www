# B3GNT5

## Overview
B3GNT5 is a human gene that encodes the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 5, a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids, specifically the lacto- and neolacto-series. This enzyme plays a critical role in the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to galactose, forming lactotriaosylceramide, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell-cell communication and signaling (Miao2022Elevated; Jeong2020B3GNT5). The B3GNT5 protein is characterized as a type II membrane protein, with a structure that includes a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane segment, and a catalytic domain (Togayachi2001Molecular). It is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to glycan chain elongation, a process vital for the proper functioning of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Miao2022Elevated). Alterations in B3GNT5 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and its significance in cancer progression and immune modulation (Verkerk2024Tumorexpressed; Miao2022Elevated; Jeong2020B3GNT5).

## Structure
The B3GNT5 protein is encoded by the human B3GNT5 gene and is involved in the synthesis of lacto- or neolacto-series carbohydrate chains on glycolipids. The primary structure of the B3GNT5 protein consists of 378 amino acids, and it is predicted to be a type II membrane protein. This structure includes a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane segment, and a catalytic domain (Togayachi2001Molecular). The protein contains motifs typical of the β3Gal-T and β3Gn-T families, with conserved cysteine residues and a triplet of aspartic acid residues that may serve as a dication binding site (Togayachi2001Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of B3GNT5 include N-glycosylation, which is crucial for its stabilization and function. The protein is predominantly N-glycosylated at four sites: N59, N167, N276, and N335. Glycosylation enhances the stability of B3GNT5, as non-glycosylated forms degrade more rapidly (Miao2022Elevated). The presence of glycosylation also correlates with increased surface expression of SSEA-1 and enhanced sphere-forming ability in cancer cells, indicating its role in promoting tumorigenic activity (Miao2022Elevated). The molecular structure of B3GNT5, including its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The B3GNT5 gene encodes a glycosyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), specifically the lacto- and neolacto-series. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to galactose at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains, forming lactotriaosylceramide (Miao2022Elevated; Jeong2020B3GNT5). B3GNT5 is the sole enzyme responsible for synthesizing lactotriaosylceramide, a glycolipid involved in the generation of lacto- and neolactoseries carbohydrate chains, which are important for cellular processes such as cell-cell communication and signaling (Miao2022Elevated).

The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to glycan chain elongation, a process essential for the proper functioning of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Miao2022Elevated). These glycan structures are involved in various biological processes, including embryonic development and immune response. The activity of B3GNT5 in healthy cells is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions, although specific details about its role in healthy human cells are not extensively discussed in the available literature (Miao2022Elevated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the B3GNT5 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In glioblastoma, a highly malignant brain tumor, elevated B3GNT5 expression is associated with glioma stem cell properties, contributing to tumor development, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence. Higher levels of B3GNT5 correlate with poor clinical outcomes in glioblastoma patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Jeong2020B3GNT5).

In breast cancer, particularly the basal-like subtype, B3GNT5 is overexpressed due to copy number amplification and promoter hypomethylation. This overexpression is linked to increased cancer stem cell-like properties and tumorigenesis, correlating with larger tumor sizes, higher histological grades, and poorer survival outcomes. B3GNT5's role in glycosylation is crucial for its protein stability, and its expression enhances the surface expression of SSEA-1, a marker associated with cancer stem cells (Miao2022Elevated).

In liver cancer, B3GNT5 expression is upregulated, with decreased methylation levels contributing to its increased expression. This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis and is regulated by the lncRNA MIR4435-2HG through miR-136-5p, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Zhu2021lncRNA).

## Interactions
B3GNT5 is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids and has been implicated in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. In liver cancer, B3GNT5 expression is upregulated by the long non-coding RNA MIR4435-2HG, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-136-5p, thereby relieving its suppression on B3GNT5 (Zhu2021lncRNA). This interaction suggests a regulatory axis involving MIR4435-2HG, miR-136-5p, and B3GNT5 that contributes to cancer progression.

In the context of immune responses, B3GNT5-related non-sialylated glycosphingolipids (nsGSLs) have been shown to modulate the interaction between the phagocytosis inhibitory receptor SIRPα and its ligand CD47. The deletion of B3GNT5 can restore this interaction, indicating that B3GNT5-related nsGSLs play a role in immune cell interactions (Verkerk2024Tumorexpressed).

In glioblastoma, B3GNT5 is upregulated in glioma stem cells and is associated with maintaining stem cell properties. Knockdown of B3GNT5 results in decreased stem cell markers and neurosphere formation, highlighting its role in stem cell self-renewal (Jeong2020B3GNT5). These interactions underscore the significance of B3GNT5 in various cellular contexts, particularly in cancer progression and immune modulation.
