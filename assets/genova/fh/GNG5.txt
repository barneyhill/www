# GNG5

## Overview
GNG5 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit gamma 5 (Gγ5), a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction. These proteins are integral to the function of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which mediate a wide range of physiological processes by transmitting signals from the cell surface to intracellular effectors. The Gγ5 protein, categorized as a gamma subunit, plays a critical role in the specificity and regulation of these signaling pathways. It is particularly significant in neural development, where it influences the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and in metabolic processes, such as insulin secretion. Additionally, GNG5 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gliomas, where its expression levels correlate with tumor grade and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Yang2020GNG5; AyoMartin2020GNG5).

## Structure
The GNG5 gene encodes a gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are involved in signal transduction. The primary structure of GNG5 includes a unique -CSFL motif that influences its processing, resulting in variably processed isoforms (Hansen2010Specificity). The gamma subunits, including GNG5, are known for their diversity, particularly in the N-terminal region, which may contribute to specificity in protein interactions. The C-terminal region of GNG5 is involved in directing post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, which is crucial for membrane localization and function (Mulligan2010Prenylationdeficient; Hansen2010Specificity).

GNG5 is categorized into a class with γ5 and γ10 subunits, sharing 53% amino acid identity, indicating a degree of structural similarity (Hansen2010Specificity). The C-termini of some gamma subunits, including γ5, contain PDZ consensus sequences, suggesting roles in intracellular localization (Hansen2010Specificity). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of the GNG5 protein, as well as its specific domains and prominent folds, are not provided in the available context. The gene structure of GNG5 includes two coding exons and may have additional non-coding exons that could affect mRNA stability or subcellular localization (Hansen2010Specificity).

## Function
The GNG5 gene encodes the G protein subunit gamma 5 (Gγ5), which is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction. These proteins play a crucial role in transmitting signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell membrane to various intracellular effectors. Upon activation by an agonist, the G protein complex undergoes a conformational change, leading to the dissociation of the α subunit from the βγ dimer, allowing the βγ subunits to act as effectors in pathways such as the MAP kinase cascade and vesicular trafficking (AyoMartin2020GNG5).

GNG5 is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells, particularly in human basal radial glial cells, where it is essential for brain expansion and gyrification. It regulates the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells, influencing the number of apical and basal progenitors and affecting neuronal migration during cortical development (AyoMartin2020GNG5). GNG5 is also localized in mitochondria, suggesting a role in mitochondrial function or dynamics (AyoMartin2020GNG5).

In the context of insulin secretion, GNG5 is involved in regulatory pathways that influence glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, potentially contributing to glucotoxic effects in hyperglycemic conditions (Taneera2014Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GNG5 gene have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of gliomas, a type of brain tumor. GNG5 is overexpressed in glioma samples compared to normal brain tissues, and its expression levels are positively correlated with the World Health Organization (WHO) grade of gliomas. Higher expression levels of GNG5 are associated with more advanced tumor grades and are linked to clinical features such as older age, microvascular proliferation, necrosis, and tumor recurrence. Importantly, high GNG5 expression is associated with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival in glioma patients, making it an unfavorable prognostic indicator (Yang2020GNG5).

In addition to its role in gliomas, GNG5 expression is relevant in the context of immune cell infiltration in tumors. It is positively correlated with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and M2 macrophage infiltration, which are associated with poor survival outcomes in glioma patients (Cai2021A). These findings suggest that GNG5 could serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in glioma management and may be a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
GNG5, or G protein subunit gamma 5, is a component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, which includes alpha and beta subunits. This complex interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell membrane. Upon activation by an agonist, the alpha subunit exchanges GDP for GTP and dissociates, allowing the beta-gamma dimer, which includes GNG5, to act as an effector in various intracellular signaling pathways, such as the MAP Kinase cascade and vesicular traffic (AyoMartin2020GNG5).

GNG5 is also involved in the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. It forms a G beta-gamma dimer that couples signals from GPCRs to activate adenylyl cyclases or potassium channels, influencing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Taneera2014Identification).

In the context of cortical development, GNG5 is suggested to mediate the functions of DCHS1 and FAT4, as similar phenotypes are observed with their downregulation. This implies potential interactions or shared pathways between these proteins (AyoMartin2020GNG5). Additionally, GNG5 is enriched in mitochondria, indicating possible interactions with mitochondrial proteins, although specific physical interactions are not detailed (AyoMartin2020GNG5).
