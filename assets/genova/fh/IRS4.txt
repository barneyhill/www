# IRS4

## Overview
Insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic adaptor protein involved in insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways. The IRS4 protein plays a crucial role in mediating signal transduction by interacting with insulin and IGF receptors, facilitating downstream signaling events. It is characterized by the presence of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which are essential for its function as a docking protein. These domains enable IRS4 to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation, allowing it to interact with various signaling molecules, including those containing SH2 domains. IRS4 is expressed in several human tissues and is implicated in processes such as cell differentiation and glucose uptake. Additionally, it has been associated with certain pathological conditions, including cancer and central hypothyroidism, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Weischenfeldt2016Pancancer; Sesti2001Defects; Karas2001The).

## Structure
IRS4 is a cytoplasmic protein involved in insulin signaling, characterized by the presence of specific domains that facilitate its function. It contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain at the N-terminus, which are crucial for its interaction with the insulin receptor and efficient tyrosine phosphorylation (Karas2001The). These domains allow IRS4 to act as a docking protein, mediating signaling pathways activated by insulin and IGF-I receptors.

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which influence its activity and interactions. Tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for IRS4's interaction with SH2 domain-containing proteins, such as Crk-II, and involves specific tyrosine residues (Y700, Y717, Y743, Y779) (Karas2001The). These phosphorylated tyrosines are part of motifs that facilitate binding to SH2 domain-containing proteins, playing a significant role in downstream signaling.

IRS4 does not have a well-defined quaternary structure, as it primarily functions as a signaling adaptor. The protein's structure and modifications enable it to participate in complex signaling networks, impacting various cellular processes (Tsuruzoe2001Insulin; Karas2001The). There is no detailed information available on the primary, secondary, or tertiary structures of IRS4 in the provided context.

## Function
IRS4 (insulin receptor substrate 4) is a cytoplasmic protein involved in insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways. It acts as an adaptor molecule, facilitating the transmission of signals from insulin and IGF receptors to downstream effectors. IRS4 is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin, which allows it to interact with various signaling molecules, including the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and Grb-2 (Sesti2001Defects; Giovannone2000Insulin).

IRS4 is expressed in various human tissues, such as the pituitary, thyroid, ovary, and prostate, but not in the spleen or lung (Sesti2001Defects). It plays a role in cell differentiation, as indicated by increased IRS4 mRNA expression during the differentiation of certain cell types. Functionally, IRS4 overexpression in rat adipocytes enhances GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface, promoting glucose uptake (Sesti2001Defects). In 32D hematopoietic cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, IRS4 enhances insulin and IGF-I-stimulated cell proliferation, although it does not promote cell survival like IRS-1 and IRS-2 (Giovannone2000Insulin).

IRS4 may also act as a negative regulator of IGF-I signaling by suppressing IRS-1 and IRS-2 functions, reducing their mRNA and protein levels, and decreasing their association with PI 3-kinase (Tsuruzoe2001Insulin). This suggests a complex role in modulating signaling pathways related to cell growth and mitogenesis, potentially acting as both a mediator and inhibitor depending on the cellular context (Tsuruzoe2001Insulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the IRS4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, IRS4 is associated with lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC), sarcoma, and cervical squamous carcinoma. These associations are primarily due to somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) that lead to IRS4 overexpression. In LUSC, recurrent deletions downstream of IRS4 coincide with increased expression, potentially due to alterations in chromatin structure and enhancer hijacking mechanisms. This overexpression is linked to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, promoting cell proliferation and migration, and is supported by experimental evidence showing increased tumor growth in mouse models with IRS4 overexpression (Weischenfeldt2016Pancancer).

IRS4 mutations are also associated with central hypothyroidism (CeH). Studies have identified specific mutations in IRS4 in male patients with CeH, characterized by low thyroid hormone levels due to insufficient thyroid-stimulating hormone production. These mutations have been found in several families, with male carriers exhibiting biochemical signs of CeH. The IRS4 gene is expressed in the hypothalamic nuclei and pituitary gland, suggesting its role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (CA2019Mutations).

## Interactions
IRS4 interacts with several proteins involved in insulin and IGF-I receptor signaling pathways. It binds to SH2 domain-containing proteins following tyrosine phosphorylation by the insulin receptor, although its interaction with p85, a regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, is notably weak. IRS4 binds p85α weakly and does not bind p85β, which affects its ability to activate PI 3-kinase fully (Uchida2000IRS4). Despite this, IRS4 can still promote the PKB/Akt signaling pathway during insulin stimulation (Uchida2000IRS4).

IRS4 also interacts with Crk-II, an adapter protein involved in IGF-I receptor signaling. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on IRS4, and is enhanced following IGF-I stimulation (Karas2001The). The region between amino acids 678 and 800 of IRS4 is crucial for its interaction with Crk-II (Karas2001The).

Additionally, IRS4 has been identified as a binding partner of the copper transporter protein CTR1. This interaction is specific to IRS4, as no interaction with IRS-1 or IRS-2 was detected (Tsai2014Molecular). The interaction with CTR1 is mediated by specific amino acids in CTR1, such as Y103 (Tsai2014Molecular).
