# BTN2A2

## Overview
BTN2A2 is a gene that encodes the protein butyrophilin subfamily 2 member A2, which is a member of the butyrophilin family, related to the B7 family of immune co-regulatory proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of immune responses, functioning as an inhibitor of T cell activation. It is expressed on various immune cells, including B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and activated T cells, indicating its role in modulating immune responses (Smith2010BTN1A1). BTN2A2 is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis by influencing the balance between effector and regulatory T cell responses, and its interactions with innate lymphoid cells further underscore its role in immune regulation (Frech2022Btn2a2). The protein's involvement in immune modulation has significant implications for autoimmune diseases, bone disorders, and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Sarter2016Btn2a2).

## Function
BTN2A2 is a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through its role as an inhibitor of T cell activation. It is part of the butyrophilin family, which is related to the B7 family of immune co-regulatory proteins. BTN2A2 is expressed on various immune cells, including B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and is upregulated on activated T cells, suggesting its involvement in modulating immune responses (Smith2010BTN1A1).

BTN2A2 functions by inhibiting the proliferation and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This inhibition is observed when BTN2A2 is presented as a plate-bound fusion protein, indicating that its inhibitory effects are dependent on its physical presentation to T cells (Smith2010BTN1A1). The protein also reduces the production of cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-γ by CD4+ T cells, further contributing to its role in immune regulation (Smith2010BTN1A1).

In addition to its role in T cell regulation, BTN2A2 is involved in maintaining immune homeostasis by modulating the balance between effector and regulatory T cell responses. Its expression by antigen-presenting cells is crucial for this regulatory function, as evidenced by studies showing altered immune responses in Btn2a2-deficient mice (Sarter2016Btn2a2).

## Clinical Significance
BTN2A2 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in immune regulation. Alterations in BTN2A2 expression or function can lead to exacerbated autoimmune responses. In mice deficient in BTN2A2, there is an increase in pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells, which are associated with autoimmune conditions such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (Sarter2016Btn2a2). These mice also show increased anti-DNA antibody titers with age, suggesting a potential loss of self-tolerance (Sarter2016Btn2a2).

BTN2A2 also plays a role in bone homeostasis. Its deficiency in mice leads to changes in trabecular bone architecture, indicating its involvement in osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. This is particularly relevant in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, where decreased levels of BTN2A2 have been observed (Frech2021RANKLInduced).

In cancer, BTN2A2 deficiency has been shown to potentiate antitumor responses. Mice lacking BTN2A2 exhibit impaired tumor growth, correlating with increased infiltration of IFN-γ-producing T cells in tumors, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for enhancing antitumor immunity (Sarter2016Btn2a2). These findings highlight BTN2A2's significant role in modulating immune responses, with implications for autoimmune diseases, bone disorders, and cancer.

## Interactions
BTN2A2, a member of the butyrophilin family, is involved in various interactions that modulate immune responses. It acts as an inhibitor of T cell activation by binding to a receptor on T cells, although the specific receptors remain unidentified (Sarter2016Btn2a2). BTN2A2 is expressed on the surface of immune cells such as T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, with its expression increasing upon activation (He2021BTN2A2). The BTN2A2-Ig fusion protein, which includes the extracellular domain of BTN2A2, binds more strongly to activated T cells compared to resting ones, suggesting that activated T cells express a putative BTN2A2 receptor (He2021BTN2A2).

BTN2A2 also plays a role in the interaction between innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and T cells, particularly in type 2 immune responses. It acts as a co-stimulatory molecule, maintaining T cell homeostasis and modulating immune responses to prevent excessive reactions in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (Frech2022Btn2a2). BTN2A2's expression on ILC2 is upregulated following stimulation, and its absence leads to increased T cell responses, indicating its role in restraining T cell-mediated immunity (Frech2022Btn2a2). These interactions highlight BTN2A2's significant role in immune regulation through its inhibitory and co-stimulatory functions.
