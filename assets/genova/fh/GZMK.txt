# GZMK

## Overview
Granzyme K (GZMK) is a gene that encodes the serine protease enzyme granzyme K, which is predominantly expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. As a member of the granzyme family, granzyme K plays a crucial role in immune defense mechanisms, particularly in inducing apoptosis and modulating inflammatory responses. Unlike other granzymes, granzyme K is characterized by its tryptase activity, cleaving substrates after arginine or lysine residues, and is involved in both intracellular and extracellular processes. Intracellularly, it contributes to apoptosis through caspase-independent pathways, while extracellularly, it influences immune responses by activating endothelial cells and modulating pro-inflammatory signals. Granzyme K's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections, underscores its significance in immune regulation and potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2006Granzyme; Jonsson2022Granzyme; Bouwman2021Intracellular).

## Structure
Granzyme K (GZMK) is a serine protease primarily found in cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells. The primary structure of GZMK consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of serine proteases. The tertiary structure of GZMK is a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by disulfide bonds, which is common in proteins of this class. GZMK functions as a monomer, indicating it lacks a quaternary structure (Zhao2006Granzyme; Joeckel2017Granzyme).

GZMK shares substrate specificity with granzyme A (GzmA), particularly in cleaving SET complex proteins such as SET, HMG2, and Ape1, suggesting partial redundancy with GzmA (Zhao2006Granzyme). The crystal structure of GZMK has been determined, revealing its monomeric nature, which contrasts with the dimeric structure of GzmA (Zhao2006Granzyme). GZMK is characterized by its tryptase activity, cleaving substrates after Arg or Lys residues (Joeckel2017Granzyme). While specific domains, prominent folds, and post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common in serine proteases, detailed information on these aspects for GZMK is not provided in the available context.

## Function
Granzyme K (GZMK) is a serine protease expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, playing a significant role in immune defense. In healthy human cells, GZMK is involved in both intracellular and extracellular processes. Intracellularly, it contributes to cytotoxicity by cleaving DNA into oligonucleosome-sized fragments, leading to chromatin condensation and mitochondrial dysfunction. This process generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disrupts mitochondrial membranes, promoting cell death through caspase-independent apoptosis (Bouwman2021Intracellular).

GZMK also cleaves various intracellular substrates, such as nucleosome assembly protein SET and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, which may influence chromatin condensation and apoptotic morphology (Bouwman2021Intracellular). Extracellularly, GZMK can activate endothelial cells and modulate pro-inflammatory immune responses by cleaving transmembrane receptors like PAR-1, leading to increased expression of adhesion molecules and cytokine production (Bouwman2021Intracellular).

GZMK is implicated in modulating immune responses and inflammation, rather than direct cytotoxicity, in healthy cells. It circulates in different forms and is not cytotoxic without a delivery agent like perforin, indicating its role in immune regulation beyond classical perforin-mediated activity (Bouwman2021Intracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Granzyme K (GZMK) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, high expression of GZMK is associated with improved overall survival, progression-free survival, and recurrence-free survival, particularly in hormone receptor-negative and HER2-positive patients. It is also linked to enhanced responsiveness to immunotherapy, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and predictor of treatment outcomes (Li2024Exploring).

In the context of inflammatory diseases, GZMK plays a significant role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by activating synovial fibroblasts to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and CCL2, contributing to inflammation without inducing apoptosis. This suggests its involvement in the inflammatory pathways of RA and potential as a therapeutic target (Jonsson2022Granzyme).

GZMK is also involved in viral infections, where it may inhibit viral replication and modulate immune responses. Elevated levels of GZMK have been observed in conditions like viral infections, sepsis, and airway inflammation, indicating its role in immune defense and inflammation (Bouwman2021Intracellular). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GZMK in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Granzyme K (GZMK) is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in inducing apoptosis and modulating immune responses. GZMK cleaves the nucleosome assembly protein SET, which disrupts its function and leads to the activation and nuclear translocation of the DNase NM23H1. This interaction results in single-stranded DNA nicks, contributing to cell death (Zhao2006Granzyme). GZMK also interacts with other components of the SET complex, such as HMG2 and Ape1, further promoting DNA damage (Zhao2006Granzyme).

GZMK cleaves the BH3 interacting-domain death antagonist (Bid), converting it to truncated Bid (tBid), which disrupts the mitochondrial membrane and facilitates the release of pro-apoptotic factors like cytochrome c (Bouwman2021Intracellular). It also interacts with vasolin-containing protein (VCP), inhibiting the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, leading to ER stress and apoptosis (Bouwman2021Intracellular). Additionally, GZMK processes p53 into pro-apoptotic fragments, further promoting mitochondrial disruption and apoptosis (Bouwman2021Intracellular).

In the context of viral infections, GZMK cleaves importin α1 and importin β, disrupting their dimerization and hindering the nuclear import of viral proteins, thereby affecting viral replication (de2021Noncytotoxic).
