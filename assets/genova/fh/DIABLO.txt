# DIABLO

## Overview
The DIABLO gene encodes the diablo IAP-binding mitochondrial protein, commonly referred to as SMAC/DIABLO, which is a pivotal regulator of apoptosis. This protein is categorized as a pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein and plays a crucial role in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by antagonizing inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). SMAC/DIABLO is synthesized as a precursor in the mitochondria and, upon apoptotic stimuli, is released into the cytosol where it promotes apoptosis by binding to IAPs, thereby facilitating the activation of caspases. The protein's structure, characterized by an N-terminal AVPI motif, is essential for its interaction with IAPs, and it exists in multiple isoforms that may have distinct functions beyond apoptosis. The DIABLO gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest in cancer research, as alterations in their expression or function can influence cancer progression and treatment responses (Pandey2022Nonapoptotic; Srinivasula2001A).

## Structure
The DIABLO protein, also known as SMAC/Diablo, is a pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein with a crucial role in apoptosis regulation. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal AVPI motif, essential for its interaction with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) (Salamon2017Heterologous). The mature form of SMAC/Diablo has a molecular weight of approximately 20.8 kDa and is known to form a tetramer in the cytosol, indicating its quaternary structure (Salamon2017Heterologous; Polykretis2021Biophysical).

The secondary structure of SMAC/Diablo includes significant elements that have been identified through crystallographic studies, although specific details on the types of secondary structures are not provided in the context (Salamon2017Heterologous). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by its ability to form a homodimer, which is crucial for its function in apoptosis (Paul2018A).

SMAC/Diablo also exists in several isoforms, such as SMAC/Diablo-α, -β, and -ε, with the latter two lacking the IAP-binding motif and mitochondrial targeting signal, suggesting potential non-apoptotic functions (Paul2018A). These isoforms may influence the protein's activity and localization, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular processes.

## Function
The DIABLO gene encodes a protein known as SMAC/DIABLO, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, SMAC/DIABLO is localized to the mitochondria, where it is synthesized as a precursor protein. This precursor undergoes N-terminal processing to become active and is then targeted to the intermembrane space of the mitochondria (Tikoo2002Tissue).

Upon receiving apoptotic stimuli, such as UV radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs, SMAC/DIABLO is released into the cytosol. In the cytosol, it interacts with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as XIAP, by binding to their baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains. This interaction prevents IAPs from inhibiting caspases, particularly caspase-3 and caspase-9, thereby facilitating the apoptotic process (MartinezRuiz2008Role; Srinivasula2001A).

The release and activity of SMAC/DIABLO are critical for the proper execution of apoptosis, ensuring the removal of damaged or potentially harmful cells. This function is vital for processes such as tissue homeostasis and immune system development (MartinezRuiz2008Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the DIABLO gene, also known as SMAC, have significant implications in cancer progression. Overexpression of DIABLO is observed in various cancers, including breast, lung, bladder, cervical, pancreas, prostate, and colorectal cancers, as well as melanoma and glioma (Pandey2022Nonapoptotic). In breast cancer, DIABLO enhances the apoptosis-inducing potential of chemotherapeutic drugs and irradiation, suggesting its role in overcoming drug resistance (Fandy2008SmacDIABLO). In lung cancer, DIABLO is involved in regulating tumor growth and survival, influencing processes such as lipid synthesis, inflammation, and immune response (Pandey2022Nonapoptotic).

DIABLO's interaction with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) is crucial for its role in promoting apoptosis. Smac mimetics, which mimic DIABLO's interaction with IAPs, have been developed as potential cancer treatments, although their efficacy has been limited (Polykretis2021Biophysical). Targeting DIABLO's non-apoptotic functions, such as its role in inflammation and immune suppression, presents a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment (Pandey2022Nonapoptotic). The modulation of DIABLO levels and its interactions with proteins like XIAP can enhance the effectiveness of apoptosis-inducing agents in cancer therapy (NeMoyer2019Targeting).

## Interactions
DIABLO, also known as SMAC, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a significant role in apoptosis by interacting with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) such as XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2. Upon apoptotic stimuli, DIABLO is released into the cytosol, where it binds to the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP, facilitating the release and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, respectively (MartinezRuiz2008Role; Srinivasula2001A). This interaction is mediated by a conserved N-terminal tetrapeptide motif (Ala-Val-Pro-Ile), which competes with caspase-9 for binding to XIAP, thereby promoting apoptosis (Corbi-Verge2016Motif; Srinivasula2001A).

DIABLO forms homodimers to interact with IAPs, and its interaction with XIAP is characterized by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, particularly involving residues such as Trp 310 and Glu 314 in XIAP (Obiol‐Pardo2008Protein–protein; Srinivasula2001A). The interaction between DIABLO and XIAP is non-covalent, as evidenced by the disruption of the complex under denaturing conditions (Polykretis2021Biophysical). DIABLO also interacts with Survivin, another IAP, although the binding affinity is lower compared to XIAP due to differences in electrostatic interactions (Obiol‐Pardo2008Protein–protein). There is no evidence of DIABLO interacting with nucleic acids.
