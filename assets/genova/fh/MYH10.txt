# MYH10

## Overview
MYH10 is a gene that encodes the non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB (NMHC IIB), a motor protein that belongs to the non-muscle myosin II family. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell motility, cytokinesis, and the maintenance of cell shape. NMHC IIB is characterized by its hexameric structure, comprising two heavy chains and two pairs of light chains, with distinct domains responsible for actin binding and filament assembly (Tuzovic2013A; Otterpohl2017Nonmuscle). The MYH10 gene is involved in critical developmental processes, such as cardiac development and ciliogenesis, and its expression is tightly regulated through post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins (Ridge2017Nonmuscle; Hong2015Myosin). Alterations in MYH10 expression or mutations can lead to significant developmental and hematological disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (AntonyDebré2012MYH10; Tuzovic2013A).

## Structure
The MYH10 gene encodes the non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB (NMHC IIB), a protein that is part of the non-muscle myosin II family. This protein is a hexamer composed of two heavy chains and two pairs of light chains. The primary structure of MYH10 includes an N-terminal globular head or motor domain, which is responsible for actin binding and ATPase activity, and a long α-helix coiled-coil tail domain, which facilitates dimerization and filament assembly (Tuzovic2013A; Otterpohl2017Nonmuscle).

The motor domain of MYH10 is crucial for its function, as it binds to actin filaments and contains the site for actin-activated MgATPase activity, which is essential for cellular contractility and motility (Tuzovic2013A). The coiled-coil tail domain is involved in the formation of bipolar filaments, which are necessary for the protein's structural role in cells (Tuzovic2013A).

MYH10 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions within the cell. The gene also produces splice variant isoforms, which may have distinct roles in different cellular contexts (Hong2015Myosin). These structural features enable MYH10 to participate in various cellular processes, including cell migration and cytokinesis.

## Function
MYH10 encodes the non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB (NMHC IIB), a motor protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, MYH10 is involved in the organization of actin filaments and is essential for maintaining cell shape and motility. It is particularly active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the contractile apparatus of cells (Otterpohl2017Nonmuscle).

MYH10 is crucial for the biogenesis of primary cilia, as it is necessary for centriole migration to the apical plasma membrane, a key step in ciliogenesis. It influences the recruitment of intraflagellar transport proteins, such as IFT88, to the centrosome, which is essential for axoneme assembly (Hong2015Myosin). MYH10 also plays a role in the formation of the cortical actin complex, affecting the organization of actin filaments and the enrichment of actin-binding proteins like EZRIN at the apical membrane, which is important for ciliary structure and function (Hong2015Myosin).

In the context of cardiac development, MYH10 is essential for epicardial function and coronary vessel formation. It is involved in epicardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the migration of epicardial-derived cells into the myocardium, processes critical for proper cardiac development (Ridge2017Nonmuscle).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MYH10 gene have been implicated in several developmental and hematological disorders. A novel de novo mutation, p.E908X, in MYH10 is associated with severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia in humans. This mutation results in a truncated protein, disrupting filament assembly and potentially acting through a dominant negative mechanism (Tuzovic2013A). In mice, similar mutations lead to developmental abnormalities such as hydrocephalus and defects in neuronal migration, suggesting a critical role for MYH10 in brain and heart development (Tuzovic2013A).

In hematological contexts, MYH10 expression is linked to platelet disorders and leukemia. Normally silenced during megakaryocyte maturation by RUNX1, MYH10 is expressed in platelets of patients with RUNX1 mutations, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML), and Paris-Trousseau syndrome, which involves FLI1 haploinsufficiency (AntonyDebré2012MYH10). MYH10 expression in platelets serves as a biomarker for RUNX1-related disorders and can aid in diagnosing inherited platelet disorders and myeloid neoplasms (AntonyDebré2012MYH10). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), low MYH10 expression is associated with poor prognosis, and its expression levels can help identify AML molecular characteristics (Xiao2021Effect).

## Interactions
MYH10, or myosin heavy chain 10, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It forms a functional protein complex with GLUT4, a glucose transporter, at the cell membrane. This interaction is significant in adipocyte function and adipogenesis, particularly in the context of insulin signaling. Insulin induction alters MYH10's localization and interaction with GLUT4, suggesting that MYH10 may regulate insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane (Kislev2022MYH10). 

MYH10 is also regulated by protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ), which phosphorylates MYH10, affecting its role in cytoskeletal reorganization necessary for GLUT4 translocation (Kislev2022MYH10). This regulation underscores MYH10's involvement in the insulin signaling pathway and its impact on adipocyte differentiation and function (Kislev2022MYH10).

In the context of ER stress, MYH10 interacts with LAMC2, a protein that enhances ER-mitochondria interactions. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress in tumor cells. LAMC2 co-localizes with MYH10, forming a protein complex that supports ER-mitochondria interactions (Tong2023LAMC2). These interactions highlight MYH10's diverse roles in cellular dynamics and stress responses.
