# CASQ1

## Overview
The CASQ1 gene encodes calsequestrin 1, a high-capacity, low-affinity calcium-binding protein predominantly found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers. Calsequestrin 1 plays a pivotal role in calcium regulation, essential for muscle contraction and relaxation processes. It functions by buffering calcium ions, thereby preventing osmotic damage and facilitating rapid calcium release and uptake during muscle activity. Structurally, calsequestrin 1 is characterized by a thioredoxin-like fold and has the ability to polymerize, which enhances its calcium-binding capacity. The protein interacts with key components of the excitation-contraction coupling machinery, such as the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), and is involved in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through interactions with proteins like STIM1 and Orai1. Mutations in the CASQ1 gene have been implicated in various muscle disorders and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Jeong2021Calsequestrin; Lahooti2015Novel; Woo2020Calsequestrin:).

## Structure
CASQ1, or calsequestrin 1, is a protein primarily found in fast-twitch skeletal muscles, playing a crucial role in calcium regulation within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The primary structure of CASQ1 includes a sequence rich in acidic residues, particularly aspartic acid, which contributes to its high capacity for calcium binding (Wang2020Calsequestrin.). The secondary structure of CASQ1 is characterized by a thioredoxin-like fold, consisting of a four-strand β-sheet sandwiched by three alpha helices (Wang2020Calsequestrin.). 

The tertiary structure of CASQ1 involves three domains with high structural similarity to the thioredoxin fold, forming a disk-like shape with a core of five-stranded β-sheets flanked by four α-helices (Woo2020Calsequestrin:). The quaternary structure of CASQ1 is defined by its ability to polymerize, forming homopolymers through front-to-front and back-to-back interactions, which enhance its calcium-binding capacity (Wang2020Calsequestrin.; Woo2020Calsequestrin:).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are significant for CASQ1, influencing its polymerization and calcium-binding properties. CASQ1 primarily possesses a lone mannose group for glycosylation, affecting its multimerization and retention in the junctional SR (Marabelli2023The). Phosphorylation increases its calcium sensitivity, potentially due to the higher affinity of calcium for phosphate groups (Marabelli2023The).

## Function
Calsequestrin 1 (CASQ1) is a critical calcium-binding protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle cells, where it plays a vital role in calcium (Ca2+) regulation and muscle contraction. CASQ1 acts as a high-capacity, low-affinity Ca2+ buffer, allowing it to store large amounts of Ca2+ without causing osmotic damage, which is essential for the rapid release of Ca2+ during muscle contraction and efficient uptake during relaxation (Jeong2021Calsequestrin; Woo2020Calsequestrin:). 

CASQ1 interacts with the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) to modulate Ca2+ release from the SR to the cytosol, a process crucial for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling (Woo2020Calsequestrin:). The protein's function is influenced by its polymerization state, which is dependent on Ca2+ concentration; at high Ca2+ levels, CASQ1 polymerizes and inhibits RyR1 activity, preventing excessive Ca2+ release (Woo2020Calsequestrin:). 

CASQ1 also plays a role in store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), interacting with proteins such as STIM1 and Orai1 to regulate Ca2+ entry into the cytosol, thus maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis (Woo2020Calsequestrin:). Its absence or dysfunction can lead to muscle performance issues and increased susceptibility to stress conditions (Wang2020Calsequestrin.).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CASQ1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, primarily affecting muscle function and autoimmune thyroid disorders. In the context of autoimmune diseases, specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CASQ1 gene, such as rs74123279 and rs2275703, have been linked to Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). These SNPs are associated with reduced CASQ1 protein levels in thyroid tissues, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Lahooti2015Novel).

In skeletal muscle disorders, mutations in the CASQ1 gene have been identified in patients with tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM). These mutations, including p.Asp44Asn, p.Gly103Asp, and p.Ile385Thr, affect the protein's calcium-binding properties and its ability to form polymers, leading to impaired calcium homeostasis in muscle fibers. This results in symptoms such as muscle weakness, cramps, and the presence of tubular aggregates in muscle fibers (Barone2017Identification).

Additionally, a specific CASQ1 SNP, N59D, has been associated with heat stroke. This mutation may affect calcium regulation in muscles, leading to increased susceptibility to heat stroke and altered blood calcium levels (Li2014An).

## Interactions
Calsequestrin 1 (CASQ1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in calcium regulation within skeletal muscle. CASQ1 interacts with stromal interaction molecule 2 (STIM2), a relationship confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation assays in mouse skeletal myotubes. This interaction affects store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and intracellular calcium distribution, leading to increased calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and decreased cytosolic calcium levels (Jeong2021Calsequestrin). The interaction between CASQ1 and STIM2 also influences the activity of the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), enhancing calcium release in response to membrane depolarization (Jeong2021Calsequestrin).

CASQ1 also interacts with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), particularly in the context of SOCE. This interaction is enhanced when calcium stores are depleted, and it inhibits the STIM1-Orai1 interaction, thereby regulating calcium entry (Wang2015Retrograde). The monomeric form of CASQ1 is crucial for its interaction with STIM1, affecting downstream processes such as SOCE (Wang2015Retrograde). These interactions highlight CASQ1's role in modulating calcium dynamics, which is essential for muscle function and calcium homeostasis.
