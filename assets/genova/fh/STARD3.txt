# STARD3

## Overview
STARD3 is a gene that encodes the protein StAR related lipid transfer domain containing 3, which is integral to intracellular lipid transport, particularly cholesterol. The protein is categorized as a lipid transfer protein and is characterized by two main domains: the MENTAL domain, which anchors it to late endosomal membranes, and the START domain, which facilitates cholesterol binding and transfer. STARD3 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis by forming membrane contact sites with the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby enabling efficient cholesterol transport. This function is vital for various cellular processes, including membrane composition modulation and organelle dynamics. Alterations in STARD3 expression have been linked to several cancers and age-related macular degeneration, highlighting its clinical significance (Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL; Voilquin2019STARD3:; Wilhelm2017STARD3).

## Structure
The STARD3 protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including the MENTAL domain and the START domain. The MENTAL domain, located in the amino-terminal half, consists of four transmembrane helices and is responsible for anchoring the protein to late endosomal membranes. This domain is unique to STARD3 and its paralog STARD3NL, and it resembles the structural organization of the Tetraspanin superfamily (Alpy2014STARD3:; Voilquin2019STARD3:).

The START domain, located in the carboxy-terminal half, adopts a helix-grip fold with a nine-stranded curved β-sheet and three α-helices. This domain forms a deep lipid-binding pocket that accommodates a cholesterol molecule, facilitating its role in cholesterol transport (Horvath2016Structure; Voilquin2019STARD3:). The START domain is structurally similar to other START proteins, such as STARD1, with conserved residues like Arg351 playing a crucial role in ligand binding (Asif2021STARD3:).

STARD3 can form homo- and hetero-oligomers, potentially creating cholesterol-enriched microdomains at the endosome surface. The protein also interacts with ER-resident VAP proteins through a FFAT-like motif, contributing to the formation of membrane contact sites between late endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL; Voilquin2019STARD3:).

## Function
The STARD3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular cholesterol transport, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endosomes. STARD3 is characterized by a START domain, which facilitates the binding and transfer of cholesterol, and a MENTAL domain, which anchors the protein to endosome membranes (Wilhelm2017STARD3; Voilquin2019STARD3:). This protein forms membrane contact sites by interacting with ER-anchored proteins such as VAP-A and VAP-B, creating a molecular machine that efficiently transfers cholesterol from the ER to endosomes (Wilhelm2017STARD3; Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL).

STARD3's activity results in the accumulation of cholesterol in endosomes, which is essential for maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis and membrane integrity (Wilhelm2017STARD3). This process is independent of the transcriptional regulation by SREBP-2, allowing for local modulation of cholesterol levels within organelles (Wilhelm2017STARD3). The protein's function is critical for the formation of internal membranes within endosomes, such as intraluminal vesicles, which are important for organelle dynamics and cellular homeostasis (Wilhelm2017STARD3). STARD3's role in cholesterol transport is vital for various cellular processes, including the modulation of membrane composition and the maintenance of cholesterol distribution within cells (Voilquin2019STARD3:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the STARD3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly HER2-positive subtypes, STARD3 is often co-amplified with the HER2/ERBB2 gene, contributing to cancer aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Overexpression of STARD3 in these cancers is associated with increased cholesterol biosynthesis and Src kinase activity, which may enhance oncogenic signaling and resistance to therapies like trastuzumab (Vassilev2015Elevated). 

STARD3 mutations have been identified in several cancer types, including breast, lung, liver, and stomach cancers. The R117Q mutation is notably prevalent in adenocarcinomas of the intestine and stomach (Asif2021STARD3:). In prostate cancer, STARD3 expression correlates with poor prognosis due to its role in androgen biosynthesis (Asif2021STARD3:).

Beyond cancer, STARD3 is involved in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In this condition, STARD3 overexpression in retinal pigment epithelial cells reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, suggesting a protective role against AMD progression (Almarhoun2021Overexpression). These findings highlight STARD3's significant role in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
STARD3 interacts with vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins (VAPs), specifically VAP-A and VAP-B, at membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and late endosomes (LEs). These interactions are mediated through a conserved FFAT-like motif in the MENTAL domain of STARD3, which is crucial for the recruitment of VAP proteins to these contact sites. The interaction with VAP-A and VAP-B facilitates the formation of ER-endosome contacts, which are essential for lipid transfer processes, including cholesterol transport (Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL; Wilhelm2016Touché!).

STARD3 also participates in the transport of sphingosine at ER-lysosome contact sites. It binds sphingosine within its StART domain and delivers it to the ER, suggesting a role in sphingolipid biosynthesis. This interaction is less pronounced compared to other lysosomal transporters like NPC1, but it highlights STARD3's dual specificity for cholesterol and sphingosine (Hempelmann2023The).

These interactions underscore STARD3's role in lipid exchange and organelle tethering, impacting intracellular cholesterol distribution and endosomal dynamics (Wilhelm2017STARD3; Wilhelm2016Touché!).
