# SPADH

## Overview
The SPADH gene encodes a member of the spermadhesin protein family, which is primarily involved in reproductive processes. Spermadhesins are a group of proteins that play a crucial role in sperm-egg interaction, facilitating the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida of the egg. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind to carbohydrates and are often found in the seminal plasma of various mammalian species. The SPADH gene is expressed in the male reproductive tract, and its protein product is essential for successful fertilization. Understanding the function and regulation of the SPADH gene and its encoded protein can provide insights into male fertility and potential targets for contraception or treatment of infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
