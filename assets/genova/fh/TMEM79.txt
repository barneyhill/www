# TMEM79

## Overview
TMEM79 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 79, a member of the transmembrane protein family, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining skin barrier function. The protein is predominantly expressed in keratinocytes and is integral to the formation and function of lamellar granules, which are essential for the secretion of intercellular lipids critical to the integrity and permeability of the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis (Wang2023Overexpression; Ishitsuka2021The). TMEM79 is involved in the keratinization process and the morphogenesis of hair follicles, and it also regulates interactions between keratinocytes and sensory neurons, impacting histaminergic itch (Matsui2015Dissecting; Egawa2018Barrier). Mutations in TMEM79 are associated with atopic dermatitis, highlighting its clinical significance in skin-barrier function and inflammatory skin conditions (Emrick2018Tissuespecific; Chen2020TMEM79MATTRIN).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM79, also known as transmembrane protein 79, is a crucial component in maintaining skin barrier function in healthy human cells. It is a member of the transmembrane protein family and is primarily expressed in keratinocytes, where it plays a significant role in the formation and function of lamellar granules (LGs) (Wang2023Overexpression; Ishitsuka2021The). These granules are essential for the secretion of intercellular lipids, which are critical for the integrity and permeability of the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis (Matsui2015Dissecting; Egawa2018Barrier).

TMEM79 is involved in the keratinization process, affecting the development of the stratum corneum and the morphogenesis of hair follicles (Wang2023Overexpression). It is localized in the lamellar bodies of the SG1 layer of the epidermis, where it facilitates the secretion of lamellar body contents, crucial for normal stratum corneum formation and function (Matsui2015Dissecting). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of mast cell-mediated histaminergic itch, indicating its role in interactions between keratinocytes and sensory neurons (Ishitsuka2021The). TMEM79's proper function is vital for maintaining epidermal integrity and preventing inflammatory skin conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TMEM79 gene are linked to atopic dermatitis (AD), a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by skin-barrier defects and chronic itch. TMEM79 is expressed in keratinocytes and sensory neurons, and its loss leads to increased scratching behavior and dermal thickening, indicating its role in skin-barrier function and itch response (Emrick2018Tissuespecific). In Tmem79 knockout mice, the absence of TMEM79 results in the accumulation of reactive species, stimulating prostaglandin E2 production, which attracts mast cells to the dermis. This process leads to mast cell degranulation and histamine release, contributing to scratching behavior (Emrick2018Tissuespecific).

TMEM79 mutations, such as the matted allele in mice, result in a functional null, leading to skin inflammation that models human AD (Chen2020TMEM79MATTRIN). The gene is also identified as a predisposition gene for AD in humans, with mutations or expression alterations potentially causing skin barrier defects and increased susceptibility to allergens and irritants (Chen2020TMEM79MATTRIN). The dysregulated skin barrier function in Tmem79 mutant mice promotes IL-17A-dependent spontaneous skin and lung inflammation, illustrating a connection to the 'atopic march' where individuals with AD may develop secondary allergic conditions like asthma (Saunders2020Dysregulated).

## Interactions
TMEM79, also known as MATTRIN, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. It interacts with the Frizzled (FZD) family of receptors, specifically promoting the degradation of FZD proteins by inhibiting the deubiquitination activity of ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8). This interaction is crucial for regulating Wnt/FZD signaling pathways, as TMEM79 binds to the immature form of FZD5, facilitating its degradation and reducing its presence at the plasma membrane (Chen2020TMEM79MATTRIN).

TMEM79 also interacts with TRPV3, a transient receptor potential ion channel involved in temperature sensation. TMEM79 acts as a negative regulator of TRPV3 by promoting its degradation in lysosomes, thereby reducing TRPV3-mediated currents and affecting temperature detection in keratinocytes. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, demonstrating that TMEM79 and TRPV3 colocalize at the plasma membrane (Lei2023Involvement).

These interactions highlight TMEM79's role in modulating key signaling pathways and physiological processes, such as Wnt signaling and thermosensation, through its regulatory effects on protein degradation.
