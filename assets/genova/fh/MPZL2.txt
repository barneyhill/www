# MPZL2

## Overview
The MPZL2 gene encodes the myelin protein zero like 2, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein, also known as epithelial V-like antigen (EVA) or EVA1, is implicated in mediating homophilic cell-cell adhesion, which is crucial for cellular communication and structural integrity. MPZL2 is predominantly expressed in the inner ear, particularly within the auditory inner and outer hair cells, suggesting its significant role in auditory function and sound perception. Mutations in the MPZL2 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment, highlighting its clinical relevance in auditory health (Wesdorp2018MPZL2; Bademci2018MPZL2).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MPZL2 gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) in humans. Individuals with pathogenic variants of MPZL2 typically exhibit symmetric, progressive, mild to moderate sensorineural hearing impairment, often with a downsloping audiogram configuration. The onset of hearing impairment usually occurs in the first decade of life and progresses with age, particularly affecting high-frequency hearing (Wesdorp2018MPZL2). 

In a study involving a Dutch consanguineous family, a homozygous truncating variant, c.72del (p.Ile24Metfs*22), was identified, which co-segregated with hearing impairment. This variant is predicted to cause premature termination of protein synthesis, leading to a loss of function (Wesdorp2018MPZL2). Similar findings were reported in other populations, including Turkish and Iranian families, suggesting a potential founder effect for this variant (Bademci2018MPZL2).

MPZL2 mutations are also prevalent in certain populations, such as East Asians and Ashkenazi Jews, where they contribute significantly to cases of moderate sensorineural hearing loss (Zhang2024MPZL2—a). Despite its role in hearing, no other systemic issues, such as neuropathy or immunodeficiency, have been associated with MPZL2 deficiency, indicating a specific impact on auditory function (Wesdorp2018MPZL2).

## Interactions
The MPZL2 protein, also known as epithelial V-like antigen (EVA) or EVA1, is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is suggested to mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion, which implies that it may interact with itself or similar proteins to facilitate cellular adhesion processes. MPZL2 is expressed in the inner ear, particularly in the auditory inner and outer hair cells, indicating its potential role in sound perception and hearing mechanisms (Bademci2018MPZL2).

While the specific protein interactions of MPZL2 are not extensively detailed in the available studies, its expression pattern and classification within the immunoglobulin superfamily suggest that it may participate in interactions relevant to cellular adhesion and signaling pathways. The study by Bademci et al. does not explicitly discuss protein interactions of MPZL2 but highlights its expression in cochlear tissues, suggesting a role in hearing loss mechanisms (Bademci2018MPZL2). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise interaction partners and functional roles of MPZL2 in cellular processes.
