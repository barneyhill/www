# LRRC74A

## Overview
The LRRC74A gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 74A, which is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. These proteins are characterized by their involvement in protein-protein interactions and are often implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and immune response. The LRRC74A protein is not currently categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but its role in cellular mechanisms is being actively studied. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in disease pathways, particularly in oral squamous cell carcinoma and immune-mediated diseases such as multiple sclerosis, suggesting that LRRC74A may serve as a prognostic marker and a target for therapeutic interventions (Kuk2022Prognostic; Yang2024Largescale).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The LRRC74A gene has been implicated in various diseases through its mutations and expression alterations. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), LRRC74A mutations are associated with a better prognosis in early pathological stages (stages 1, 2, and 3). The gene exhibits hazard ratios less than 1.0, suggesting a protective role in these stages (Kuk2022Prognostic). 

In the context of immune-mediated diseases (IMDs), LRRC74A has been linked to multiple sclerosis (MS). A large-scale whole-exome sequencing study identified an association between LRRC74A and MS, with an odds ratio of 1.08 and a significant P-value, indicating a potential role in disease susceptibility. The study also noted that relatively deleterious mutations in LRRC74A were enriched in IMD cases, highlighting its clinical significance in these conditions (Yang2024Largescale).

Despite its mention in studies related to vitamin D's influence on natural killer cells, the clinical significance of LRRC74A in this context remains unclear, as no specific details on expression alterations or interaction changes were provided (christofyllakis2021influence). Overall, LRRC74A's role in disease mechanisms is still under investigation, with current research focusing on its potential as a prognostic marker and its involvement in immune-related conditions.
