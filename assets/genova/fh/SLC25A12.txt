# SLC25A12

## Overview
The SLC25A12 gene encodes the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier protein, known as solute carrier family 25 member 12 (AGC1 or aralar1), which is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family. This protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in the malate-aspartate shuttle, facilitating the exchange of aspartate and glutamate across the mitochondrial membrane. AGC1 is characterized by its transmembrane transport domain and calcium-binding EF-hand motifs, which regulate its function. Predominantly expressed in the brain, AGC1 is crucial for energy metabolism and the synthesis of N-acetylaspartate, a precursor for myelin lipids. The protein's interactions with other mitochondrial proteins, such as MAVS and OPA1, underscore its involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and antiviral signaling. Mutations in SLC25A12 have been linked to neurological disorders, including autism spectrum conditions and hypomyelination, highlighting its clinical significance (Yasukawa2020The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological; Palmieri2004The; Durdiaková2014Single).

## Structure
The SLC25A12 gene encodes the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier protein AGC1, which is part of the solute carrier family 25. The protein consists of 678 amino acids and is characterized by a bipartite structure with distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain contains EF-hand motifs that bind calcium ions, playing a regulatory role in the protein's function (Ramoz2004Linkage; Amoedo2016AGC12). The C-terminal domain includes a transmembrane transport domain with six transmembrane helices, facilitating the exchange of aspartate for glutamate and a proton across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Palmieri2004The; Amoedo2016AGC12).

The protein's structure is further defined by three tandemly repeated homologous domains, each about 100 amino acids long, with two hydrophobic stretches that span the membrane as alpha-helices (Palmieri2004The). These structural features are typical of mitochondrial carrier proteins, which often form homodimers (Palmieri2013The). Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, methylation, and acetylation have been identified, although their specific regulatory roles are not fully understood (Amoedo2016AGC12). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and is crucial for the malate-aspartate shuttle, which is essential for cellular energy metabolism (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

## Function
The SLC25A12 gene encodes the aspartate/glutamate carrier isoform 1 (AGC1), also known as aralar1, which is a mitochondrial carrier protein involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle. This shuttle is essential for transferring reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH into mitochondria, a critical process for energy production in cells (Palmieri2013The; Palmieri2004The). AGC1 facilitates the exchange of aspartate and glutamate across the mitochondrial membrane, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular energy balance and supporting glycolysis (Palmieri2014Mitochondrial; Infantino2019Epigenetic).

In neurons, AGC1 is predominantly expressed and is crucial for the synthesis of N-acetylaspartate, a precursor for myelin lipids, which is vital for proper myelination in the brain (Palmieri2013The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The protein's activity is modulated by calcium ions, which bind to its N-terminal domain, influencing its transport function (Palmieri2004The). SLC25A12 is also involved in mitochondrial metabolism and antiviral signaling, interacting with the MAVS protein to regulate innate immune responses (Yasukawa2020The; Zhang2023SLC25). In healthy human cells, SLC25A12 is active in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and heart (Infantino2019Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC25A12 gene, which encodes the aspartate/glutamate carrier isoform 1 (AGC1), are associated with several neurological disorders. A notable mutation, c.1769A > C, results in a glutamine-arginine substitution at position 590 (Q590R), leading to severe global hypomyelination, reduced N-acetyl aspartate in the brain, severe hypotonia, psychomotor developmental arrest, and seizures (Palmieri2013The). Other mutations, such as p.Arg252Gln, also result in reduced ATP production and transport activity, contributing to similar neurological symptoms (Palmieri2020Diseases).

SLC25A12 has been implicated in autism spectrum conditions (ASC), including Asperger syndrome. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) like rs6716901 have shown significant associations with ASC, suggesting that SLC25A12 may act as a modifier gene in these conditions (Durdiaková2014Single). The gene's dysfunction is linked to mitochondrial oxidative dysfunction, which is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of autism (Ramoz2004Linkage).

In cancer, SLC25A12 deficiency has been linked to increased pulmonary metastasis, indicating its role in tumor progression and metastasis (Alkan2020Deficiency). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC25A12 in various diseases, particularly those affecting the central nervous system.

## Interactions
SLC25A12, also known as the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial metabolism and signaling. It has been shown to interact with MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein) in HEK293 cells, suggesting a direct interaction under physiological conditions. This interaction is significant for MAVS-mediated antiviral innate immunity, as SLC25A12 plays a role in regulating mitochondrial metabolism and antiviral signaling (Yasukawa2020The).

SLC25A12 also interacts with OPA1, a protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in cristae remodeling and mtDNA maintenance. This interaction was identified through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that SLC25A12 may influence OPA1 function and mitochondrial structure (wong2014role). The interaction between SLC25A12 and OPA1 is part of a broader network involving other SLC25 proteins, which are implicated in nutrient transport and mitochondrial function (wong2014role).

These interactions highlight the role of SLC25A12 in mitochondrial dynamics and its potential impact on cellular energy homeostasis and immune responses. The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.
