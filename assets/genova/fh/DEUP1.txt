# DEUP1

## Overview
DEUP1, or deuterosome assembly protein 1, is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic protein crucial for the biogenesis of centrioles in multiciliated cells. The protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly of deuterosomes, which are essential structures for the de novo formation of centrioles, independent of pre-existing mother centrioles. This function is particularly important in tissues where multiciliated cells are prevalent, such as the respiratory and reproductive systems, as it facilitates the amplification of basal bodies necessary for motile cilia formation (Zhao2019Parental; Zhao2018Mother). DEUP1 is a paralog of Cep63 and interacts with proteins like Cep152 and Plk4, which are integral to centriole duplication and biogenesis (Revinski2018CDC20B; Mori2017Cytoplasmic). Additionally, DEUP1 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression is often downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Yu2019Clinical).

## Function
DEUP1 (deuterosome assembly protein 1) plays a crucial role in the formation of multiciliated cells by facilitating the assembly of deuterosomes, which are essential for centriole biogenesis. In multiciliated epithelial cells, DEUP1 acts as a platform for the de novo formation of centrioles, independent of mother centrioles (Zhao2019Parental; Zhao2018Mother). This process is vital for the amplification of basal bodies, which are necessary for the formation of motile cilia (Zhao2019Parental).

DEUP1 is a paralog of Cep63 and interacts with Cep152, playing a significant role in centriole duplication (Revinski2018CDC20B). It is detected in the core of the deuterosome and is essential for the multiplication of centrioles in multiciliated cells, such as those in the respiratory and reproductive systems (Revinski2017CDC20B). DEUP1's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, particularly in regions where cilia are assembled, ensuring proper cilia function (Revinski2018CDC20B).

The presence of DEUP1 in deuterosomes allows for the efficient production of centrioles, which subsequently convert into basal bodies to initiate cilium elongation, a critical process for the function of multiciliated cells (Revinski2018CDC20B).

## Clinical Significance
DEUP1 (deuterosome assembly protein 1) has been implicated in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common type of liver cancer. Research indicates that DEUP1 may function as a tumor suppressor gene, with its inactivation contributing to HCC development. In HCC tissues, DEUP1 expression is significantly reduced or absent, while adjacent non-cancerous tissues exhibit higher expression levels. This downregulation is associated with hypermethylation of the DEUP1 promoter, suggesting that methylation may lead to gene inactivation (Yu2019Clinical).

The study found a negative correlation between DEUP1 promoter methylation and protein expression, indicating that methylation could be a mechanism for DEUP1 inactivation in HCC. This inactivation is significantly associated with tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage and tumor differentiation, highlighting its potential role in HCC progression. DEUP1 expression levels are also linked to patient survival rates, suggesting its clinical significance in HCC prognosis (Yu2019Clinical).

Beyond liver cancer, DEUP1 expression is reduced in other malignancies, such as gastric and thyroid cancers, although its specific role in these cancers requires further investigation (Yu2019Clinical).

## Interactions
DEUP1 (deuterosome assembly protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for centriole biogenesis in multiciliated cells. It interacts with Cep152 and recruits Plk4, which are essential for activating centriole biogenesis (Mori2017Cytoplasmic). DEUP1 also forms complexes with E2f4 and Sas6, both of which are core components of centriole biogenesis. These interactions occur in the same location as Pcm1-containing foci, indicating a close proximity and functional relationship (Mori2017Cytoplasmic). 

DEUP1 is associated with nascent centrioles organized around the DEUP1-positive core ring and is found close to Pericentrin (PCNT) and γ-tubulin, two main components of the pericentriolar material (PCM) (Revinski2018CDC20B). It interacts with these proteins to facilitate centriole amplification. DEUP1 can replace Cep63 to sustain centriole-dependent procentriole assembly, suggesting a functional interaction between these proteins (Zhao2019Parental). 

In addition, DEUP1 is part of a network of interactions necessary for centriole production, involving canonical cell cycle molecules like CEP152 and PLK1, and deuterosomal molecules such as CDC20B (Revinski2017CDC20B). These interactions highlight DEUP1's role in organizing and facilitating the assembly of centrioles during multiciliogenesis.
