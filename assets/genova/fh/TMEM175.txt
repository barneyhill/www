# TMEM175

## Overview
TMEM175 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 175, a lysosomal potassium channel integral to maintaining lysosomal homeostasis. This protein is characterized by its unique structural architecture, which includes a homodimeric formation with two homologous repeats of six transmembrane helices, contributing to its pseudo-four-fold symmetric structure (Oh2020Gating; Oh2022Differential). Unlike typical potassium channels, TMEM175 lacks a canonical P-loop selectivity filter, instead utilizing a hydrophobic constriction for ion selectivity (Oh2022Differential). Functionally, TMEM175 is crucial for regulating lysosomal pH and membrane potential, impacting cellular processes such as autophagy and mitophagy (Tang2023Transmembrane). Its dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, notably Parkinson's disease, due to its role in lysosomal degradation and α-synuclein clearance (Jinn2017TMEM175). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as AKT and Bcl-2, further underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathology (Palomba2023Common; Tang2023Transmembrane).

## Structure
The TMEM175 protein is a lysosomal potassium channel characterized by a unique structural architecture. It is a homodimer, with each subunit containing two homologous repeats of six transmembrane helices, resulting in a pseudo-four-fold symmetric architecture (Oh2020Gating; Oh2022Differential). The ion conduction pathway is centrally located and lined by the TM1 and TM7 helices, with key constrictions formed by conserved isoleucine residues, such as Ile46 and Ile271, which play a significant role in gating and ion selectivity (Oh2020Gating; Oh2022Differential).

The protein's structure lacks the canonical P-loop selectivity filter found in other potassium channels. Instead, it features a hydrophobic constriction that contributes to its selectivity for potassium ions over sodium ions (Oh2022Differential). The channel's architecture allows for unique ion-permeation properties, being more permeable to cesium ions than sodium ions (Oh2020Gating).

TMEM175's structure is crucial for its function in maintaining lysosomal homeostasis and is linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (Oh2020Gating; Tang2023Transmembrane). The protein's structural features, including its transmembrane helices and hydrophobic gating mechanism, are essential for its role as a lysosomal ion channel.

## Function
TMEM175 is a lysosomal ion channel that plays a critical role in maintaining lysosomal pH stability and membrane potential in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a proton-selective and proton-activated channel, mediating proton leak currents in lysosomes, which is essential for regulating lysosomal acidity (Tang2023Transmembrane). TMEM175 also conducts potassium ions, contributing to the lysosomal membrane potential and ion homeostasis. This dual function is crucial for the proper functioning of lysosomal enzymes and cellular recycling processes (Tang2023Transmembrane).

The channel's activity is regulated by various factors, including AKT, which modulates its function through conformational changes (Tang2023Transmembrane). TMEM175's role extends beyond lysosomal function, potentially impacting mitochondrial functions and apoptosis regulation (Tang2023Transmembrane). In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TMEM175 is implicated in the regulation of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, affecting the clearance of autophagosomes and influencing mitochondrial function through lysosome-mediated mitophagy (Tang2023Transmembrane). Its deficiency can lead to impaired lysosomal degradation and accumulation of α-synuclein, which is associated with Parkinson's disease (Jinn2017TMEM175).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM175 gene are significantly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disorder. TMEM175 encodes a lysosomal potassium channel, and its dysfunction is linked to impaired lysosomal function, which is crucial for cellular waste processing. Variants in TMEM175, such as p.M393T and p.Q65P, have been associated with PD, with the p.M393T variant also linked to REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (Krohn2019Genetic). The p.M393T variant is associated with reduced glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, which is significant in PD pathogenesis (Krohn2019Genetic).

Research has identified both common and rare TMEM175 variants associated with PD, including novel highly penetrant mutations that may be sufficient to cause the disease (Palomba2023Common). These mutations result in a loss of potassium conductance and reduced channel affinity for Akt, leading to impaired autophagic/lysosomal proteolytic flux and increased expression of unfolded protein response markers (Palomba2023Common). TMEM175 is also involved in the regulation of lysosomal pH and autophagy, with its deficiency linked to lysosomal alkalinization and impaired degradation of α-synuclein, a hallmark of PD (Tang2023Transmembrane).

## Interactions
TMEM175, a lysosomal potassium channel, participates in several protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. It interacts with protein kinase B (AKT), which binds to the TM2-TM3 linker region of TMEM175. This interaction activates TMEM175 through conformational changes rather than kinase activity (Palomba2023Common; Tang2023Transmembrane). The antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 also interacts with TMEM175, inhibiting its activity. Specific amino acid residues, R377 and V145, are crucial for this interaction (Tang2023Transmembrane).

TMEM175 is part of a network of interactions identified in the BioPlex 3.0 Interactome, including proteins such as SAR1B, TMEM154, TNFRSF10C, and TTYH1 (Tang2023Transmembrane). It may also interact with proteins like APP, GPR37, and viral proteins E5 and E5A. The STRING database analysis suggests connections with proteins like DGKQ, FAM47E, GAK, and LRRK2, with the latter being particularly relevant due to its association with Parkinson's disease (Tang2023Transmembrane). TMEM175 contains a calmodulin-binding domain, indicating potential interaction with calmodulin (Tang2023Transmembrane). These interactions highlight TMEM175's role in cellular processes and its potential involvement in neurodegenerative diseases.
