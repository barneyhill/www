# LRRC49

## Overview
LRRC49 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 49, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to the cytoskeleton. The protein is a component of the tubulin polyglutamylase (TPG) complex, which plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of tubulin, a structural protein essential for microtubule dynamics (Zhang2024Computing). LRRC49 is also associated with centriolar satellite proteins, suggesting its involvement in the transport and localization of the polyglutamylase complex to centrioles (Gheiratmand2019Spatial). The protein's interactions within the TPG complex and its localization to the pericentriolar region underscore its significance in maintaining cellular structure and function (Huttlin2020Dual). Additionally, LRRC49 has been implicated in clinical contexts, such as breast cancer and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and its relevance in disease mechanisms (Tylee2016RNA; De2008Silencing).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC49 gene has been implicated in breast cancer through the mechanism of promoter hypermethylation, which leads to the silencing of its expression. In a study, it was found that the LRRC49 gene, along with the THAP10 gene, is organized in a head-to-head orientation with a shared promoter region. This promoter region was hypermethylated in 57.5% of breast tumor samples, correlating with a significant down-regulation of LRRC49 expression in 61% of primary breast tumors. The study also noted a relationship between LRRC49 expression and estrogen receptor status, with higher expression levels in ER-positive breast tumors, suggesting that the bidirectional promoter of LRRC49/THAP10 may be a target of estrogen receptor activity (De2008Silencing).

In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), LRRC49 has been identified as downregulated in males and correlated with clinical features of ASD, indicating it could be a potential marker of severity. However, these findings are correlational and based on transformed lymphocytes, and the direct role of LRRC49 in autism pathophysiology has not been confirmed (Tylee2016RNA).

## Interactions
LRRC49 is involved in several protein interactions and complexes. It is a member of the tubulin polyglutamylase (TPG) complex, which includes the catalytic subunit TTLL1 and other subunits such as TPGS1, TPGS2, and NICN1. The TPG complex is involved in the modification of tubulin, a key component of the cytoskeleton (Zhang2024Computing). LRRC49 is also associated with centriolar satellite proteins, forming clusters with proteins like TPGS1 and C11orf49. These interactions suggest a role in transporting the polyglutamylase complex to centrioles (Gheiratmand2019Spatial).

The BioPlex networks have identified LRRC49 as an established member of the polyglutamylase complex, localizing to the pericentriolar region along with C11orf49 isoforms (Huttlin2020Dual). Additionally, LRRC49 interacts with TBC1D19, a central component of the TPG complex, indicating potential regulatory roles (Zhang2024Computing). These interactions highlight LRRC49's involvement in cellular processes related to microtubule dynamics and centriolar satellite functions. The dynamic nature of these interactions underscores the importance of LRRC49 in maintaining cellular structure and function.
