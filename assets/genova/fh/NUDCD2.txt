# NUDCD2

## Overview
NUDCD2 is a gene that encodes the protein NudC domain containing 2, which is a member of the NudC protein family. This family is characterized by its involvement in microtubule regulation and chaperone activities, playing a critical role in various cellular processes (Vassileva2023Small). The protein encoded by NUDCD2 functions as an autophagy receptor, particularly in the selective autophagic degradation of CP110 at mother centrioles, a process essential for ciliogenesis (Liu2021NudCL2). Additionally, NUDCD2 interacts with several protein partners, including the giant ubiquitin ligase HERC2, indicating its potential involvement in intracellular protein transport and cellular energy metabolism (Galligan2014Proteomic). Through these interactions, NUDCD2 contributes to the regulation of cellular homeostasis and the maintenance of cellular structures.

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
NUDCD2, also known as NudC-like 2 (NudCL2), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. NUDCD2 acts as an autophagy receptor, mediating the selective autophagic degradation of CP110 at mother centrioles, which is essential for promoting ciliogenesis. This interaction is facilitated by the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif of NUDCD2, which is necessary for the degradation of CP110 (Liu2021NudCL2). Knockdown of CP110 can rescue ciliogenesis defects in NUDCD2 knockout or depleted cells, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Liu2021NudCL2).

NUDCD2 is also part of the NudC protein family, which is known for its conserved domain architecture and involvement in microtubule regulation and chaperone activities. These proteins, including NUDCD2, are associated with protein partners containing β-propeller domains and have demonstrated chaperone activity in vitro (Vassileva2023Small). Additionally, NUDCD2 has been identified as an interacting protein with the giant ubiquitin ligase HERC2, suggesting a role in intracellular protein transport and cellular energy metabolism (Galligan2014Proteomic). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of NUDCD2 in cellular functions.
