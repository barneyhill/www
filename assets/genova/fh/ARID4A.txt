# ARID4A

## Overview
ARID4A is a gene that encodes the AT-rich interaction domain 4A protein, which is a member of the ARID family of proteins. This protein is primarily involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, functioning as a transcriptional repressor. It is a component of the SIN3A co-repressor complex and interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (RB) to modulate E2F-dependent transcription, thereby influencing cell cycle progression and arrest (Wu2008Identification; Wu2006Deficiency). The ARID4A protein contains several domains, including an ARID domain, a Tudor domain, a chromodomain, and a chromobarrel domain, which facilitate its interactions with DNA and methylated histones (Korn2022Structures; Deák2021Missense). These interactions are crucial for its role in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression. ARID4A is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and plays a significant role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and hematopoiesis (Ren2022A; Cajuso2014Exome). Alterations in the ARID4A gene have been linked to various diseases, including schizophrenia and several types of cancer, highlighting its importance in genomic stability and disease prevention (Cajuso2014Exome; Ren2022A).

## Structure
The ARID4A protein is a member of the ARID family, characterized by the presence of an ARID domain, which is a DNA-binding motif with a helix-turn-helix structure (Korn2022Structures; Wu2006Deficiency). The ARID domain consists of six α-helices and two loop regions, with potential extensions at the N- and C-termini that may influence DNA binding (Korn2022Structures). The ARID4A protein also contains a Tudor domain, a chromodomain, and a chromobarrel domain, which are involved in binding to methylated histones and DNA (Korn2022Structures; Deák2021Missense; Wu2006Deficiency). The chromodomain and chromobarrel domain are particularly noted for their potential to recognize methylated lysine residues on histones, although experimental results have been conflicting (Deák2021Missense).

ARID4A is associated with the mSIN3-histone deacetylase complex, acting as a transcriptional repressor (WILSKER2005Nomenclature; Wu2006Deficiency). The protein contains a conserved LXCXE motif, which interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (RB), facilitating its role in transcriptional repression (Wu2006Deficiency). The protein's structure and function are further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and it may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing (Deák2021Missense).

## Function
The ARID4A gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It is a component of the SIN3A co-repressor complex, which influences gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. ARID4A interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (RB) to repress E2F-dependent transcription, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase (Cajuso2014Exome; Wu2008Identification). This interaction is facilitated by the ARID4A protein's conserved LXCXE motif, which binds to RB, and its ARID domain, which is involved in DNA binding (Wu2006Deficiency).

ARID4A is involved in epigenetic regulation, particularly through its association with the mSin3A-histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. This complex recruits ARID4A to E2F-dependent promoters, where it mediates transcriptional repression by modifying histone methylation patterns, such as H3K9 and H4K20 trimethylation (Wu2008Identification; Wu2006Deficiency). The protein's chromodomain and Tudor domain facilitate binding to methylated lysines on histones H3 and H4, contributing to its role in maintaining chromatin structure and gene expression regulation (Wu2006Deficiency).

In healthy human cells, ARID4A is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and maintaining normal hematopoiesis. Its function as a transcriptional repressor and chromatin remodeler is essential for normal cellular processes and preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Ren2022A; Cajuso2014Exome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARID4A gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A novel heterozygous missense variant, p.His411Asp, has been associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese families. This mutation disrupts the DNA-binding activity of the ARID4A protein, potentially contributing to schizophrenia susceptibility by promoting cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (Ren2022A). ARID4A is also suggested to function as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, including prostate and breast cancer, and is involved in the regulation of epigenetic programming in leukemia (Ren2022A).

In leukemia, ARID4A, along with ARID4B, acts as a suppressor gene. Deficiency in ARID4A leads to disturbed histone modifications and altered expression of genes crucial for hematopoiesis, contributing to leukemia development (Wu2008Identification). In mice, ARID4A deficiency results in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders and acute myeloid leukemia, characterized by ineffective blood cell production and increased mortality (Wu2008Identification).

In colorectal cancer, ARID4A mutations are frequently observed, particularly in microsatellite unstable colorectal cancer, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Cajuso2014Exome). These mutations may lead to partial or complete inactivation of the gene, contributing to cancer progression (Cajuso2014Exome).

## Interactions
ARID4A is involved in several protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. It interacts with ARID4B, forming a complex that associates with the Snrpn promoter, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis (Wu2006Deficiency). ARID4A also binds directly to the retinoblastoma protein (RB), utilizing a conserved LXCXE motif, and acts as a repressor of E2F-dependent transcription by recruiting the mSin3A-histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to E2F-dependent promoters (Wu2006Deficiency; Wu2008Identification).

In addition to its interactions with proteins, ARID4A binds to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) through its PWWP-ARID domain. A missense variant, p.His411Asp, disrupts this DNA-binding activity, highlighting the importance of His411 in maintaining ARID4A's affinity for dsDNA (Ren2022A). ARID4A is also part of the SIN3-HDAC chromatin remodeling complex, where it interacts with the breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1). This interaction is significant for the regulation of gene expression and metastasis suppression in breast cancer cells (Hurst2008Alterations). These interactions underscore ARID4A's role in modulating transcription and maintaining genomic stability.
