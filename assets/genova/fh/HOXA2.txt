# HOXA2

## Overview
The HOXA2 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain known as the homeodomain. The protein product, homeobox A2, plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly in the craniofacial region, by regulating the patterning and differentiation of the second branchial arch. As a transcription factor, homeobox A2 modulates gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the development of skeletal structures and other tissues. Its activity is tightly regulated through interactions with various proteins, including those involved in protein degradation pathways, which affect its stability and localization. Mutations and epigenetic alterations in HOXA2 have been linked to congenital malformations and various cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Kanzler1998Hoxa2; Bergiers2013The; Si2020Identification).

## Function
The HOXA2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the craniofacial region, particularly in the patterning of the second branchial arch. It functions by modulating the mesenchyme's response to skeletogenic signals, thereby restricting chondrogenesis and inhibiting bone formation in specific areas of the branchial region (Kanzler1998Hoxa2). In the absence of HOXA2, the second branchial arch can develop skeletal elements characteristic of the first arch, indicating its role in providing regional identity (Kanzler1998Hoxa2).

HOXA2 interacts with partner proteins to modulate its DNA binding specificity and transcriptional activity. The KPC2 protein, for instance, can relocalize HOXA2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, reducing its transcriptional activity, which suggests a regulatory mechanism for HOXA2 during embryogenesis (Bridoux2015KPC2). Additionally, HOXA2 is involved in protein degradation pathways, interacting with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RCHY1 to promote its proteasome-mediated decay, highlighting its role in regulating protein stability (Rezsohazy2015Cellular).

HOXA2's activity is essential for the proper formation of skeletal structures in the second branchial arch, and its expression levels are critical for normal development (Ohnemus2001Different).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HOXA2 gene are associated with microtia, a congenital condition characterized by malformations of the external ear. These mutations, identified in Chinese families, are typically loss-of-function mutations that result in truncated HOXA2 proteins or trigger nonsense-mediated decay, affecting the transcription of the HMX1 gene, which is crucial for ear development. Notably, these mutations can lead to external ear malformations without significant hearing impairment, distinguishing them from other conditions that may involve hearing loss (Si2020Identification).

In addition to its role in ear development, alterations in the expression and methylation of HOXA2 have been implicated in various cancers. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, aberrant hypermethylation of HOXA2 is linked to increased expression of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), promoting tumor invasiveness (Li2013Aberrantly). In colorectal cancer, HOXA2 is frequently hypermethylated, particularly in early stages, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis (Li2019Study). The methylation status of HOXA2 is also relevant in lung squamous cell carcinoma, where it helps stratify the disease into molecular subtypes with distinct prognoses (Paço2020Methylation).

## Interactions
HOXA2, a homeodomain transcription factor, engages in various protein interactions that influence its function and stability. It interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RCHY1, promoting its proteasomal degradation in a ubiquitin-independent manner. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of the p53 protein, as HOXA2 inhibits RCHY1's ubiquitin ligase activity, reducing p53 ubiquitination (Bergiers2013The). The interaction between HOXA2 and RCHY1 primarily occurs in the nucleus and is enhanced by proteasomal inhibition, indicating a role in protein degradation pathways (Bridoux2015Molecular).

HOXA2 also interacts with the 20S proteasome subunits PSMA3 and PSMB2, which are involved in protein degradation processes (Bergiers2013The). Additionally, HOXA2 forms complexes with KPC2 and PPP1CB, which regulate its activity by promoting nuclear export and cytoplasmic retention. These interactions decrease HOXA2's transcriptional activity and reduce its ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing the protein in the cytoplasm (Bridoux2015KPC2; Deneyer2019HOXA2). The interaction with KPC2 involves multiple regions of HOXA2, including its homeodomain, and is not limited to a single protein motif (Bridoux2015KPC2).
