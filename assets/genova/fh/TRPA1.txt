# TRPA1

## Overview
The TRPA1 gene encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1, a protein that functions as a calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel. This protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and is characterized by its homotetrameric structure, which includes six transmembrane helices and a reentrant pore loop. TRPA1 is widely expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, where it plays a critical role in sensory perception, particularly in nociception and pain modulation. It is activated by a variety of chemical irritants and environmental stimuli, contributing to processes such as inflammation, vasodilation, and epithelial barrier function. The channel's activity is modulated through complex interactions with other proteins, including TRPV1, calmodulin, and the sigma-1 receptor, highlighting its significance in physiological and pathological contexts (Nilius2012The; Paulsen2015Structure; Viana2016TRPA1).

## Structure
The TRPA1 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and functions as a cation channel. It is a homotetrameric structure, with each subunit consisting of six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) and a reentrant pore loop, forming a central ion-conducting pore (Zimova2018Intracellular; Samanta2018Structural). The protein features a large N-terminal domain with 16 ankyrin repeats, which are involved in protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions (Samanta2018Structural). The C-terminal domain includes a coiled-coil structure (Paulsen2015Structure).

The TRPA1 channel is activated by electrophilic irritants through covalent modification of cysteine or lysine residues in the cytoplasmic N terminus (Paulsen2015Structure). The channel's structure includes a TRP-like allosteric domain that interacts with other non-contiguous structures, such as the pre-S1 helix and S4-S5 linker, through hydrophobic interactions, playing a role in allosteric regulation (Paulsen2015Structure). The channel's pore, when activated, resembles that of TRPV1, with two major constrictions and two pore helices (Paulsen2015Structure).

The TRPA1 protein also contains a highly hydrophilic intracellular cavity within the S1–S4 sensor domain, which is crucial for its regulation and gating (Zimova2018Intracellular). This domain is surrounded by phospholipids and can bind membrane phosphoinositides like PIP2, which regulate the channel's gating in a state-dependent manner (Zimova2018Intracellular).

## Function
The TRPA1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes across different tissues. In sensory neurons, TRPA1 is involved in nociception, responding to environmental irritants, temperature changes, and mechanical stimuli, which contributes to pain perception and inflammatory responses (Nilius2012The; Viana2016TRPA1). It is activated by a wide range of chemical irritants, including reactive electrophilic compounds, and is modulated by G protein-coupled receptors, which are involved in nociceptor sensitization (Viana2016TRPA1).

TRPA1 is expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, such as epithelial cells and hair cells, and is involved in sensory and homeostatic tasks (Nilius2012The). In the cardiovascular system, TRPA1 mediates endothelium-dependent vasodilation through the activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels, influencing vascular tone and blood flow regulation (Nilius2012The; Earley2009EndotheliumDependent). In the skin, TRPA1 is involved in maintaining the epidermal barrier and responding to oxidative stress, contributing to processes like barrier regeneration and melanin synthesis (Maglie2021The). It also plays a role in the gastrointestinal tract as a chemosensor, modulating epithelial permeability and anion secretion (Nilius2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TRPA1 gene are linked to several clinical conditions. A notable mutation, N855S, causes Familial Episodic Pain Syndrome (FEPS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severe upper body pain triggered by fasting, physical stress, and cold. This mutation results in a gain-of-function, increasing the inward current of the TRPA1 channel and shifting its voltage dependence, which enhances nociceptive system sensitization (Kremeyer2010A; Nilius2012The).

TRPA1 is also implicated in various inflammatory conditions. Its activation contributes to neurogenic inflammation and is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases like atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, where it is overexpressed in skin cells and sensory neurons (Maglie2021The; Yao2023Inflammation—the). In respiratory diseases, TRPA1 activation by irritants can exacerbate symptoms in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Nilius2012The).

In neuropathic pain, TRPA1 variants have been studied, with some linked to altered pain perception, such as paradoxical heat sensation (Naert2020TRPA1). TRPA1 is also involved in migraine pathogenesis and is a target for therapeutic interventions in pain management (Benemei2014The; Moore2017Regulation).

## Interactions
The TRPA1 channel is involved in various protein-protein interactions that regulate its function. It interacts with the TRPV1 channel, forming a complex that modulates TRPA1's single-channel properties, such as current-voltage relationships and open probability, independently of intracellular calcium levels (Nilius2012The; Staruschenko2010Contribution). The interaction between TRPA1 and TRPV1 is influenced by the transmembrane adaptor protein Tmem100, which can either weaken or enhance the association between these channels, affecting TRPA1 activity (Weng2015Tmem100).

TRPA1 is also regulated by calmodulin (CaM), which binds to its N- and C-terminal regions. This binding is modulated by calcium ions, with CaM competing with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) for binding sites on TRPA1 (Zimova2020Proximal). The sigma-1 receptor (σ1R) interacts with TRPA1, binding to both its N-terminal and C-terminal regions, and this interaction is enhanced by calcium ions. σ1R competes with CaM for binding at the N-terminal domain, influencing TRPA1's function (CortésMontero2019Ligands).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving TRPA1, which plays a significant role in sensory perception and pain modulation.
