# YARS1

## Overview
YARS1, or tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is a gene that encodes an enzyme crucial for protein synthesis, specifically by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid tyrosine to its corresponding tRNA. This enzyme belongs to the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are essential for the accurate translation of the genetic code into functional proteins (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). Beyond its canonical role in protein synthesis, the YARS1 protein also exhibits noncanonical functions, such as actin cytoskeleton organization, by binding to F-actin and organizing actin filaments into tight bundles (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). This dual functionality is significant in various cellular processes, including cell migration and neurodevelopment. Mutations in the YARS1 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and multisystem disorders, highlighting its clinical importance (Forrest2022A).

## Structure
The YARS1 protein, also known as tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is involved in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of tyrosine to its corresponding tRNA. The primary structure of YARS1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of YARS1 results in a compact, globular shape, which often features an anticodon-binding domain crucial for its interaction with tRNA (Yaremchuk2002Class).

YARS1 functions as a homodimer, representing its quaternary structure, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). This dimeric form may also contribute to its noncanonical role in actin bundling, as observed in studies related to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. Additionally, YARS1 may have splice variant isoforms, which could influence its localization and activity within the cell (Jiang2020Human). These structural features and modifications are critical for the diverse roles YARS1 plays in cellular processes.

## Function
The YARS1 gene encodes the enzyme tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of tyrosine to its corresponding tRNA, a process known as aminoacylation. This function is essential for the accurate translation of the genetic code into proteins, impacting cellular function and organismal development (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA).

Beyond its canonical role in protein synthesis, YARS1 has a noncanonical function in actin cytoskeleton organization. It binds to F-actin and organizes actin filaments into tight bundles, a property that does not significantly interfere with its aminoacylation activity (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). This actin-bundling activity positions YARS1 among over 200 known actin-binding proteins that regulate the assembly and disassembly of F-actin, influencing the organization and mechanical properties of actin networks (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA).

YARS1 is enriched at F-actin assemblies, such as the cell cortex and dynamic protrusions like lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, and is involved in processes like cell migration and the formation of protrusions in neuroblastoma cells (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). This dual functionality of YARS1 highlights its importance in maintaining cellular functions, particularly in neurons where actin dynamics are crucial for processes like synaptic vesicle mobilization (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the YARS1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and multisystem disorders. One notable condition linked to YARS1 mutations is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type C (CMTDIC), a hereditary neuropathy characterized by progressive weakness and sensory loss in the distal extremities (Forrest2022A). Additionally, recessive mutations in YARS1 can lead to severe multisystem diseases. For instance, the p.Pro167Thr mutation is associated with developmental delay, hypertriglyceridemia, liver disease, cystic lung lesions, and thinning of the corpus callosum. This mutation affects the dimerization of YARS, impacting its cytokine activity and leading to immune dysregulation (Williams2018Homozygosity).

Other variants, such as p.(Arg367Trp), are linked to distinct neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including severe neurological impairments and sensory deficits (Averdunk2021The). The p.(Pro213Leu) and p.(Gly525Arg) variants are associated with a novel multisystem disease characterized by failure to thrive, developmental delay, and liver dysfunction (Nowaczyk2016A). These mutations highlight the clinical heterogeneity associated with YARS1, emphasizing the importance of understanding specific variants and their impact on protein function. The structural impact of these mutations on the YARS1 protein affects its stability and function, contributing to the variability in clinical manifestations (Averdunk2021The).

## Interactions
YARS1, or tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is known for its interactions with various proteins and its role in actin bundling. It binds directly to F-actin, organizing actin filaments into tight bundles, a property that is enhanced in certain Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease-associated mutants (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). YARS1 interacts with actin-binding proteins such as Fimbrin (Fim) and plastin (PLS3), suggesting it may form complexes with these proteins to influence actin cytoskeleton organization (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). 

In Drosophila models, YARS1 mutations have been shown to interact genetically with the Fim gene, enhancing phenotypes associated with CMT, indicating a functional interaction with actin-bundling proteins (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). In vitro assays have demonstrated that YARS1 can bind and bundle F-actin, and this activity is not disrupted by its canonical tRNA ligase function (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). 

YARS1 also participates in protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells, where it is enriched at F-actin assemblies and dynamic protrusions, further supporting its role in actin organization (Ermanoska2023TyrosyltRNA). These interactions highlight YARS1's noncanonical functions beyond its role in protein synthesis.
