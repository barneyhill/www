# FIS1

## Overview
The FIS1 gene encodes the fission, mitochondrial 1 protein, which is integral to the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in the processes of mitochondrial fission, mitophagy, and apoptosis. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in recruiting dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to facilitate mitochondrial fission, a critical process for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial; Losón2013Fis1). Beyond its role in fission, Fis1 is involved in mitophagy by interacting with proteins such as TBC1D15/17 and Syntaxin17, which help remove damaged mitochondria, thereby maintaining cellular health (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial). Additionally, Fis1 is implicated in apoptosis, influencing mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release, which are essential steps in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial). The protein's activity is context-dependent, exhibiting both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions based on expression levels and cellular conditions (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial).

## Function
The FIS1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in mitochondrial fission, mitophagy, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, Fis1 is anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is involved in recruiting the GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to facilitate mitochondrial fission, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial; Losón2013Fis1). Fis1 interacts with other proteins such as TBC1D15/17 and Syntaxin17, which are involved in mitophagy, helping to remove damaged mitochondria and maintain cellular health (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial).

Fis1 also plays a role in apoptosis by influencing mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release, which are critical steps in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial). It is involved in forming a complex at ER-mitochondrial contact sites, which is necessary for activating procaspase 8, linking it to both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial). The protein's activity is context-dependent, exhibiting both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions based on expression levels and cellular conditions (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial). Overall, Fis1 is integral to maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, impacting cellular energy production and stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the FIS1 gene are implicated in several diseases. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), increased FIS1 expression is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, promoting mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis. In ALS, FIS1 may compensate for mutations in the C9ORF72 gene, and inhibiting the FIS1-Drp1 interaction could slow disease progression (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial). In PD, particularly in autosomal recessive forms, FIS1 is linked to mitophagy and stress response, contributing to dopaminergic neuron loss (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial).

In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), FIS1 upregulation is linked to mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired neuronal survival, although its overexpression mimics AD-like mitochondrial distribution without restoring normal neurite formation (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial). In cancer, altered FIS1 expression is associated with disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, potentially contributing to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial).

In metabolic disorders, FIS1 plays a role in insulin resistance and diabetic complications. Increased FIS1 expression in diabetic nephropathy is linked to mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction, with potential therapeutic interventions targeting FIS1 to mitigate these effects (Ihenacho2021Mitochondrial). In the liver, FIS1 regulates the mitochondrial integrated stress response, improving glucose homeostasis and reducing oxidative stress, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases (Liou2022Hepatic).

## Interactions
FIS1 is a key player in mitochondrial fission, primarily through its interactions with other proteins. It interacts with dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), facilitating its recruitment to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) where it promotes mitochondrial fission. This interaction is mediated by the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of FIS1, which is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the fission machinery (Zerihun2023The). 

FIS1 also interacts with other adaptor proteins such as mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) and mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49/51). These interactions are important for the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and have been implicated in cardiovascular diseases (Zerihun2023The; Zerihun2023Selective). The interaction between FIS1 and Mid51 is particularly notable as it occurs independently of Drp1, suggesting a unique role in mitochondrial fission (Zerihun2023Selective).

In addition to its role in fission, FIS1 interacts with mitochondrial fusion proteins Mfn1 and Mfn2. This interaction is inhibited by MIEF1 and MIEF2, which sequester FIS1 and reduce its inhibitory effect on mitochondrial fusion, thereby promoting fusion processes (Yu2021MIEF12).
