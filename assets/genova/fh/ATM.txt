# ATM

## Overview
The ATM gene encodes the ATM serine/threonine kinase, a critical enzyme involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly DNA double-strand breaks. As a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family, ATM plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by orchestrating DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis. The ATM protein is characterized by its large size and complex structure, which includes a conserved kinase domain and several regulatory domains that facilitate its activation and function. Upon activation, ATM phosphorylates a variety of substrates, including key proteins such as p53, BRCA1, and CHK2, to initiate DNA repair processes and maintain cellular homeostasis (Abraham2001Cell; Guleria2016ATM). Mutations in the ATM gene are associated with ataxia-telangiectasia, a disorder marked by neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, and increased cancer risk, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in human health (McKinnon2004ATM; Boultwood2001Ataxia).

## Structure
The ATM (ATM serine/threonine kinase) protein is a large serine-threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response, particularly in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. 

The primary structure of ATM consists of 2,812 amino acids, resulting in a molecular weight of approximately 327 kDa (Wang2016Structure). The secondary structure is dominated by helix-turn-helix repeats, with the α-helix being the predominant form (Wang2016Structure). 

In terms of tertiary structure, ATM contains a conserved kinase domain at the C terminus, along with three other structural modules: the FAT, FATC, and an N-terminal helical solenoid. The FAT domain wraps around about 50% of the kinase domain, potentially regulating substrate or regulator binding (Wang2016Structure). The N-terminal helical solenoid forms two arms that cradle the catalytic core (Wang2016Structure).

The quaternary structure of ATM involves dimerization, where it exists as a non-covalent homodimer in its inactive state. The dimer interface is primarily centered on the TRD2 regions of the FAT domains between the two monomers (Wang2016Structure). Activation involves autophosphorylation, particularly at serine residue 1981, which induces dimer dissociation and initiates ATM kinase activity (Shiloh2003ATM).

## Function
The ATM serine/threonine kinase is a pivotal protein in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. It is primarily activated in response to DNA double-strand breaks, where it phosphorylates a variety of substrates to initiate DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis (Xu2014The; Guleria2016ATM). ATM is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase related kinases (PIKKs) family and is involved in cell cycle checkpoint signaling, particularly in response to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage (Abraham2001Cell). 

ATM's activation involves a transition from an inactive dimer to active monomers, facilitated by autophosphorylation and recruitment to DNA damage sites, often mediated by the MRN complex (Mre11, Rad50, and NBS1) (Guleria2016ATM). Once activated, ATM phosphorylates key proteins such as p53, BRCA1, and CHK2, which are crucial for cell cycle regulation and DNA repair processes (Abraham2001Cell; Guleria2016ATM). 

Beyond its role in DNA damage response, ATM is involved in regulating oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and insulin signaling, highlighting its broader role in cellular homeostasis and metabolism (Guleria2016ATM). ATM's activity is crucial for preventing genomic instability and associated diseases, such as cancer (Xu2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATM gene are primarily associated with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, and increased cancer risk, particularly lymphoid malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma (McKinnon2004ATM; Boultwood2001Ataxia; Khanna2000Cancer). Approximately 10-15% of individuals with AT develop malignancies, mostly lymphoid tumors, during childhood or early adulthood (Stankovic1998ATM).

ATM mutations also confer an increased risk of breast cancer, with heterozygous carriers having a two- to fourfold increased risk compared to the general population (Ahmed2006ATM; Khanna2000Cancer). Specific mutations, such as the T7271G transversion, are associated with a higher risk of breast cancer (Ahmed2006ATM; Stankovic1998ATM). ATM heterozygotes may also have an increased frequency of other cancers, although data on these associations are inconclusive (Ahmed2006ATM).

Alterations in ATM expression or function can lead to genomic instability, contributing to cancer predisposition. Somatic mutations in ATM have been identified in sporadic cancers, particularly leukemias (McKinnon2004ATM). The ATM gene's role in DNA repair and cell cycle control is crucial for maintaining genomic stability, and its dysfunction can lead to the diverse pathologies observed in AT and related conditions (McKinnon2004ATM).

## Interactions
The ATM serine/threonine kinase is a pivotal component in the DNA damage response, engaging in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. ATM is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through its interaction with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, which acts as a sensor for these breaks and facilitates ATM activation (Lee2005ATM; Shiloh2013The; Bhatti2011ATM). The interaction between ATM and NBS1 is particularly crucial for ATM's recruitment and retention at DSB sites (Shiloh2013The). ATM phosphorylates NBS1 at specific serine residues, which is important for the activation of the S-phase cell cycle checkpoint and CHK2 (Bhatti2011ATM).

ATM also interacts with the sensor protein MDC1, which is anchored to DSB sites via phosphorylated histone H2A.X (γH2A.X). This interaction allows ATM to phosphorylate additional H2A.X molecules, promoting the expansion of the DSB-associated focus (Shiloh2013The). Furthermore, ATM interacts with other proteins such as BRIT1 and PI3Kb, which are involved in the recruitment of NBS1 to DSBs (Bhatti2011ATM). These interactions underscore the complex network of protein interactions that ATM engages in to coordinate the cellular response to DNA damage.
