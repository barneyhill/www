# PSMD10

## Overview
PSMD10, also known as gankyrin, is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 10, a critical component of the 26S proteasome complex. This protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its role in cellular processes such as autophagy and protein degradation. As a non-ATPase subunit, PSMD10 is involved in the regulation of ubiquitinated protein degradation, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and influencing cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The protein's interactions with key cellular proteins, such as ATG7, RB1, and TP53, underscore its involvement in autophagy, cell cycle progression, and stress responses. PSMD10's dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, where it contributes to tumor progression and metastasis through its role in autophagy and metabolic reprogramming (Chu2017MicroRNA‐1254; Luo2016PSMD10gankyrin; Liu2019Gankyrin).

## Structure
PSMD10, also known as gankyrin, is a non-ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome complex, characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which are common motifs for protein-protein interactions. These ankyrin repeats are crucial for the protein's stability and function, facilitating interactions with various proteins such as ATG7, which is involved in autophagy (Li2021Genetically; Luo2016PSMD10gankyrin). The protein's structure includes multiple ankyrin repeats, and the last three repeats, along with the C-terminal tail, are essential for its interaction with ATG7, highlighting their importance in PSMD10's role in autophagy (Luo2016PSMD10gankyrin).

PSMD10 can exist as a monomer or homodimer, with homodimerization being critical for its function in autophagy. The N-terminus, particularly the Cys4 residue, plays a significant role in stabilizing the homodimer (Li2021Genetically). The protein's ability to form homodimers is essential for its interaction with ATG7, although this interaction is disrupted by the bacterial effector NleE, which maintains PSMD10 in a monomeric state (Li2021Genetically). These structural features underscore PSMD10's involvement in cellular processes such as autophagy and its potential implications in cancer progression.

## Function
PSMD10, also known as Gankyrin, is a non-ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome complex, which is crucial for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis by regulating the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins, thereby ensuring proper cellular function (Sudharsan2022A). PSMD10 is involved in several key cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It interacts with proteins such as RB1 and TP53, influencing cell cycle progression and survival (Luo2016PSMD10gankyrin).

In healthy human cells, PSMD10 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it participates in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival (Sudharsan2022A). The protein's ability to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus allows it to modulate various cellular processes, including the transcriptional activation of genes involved in autophagy and stress responses (Luo2016PSMD10gankyrin). Through these activities, PSMD10 contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the organism's overall health. Its role in these processes underscores its importance in normal cellular function and its potential implications in disease states when dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
PSMD10, also known as gankyrin, is significantly implicated in the progression of various cancers, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of PSMD10 is frequently observed in HCC and is associated with poor prognosis, increased invasiveness, and metastasis. It promotes tumor progression by enhancing autophagy through interactions with ATG7, which supports tumor cell survival under stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation or chemotherapy (Luo2016PSMD10gankyrin). PSMD10 also plays a role in metabolic reprogramming, driving glycolysis and glutaminolysis, which contributes to tumorigenesis and drug resistance in HCC (Liu2019Gankyrin).

In addition to HCC, PSMD10 is overexpressed in other cancers, including colorectal cancer, where it targets tumor suppressors like RB1 and TP53 for degradation, facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis (Chu2017MicroRNA‐1254). The gene's interaction with β-catenin signaling pathways further underscores its role in cancer progression, as it establishes a positive feedback loop that enhances β-catenin activity, contributing to tumorigenesis (Dong2011The). These findings highlight PSMD10 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
PSMD10, also known as gankyrin, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with ATG7, a key protein in autophagy, both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This interaction is crucial for promoting autophagy, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and is enhanced under conditions of nutrient deprivation (Luo2016PSMD10gankyrin). PSMD10 also interacts with GRP78, facilitating endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes, which is significant in the context of homocysteine-induced liver injury (Xiao2021Interaction).

In the context of bacterial infection, PSMD10 interacts with the Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli effector protein NleE. This interaction suppresses PSMD10 homodimerization, which is necessary for its interaction with ATG7 and the promotion of autophagy. By maintaining PSMD10 in a monomeric state, NleE attenuates autophagosome formation, thereby subverting the host's autophagic response (Li2021Genetically). These interactions highlight PSMD10's role in modulating autophagy and apoptosis, impacting both cellular stress responses and pathogen-host interactions.
