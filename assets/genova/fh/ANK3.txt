# ANK3

## Overview
The ANK3 gene encodes the ankyrin G protein, a member of the ankyrin family of proteins, which are integral to the structural organization of cellular membranes. Ankyrin G is a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in linking integral membrane proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton, thereby maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating various cellular processes. It is categorized as a membrane skeletal protein and is involved in the formation and stabilization of specialized membrane domains. In neurons, ankyrin G is essential for the organization of the axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier, where it stabilizes voltage-gated sodium channels, contributing to action potential generation and propagation. In cardiac cells, it modulates the expression and membrane targeting of cardiac voltage-gated sodium channels, which are crucial for heart rhythm. Mutations in ANK3 have been associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, as well as cardiac arrhythmias, highlighting its clinical significance (Chagula2020Ankyrins; Bennett2008Organizing; Cunha2009Ankyrin).

## Structure
The ANK3 gene encodes the ankyrin G protein, which is part of the ankyrin family of membrane skeletal proteins. The molecular structure of ankyrin G includes several domains: an N-terminal domain with 24 ankyrin repeats, a spectrin-binding domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (Leussis2012Ankyrin). The ankyrin repeats are 33-amino acid motifs involved in protein-protein interactions, binding numerous membrane or cytoplasmic proteins (Leussis2012Ankyrin). The spectrin-binding domain links ankyrin G to the cytoskeleton, while the C-terminal domain modulates binding affinity (Leussis2012Ankyrin).

Ankyrin G is expressed in various isoforms due to alternative splicing, resulting in proteins with different molecular weights and functions. In the brain, large isoforms such as 480 kDa and 270 kDa are localized to the axon initial segment and nodes of Ranvier, playing roles in synaptic organization (Leussis2012Ankyrin). Smaller isoforms, like the 100 kDa and 120 kDa, are found in lysosomes and are involved in cellular trafficking (Leussis2012Ankyrin). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect ankyrin G's interactions with other proteins (Leussis2012Ankyrin).

## Function
The ANK3 gene encodes ankyrin-G, a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular structure and function by linking integral membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton. Ankyrin-G is involved in the formation and stabilization of specialized membrane domains, which are essential for various cellular processes. In epithelial cells, ankyrin-G collaborates with β2-spectrin to form lateral membrane domains, facilitating cell morphology and membrane biogenesis by recruiting E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule (Bennett2008Organizing; Cunha2009Ankyrin).

In neurons, ankyrin-G is crucial for the organization of the axon initial segments (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier, where it stabilizes voltage-gated sodium channels and neurofascin, contributing to action potential generation and propagation (Bennett2008Organizing; Sharma2020Human). It also recruits β4-spectrin to these sites, which is vital for membrane stability (Bennett2008Organizing). Ankyrin-G's interactions with ion channels and cell adhesion molecules are essential for synaptogenesis, synaptic stability, and maintaining neuromuscular junctions (Sharma2020Human).

In cardiac cells, ankyrin-G modulates the expression and membrane targeting of cardiac voltage-gated sodium channels, such as Nav1.5, which are necessary for the rhythmic beating of the heart (Chagula2020Ankyrins). Dysfunction in ANK3 has been linked to neurological disorders, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, as well as cardiac arrhythmias like Brugada syndrome (Chagula2020Ankyrins; Cunha2009Ankyrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANK3 gene are associated with a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. ANK3 has been implicated in bipolar disorder, with genome-wide association studies identifying several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to the condition (Yoon2022Roles; Takata2011Association). Some variants in ANK3 are associated with lower expression levels of Ankyrin-G, increasing the risk of bipolar disorder, while others may have protective effects (Stevens2021Ankyrins). 

ANK3 is also associated with schizophrenia, although the evidence is less consistent. Some studies have found SNPs in ANK3 linked to schizophrenia, but these findings have not always reached genome-wide significance (Yoon2022Roles). In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), rare de novo mutations in ANK3 have been identified, suggesting a potential role in ASD susceptibility (Yoon2022Roles; Bi2012Mutations).

ANK3 mutations can lead to severe cognitive deficits, intellectual disability, and behavioral problems, including ADHD and aggressive behavior (Iqbal2013Homozygous). These mutations may disrupt neuronal function by affecting Ankyrin-G isoforms, which are crucial for maintaining neuronal polarity and excitability (van2017Behavioural; Stevens2021Ankyrins).

## Interactions
ANK3, or ankyrin-G, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In cardiac cells, ankyrin-G interacts with plakophilin-2 (PKP2) and connexin43 (Cx43) at the intercalated disc, forming a complex network that supports mechanical and electrical coupling. These interactions are essential for maintaining intercellular adhesion and sodium channel function, which are critical for impulse propagation in the heart (Sato2011Interactions).

Ankyrin-G also plays a role in neurons, where it interacts with KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 ion channels. The C3 domain motif of these channels is necessary for their interaction with ankyrin-G, which is crucial for their localization at axon initial segments (AISs) and nodes of Ranvier. This interaction helps stabilize the channels at these sites, affecting neuronal excitability and action potential propagation (Pan2006A).

In epithelial cells, ankyrin-G collaborates with β2-spectrin to form the lateral membrane, highlighting its role in membrane protein localization and stabilization. This interaction is part of a broader mechanism where ankyrin-G links the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton, contributing to cellular structural integrity (Kizhatil2007AnkyrinG; Li2020Structural).
