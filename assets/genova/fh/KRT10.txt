# KRT10

## Overview
The KRT10 gene encodes keratin 10, a type I intermediate filament protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of the epidermis. Keratin 10 is primarily expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, where it forms heterodimers with type II keratins, such as keratin 1, to create robust intermediate filaments. These filaments are essential for maintaining the mechanical resilience and barrier function of the skin. The protein's structure includes a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is crucial for filament formation, and is characterized by polymorphic glycine-rich loops that enhance its flexibility. Keratin 10 is involved in regulating keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation, contributing to cellular homeostasis. Mutations in the KRT10 gene are linked to several skin disorders, including Ichthyosis with Confetti and epidermolytic ichthyosis, underscoring its clinical significance in dermatological health (Choate2010Mitotic; Dmello2019Multifaceted; Fischer2016Keratins).

## Structure
The KRT10 gene encodes keratin 10, a type I intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis. The primary structure of keratin 10 includes a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This rod domain is crucial for the protein's structural integrity and is organized in a heptad repeat pattern, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers (Ho2022Update).

The secondary structure of keratin 10 is characterized by these coiled-coil motifs, which are essential for the protein's ability to form stable filamentous networks. The tertiary structure involves the assembly of these networks, contributing to the mechanical resilience of the epidermis (Ho2022Update).

In terms of quaternary structure, keratin 10 forms heterodimers with type II keratins, such as keratin 1, to create intermediate filaments. These heterodimers further interact to form tetramers, which are the basic building blocks of keratin intermediate filaments (Ho2022Update).

The C-terminal V2 subdomain of keratin 10 is particularly notable for its polymorphism, characterized by variable numbers and sizes of glycine-rich loops. These loops contribute to the protein's flexibility and are crucial for its function in maintaining epidermal integrity (Korge1992Extensive). Common post-translational modifications of keratin 10 include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Ho2022Update).

## Function
Keratin 10 (KRT10) is a type I cytokeratin protein predominantly expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and resilience of keratinocytes. KRT10 is involved in the assembly of intermediate filaments, which provide mechanical support to cells and tissues, contributing to the formation of the skin barrier (Fischer2016Keratins).

In healthy human cells, KRT10 is expressed during the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, replacing KRT5 and KRT14 with KRT1 and KRT10, which highlights its role in the differentiation process (Komori2018Type). KRT10 inhibits cell proliferation by increasing the G1-phase population and decreasing the S-phase population in human keratinocytes, a process that requires functional Rb proteins and involves the PI3K-signaling pathway (Dmello2019Multifaceted). This regulation of cell proliferation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing hyperproliferative conditions that could lead to cancer (Dmello2019Multifaceted).

KRT10 also plays a role in protecting cells from chemically induced apoptosis, allowing for timely differentiation of keratinocytes (Dmello2019Multifaceted). Its expression is associated with the structural integrity of the epidermis, particularly in areas subjected to mechanical stress, such as plantar skin (Fischer2016Keratins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT10 gene are associated with several skin disorders, most notably Ichthyosis with Confetti (IWC) and epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI). IWC is a rare autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by erythroderma and numerous pale spots on the skin. It is caused by dominant-negative frameshift variants in the KRT10 gene, leading to the production of mutant keratin 10 proteins with arginine-rich C-termini that mislocalize to the nucleus. This mislocalization disrupts the keratin filament network, affecting the skin's barrier function and contributing to the pathogenesis of IWC (Renz2019Arginine‐; Choate2010Mitotic; Pan2020Ichthyosis).

Epidermolytic ichthyosis, another condition linked to KRT10 mutations, is characterized by generalized erythroderma and blistering at birth, progressing to hyperkeratosis. This disorder is typically caused by autosomal dominant mutations in KRT10, but a novel recessive mutation has also been identified, resulting in the absence of the K10 protein and compensatory upregulation of other keratins (Gutierrez2013A).

Mutations in KRT10 can also lead to other severe skin diseases, such as keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome and ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens, indicating a broader impact of KRT10 mutations on skin conditions (Choate2010Mitotic).

## Interactions
Keratin 10 (KRT10) is a type I cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells by forming intermediate filaments. It primarily interacts with keratin 1 (KRT1), a type II keratin, to form stable heterodimers that are essential for maintaining the mechanical resilience of the epidermis. These KRT1/KRT10 heterodimers are integral to the formation of the cytoskeleton in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, contributing to the skin's structural stability (Fischer2016Keratins; Terrinoni2018Role).

In the context of ichthyosis hystrix of Curth-Macklin, a mutation in the KRT10 gene can disrupt the normal formation of these heterodimers, leading to altered keratin dimer formation and compromised epidermal integrity (Terrinoni2018Role). In knockout mouse models lacking KRT10, other keratins such as K1, K9, and K16 are upregulated, suggesting compensatory interactions among keratins to maintain epidermal structure, although these compensations are not fully effective (Fischer2016Keratins).

KRT10's interactions are not limited to structural roles; they may also involve cell signaling and adhesion processes, although specific details on these interactions are less well-documented in the provided context.
