# PTTG1IP2

## Overview
PTTG1IP2 is a gene that encodes the protein PTTG1IP family member 2, which is part of a family of proteins involved in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by PTTG1IP2 is implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation, and it may play a role in tumorigenesis. As a member of the PTTG1IP family, it is associated with the modulation of the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant in cellular signaling and cancer biology (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of PTTG1IP2 is crucial for elucidating its potential impact on human health and disease.
