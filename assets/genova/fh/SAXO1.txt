# SAXO1

## Overview
SAXO1 is a gene that encodes the protein stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 1, also known as FAM154A, which is a microtubule-stabilizing protein primarily associated with cilia and flagella. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind and stabilize microtubules, a function that is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and proper function of these organelles. SAXO1 is part of the MAP6-related protein family and is predominantly expressed in tissues with ciliated cells, such as the testis, where it plays a significant role in the axoneme of the sperm flagellum (Dacheux2015Human). The protein's structure includes Mn modules that are essential for its microtubule-binding capabilities, and it is involved in regulating cilia length, which is vital for cellular motility and signaling (Dacheux2015Human). SAXO1's interactions with microtubules and potential interactions with other cytoskeletal components underscore its importance in the complex network of proteins that support ciliary and flagellar function (Leung2022Unraveling).

## Structure
The SAXO1 protein, also known as FAM154A, is a microtubule-stabilizing protein specific to cilia and related structures. It is characterized by the presence of Mn modules, which are crucial for microtubule targeting, binding, and stabilization. SAXO1 contains 12 Mn modules, with the 12th module featuring a CPASYpsPPGy sequence specific to vertebrate SAXO proteins, indicating potential protein-protein interactions (Dacheux2015Human). The Mn modules, particularly Mn1-2 and Mn1-3, are sufficient for microtubule binding and stabilization both in vitro and in vivo, with Mn1-3 having a higher affinity for microtubules (Dacheux2015Human).

SAXO1 also has an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain shared with MAP6 proteins, which may play a role in retention at the centriole and could be involved in post-translational modifications like palmitoylation (Dacheux2015Human). The protein includes a RVxP cilia targeting motif, similar to motifs found in other axonemal proteins (Dacheux2015Human). SAXO1 is expressed in various human tissues, predominantly in the testis, and is associated with the axoneme of the sperm flagellum (Dacheux2015Human). The gene spans 122.1 kbp on chromosome 9 and consists of 12 exons, with 8 putative isoforms identified (Dacheux2015Human).

## Function
The SAXO1 gene encodes a microtubule-stabilizing protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella in human cells. SAXO1 is part of a family of MAP6-related proteins and is specifically involved in stabilizing microtubules within these organelles, which are essential for processes such as cell motility and signaling (Dacheux2015Human). The protein localizes to centrioles, basal bodies, and axonemes, where it binds to microtubules and contributes to their stability, particularly under cold conditions (Dacheux2015Human).

In healthy human cells, SAXO1 is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels in tissues containing ciliated cells, such as the testis. In mature sperm cells, SAXO1 is found along the axoneme and at the proximal centriole, suggesting a role in stabilizing the microtubule structures within the sperm flagellum (Dacheux2015Human). The protein's Mn modules are critical for its microtubule-binding and stabilizing functions, and its overexpression has been shown to increase cilia length, indicating its involvement in regulating axoneme length (Dacheux2015Human). SAXO1's function in stabilizing microtubules is essential for maintaining the proper length and function of cilia, which are vital for various cellular and physiological processes (Dacheux2015Human).

## Interactions
SAXO1, also known as FAM154A, is a microtubule-stabilizing protein that interacts with various components within cilia and related structures. SAXO1 is known to bind specifically to microtubules, particularly within the axoneme of cilia and flagella, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing these structures. This interaction is facilitated by the Mn modules within SAXO1, which are essential for its binding and stabilization functions (Dacheux2015Human).

SAXO1 interacts with tubulin dimers, binding longitudinally along individual protofilaments within the axonemal microtubules. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm flagellum (Leung2022Unraveling). SAXO1 has been shown to interact with the Mn motif of SAXO1 (Lys221) and Lys370 in the S9-S10 loop of α-tubulin, which is near the SAXO1 binding site (Leung2022Unraveling).

There is also evidence suggesting SAXO1's potential interaction with actin, as indicated by unpublished data from a yeast two-hybrid assay showing SAXO1's interaction with TbActin (Dacheux2015Human). These interactions highlight SAXO1's role in the complex network of proteins that regulate ciliary and flagellar function.
