# TMEM95

## Overview
TMEM95 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 95, a highly conserved single-pass type I transmembrane protein involved in mammalian fertilization. This protein plays a critical role in the process of sperm-oocyte fusion, facilitating the penetration of sperm through the zona pellucida and subsequent binding to the oolemma. TMEM95 is characterized by its Pfam:IZUMO domain and leucine-rich repeat C-terminal domain (LRRCT), which are implicated in signal transduction and cell adhesion. Despite its essential function in fertilization, TMEM95 does not interact with the well-known fertilization proteins JUNO or IZUMO1, suggesting it may operate through an IZUMO1-independent pathway or downstream of the IZUMO1-JUNO interaction (HernándezFalcó2022The). The protein's dynamic relocation within sperm cells during the acrosome reaction underscores its importance in the later stages of fertilization (HernándezFalcó2022The). While TMEM95 shares structural features with other gamete fusion-associated proteins, its precise molecular interactions and mechanisms remain subjects of ongoing research (Vance2022SPACA6).

## Structure
The TMEM95 protein is a highly conserved single-pass type I transmembrane protein consisting of 176 amino acids. It contains a Pfam:IZUMO domain and a leucine-rich repeat C-terminal domain (LRRCT), which are involved in various biological functions such as signal transduction and cell adhesion (HernándezFalcó2022The). The protein sequence of TMEM95 is conserved among mammals, including humans, indicating its evolutionary importance (HernándezFalcó2022The).

In terms of structural features, TMEM95 is characterized by its transmembrane domain, which suggests its role in cellular membrane processes. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which may affect its function and localization (Shireesha2021Bioinformatic). In cattle, six exons are predicted for the TMEM95 gene, but in buffalo, a 2 bp deletion results in only three isoforms (X2, X5, and X6) being possible, with variations in transmembrane topology and signal peptide presence (Shireesha2021Bioinformatic).

TMEM95 relocates from the outer acrosomal membrane to the equatorial segment in mature mammalian sperm after the acrosome reaction, indicating its dynamic role during fertilization (HernándezFalcó2022The). Despite its critical role, the exact molecular interactions and structure of TMEM95 remain unclear (HernándezFalcó2022The).

## Function
TMEM95 is a highly conserved transmembrane protein involved in mammalian fertilization, playing a crucial role in sperm-oocyte fusion. In healthy human cells, TMEM95 is essential for the fusion process, as its deficiency can lead to male subfertility. The protein allows sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the oolemma but is necessary for the subsequent fusion with oocytes, indicating its critical role in this process (HernándezFalcó2022The).

TMEM95 is a single-pass type I transmembrane protein consisting of 176 amino acids, involved in signal transduction and cell adhesion. It contains a predicted Pfam:IZUMO domain and a leucine-rich repeat C-terminal domain (LRRCT), suggesting its involvement in complex molecular interactions during fertilization (HernándezFalcó2022The). Despite its importance, TMEM95 does not interact with the proteins JUNO or IZUMO1, indicating it may function through an IZUMO1-independent pathway or act downstream of the IZUMO1 and JUNO interaction (HernándezFalcó2022The).

In mature sperm, TMEM95 relocates from the outer acrosomal membrane to the equatorial segment after the acrosome reaction, highlighting its role in the later stages of fertilization (HernándezFalcó2022The). Its precise molecular activities and interactions in human cells remain an area of ongoing research.

## Interactions
TMEM95 is a crucial protein involved in mammalian fertilization, particularly in the process of sperm-oocyte fusion. Although TMEM95 does not directly interact with the proteins JUNO or IZUMO1, which are also involved in fertilization, it may function cooperatively with other proteins such as SPACA6, SOF1, and FIMP. These interactions suggest that TMEM95 could regulate membrane fusion through an IZUMO1-independent pathway (HernándezFalcó2022The). 

Research has identified 41 sperm proteins that potentially interact with TMEM95, although none of these proteins were previously known to play a role in fertilization. This suggests that TMEM95 may have an independent role in the fertilization process (L2022The). Despite the identification of these proteins, the reliability of these interactions requires further validation, as key proteins like IZUMO1 were not found in the list of interacting proteins (L2022The).

TMEM95 is part of a conserved superfamily of gamete fusion-associated proteins, sharing structural features with SPACA6 and IZUMO1, such as the 4HB domain and specific disulfide bonding patterns. These structural similarities highlight its importance in gamete fusion, although specific protein interactions remain to be fully elucidated (Vance2022SPACA6).
