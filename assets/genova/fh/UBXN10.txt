# UBXN10

## Overview
UBXN10 is a gene that encodes the UBX domain protein 10, a crucial adaptor protein involved in the process of ciliogenesis, which is the formation and maintenance of cilia in cells. The protein UBX domain protein 10 is characterized by its interaction with the intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) complex, playing a pivotal role in the anterograde transport necessary for ciliary function. It operates within the VCP-UBXD network, facilitating the recruitment of valosin-containing protein (VCP) to the IFT-B complex through its association with CLUAP1, thereby maintaining cilia structure and function (Raman2015Systematic). UBXN10's involvement in ciliary protein transport and its essential role in ciliogenesis underscore its significance in cellular processes and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and ciliopathies (Yang2024Exploring; Raman2015Systematic).

## Function
UBXN10 (UBX domain protein 10) is a protein that plays a significant role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation and maintenance in cells. It functions as an adaptor protein within the VCP-UBXD network, interacting specifically with the intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) complex, which is essential for anterograde transport into cilia (Raman2015Systematic). UBXN10 facilitates the recruitment of VCP (valosin-containing protein) to the IFT-B complex via CLUAP1, which is crucial for maintaining cilia structure and function (Raman2015Systematic). 

In healthy human cells, UBXN10 localizes to cilia in a VCP-dependent manner and is essential for ciliogenesis, as both VCP and UBXN10 are required for this process (Raman2015Systematic). Depletion of UBXN10 results in a significant reduction in the number of cilia, indicating its crucial role in ciliary maintenance (Raman2015Systematic). The protein traffics within cilia in a bi-directional manner, similar to IFT88, and co-traffics with IFT-B, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of ciliary protein transport (Raman2015Systematic). UBXN10's function is closely linked to VCP activity, as inhibition of VCP leads to destabilization of the IFT-B complex and affects ciliary function (Raman2015Systematic).

## Clinical Significance
UBXN10 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, UBXN10 expression is downregulated in most tumors, except for kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) and breast cancer (BRCA), suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Yang2024Exploring). In colon adenocarcinoma, UBXN10 has been shown to inhibit tumor growth by modulating the miR-515-5p/SLIT3 axis, indicating its potential as a tumor suppressor (Yang2024Exploring). The expression of UBXN10 is inversely correlated with the IC50 of cancer cell lines, suggesting a role in drug sensitivity and potential implications for pharmacological therapy (Yang2024Exploring).

UBXN10 is also crucial for ciliogenesis, as it interacts with the intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) complex. Disruption of UBXN10 leads to defects in ciliary function, which can result in developmental abnormalities or diseases related to ciliary dysfunction (Raman2015Systematic). The depletion of UBXN10 in zebrafish embryos causes defects in left-right asymmetry, highlighting its importance in cilia-related processes (Raman2015Systematic). These findings suggest that alterations in UBXN10 expression or function could have significant clinical implications in both cancer and ciliopathies.

## Interactions
UBXN10 is a protein that interacts specifically with the Intraflagellar Transport B (IFT-B) complex, a crucial component in cilia formation. It acts as a 'UBX-domain only' adaptor, associating with several IFT-B subunits, including IFT88, IFT74, and TTC26. This interaction was confirmed through proteomic analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that UBXN10 associates with 14 out of 15 IFT-B subunits in an in vitro translation system (Raman2015Systematic). UBXN10 also binds specifically to the CLUAP1 subunit of IFT-B, facilitating the recruitment of VCP to IFT-B via CLUAP1. This interaction is essential for the localization of UBXN10 to cilia, which is dependent on its interaction with VCP (Raman2015Systematic).

The study by Raman et al. further highlights that UBXN10 is part of a complex with CLUAP1, and its interaction with VCP is crucial for the stability and activity of the IFT-B complex. Inhibition of VCP affects the composition of IFT-B complexes, leading to a reduction in certain IFT-B subunits and impacting ciliary trafficking (Raman2015Systematic). These interactions underscore UBXN10's role in ciliogenesis and its specific interactions within the IFT-B complex.
