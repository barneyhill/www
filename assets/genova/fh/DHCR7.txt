# DHCR7

## Overview
The DHCR7 gene encodes the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, a crucial component of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a membrane-bound reductase and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It facilitates the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, a vital process for maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Cholesterol is an essential structural component of cell membranes and serves as a precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids. The regulation of DHCR7 activity is critical for balancing cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis, as cholesterol levels can influence the enzyme's degradation and activity. Mutations in the DHCR7 gene are linked to Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies due to impaired cholesterol synthesis and the accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol (Prabhu2016Cholesterol-mediated; Fitzky1998Mutations).

## Structure
The DHCR7 protein, encoded by the DHCR7 gene, is a membrane-bound enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum, playing a crucial role in cholesterol biosynthesis. The primary structure of DHCR7 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function. Although the complete three-dimensional structure of DHCR7 has not been fully resolved, models suggest that it contains multiple transmembrane domains, which are significant for its function and stability (Prabhu2016Cholesterol-mediated; Boland2016Investigation).

The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of membrane proteins, contributing to its ability to span the lipid bilayer. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a specific three-dimensional shape, essential for its enzymatic activity. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins or itself, although specific details are not provided in the available literature.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence DHCR7's activity and stability, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. The existence of splice variant isoforms could result in different functional properties, but specific isoforms are not mentioned in the sources (Fitzky20017Dehydrocholesterol–dependent; Prabhu2016Cholesterol-mediated).

## Function
The DHCR7 gene encodes the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, which plays a critical role in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway by catalyzing the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) to cholesterol. This conversion is essential for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in human cells, as cholesterol is a vital component of cell membranes and a precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids (Prabhu2016Cholesterol-mediated; Chen2023Integrated). The enzyme is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where cholesterol synthesis occurs (Peng2018Computational).

In healthy human cells, DHCR7 activity is tightly regulated to balance cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis. Cholesterol itself can accelerate the proteasomal degradation of DHCR7, reducing its protein levels and activity, which shifts the metabolic balance towards increased vitamin D production when 7DHC accumulates (Prabhu2016Cholesterol-mediated). This regulation is crucial for maintaining adequate levels of both cholesterol and vitamin D, which are important for various physiological processes, including calcium homeostasis and skeletal health (Prabhu2016Cholesterol-mediated).

Mutations in DHCR7 can lead to Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), characterized by intellectual disability and multiple malformations due to disrupted cholesterol synthesis and potential toxic buildup of 7DHC (Peng2018Computational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DHCR7 gene, which encodes the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, are responsible for Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), an autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in cholesterol synthesis, leading to an accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol and a range of clinical symptoms, including intellectual disability, dysmorphic facial features, and multiple congenital malformations (Bianconi2015Pathogenesis; Fitzky1998Mutations). The severity of SLOS varies widely, with some individuals experiencing severe congenital malformations and others having milder symptoms such as minor physical anomalies and behavioral issues (Bianconi2015Pathogenesis).

Over 150 mutations in the DHCR7 gene have been identified, including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations, as well as deletions that lead to frameshifts (Peng2018Computational; Fitzky1998Mutations). The most common mutation in the United States is the c.964-1G>C splice acceptor mutation, which accounts for about a third of the mutant alleles in SLOS patients (Bianconi2015Pathogenesis). The phenotype-genotype correlation in SLOS is generally poor, with modifier genes such as maternal ApoE and ABCA1 potentially influencing the severity of the condition (Bianconi2015Pathogenesis; Lanthaler2014Genotypebased).
