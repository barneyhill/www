# PCNX1

## Overview
PCNX1 is a gene that encodes the pecanex 1 protein, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. The pecanex 1 protein is characterized by its role in cellular signaling pathways, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Research has suggested that pecanex 1 may play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, potentially impacting developmental processes and disease states. The gene's expression and mutations have been studied in the context of cancer, particularly breast cancer, where alterations in PCNX1 have been associated with chemotherapy resistance and clinical outcomes (Al2020Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PCNX1 gene have been implicated in breast cancer, particularly in the context of chemotherapy resistance. Studies have identified somatic variants in PCNX1, including frame-shift deletions, in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). These mutations were observed in post-NAC samples but not in pre-NAC samples, suggesting a potential role in chemotherapy resistance. The frame-shifts are predicted to cause premature termination of the protein, possibly leading to nonsense-mediated decay and loss of gene function (Al2020Genomic).

In experimental models, reduced expression of PCNX1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells was associated with increased resistance to the chemotherapy drug epirubicin. This resistance was linked to elevated levels of the xenobiotic pump ABCG2, which is known to mediate chemoresistance by exporting drugs out of cells (Al2020Genomic). Although PCNX1 expression alone did not show significant relationships with survival, trends suggested that low expression might be associated with relative resistance and poor survival outcomes in certain breast cancer subgroups (Al2020Genomic). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of PCNX1 in predicting chemotherapy response and survival in breast cancer patients.
