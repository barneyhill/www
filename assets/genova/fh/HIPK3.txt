# HIPK3

## Overview
HIPK3, or homeodomain interacting protein kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and cell proliferation. The protein product of HIPK3, also known as homeodomain interacting protein kinase 3, is characterized by a highly conserved kinase domain and is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it forms subnuclear structures. This kinase is integral to the modulation of Wnt signaling pathways, influencing key components such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and β-catenin, which are crucial for transcriptional activity and pancreas development (Shojima2012Depletion). HIPK3 also plays a role in maintaining normal insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, and it has been implicated in cancer biology, where it exhibits tumor-suppressive properties in certain contexts (Xiao2021Identification). The gene's expression, particularly its circular RNA form circHIPK3, is associated with various diseases, including cancers and rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting its significance in disease pathogenesis (Jiang2023DNA; Lu2019Circular).

## Structure
HIPK3 is a serine/threonine kinase with a highly conserved kinase domain, sharing about 90% identical amino acids with other homeodomain-interacting protein kinases (HIPKs) (van2015Effect). The protein's architecture includes a smaller N-terminal region with a conserved sumoylation site and a large C-terminal domain. This C-terminal domain contains a homeobox interaction domain, an autoinhibitory domain, a PEST region rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine residues, and a C-terminus rich in serine, glutamine, and alanine repeats, also known as the SQA or YH-rich region (van2015Effect).

HIPK3 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it forms subnuclear structures known as HIPK domains, appearing in a punctate pattern. This distribution is dependent on a functional SUMO interaction motif (van2015Effect). HIPK3 undergoes autophosphorylation on a conserved tyrosine residue in the activation loop, which is crucial for its catalytic activity and subcellular localization (van2015Effect). The protein is involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, similar to other HIPK family members (Ritter2019Differential). Despite these insights, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of HIPK3, as well as its splice variant isoforms, are not detailed in the available literature (Ritter2019Differential; van2015Effect).

## Function
HIPK3 (homeodomain interacting protein kinase 3) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and cell proliferation. In healthy human cells, HIPK3 is involved in modulating Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for transcriptional activity and pancreas development (Shojima2012Depletion). It influences the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and the abundance of β-catenin, which are key components of the Wnt signaling pathway (Shojima2012Depletion).

HIPK3 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it interacts with homeodomain transcription factors to modulate gene expression. This interaction is essential for maintaining normal insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, as evidenced by its role in regulating the expression of genes such as Pdx1, Gck, and Slc2a2, which are involved in glucose sensing and insulin secretion (Shojima2012Depletion). The protein's activity is also linked to the regulation of beta cell proliferation and apoptosis, processes critical for maintaining proper insulin levels and glucose tolerance (Shojima2012Depletion).

In the context of cancer, HIPK3 has been shown to have tumor-suppressive properties, as its expression is downregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where it inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Xiao2021Identification). This suggests that HIPK3 may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HIPK3 gene, particularly its circular RNA form circHIPK3, have been implicated in various diseases, notably cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), circHIPK3 is significantly upregulated, promoting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis by sponging miR-149, which contributes to cancer progression (Lu2019Circular). In colorectal cancer, circHIPK3 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis, influencing cancer progression through the c-Myb/circHIPK3/miR-7 axis (Wen2020Circular). In gastric cancer, circHIPK3 is upregulated and linked to aggressive clinical features, promoting cell proliferation and migration via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Wen2020Circular).

In bladder cancer, circHIPK3 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation associated with cancer progression (Wen2020Circular). In osteosarcoma, circHIPK3 expression shows contradictory roles, being both upregulated and downregulated in different studies, affecting cancer malignancy through various miRNA interactions (Wei2022Understanding). In rheumatoid arthritis, HIPK3 methylation levels are downregulated, correlating with inflammation markers, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic indicator (Jiang2023DNA). These findings highlight the complex role of HIPK3 in disease pathogenesis, influenced by its expression levels and interactions with microRNAs.

## Interactions
HIPK3 interacts with several components of the CCR4-NOT complex, a key player in mRNA decay and transcriptional regulation. It binds to CNOT2, a shared substrate for HIPK family kinases, and phosphorylates it at specific serine residues. This interaction occurs in cytoplasmic foci distinct from known structures like stress granules or processing bodies (RodriguezGil2016HIPK). HIPK3 also associates with other subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex, such as CNOT6 and CNOT6L, indicating its involvement with the entire complex (RodriguezGil2016HIPK).

HIPK3 forms high molecular weight complexes in cells, suggesting stable interactions with other proteins. It is found in complexes with DCAF7 and can interact with other HIPK family members, such as HIPK1 and HIPK2, although these interactions are more prominent when the proteins are overexpressed (Ritter2019Differential).

HIPK3 is also involved in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. It interacts with the insulin promoter, as shown by ChIP assays, and regulates transcriptional activity related to insulin secretion (Shojima2012Depletion).
