# HEBP2

## Overview
HEBP2 is a gene that encodes the heme-binding protein 2, a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to apoptosis and mitochondrial function. Despite its name, heme-binding protein 2 does not bind heme in the same manner as its homolog HEBP1, due to structural differences that prevent typical heme interaction (Goodfellow2021The). Instead, the protein is implicated in enhancing calcium-triggered mitochondrial permeability transition, which can lead to oxidative stress-dependent cell death (Goodfellow2021The). HEBP2 contains a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain, which is associated with pro-apoptotic functions, although its interaction with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL is atypical (Goodfellow2021The). Additionally, HEBP2 plays a role in intracellular trafficking and microtubule network organization, particularly in mitotic cells, through its interaction with the calcium-binding protein PDCD6 (Goodfellow2021The). The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in cancer progression, with increased expression observed in certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Qin2017Deregulated).

## Structure
The human heme-binding protein 2 (hHEBP2) is characterized by a predominantly hydrophobic central core flanked by two alpha-helices. The central core consists of a distorted beta-barrel, composed of an eight-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, which suggests a complex tertiary structure with a pseudo two-fold symmetry axis along the hHEBP2 monomer. This symmetry defines two subdomains: the b1-b2-a1-b3-b4 sub-domain (residues 39 to 110) and the b5-b6-a3-b7-b8 sub-domain (residues 127 to 195) (Goodfellow2021The).

The protein includes a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain between residues Leu158 and Asp172, which is involved in interactions with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. However, the BH3 domain in hHEBP2 is not a pure alpha-helix, as it includes a terminal loop (Goodfellow2021The). The crystal structure of hHEBP2 shows high structural similarity to mHEBP1, with significant differences primarily in specific loops (Goodfellow2021The).

Despite its classification as a heme-binding protein, hHEBP2 does not bind heme in the same manner as other family members, due to steric hindrance from specific residues such as F66 and N70 (Goodfellow2021The). The electrostatic surface potential of hHEBP2 reveals a more negative surface near the equivalent heme-binding helix compared to mHEBP1 (Goodfellow2021The).

## Function
HEBP2, also known as heme-binding protein 2, is involved in several cellular processes, particularly related to cell death and mitochondrial function. Although initially thought to bind heme, recent studies suggest that HEBP2 does not function as a heme-binding protein in the same way as its homolog HEBP1 (Goodfellow2021The). Instead, HEBP2 is implicated in enhancing calcium-triggered mitochondrial permeability transition, which can lead to oxidative stress-dependent cell death (Goodfellow2021The). This process involves the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, a critical event in the regulation of apoptosis.

HEBP2 contains a BH3 domain, which is associated with pro-apoptotic functions, and interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, although this interaction is not typical of genuine BH3 domains (Goodfellow2021The). The protein is also involved in intracellular trafficking and the organization of the microtubule network in mitotic cells, particularly in a calcium-dependent manner, through its interaction with the calcium-binding protein PDCD6 (Goodfellow2021The). HEBP2's role in these processes suggests its involvement in cellular homeostasis and apoptosis, impacting cell fate and survival.

## Clinical Significance
HEBP2 (heme binding protein 2) has been implicated in the development and progression of certain cancers, particularly breast and lung cancers. Studies have shown that both the gene copy number and mRNA levels of HEBP2 are significantly increased in these cancers, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Qin2017Deregulated). The interaction between HEBP2 and ALG-2, a calcium-binding protein, is crucial for maintaining proper microtubule dynamics and mitotic spindle behavior. Disruptions in this interaction can lead to impaired spindle orientation and positioning during mitosis, contributing to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer cells (Qin2017Deregulated).

Mutations that disrupt the interaction between HEBP2 and ALG-2 result in altered subcellular distribution of HEBP2, leading to a more diffuse distribution, which may affect its function in cancer cells (Qin2017Deregulated). The deregulated ALG-2/HEBP2 axis has been shown to alter microtubule dynamics, with specific mutations in ALG-2 affecting microtubule reassembly and stability, further implicating HEBP2 in cancer development (Qin2017Deregulated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HEBP2 in cancer and suggest potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

## Interactions
HEBP2 (heme binding protein 2) is known to interact with several proteins, notably the apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2), also known as PDCD6. This interaction is significant in intracellular trafficking of vesicles and is deregulated in some cancer cells. The PDCD6-HEBP2 complex plays a role in redistributing PDCD6 in the cytoplasm and organizing the microtubule network in a calcium-dependent manner in mitotic cells. This interaction does not involve the BH3 domain of HEBP2 (Goodfellow2021The).

In the context of HIV-1 production, HEBP2 interacts with ALG-2, inducing conformational changes in both proteins. The interaction results in a more compact conformation of the ALG-2 dimer, reducing the crevice between the two monomers. This interaction is specific to HEBP2, as the ALG-2 dimer shows a more open conformation when complexed with the ALIX peptide. HEBP2 affects the subcellular localization of ALG-2, tethering it to the cytoplasm and reducing its nuclear presence (Ma2016Structural).

HEBP2 is also involved in the endosomal-exosomal pathways, particularly in the HIV-1 exit process from its cellular host. PDCD6 acts as an inhibitor of HIV-1 replication, and HEBP2 binding further impairs HIV-1 production (Goodfellow2021The). The interaction between HEBP2 and ALG-2 is calcium-dependent and can be disrupted by EGTA, involving specific residues such as Phe 100 in HEBP2 and Trp 57 in ALG-2 (Ma2016Structural).
