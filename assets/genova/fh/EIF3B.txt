# EIF3B

## Overview
The EIF3B gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit B (eIF3b), a core component of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which is pivotal in the initiation of protein synthesis. The eIF3b protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a β-propeller structure formed by WD40 repeats, which facilitate interactions with ribosomal proteins and RNA, thereby stabilizing pre-initiation complexes and aiding in mRNA recruitment (Llácer2018eIF3b; Valášek2017Embraced). As part of the eIF3 complex, eIF3b plays a crucial role in the assembly of the 48S pre-initiation complex, ensuring proper start codon recognition and maintaining the fidelity of translation initiation (Llácer2018eIF3b). The gene's expression is implicated in various cancers, where it influences cell proliferation and survival, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Chai2019Systematically; Wu2022Establishing).

## Structure
The EIF3B protein is a core component of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis. The structure of EIF3B includes several domains, such as the RNA recognition motif (RRM), WD40 repeats forming a β-propeller, and a C-terminal extended α-helix (Llácer2018eIF3b; Valášek2017Embraced). The RRM domain is involved in interactions with other initiation factors, such as eIF1, and plays a role in AUG start codon recognition and GTP hydrolysis (Valášek2017Embraced). The β-propeller structure, characterized by 9 WD40 repeats, interacts with ribosomal proteins and RNA, contributing to the stabilization of pre-initiation complexes and mRNA recruitment (Llácer2018eIF3b; Valášek2017Embraced).

The quaternary structure of EIF3B involves its integration into the eIF3 complex, where it forms part of a stable eIF3b-g-i module, interacting with other subunits like eIF3a, eIF3g, and eIF3i (Valášek2017Embraced). This module is crucial for the assembly and function of the eIF3 complex, which is essential for translation initiation (Valášek2017Embraced). The specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of EIF3B are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
EIF3B is a core component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis in human cells. It is essential for the assembly of the 48S pre-initiation complex (PIC) during translation initiation, where it stabilizes the assembly of the PICs and facilitates mRNA recruitment (Valášek2017Embraced). EIF3B, along with eIF3a, forms the nucleation core of the eIF3 complex, which is necessary for the structural integrity and function of the complex (Valášek2017Embraced). 

The eIF3b subunit interacts with other components of the translation machinery, such as eIF1, eIF2, and the 18S rRNA, to ensure proper recognition of the start codon during mRNA scanning (Valášek2017Embraced). It also plays a role in modulating start codon selection by interacting with the ribosomal subunit interface, which is crucial for maintaining the fidelity of translation initiation (Llácer2018eIF3b). 

EIF3B is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell growth and proliferation by regulating protein translation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF3B gene have been implicated in various cancers, including melanoma, colon cancer, and gliomas. In melanoma, high expression levels of EIF3B are associated with poor prognosis and reduced immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in immune evasion and cancer progression (Wu2022Establishing). Silencing EIF3B in melanoma cell lines has been shown to impair cell proliferation and migration, indicating its importance in sustaining melanoma growth and aggressiveness (Gandolfi2016The).

In colon cancer, EIF3B is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. RNA interference-mediated silencing of EIF3B in colon cancer cells results in decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and altered cell cycle distribution, highlighting its role in tumor growth (Wang2012RNA).

EIF3B is also overexpressed in gliomas, where its expression correlates with tumor grade and poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Chai2019Systematically). The gene's involvement in protein synthesis and cell cycle regulation underscores its significance in cancer development and progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
EIF3B, a core component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, plays a crucial role in translation initiation through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. EIF3B is part of a trimeric module with eIF3g and eIF3i, which is attached to the eIF3a C-terminal domain (CTD). This module is positioned near the mRNA entry channel and is involved in modulating mRNA scanning and AUG recognition (Valášek2017Embraced). EIF3B interacts with ribosomal proteins and RNA elements, including RPS9/uS4 and 18S rRNA, and forms contacts with eIF1 and eIF2γ, which are crucial for the initiation process (Valášek2017Embraced).

The β-propeller of EIF3B, formed by 9 WD40 repeats, interacts with eIF2γ and is positioned near the mRNA entry channel (Llácer2018eIF3b). The RNA recognition motif (RRM) of EIF3B interacts with eIF1 and the eIF3c N-terminal domain, playing a role in stabilizing the pre-initiation complex (PIC) and facilitating mRNA recruitment (Llácer2018eIF3b). These interactions are essential for maintaining the fidelity of start codon selection and the transition between open and closed conformations of the PIC (Llácer2018eIF3b). The interactions of EIF3B with rRNA and other initiation factors are critical for its function in translation initiation (Llácer2018eIF3b).
