# PIK3CG

## Overview
The PIK3CG gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit gamma (p110γ), a member of the Class IB phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). This kinase plays a pivotal role in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and survival (Bilanges2019PI3K; Roskoski2021Properties). The p110γ protein is predominantly expressed in immune cells, where it regulates functions such as chemotaxis, inflammation, and immune cell activation (Marini2020Germline; Fruman2017The). Its activity is modulated through interactions with regulatory subunits and post-translational modifications, which influence its role in signaling pathways (Jean2014Classes; Roskoski2021Properties). Given its involvement in critical physiological and pathological processes, PIK3CG is a significant focus of research in areas such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and immune disorders (Silva2018Canonical; Schmid2011Receptor).

## Structure
The PIK3CG gene encodes the catalytic subunit gamma (p110γ) of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is a Class IB PI3K. The primary structure of p110γ includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains such as the Ras-binding domain (RBD), C2 domain, helical domain, and the kinase domain (Brown2011Phylogenomics; Roskoski2021Properties). The kinase domain spans residues 828-1073, with a P-loop at 804-809 and a gatekeeper residue at I879 (Roskoski2021Properties).

The secondary structure of p110γ features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these elements, allowing the protein to interact with other molecules and the plasma membrane. The quaternary structure of p110γ involves its interaction with regulatory subunits, such as p101 or p87, forming a heterodimeric complex (Jean2014Classes; Roskoski2021Properties).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating the activity of p110γ. These modifications can influence the protein's interaction with other signaling molecules and its activation state (Roskoski2021Properties). The structural features of p110γ are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Bilanges2019PI3K).

## Function
The PIK3CG gene encodes the p110γ catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ), which plays a crucial role in immune cell function, particularly in leukocytes. PI3Kγ is involved in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival. It is highly expressed in myeloid cells and is essential for macrophage functions such as actin-cytoskeleton remodeling, cell polarization, and phagocytosis (Marini2020Germline). In T cells, PI3Kγ is critical for T-cell activation and proliferation, with its deficiency leading to impaired TCR-dependent activation, which can be restored with wild-type p110γ (Marini2020Germline).

PI3Kγ is activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, where it facilitates chemokine receptor responses crucial for leukocyte trafficking to inflamed tissues (Takeda2019Human). It also plays a role in thymocyte development and T cell activation, linking GPCRs to cell migration and superoxide formation in neutrophils (Sasaki2000Function). PI3Kγ's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, influencing processes like chemotaxis and inflammation (Fruman2017The). Its deficiency can lead to immune dysregulation and inflammation, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Takeda2019Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PIK3CG gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of cancer, PIK3CG is associated with tumor inflammation and progression. It is activated in myeloid cells by receptor tyrosine kinases, Toll-like/IL1 receptors, and G protein-coupled receptors, promoting myeloid cell recruitment to tumors and contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. Targeting PIK3CG could suppress tumor inflammation and malignancy (Schmid2011Receptor). In claudin-low breast cancer, PIK3CG expression is higher and correlates with worse survival rates. Inhibiting PIK3CG in combination with paclitaxel has shown potential in enhancing treatment efficacy by inhibiting cancer cell growth and migration (p&gt; Chang2020&lt; Targeting).

In cardiovascular diseases, PIK3CG plays a role in chagasic myocarditis, where its signaling in myeloid cells is crucial for controlling Trypanosoma cruzi infection and preventing heart damage. Alterations in PIK3CG interactions are significant in the immune response and pathogenesis of this condition (Silva2018Canonical). In prostate cancer, PIK3CG is upregulated in metastatic cases resistant to androgen receptor inhibition, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chung2020PIK3CG).

In neurological disorders, PIK3CG polymorphisms are associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), affecting neurotransmitter dynamics and contributing to symptoms like inattention and hyperactivity (Gu2018Association).

## Interactions
PIK3CG, also known as phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its activity and function. It interacts with G-protein beta-gamma subunits, which are crucial for its activation in response to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (Nürnberg2019Function). PIK3CG forms a heterodimer with regulatory subunits such as p101 (PIK3R5) and p87 (PIK3R6), which enhance its response to Gβγ stimulation (Nürnberg2019Function).

PKCβ phosphorylates PIK3CG at Ser582, a modification that disrupts its interaction with the p84 adapter subunit, thereby decoupling it from GPCR inputs and allowing it to function independently (Walser2013PKCβ). This phosphorylation event is crucial for mast cell degranulation and other cellular processes (Walser2013PKCβ).

In cardiac cells, PIK3CG interacts with protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), forming a multiprotein complex that integrates cAMP and PIP3 signaling pathways. This interaction is essential for regulating myocardial contractility and involves PIK3CG acting as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) (Perino2011Integrating). PIK3CG's interaction with PKA is mediated by specific residues and is crucial for modulating PDE3B activity (Perino2011Integrating).
