# OR4F17

## Overview
OR4F17 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily F member 17, which is part of the extensive family of olfactory receptors. These receptors are categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), known for their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in detecting odor molecules. The OR4F17 protein is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it contributes to the sense of smell by binding specific odorant molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway. This receptor's function is influenced by post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which affect its stability and activity. Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4F17 has been associated with various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, indicating its potential involvement in broader biological processes (Kalra2020Analysis; GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

## Structure
OR4F17 is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in odor detection. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a hallmark of GPCRs. The primary structure of OR4F17 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor. The secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha helices, which span the cell membrane and are crucial for the receptor's ability to detect odor molecules.

The tertiary structure of OR4F17 involves the three-dimensional folding of these alpha helices, allowing the receptor to maintain its functional conformation and interact with odorant molecules effectively. Quaternary structure is generally not applicable to OR4F17, as these receptors typically function as monomers.

Common post-translational modifications of OR4F17 may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence the receptor's stability, localization, and activity. These modifications are typical for olfactory receptors and play a role in their proper function within the olfactory system. There is no information provided on splice variant isoforms for OR4F17.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR4F17 gene is primarily associated with its expression in cancer and neurological conditions. In cancer, particularly breast carcinoma, OR4F17 expression has been linked to metastasis signatures, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Kalra2020Analysis). This correlation indicates that OR4F17 may be involved in pathways that influence cancer cell behavior, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

In the context of neurological disorders, OR4F17 is noted for its downregulation in the frontal cortex of individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This downregulation occurs in both premotor and parkinsonian stages, highlighting a potential link between olfactory dysfunction and PD (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional). The study suggests that the dysregulation of OR4F17, along with other olfactory receptors, may contribute to the olfactory deficits commonly observed in PD patients, although the specific clinical implications of OR4F17 mutations or expression changes in PD are not fully detailed.

Overall, while OR4F17 is implicated in cancer and PD, the precise clinical outcomes of its mutations or altered expression require further investigation to establish definitive roles in these conditions.
