# CLDN15

## Overview
CLDN15 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein claudin 15, which is a critical component of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudin 15 is characterized by its four transmembrane helices and is involved in forming paracellular channels that are highly selective for cations, particularly sodium ions. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity and function of tight junctions, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, where it regulates paracellular ion permeability and contributes to sodium homeostasis. The structural features of claudin 15, including its extracellular loops and beta-sheet formations, are essential for its ion selectivity and permeability properties. CLDN15's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, such as cancer, highlight its importance in cellular communication and immune regulation (Lu2013Claudins; Krause2015Assembly; Alghamdi2023Identification).

## Structure
Claudin 15 (CLDN15) is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in forming tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. The protein is characterized by its four transmembrane helices, which form a left-handed four-helix bundle with a rhombic clockwise arrangement (Krause2015Assembly). It features two extracellular loops, ECL1 and ECL2, which are essential for its function. ECL1 is involved in regulating paracellular tightening and permeation, while ECL2 participates in intermolecular interactions (Krause2015Assembly).

The crystal structure of CLDN15 reveals a beta-sheet structure in ECL1, formed by four beta strands, which is crucial for its ion selectivity and permeability properties (Krause2015Assembly). The protein's quaternary structure includes the assembly of monomers into an antiparallel double row within a single membrane, forming a half-pipe structure through extracellular β-sheets maintained by hydrogen bonds (McGuinness2023Molecular).

CLDN15 is known for its role in forming paracellular channels that are highly selective for cations, particularly sodium (Na+), due to the presence of negatively charged residues like D55, which line the pore and create an electric potential that facilitates cation flux (Alberini2018Molecular).

## Function
Claudin-15 (CLDN15) is a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and function of tight junctions in epithelial cells, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. It is predominantly expressed in the proximal parts of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the duodenum and jejunum, and is localized at the apical membranes of epithelial cells (Lu2013Claudins). CLDN15 is involved in regulating paracellular ion permeability, acting as a cation-selective channel that facilitates the passage of sodium (Na+) ions through the paracellular pathway (McGuinness2023Molecular; Lu2013Claudins).

In the small intestine, CLDN15 is essential for maintaining sodium homeostasis, which is crucial for Na+-dependent glucose uptake. Its absence leads to significant alterations in luminal Na+ and potassium (K+) concentrations, affecting glucose absorption (Tamura2011Loss). CLDN15 also plays a role in maintaining the transepithelial electrical resistance and paracellular ion flow, contributing to the overall barrier function of the intestinal epithelium (McGuinness2023Molecular; Lu2013Claudins).

The protein's function extends to the cecum and large intestine, where it is crucial for Na+ permeability and absorption, highlighting its role in maintaining ion transport and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (Hempstock2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CLDN15 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the gastrointestinal tract, CLDN15 plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal structure and function. CLDN15 knockout mice exhibit a condition known as mega-intestine, highlighting its importance in intestinal homeostasis and structure (Zeisel2018Tight). Additionally, a double knockout of CLDN15 with CLDN2 results in reduced paracellular sodium flow, leading to nutrient absorption issues, malnourishment, and death, indicating its role in regulating sodium transport (Zeisel2018Tight).

In the context of cancer, CLDN15 has been identified as a diagnostic marker for malignant pleural mesothelioma and is associated with various cancer-related processes, including immune regulation and cellular communication (Alghamdi2023Identification). In colon adenocarcinoma, CLDN15 is downregulated, and its expression is negatively correlated with immune checkpoint genes and various immune cells, suggesting its involvement in immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment (Alghamdi2023Identification). These findings underscore the potential of CLDN15 as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, particularly in colorectal cancer (Alghamdi2023Identification).

## Interactions
Claudin 15 (CLDN15) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in tight junctions. CLDN15 can form linear homooligomers, which are essential for its role in tight junction strand formation (Liu2016Systems). It interacts with the protein GEM, which is part of its interaction network (Rouka2017Transcriptomic). The assembly of CLDN15 into tight junctions is thought to depend on claudin-claudin interactions, including both cis-oligomerization and trans-interactions. A model based on CLDN15 crystal structures suggests an antiparallel double row cis-arrangement of CLDN15 protomers, involving specific interactions between extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and a short extracellular helix (ECH) of ECL1, as well as interactions between the edges of β-sheets in ECL1 (Krause2015Assembly).

In the context of cancer, CLDN15 is part of a protein-protein interaction network in colon cancer, interacting with other claudins such as CLDN1, CLDN11, CLDN9, and CLDN17 (Alghamdi2023Identification). These interactions highlight the role of CLDN15 in maintaining the integrity and function of tight junctions, as well as its potential involvement in disease processes.
