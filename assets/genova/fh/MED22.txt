# MED22

## Overview
MED22 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 22, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The MED22 protein is categorized as part of the head module of the Mediator complex, where it plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the transcription initiation complex. This stabilization is essential for the assembly of the pre-initiation complex on RNA polymerase II promoters, thereby influencing the transcription of numerous genes (Seizl2011Mediator). The MED22 protein forms a stable heterodimer with MED11, contributing to the structural integrity of the Mediator complex through a conserved four-helix bundle. This interaction is crucial for effective transcription initiation and is conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Seizl2011Mediator; Zhao2021Structure). In addition to its fundamental role in transcription regulation, MED22 has clinical significance, particularly in kidney function, where its deficiency can lead to severe renal conditions (Rodriguez2020Inactivation).

## Structure
The MED22 protein is a component of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. The molecular structure of MED22 includes a conserved four-helix bundle domain, which is a common building block within the Mediator complex. This domain is essential for the stabilization of the transcription initiation complex (Seizl2011Mediator). The C-terminal helices of MED22, along with those of MED11, form a four-helix bundle with the C-terminal helices from MED28 and MED30, stabilized by extensive hydrophobic interactions (Zhao2021Structure).

In yeast, the Med11/22 heterodimer forms an antiparallel four-helix bundle, which is crucial for its function, as deletion of specific helices leads to lethal or growth-defective phenotypes (Seizl2011Mediator). The C-terminal extensions of MED22 are involved in interactions with the Med17 subunit, which is essential for normal cell growth (Seizl2011Mediator). In mammals, MED22 has longer, well-ordered C-terminal α-helices compared to its yeast counterpart, which are involved in interactions with metazoan-specific upper Tail subunits (Zhao2021Structure). The structure of MED22 is mostly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary significance in the Mediator complex (Zhao2021Structure).

## Function
MED22 is a component of the Mediator complex, a crucial multi-protein structure that facilitates transcription regulation in eukaryotic cells. It functions as part of the head module of the Mediator complex, which is essential for the stabilization of the transcription initiation complex. This stabilization is critical for the assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) on RNA polymerase II promoters, thereby influencing the transcription of a wide array of genes (Seizl2011Mediator).

The Med11/22 subcomplex, which includes MED22, forms a conserved four-helix bundle that interacts with the central head subunit Med17. This interaction is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the Mediator complex and ensuring effective transcription initiation (Seizl2011Mediator). The Med11/22 subcomplex also plays a role in stabilizing the PIC at promoters, which is crucial for the proper recruitment and function of transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (Seizl2011Mediator).

In healthy human cells, MED22 is primarily active in the cell nucleus, where it participates in conveying signals from DNA-bound transcription factors to RNA polymerase II, thus facilitating gene expression and impacting various cellular processes such as development and differentiation (Youn2016Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MED22 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in kidney function. MED22 is crucial for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier in the kidneys. Inactivation of MED22 specifically in podocytes, a type of kidney cell, leads to severe renal conditions. Studies using podocyte-specific MED22 knockout mouse models have shown that the absence of MED22 results in intracellular vacuole formation, podocyte loss, and progressive renal disease, ultimately causing premature death due to renal failure (Rodriguez2020Inactivation). These mice exhibit massive albuminuria by 12 weeks of age and elevated blood urea nitrogen levels by 16 weeks, indicating significant kidney dysfunction (Rodriguez2020Inactivation).

The deficiency of MED22 in podocytes is associated with the development of vacuole-like structures, which displace cellular components and lead to cell death. This phenomenon has been observed in common human glomerulopathies, suggesting a potential role for MED22 in these conditions (Rodriguez2020Inactivation). The exact mechanism by which MED22 deficiency causes podocyte death is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve the disruption of multiple transcriptional pathways (Rodriguez2020Inactivation). Further research is needed to elucidate the role of MED22 in human glomerular diseases.

## Interactions
MED22 is a component of the Mediator complex, specifically part of the Head module, where it forms a stable heterodimer with MED11. This Med11/22 subcomplex is crucial for stabilizing the transcription initiation complex by forming an antiparallel four-helix bundle, which interacts with the C-terminal domain of MED17, anchoring the Med11/22 bundle within the Head module (Seizl2011Mediator). The interaction between Med11/22 and Med17C is essential for cellular growth, as demonstrated by yeast complementation assays and in vitro binding studies (Seizl2011Mediator).

In mammals, MED22 interacts with the upper Tail subunits, specifically forming a helical bundle with the C-terminal α-helices of metazoan-specific subunits MED28 and MED30. This interaction is part of the structural complexity of the Mediator complex, contributing to its role in transcription regulation (Zhao2021Structure). The structure of mammalian MED22 is mostly conserved compared to its yeast counterpart, although it has longer, well-ordered C-terminal α-helices involved in these interactions (Zhao2021Structure). These interactions highlight the role of MED22 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the Mediator complex across different species.
