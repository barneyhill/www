# LMBRD2

## Overview
LMBRD2 is a gene that encodes the LMBR1 domain containing 2 protein, a transmembrane protein with a complex structure characterized by alternating cytoplasmic, helical, and transmembrane domains. This protein is highly conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary significance and potential roles in critical cellular processes (Malhotra2020De). LMBR1 domain containing 2 is implicated in G protein receptor signaling, particularly in modulating β2-adrenergic receptor pathways, which are relevant to immune responses and neurodevelopment (Cheng2021Novel). The protein's involvement in intracellular transport and signaling pathways, such as endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Malhotra2020De). Mutations in LMBRD2 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, emphasizing its clinical significance (Malhotra2020De).

## Structure
The LMBRD2 gene encodes a membrane-bound protein with a complex molecular architecture, featuring alternating cytoplasmic, helical, and transmembrane domains (Malhotra2020De). This structure suggests a sophisticated arrangement that may be crucial for its function. The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Malhotra2020De).

The predicted structure of the LMBRD2 protein includes specific domains, such as the LMBR1 domain, which is integral to its function (Atikuzzaman2015Mating). The presence of these domains suggests roles in cellular processes, potentially involving interactions with other proteins or cellular components.

While the primary structure, or amino acid sequence, of LMBRD2 is not detailed in the provided context, the presence of transmembrane domains implies a role in cellular signaling or transport. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices, as suggested by the helical domains mentioned (Malhotra2020De).

The context does not provide specific information on the tertiary or quaternary structures, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of LMBRD2. However, the protein's expression in various tissues, particularly the brain, indicates its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental processes (Malhotra2020De).

## Function
The LMBRD2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is evolutionarily ancient and widely expressed across various tissues in humans, with notable expression in the brain (Malhotra2020De). Although its precise function in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, LMBRD2 is highly conserved across species, suggesting a potential role in brain function and neurodevelopment (Malhotra2020De). Recent studies indicate that LMBRD2 might be involved in G protein receptor signaling, potentially regulating β2 adrenoceptor signaling (Malhotra2020De). This gene is associated with the adrenergic receptor signaling pathway, which is relevant to the function of natural killer (NK) cells, and its knockdown can enhance β2-adrenergic receptor signal transduction (Cheng2021Novel).

LMBRD2 is also involved in immune and inflammation response pathways, which are significant in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Cheng2021Novel). In the context of cellular processes, LMBRD2 is linked to intracellular transport and signaling pathways, playing a role in endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cellular communication. However, specific details about its molecular activities and cellular localization in healthy human cells remain to be fully characterized.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LMBRD2 gene have been associated with a novel early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, thin corpus callosum, microcephaly, and seizures. The study by Malhotra et al. identified rare de novo missense variants in LMBRD2 in 10 individuals, with five unique variants and two recurrent variants, c.1448G>A (p.Arg483His) and c.367T>C (p.Trp123Arg), which are predicted to be deleterious (Malhotra2020De). These variants were absent from population allele frequency databases, suggesting a strong link to the observed phenotypes. The recurrent p.Arg483His variant was specifically associated with motor and language delays (Malhotra2020De).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, a study on allele-specific expression in brain samples identified a rare stop gain mutation in LMBRD2, leading to a significant reduction in its expression in the putamen, indicating effective nonsense-mediated decay. This suggests that mutations in LMBRD2 can lead to reduced gene expression, although a direct link to specific diseases was not established in this study (Guelfi2019Regulatory). The involvement of LMBRD2 in genomic breakpoints in childhood B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was noted, but no direct association with leukemia or cancer has been reported (Jin2015Determination).

## Interactions
LMBRD2, also known as LMBR1 domain containing 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its function in cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), where LMBRD2 plays a role in the internalization of this receptor. The knockdown of LMBRD2 has been shown to enhance β2-AR signal transduction, suggesting that LMBRD2 may act as a modulator of this signaling pathway (Cheng2021Novel). This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where LMBRD2 is downregulated, potentially affecting the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and the production of IFN-γ, thereby exacerbating the disease (Cheng2021Novel).

Additionally, LMBRD2 has been identified as a novel modulator of the β2-adrenergic receptor through proximity labeling techniques, such as APEX2, which have been used to study G-protein coupled receptors (Pfeiffer2022Proximity). These interactions highlight the role of LMBRD2 in receptor signaling pathways and its potential impact on cellular signaling dynamics. The involvement of LMBRD2 in these interactions underscores its importance in membrane-related functions and signaling pathways.
