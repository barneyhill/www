# C19orf85

## Overview
C19orf85 is a gene located on chromosome 19 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 19 open reading frame 85. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, meaning its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes are not yet fully understood. Despite the limited information available, studies suggest that proteins encoded by open reading frames like C19orf85 may play roles in various cellular pathways and processes, potentially influencing gene expression and cellular regulation. Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise functions and interactions of the C19orf85 protein within the human genome.
