# RAD18

## Overview
RAD18 is a gene in humans that encodes the RAD18 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a crucial enzyme involved in DNA damage repair and genomic stability. The RAD18 protein is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, characterized by its RING finger domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, and a zinc finger domain that aids in DNA binding. This protein plays a pivotal role in the post-replication repair (PRR) pathway by facilitating the monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a process vital for DNA damage tolerance and the recruitment of translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases. Additionally, RAD18 is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining pathways, interacting with various chromatin components and DNA damage signaling factors. Its multifaceted role in maintaining genome stability underscores its significance in cellular responses to genotoxic stress (Griffith-Jones2023Structural; Sasatani2015RAD18; Watanabe2004Rad18).

## Structure
RAD18 is a human gene encoding the RAD18 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which plays a crucial role in DNA damage tolerance. The protein contains a RING finger domain, essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and a zinc finger domain, which aids in DNA binding. RAD18 is involved in post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, and has splice variant isoforms that may affect its function.

The RAD18 protein is characterized by several structural features that are crucial for its function. It contains a RING finger domain, which is essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins (Watanabe2004Rad18). The protein also includes a DNA-binding SAP domain, which interacts with the RING domain to enable the monoubiquitination of PCNA, a process critical for DNA damage response (Griffith-Jones2023Structural). This intramolecular interaction between the RING and SAP domains is evolutionarily conserved and involves salt bridges and a hydrophobic interaction network, crucial for RAD18's function in DNA damage response (Griffith-Jones2023Structural).

RAD18 forms an asymmetric dimer, consisting of two RAD18 molecules and one RAD6 molecule, which is involved in the ubiquitination process (Griffith-Jones2023Structural). The interaction with RAD6 is mediated through the RAD6-binding domain (R6BD) of RAD18, which is crucial for its function in PCNA monoubiquitination (Watanabe2004Rad18). The presence of MAGEA4 can influence the RAD18/RAD6 complex, suggesting a regulatory role in RAD18's function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Griffith-Jones2023Structural).

## Function
RAD18 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in DNA damage repair and maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the post-replication repair (PRR) pathway, where it facilitates the monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at stalled replication forks. This modification is essential for DNA damage tolerance, allowing the recruitment of translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases that enable DNA replication to bypass lesions without removing them, thus preventing cell death (Ting2010RAD18; Watanabe2004Rad18).

RAD18 also participates in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways. It interacts with chromatin components such as ubiquitinated histone H2A, facilitating the recruitment of repair proteins like RAD9 to DSB sites (Mustofa2021RAD18; Inagaki2011Human). RAD18's role in DSB repair is independent of PCNA ubiquitination and involves its interaction with DNA damage signaling factors, contributing to the activation of the G2/M checkpoint and ensuring cell survival after ionizing radiation exposure (Sasatani2015RAD18). Through these mechanisms, RAD18 is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutagenic events in response to genotoxic stress (Varanasi2012Rad18).

## Clinical Significance
RAD18 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in DNA damage repair. In glioma, RAD18 is overexpressed, contributing to radiotherapy resistance by downregulating the tumor suppressor protein P53, which facilitates glioma progression and radiation resistance (Wu2019High). This overexpression is also associated with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis in glioma cells (Wu2019High).

In gastric cancer, high RAD18 expression correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis. It is associated with lymph node metastasis, lymphatic and venous invasion, and advanced clinical stages. RAD18 knockdown in gastric cancer cell lines reduces proliferation and invasiveness, suggesting its role in cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance (Baatar2020High).

RAD18 polymorphisms have been linked to increased chemotherapy toxicity in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities, indicating RAD18's influence on chemotherapy side effects (Chu2016RAD18).

In colorectal cancer, the RAD18 Arg302Gln polymorphism is associated with an increased risk, particularly in well-differentiated grades and lymph node metastasis, suggesting a role in cancer susceptibility (Imai2007Single).

## Interactions
RAD18, an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that facilitate DNA damage repair. It forms a complex with the E2 conjugating enzyme RAD6, which is essential for the monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at stalled replication forks. This interaction is crucial for post-replication repair pathways, including translesion synthesis (TLS) and template switching (Ting2010RAD18; Watanabe2004Rad18).

RAD18 interacts with DNA polymerase eta (polη) through a physical interaction that guides polη to replication stalling sites. This interaction is facilitated by the monoubiquitination of PCNA, which polη preferentially binds to, enhancing its recruitment to damaged sites (Watanabe2004Rad18). RAD18 also binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), particularly at replication forks, through its SAP domain, which is important for its recruitment to sites of DNA damage (Hedglin2015Regulation).

In addition to its role in TLS, RAD18 is involved in homologous recombination (HR) repair by interacting with RAD51C and other proteins in the DNA damage signaling cascade, such as phosphorylated H2AX and MDC1 (Ting2010RAD18). These interactions highlight RAD18's multifaceted role in maintaining genome stability.
