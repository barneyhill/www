# PROK1

## Overview
PROK1 is a gene that encodes the protein prokineticin 1, a secreted peptide involved in various physiological processes, particularly in the reproductive and gastrointestinal systems. Prokineticin 1 is characterized by its role as an angiogenic factor, influencing the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, which is crucial for processes such as fetomaternal circulation and ovarian function. Structurally, the protein is defined by a conserved N-terminal hexapeptide sequence and a unique motif of disulfide bonds, contributing to its compact and functional conformation. Prokineticin 1 interacts with its receptor, PROKR1, to activate multiple signaling pathways, including MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, which are essential for its biological activities. The gene's expression is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2023PI3KAKTmTOR; Li2001Identification; Traboulsi2015Prokineticins).

## Structure
Prokineticin 1 (PROK1) is an 86 amino acid peptide characterized by a conserved N-terminal hexapeptide sequence, AVITGA, which is crucial for its biological activity and receptor binding (Zhou2006The; Monnier2008Cytokine). The primary structure of PROK1 includes a signal peptide of 27 amino acids, followed by a mature protein of 81 amino acids (Li2001Identification). The molecular structure of PROK1 is defined by a unique motif comprising five disulfide bonds formed by 10 conserved cysteine residues, which confer a compact shape to the molecule (Negri2007Bv8Prokineticin; Monnier2008Cytokine). This structure results in distinct N- and C-terminal regions, with a positive net charge on one side and a hydrophobic side on the opposite (Monnier2008Cytokine).

The tertiary structure of PROK1 is compact, with the N- and C-termini exposed on the surface, facilitating interactions with receptors and extracellular components such as sulphate proteoglycans (Monnier2008Cytokine). PROK1 does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. The protein is highly expressed in gastrointestinal tissues, particularly the stomach, and is involved in smooth muscle contractility (Li2001Identification).

## Function
Prokineticin 1 (PROK1) is a multifunctional protein involved in various physiological processes, particularly in the human reproductive system. It is known for its role in angiogenesis, acting as a potent angiogenic mitogen that influences the proliferation, survival, and migration of endothelial cells. This function is crucial for the establishment of fetomaternal circulation during pregnancy and is also significant in ovarian function, where it regulates angiogenesis in the ovary and corpus luteum (Traboulsi2015Prokineticins).

In the endometrium, PROK1 is involved in regulating gene expression critical for implantation and early pregnancy. It interacts with its receptor, PROKR1, to activate several signaling pathways, including the Gq-phospholipase C-β-cSrc-EGFR-MAPK/ERK kinase pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as ERK 1/2. This interaction results in the upregulation of genes associated with implantation, inflammation, and angiogenesis, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interleukins IL-6, IL-8, and IL-11 (Evans2008Prokineticin).

PROK1 also plays a role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in the endometrium by inducing the expression of Dickkopf 1 (DKK1), which inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway, crucial for endometrial cell proliferation and decidualization (Macdonald2011Prokineticin).

## Clinical Significance
PROK1 (prokineticin 1) is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in angiogenesis and cell proliferation. In pancreatic cancer, PROK1 is highly expressed and promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis, and cell survival through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Silencing PROK1 in pancreatic cancer cells has been shown to reduce tumor growth, decrease proliferation markers, and increase apoptosis markers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2023PI3KAKTmTOR). 

In prostate cancer, PROK1 expression is significantly increased compared to non-neoplastic tissue and correlates with Gleason scores, indicating its potential as a predictive biomarker for cancer progression. PROK1 activates the ERK1/2 pathway, enhancing cell motility and contributing to cancer progression through angiogenesis and metastatic cell motility (Sinisi2024The).

The gene's expression and interaction with specific pathways are crucial in cancer development, making it a significant focus for research into cancer therapies. Alterations in PROK1 expression or its interactions can influence tumor growth and patient prognosis, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Wang2023PI3KAKTmTOR).

## Interactions
Prokineticin 1 (PROK1) interacts with its receptor, prokineticin receptor 1 (PROKR1), to mediate various physiological processes. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of genes involved in early pregnancy, including those related to angiogenesis, immune response, and trophoblast cell functions such as adhesion, invasion, and proliferation (GoryszewskaSzczurek2021Prokineticin). PROK1-PROKR1 signaling involves several pathways, including MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and cAMP, which are essential for trophoblast cell adhesion and proliferation (GoryszewskaSzczurek2021Prokineticin).

PROK1 also modulates the expression of interleukin-11 (IL-11) through the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling pathway, highlighting its role in immune response regulation (Cook2009Prokineticin1). The interaction with PROKR1 is specific, as demonstrated by the use of a PROKR1 antagonist, which abolishes the effects of PROK1 on gene expression and protein phosphorylation (GoryszewskaSzczurek2021Prokineticin).

In the context of fetal-maternal communication, PROK1 regulates the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the endometrium, enhancing trophoblast adhesion to the endometrial lining. This process involves a signaling pathway that includes Gq, calcium, PKC, cSrc, EGFR, and MEK (Evans2009Prokineticin). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of PROK1 in reproductive biology.
