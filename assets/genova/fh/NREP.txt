# NREP

## Overview
The NREP gene encodes the neuronal regeneration related protein, also known as P311, which is an 8-kDa intracellular protein primarily expressed in the nervous system and in vascular and visceral smooth muscle tissues. This protein is highly conserved across species and plays a significant role in promoting neurite outgrowth by regulating Rho kinase activity, which is crucial for neuronal growth and regeneration. NREP is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and the regulation of microRNA expression, and it has been implicated in the development of certain cancers. The protein contains three PEST-like domains, suggesting a tightly regulated expression through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. NREP's involvement in the transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) pathway further underscores its role in cancer progression and cellular signaling (Liu2021Overexpression; Salnikov2023Structural; Salnikov2024Structural).

## Structure


## Function
The NREP gene, also known as the neuronal regeneration related protein or P311, encodes an 8-kDa intracellular protein that is highly conserved across species and is primarily expressed in the nervous system, as well as in vascular and visceral smooth muscle beds (Salnikov2023Structural; Salnikov2024Structural). NREP plays a crucial role in the nervous system by promoting neurite outgrowth through the regulation of Rho kinase activity, which is essential for neuronal growth and regeneration (Salnikov2024Structural). It is involved in cell proliferation and migration during processes such as vascularization and wound healing, and it has been implicated in the development of various cancer types (Salnikov2024Structural).

NREP contains three PEST-like domains, which are rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, indicating a tightly regulated expression and function (Salnikov2024Structural). The protein also influences microRNA expression in the cerebellum through a functional RNA domain present in its mRNA (Salnikov2024Structural). In mouse models, the absence of NREP expression leads to learning and memory impairments, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neurological functions (Salnikov2023Structural; Salnikov2024Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NREP gene, also known as neuronal regeneration related protein, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), NREP expression is decreased in hepatocytes from patients, and its administration in mice has shown potential therapeutic effects, such as decreased body weight and improved glucose tolerance. This suggests that NREP could serve as an early biomarker and therapeutic target for NAFLD (De2020Parental). NREP is also involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, and its knockdown in HepG2 cells leads to increased lipid accumulation, indicating a role in the development of steatosis and NAFLD (De2020Parental).

In the nervous system, NREP is crucial for neurite outgrowth and regeneration. Structural variations affecting the Epb41l4a locus, which impact NREP expression, have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as dyslexia and intellectual disability. Mouse models lacking NREP expression exhibit learning and memory impairments, highlighting its importance in cognitive functions (Salnikov2024Structural).

In gastric cancer, NREP is overexpressed and correlates with poor survival outcomes. It is associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly M2 macrophages, suggesting a role in tumor progression and immune regulation (Lu2021High).

## Interactions
NREP (neuronal regeneration related protein) is known to participate in various interactions that influence cellular processes. It is involved in the regulation of the transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) pathway, which is a key inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. NREP overexpression in gastric cancer cells leads to the upregulation of TGF-β1, promoting EMT and enhancing tumor cell migration and invasion (Liu2021Overexpression). This interaction suggests that NREP may play a role in modulating the tumor microenvironment by influencing the recruitment and activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are crucial for tumor progression (Liu2021Overexpression).

In the nervous system, NREP is involved in neurite outgrowth by managing Rho kinase activity, indicating its role in cellular signaling pathways that govern neuronal development and regeneration (Salnikov2023Structural). NREP mRNA also contains a functional RNA domain that modulates microRNA expression in the cerebellum, highlighting its involvement in gene expression regulation at the RNA level (Salnikov2023Structural). These interactions underscore NREP's multifaceted role in both cancer progression and neuronal development.
