# OR2C1

## Overview
The OR2C1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily C member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs involved in signal transduction processes. OR2C1 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it functions as an odorant receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection and perception of smell. Beyond its olfactory function, OR2C1 is ectopically expressed in pancreatic β-cells, where it contributes to glucose metabolism by enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through specific signaling pathways. This dual role underscores the receptor's functional versatility and its involvement in both sensory and metabolic processes (Block2017The; Beito2024Role).

## Structure
The OR2C1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs, which are involved in signal transduction processes. The primary structure of OR2C1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an odorant receptor (Block2017The; Beito2024Role).

The secondary structure of OR2C1 includes alpha helices, which are common in the transmembrane regions of GPCRs. These helices contribute to the formation of a ligand-binding pocket, allowing the receptor to interact with various odorant molecules (Block2017The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional shape, essential for the receptor's functional conformation and interaction with ligands (Block2017The).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's function and localization within the cell membrane (Beito2024Role). OR2C1 is expressed in various tissues, including the pancreas, where it plays a role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, highlighting its functional versatility beyond olfaction (Beito2024Role).

## Function
The human gene OR2C1 encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. In healthy human cells, OR2C1 is primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell.

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR2C1 is ectopically expressed in pancreatic β-cells, where it plays a significant role in metabolic processes. It is involved in potentiating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through the activation of a phospholipase C (PLC)-IP3 signaling pathway. Activation of OR2C1 by the medium-chain fatty acid octanoate leads to increased insulin secretion. Long-term stimulation of this receptor results in the up-regulation of glucokinase and enhanced glucose uptake via the IP3-CaMKK/CaMKIV pathway, providing a molecular explanation for the insulinotropic effect of octanoate. This highlights the role of OR2C1 as part of a chemo-sensing system in the pancreas, regulating hormone release based on nutrient and chemical composition in the bloodstream (Beito2024Role).

## Interactions
OR2C1, a member of the olfactory receptor family, is involved in various physiological processes through its interactions with other proteins. In pancreatic β-cells, OR2C1 is activated by octanoate, which enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via a phospholipase C (PLC)-IP3 signaling pathway. This activation leads to the up-regulation of glucokinase and increased glucose uptake through the IP3-CaMKK/CaMKIV pathway, indicating a role in glucose metabolism and insulin regulation (Beito2024Role).

The receptor's wide receptive range allows it to interact with a variety of compounds, including aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic compounds, suggesting its function as a chemo-sensing system in hormone release (Beito2024Role). Although specific protein-protein interactions for OR2C1 are not detailed, its involvement in these signaling pathways implies transient interactions with G proteins and other signaling molecules typical of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Beito2024Role).

In the context of odor discrimination, OR2C1 has been identified with a frequency of 1.65 in human tissues such as the fallopian tube, T-cells, spinal cord, parathyroid gland, and B-cells, suggesting its expression and potential interactions in diverse tissue types (Concas2021The).
