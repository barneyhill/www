# ANO5

## Overview
ANO5 is a gene that encodes the protein anoctamin 5, which is a member of the anoctamin family of transmembrane proteins. Anoctamin 5 is characterized by its eight transmembrane domains and is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, as well as in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. This protein plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including muscle membrane repair, muscle precursor cell fusion, and bone remodeling. It is involved in Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scrambling, which is essential for muscle cell fusion and membrane repair, and it also participates in osteoclast differentiation through the Akt-NFATc1 signaling pathway. Mutations in the ANO5 gene are linked to several muscular and bone disorders, such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L and gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, highlighting its clinical significance (Jarmula2019ANO5; Kim2019Role; Bolduc2010Recessive).

## Structure
The ANO5 protein, encoded by the ANO5 gene, is a member of the anoctamin family and is approximately 100 kDa in size, consisting of 913 amino acids. It features eight transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function as a potential intracellular channel involved in ion transport and muscle membrane repair (Jarmula2019ANO5; Pedemonte2014Structure). The protein is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, as well as in chondrocytes and osteoblasts, indicating its significant role in the musculoskeletal system (Jarmula2019ANO5).

The secondary structure of ANO5 includes central α-helices that are crucial for its dimerization interface. The wild-type protein exhibits a high α-helical content, which is essential for maintaining structural stability. Mutations in ANO5 can disrupt these α-helices, leading to destabilization and altered protein function (Jarmula2019ANO5).

The quaternary structure of ANO5 involves dimerization, with each subunit contributing to the formation of a stable interface through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. Mutations can affect these interactions, leading to less stable dimerization interfaces (Jarmula2019ANO5). The protein's structure and function can be significantly altered by mutations, which may lead to conditions such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (Jarmula2019ANO5).

## Function
ANO5 (anoctamin 5) is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in muscle and bone tissues. In muscle cells, ANO5 plays a significant role in muscle precursor cell (MPC) fusion, a process essential for muscle development and repair. It facilitates Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scrambling (PLS), which is crucial for the exposure of phosphatidylserine, a lipid that signals cell fusion. This activity is associated with the development of multinucleated myotubes, which are vital for muscle function (Whitlock2018Anoctamin).

ANO5 is also implicated in generating ionic currents in response to high intracellular calcium concentrations, suggesting it may conduct ions through pathways that also conduct lipids. This function is linked to its role in muscle cell fusion and membrane repair (Whitlock2018Anoctamin).

In bone tissue, ANO5 is expressed in osteoclasts and enhances RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation through the Akt-NFATc1 signaling pathway. This suggests a role in bone remodeling by regulating osteoclast function, although it does not appear to affect osteoblast differentiation (Kim2019Role).

ANO5 is primarily located in intracellular membrane vesicles, possibly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, but its exact cellular compartments remain unclear (Duran2012ANOs; Duran2011Physiological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANO5 gene are associated with several muscular and bone disorders. Recessive mutations in ANO5 are linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L (LGMD2L) and Miyoshi muscular dystrophy type 3 (MMD3), both characterized by progressive muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase levels. These conditions primarily affect the pelvic girdle and leg muscles, with symptoms including muscle atrophy and asymmetry of muscle involvement (Hicks2010A; Sarkozy2013ANO5Gene; Bolduc2010Recessive).

The c.191dupA mutation is particularly prevalent in Northern European populations and is considered a founder mutation. It is associated with a homogeneous phenotype of adult-onset proximal lower limb weakness and muscle wasting (Hicks2010A; Sarkozy2013ANO5Gene). ANO5 mutations can also lead to isolated hyperCKemia, where patients exhibit elevated creatine kinase levels without significant muscle weakness (Panadésde2020Persistent).

In addition to muscular dystrophies, ANO5 mutations are implicated in bone disorders such as gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia (GDD) and florid osseous dysplasia (FFOD). These conditions involve bone fragility and cemento-osseous lesions, with specific mutations affecting bone tissue pathology (Lv2019Identification; Andreeva2016Whole). The p.C356W mutation, for example, is associated with FFOD and may alter protein structure, impacting its function (Lv2019Identification).

## Interactions
ANO5, also known as anoctamin 5, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in muscle biology. A significant interaction is with the protein BVES (blood vessel epicardial substance), which was identified using a BioID2 proximity labeling approach. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that the N-terminus of ANO5 interacts with the C-terminus of BVES. Both proteins co-localize in muscle cells, particularly at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and their interaction is essential for myoblast differentiation. Disruption of either ANO5 or BVES impairs this differentiation process, indicating their collaborative role in muscle development and plasma membrane repair (Li2021BVES).

The study also suggests that BVES, as a cAMP effector protein, may regulate ANO5's channel and lipid scrambling activities, which are vital for proper plasma membrane repair and muscle differentiation. This interaction highlights a potential shared pathogenic mechanism with limb girdle muscular dystrophy due to genetic mutations in BVES (Li2021BVES). These findings underscore the importance of ANO5's interactions in understanding its role in muscle regeneration and the development of muscular dystrophy.
