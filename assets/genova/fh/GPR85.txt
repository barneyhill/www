# GPR85

## Overview
GPR85 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 85, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is highly conserved across species and is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in regions associated with cognitive functions such as the hippocampal dentate gyrus (Matsumoto2005A). GPR85 plays a crucial role in regulating neurogenesis and cognitive processes, with its expression linked to various psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (Jin2018Integrative; Matsumoto2008The). Additionally, alterations in GPR85 have been associated with cardiovascular conditions, such as acute myocardial infarction, highlighting its broader clinical significance (Dershem2019Rarevariant). The receptor's involvement in these diverse physiological and pathological processes makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Function
GPR85, also known as SREB2, is a highly conserved G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in the central nervous system. It is predominantly expressed in neurons throughout the brain, with the highest levels found in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, a region associated with neural plasticity and cognitive functions (Matsumoto2005A). GPR85 is involved in regulating adult neurogenesis, particularly influencing the differentiation and migration of neurons rather than their proliferation (Matsumoto2005A).

In transgenic mouse models, overexpression of GPR85 has been shown to reduce neural stem cell proliferation and impair neuron survival, leading to deficits in cognitive functions such as spatial discrimination and working memory (Chen2012SREB2GPR85). Conversely, knockout models exhibit enhanced neuron survival and improved cognitive performance, suggesting that GPR85 negatively regulates neurogenesis and related cognitive processes (Chen2012SREB2GPR85).

GPR85's expression is linked to psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, where it may influence brain size, behavior, and vulnerability to the disorder (Matsumoto2008The). Its role in modulating brain function and emotional processing highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for psychiatric disorders (Radulescu2012Effect; Roberts2017SA98.).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPR85 gene have been associated with several psychiatric and cardiovascular conditions. GPR85 has been linked to schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, with studies showing significant upregulation of GPR85 mRNA levels in various brain regions of Shank3 transgenic mice, a model for these disorders (Jin2018Integrative). Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3'-UTRs of GPR85 have been associated with schizophrenia, although experimental proof of causality is still lacking (Schöneberg2020Mutations).

In terms of cardiovascular conditions, GPR85 has been significantly associated with acute myocardial infarction. This association was identified through the analysis of rare variants in G protein-coupled receptors, highlighting the importance of including various functional variant classes in disease association studies (Dershem2019Rarevariant). The study emphasizes the role of rare coding variants, including loss-of-function and synonymous variants with altered codon bias, in understanding the genetic basis of such diseases (Dershem2018Rare).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of GPR85 in both psychiatric and cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that alterations in this gene may contribute to the pathophysiology of these conditions.
