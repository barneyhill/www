# TMEM268

## Overview
TMEM268 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 268, which is characterized by its two conserved transmembrane domains. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling and interactions. TMEM268 plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of the integrin subunit β4 (ITGB4) and the ITGB4/PLEC complex, which are essential for cytoskeletal integrity and cell adhesion. The protein's interaction with ITGB4 is crucial for modulating ubiquitination processes that affect ITGB4 stability, thereby influencing cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. These functions are particularly significant in the context of gastric cancer, where TMEM268 deletion has been associated with impaired cell adhesion, reduced proliferation, and decreased metastatic potential. Consequently, TMEM268 is considered a potential target for therapeutic strategies aimed at treating gastric cancer metastasis (Hong2018Deletion).

## Structure
The TMEM268 protein is a transmembrane protein with two conserved transmembrane domains located between amino acids 104-126 and 130-152 (Hong2018Deletion). It is encoded by two mRNA variants, TMEM268-v1 and TMEM268-v2, which differ slightly in their amino acid sequences. TMEM268-v1 is the canonical sequence, encoding a protein of 342 amino acids with a molecular weight of 37.6 kDa, while TMEM268-v2 encodes a 343 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 37.7 kDa, differing by an additional Glutamine (Q) at position 71 (Hong2018Deletion).

The protein is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, indicating its role in cellular signaling and interaction (Hong2018Deletion). TMEM268 interacts with the integrin subunit β4 (ITGB4) via their C-terminal regions, which is crucial for maintaining the stability of the ITGB4/PLEC complex and the cytoskeleton structure (Hong2018Deletion). The deletion of TMEM268 leads to increased ubiquitination and degradation of ITGB4, affecting cell adhesion and cytoskeleton remodeling (Hong2018Deletion). Specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TMEM268 are not provided in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM268 has been implicated in the progression of gastric cancer, with its deletion leading to significant effects on cancer cell behavior. The absence of TMEM268 in gastric cancer cells results in decreased cell viability, proliferation, and adhesion, as well as S-phase cell cycle arrest and disruption of cytoskeleton remodeling (Hong2018Deletion). This protein interacts with the integrin subunit β4 (ITGB4), and its deletion promotes ITGB4 degradation through the ubiquitin-mediated pathway, leading to instability of ITGB4 and filamin A (FLNA) (Hong2018Deletion). This degradation affects cell adhesion and cytoskeleton stability, impairing the metastatic potential of gastric cancer cells (Hong2018Deletion).

In vivo studies have shown that TMEM268 deletion inhibits tumorigenesis and prevents metastasis to the lungs and peritoneum in a xenograft tumor mouse model (Hong2018Deletion). The loss of TMEM268 also results in reduced expression of ITGB4 and other integrin subunits, leading to decreased cell-ECM adhesion (Hong2018Deletion). These findings suggest that TMEM268 plays a crucial role in maintaining ITGB4 stability and cell adhesion, which could have implications for gastric cancer progression and treatment (Hong2018Deletion). Targeting the TMEM268/ITGB4 signaling axis may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for treating gastric cancer metastasis (Hong2018Deletion).

## Interactions
TMEM268, a transmembrane protein, is known to interact with the integrin subunit β4 (ITGB4) in gastric cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for maintaining ITGB4 stability and function. TMEM268 associates with ITGB4 via their C-terminal regions, and this interaction is confirmed through pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Hong2018Deletion). The deletion of TMEM268 leads to increased ubiquitination and degradation of ITGB4, specifically increasing K48-linked ubiquitination while decreasing K63-linked ubiquitination. This suggests that TMEM268 plays a role in modulating the ubiquitination process of ITGB4, thereby influencing its stability (Hong2018Deletion).

TMEM268 also interacts with the ITGB4-PLEC complex, which is important for hemidesmosome formation and cytoskeletal integrity. The absence of TMEM268 results in the dissociation of this complex, leading to cytoskeletal remodeling and impaired cell adhesion (Hong2018Deletion). These interactions highlight TMEM268's role as a positive regulator of ITGB4, affecting cell adhesion, proliferation, and cytoskeletal organization, which are critical processes in cancer cell metastasis and tumorigenesis (Hong2018Deletion).
