# CA5A

## Overview
The CA5A gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme carbonic anhydrase 5A (CA-VA), which is a member of the carbonic anhydrase family, a group of zinc metalloenzymes. These enzymes are involved in the rapid conversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate and protons, a reaction critical for various physiological processes. CA-VA is predominantly expressed in the liver and plays a vital role in metabolic pathways, including the urea cycle and gluconeogenesis, by supplying bicarbonate to key mitochondrial enzymes (van2014Mitochondrial; DiezFernandez2016Defective). The enzyme's activity is dependent on its structural integrity, which includes a zinc ion at the active site, and it functions optimally in alkaline conditions (van2014Mitochondrial; Idrees2016Effect). Mutations in the CA5A gene can lead to CA-VA deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by hyperammonemia and metabolic acidosis, underscoring the enzyme's importance in metabolic homeostasis (van2014Mitochondrial; DiezFernandez2016Defective).

## Structure
Carbonic anhydrase 5A (CA5A) is a mitochondrial enzyme encoded by the CA5A gene. The primary structure of CA5A consists of a sequence of 267 amino acids in its mature form, following the cleavage of a 38-amino acid mitochondrial leader sequence (Nagao1993Human). The enzyme shows 30-49% similarity to other human carbonic anhydrases and 76% similarity to the mouse CA V sequence (Nagao1993Human).

The secondary structure of CA5A includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of carbonic anhydrase family members. The tertiary structure is stabilized by the coordination of a zinc ion at the active site, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (van2014Mitochondrial). The enzyme's structure is sensitive to pH changes, maintaining stability and activity in alkaline conditions, with maximum activity at pH 9.0 (Idrees2016Effect).

CA5A functions as a monomer, indicating it lacks a quaternary structure. The enzyme may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability. The presence of conserved residues, including those involved in zinc binding, is essential for its catalytic activity (Nagao1993Human).

## Function
The CA5A gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme carbonic anhydrase VA (CA-VA), which plays a critical role in intermediary metabolism by catalyzing the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. This reaction is essential for maintaining acid-base balance and providing bicarbonate to several key mitochondrial enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. In particular, CA-VA supplies bicarbonate to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. These enzymes are crucial for processes such as the urea cycle, gluconeogenesis, and the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (van2014Mitochondrial; DiezFernandez2016Defective).

CA-VA is primarily active in the liver, where it supports the urea cycle by providing bicarbonate to CPS1, facilitating the conversion of ammonia to urea, which is vital for ammonia detoxification (van2014Mitochondrial; AdevaAndany2015The). The enzyme is synthesized with a mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is cleaved upon entry into the mitochondria to form the mature enzyme (DiezFernandez2016Defective). The proper functioning of CA5A is essential for metabolic homeostasis, preventing conditions such as hyperammonemia and metabolic acidosis (DiezFernandez2016Defective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CA5A gene, which encodes the mitochondrial enzyme carbonic anhydrase VA (CA-VA), lead to a rare metabolic disorder known as CA-VA deficiency. This condition is characterized by early-onset hyperammonemia, hyperlactatemia, and metabolic acidosis, often presenting in neonates and young children. The deficiency results from various mutations, including missense mutations like p.Ser233Pro and p.Glu241Lys, splice site mutations, and deletions of exons, which impair the enzyme's activity and stability (van2014Mitochondrial; DiezFernandez2016Defective).

CA-VA deficiency disrupts the provision of bicarbonate to mitochondrial enzymes involved in critical metabolic pathways, such as the urea cycle and gluconeogenesis, leading to life-threatening metabolic crises (DiezFernandez2016Defective). Symptoms include lethargy, hypoglycemia, and elevated ketone bodies in urine, with potential for irreversible brain damage if untreated (DiezFernandez2016Defective; Marwaha2020Two). The condition is treatable with carglumic acid, which helps manage hyperammonemia (van2014Mitochondrial; Marwaha2020Two).

The disorder is autosomal recessive and may be underdiagnosed due to its rarity and symptom overlap with other metabolic disorders (Marwaha2020Two). Early diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent severe outcomes (DiezFernandez2016Defective).
