# NAT8B

## Overview
NAT8B is a gene that encodes the protein N-acetyltransferase 8B, which is a putative member of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily. This protein is categorized as an acetyltransferase enzyme and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). N-acetyltransferase 8B is involved in Nε-lysine acetylation, a post-translational modification that plays a crucial role in maintaining proteostasis and regulating autophagy within the secretory pathway (Rigby2021Endoplasmic; Farrugia2018Nεlysine). The protein functions as a dimer, and its activity is essential for processes such as protein folding, stability, and the regulation of reticulophagy and macroautophagy. Despite its significant cellular functions, mutations in NAT8B have not been directly linked to human diseases, although alterations in its expression have been associated with conditions such as chronic kidney disease and certain neurological disorders (Xu2018Molecular; Rigby2020The).

## Function
NAT8B, also known as ATase1, is an acetyltransferase enzyme localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). It is involved in Nε-lysine acetylation, a post-translational modification crucial for maintaining proteostasis and regulating autophagy within the secretory pathway (Rigby2021Endoplasmic; Farrugia2018Nεlysine). NAT8B functions as a dimer, and its enzymatic activity is dependent on this dimerization. It shares a high degree of identity with ATase2 (NAT8) and is part of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily, possessing a conserved acetyl-CoA-binding motif (Farrugia2018Nεlysine).

In healthy human cells, NAT8B contributes to protein modification processes essential for protein folding and stability. It plays a significant role in the regulation of reticulophagy and macroautophagy, processes that are vital for disposing of toxic protein aggregates (Rigby2021Endoplasmic). The acetylation activity of NAT8B is linked to broader cellular metabolic processes, including changes in the cellular acetylome and acetyl-CoA metabolism (Rigby2021Endoplasmic). Despite its involvement in these critical cellular functions, mutations in NAT8B are not associated with human diseases (Farrugia2018Nεlysine).

## Clinical Significance
NAT8B has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in acetylation processes within the endoplasmic reticulum. Alterations in NAT8B expression have been associated with kidney function, particularly in relation to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Studies suggest that NAT8B, along with other genes, has a causal effect on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a key measure of kidney function, indicating its potential clinical significance in kidney health (Xu2018Molecular).

In the context of neurological disorders, dysfunctional acetylation involving NAT8B is linked to severe neurological diseases. Duplication of the related gene AT-1/SLC33A1, which interacts with NAT8B, is associated with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and dysmorphism (Rigby2020The). Additionally, NAT8B has been noted for its role in cancer progenitor cells and resistance to traditional anticancer therapies, suggesting its involvement in cancer pathology (Anuntakarun2021Identification).

Research also indicates that NAT8B expression levels may influence the sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as Difttox ontak, highlighting its potential role in cancer treatment strategies (Shen2023Construction).

## Interactions
NAT8B, also known as ATase1, is involved in the acetylation of proteins within the secretory pathway. It functions as a dimer, and this dimerization is crucial for its enzymatic activity. NAT8B interacts with components of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is involved in the N-glycosylation of nascent glycoproteins. This interaction is partially lost when the C-terminus of NAT8B is truncated (Farrugia2018Nεlysine).

NAT8B is also involved in the acetylation of the ER-bound autophagy protein ATG9A. This acetylation regulates ATG9A's interaction with ER-based autophagy receptors FAM134B and SEC62, which are crucial for engaging the core autophagy machinery in the cytosol (Murie2022ATase). The acetylation of ATG9A by NAT8B is a key regulatory step in reticulophagy, a process that helps maintain proteostasis within the ER (Rigby2021Endoplasmic).

Additionally, NAT8B is post-translationally regulated by acetylation at a specific lysine residue (K99), which modulates its enzymatic activity. This acetylation serves as a site for allosteric regulation, highlighting the complex regulatory mechanisms governing NAT8B's function (Rigby2020The).
