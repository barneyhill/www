# TMC3

## Overview
The TMC3 gene encodes the transmembrane channel-like 3 protein, which is part of the transmembrane channel-like family involved in ion channel regulation. This protein is implicated in cellular ion permeability and is expressed in specific neurons within the vagal ganglia, playing a role in sensory interoception of the lungs (Keresztes2003TMC; Kortmann2023Lunginnervating). TMC3 is associated with mechanosensation and nociception, contributing to the regulation of broncho-constriction and dilation, which affects respiratory functions (Kortmann2023Lunginnervating). Additionally, TMC3 has been linked to various clinical conditions, including renal clear cell carcinoma and hypertension, and is considered a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and respiratory diseases (Lecluze2023Association; Tang2023Comprehensive; Kortmann2023Lunginnervating).

## Function
The TMC3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the transmembrane channel-like family, which is involved in ion channel regulation and potentially influences cellular ion permeability (Keresztes2003TMC). TMC3 is expressed in a specific subset of nodose neurons within the vagal ganglia, which are involved in sensory interoception of the lungs (Kortmann2023Lunginnervating). These neurons play a role in mechanosensation and nociception, as they co-express genes like Piezo2 and Trpv1, which are associated with sensory functions (Kortmann2023Lunginnervating).

TMC3+ neurons are involved in regulating broncho-constriction and dilation, affecting the respiratory cycle (Kortmann2023Lunginnervating). Activation of these neurons can lead to bronchodilation, while their inhibition results in decreased lung volume and tidal volume, suggesting a role in regulating airway dilation and constriction (Kortmann2023Lunginnervating). Although the precise molecular activities and cellular localization of TMC3 in humans are not fully elucidated, its expression in inner ear hair cells indicates a possible role in mechanotransduction processes similar to TMC1 and TMC2, which are involved in hearing and balance (Kortmann2023Lunginnervating).

## Clinical Significance
TMC3 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression or interactions. In renal clear cell carcinoma (RCCC), TMC3 is upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. High expression levels of TMC3 are associated with shorter overall survival in RCCC patients, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker. However, while univariate analysis identifies high TMC3 expression as a risk factor, multivariate analysis does not confirm it as an independent prognostic factor (Tang2023Comprehensive).

In colorectal cancer, TMC3 has been identified as part of a synthetic lethal pair with RPS6KA6. This interaction suggests that alterations in TMC3 may be involved in pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic interventions, highlighting its potential role in cancer treatment strategies (Zhou2020Integrated).

TMC3 is also associated with blood pressure regulation. Predicted loss-of-function variants in TMC3 have been linked to variations in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, suggesting its involvement in hypertension and potential as a target for drug development (Lecluze2023Association).

In respiratory conditions, TMC3 expression in lung-innervating neurons affects broncho-constriction and dilation, implicating it in diseases such as asthma and COPD (Kortmann2023Lunginnervating).
