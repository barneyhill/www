# OR5AC1

## Overview
The OR5AC1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily AC member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules and the initiation of olfactory signal transduction. Olfactory receptors, including OR5AC1, are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The OR5AC1 gene is located on chromosome 11 and is part of a large family of olfactory receptor genes, which are the largest gene family in the human genome. These receptors are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals, contributing to the sense of smell (Qiu2020aarFDC).
