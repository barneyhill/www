# VPS13D

## Overview
VPS13D is a gene that encodes the vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog D, a protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular lipid transport and mitochondrial dynamics. As a member of the VPS13 family, the VPS13D protein is characterized by its involvement in autophagy and the regulation of mitochondrial morphology and clearance. It contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which is essential for binding K63-linked ubiquitin chains, and a β-propeller/WD40-like domain that facilitates protein interactions. VPS13D localizes to membrane contact sites, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and is involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity by promoting phospholipid transport and facilitating mitophagy. Mutations in the VPS13D gene are linked to various neurological disorders, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and neurological health (Anding2018Vps13D; Insolera2021Mitochondrial; Leonzino2021Insights).

## Structure
The VPS13D protein is a member of the VPS13 family, characterized by its role in lipid transport and intracellular trafficking. It contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which is crucial for binding K63-linked ubiquitin chains, a feature important for its function in autophagy and mitochondrial regulation (Anding2018Vps13D). The protein also includes a β-propeller/WD40-like domain, which is involved in binding interactions, although specific details about its molecular structure are not extensively detailed (Leonzino2021Insights).

VPS13D localizes to membrane contact sites, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and also to peroxisomes. This localization is mediated by interactions with the outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase Miro and the ER protein VAP, which contains a cytosolic MSP domain (Leonzino2021Insights). The protein's structure is suggested to facilitate its function as a tether between organelles, promoting phospholipid transport essential for mitochondrial fission and mitophagy (Insolera2021Mitochondrial).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate VPS13D's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variants could lead to different isoforms with distinct functions, but these are not explicitly described in the context. Overall, VPS13D's structure supports its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and facilitating lipid transport.

## Function
The VPS13D gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function in healthy human cells. VPS13D is involved in regulating mitochondrial morphology and clearance, processes essential for cellular homeostasis. It functions as a ubiquitin-binding protein, with its ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain binding K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which is crucial for its role in mitochondrial size regulation and clearance (Anding2018Vps13D).

VPS13D is also implicated in the regulation of contact sites between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which are vital for autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics. It interacts with proteins such as Marf and Mfn2 at these contact sites, facilitating their disassembly, a necessary step for proper mitophagy (Shen2021Vmp1). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for various cellular processes, including lipid exchange, calcium signaling, and intracellular trafficking (Shen2021Vmp1).

The absence of VPS13D is incompatible with cellular and organismal life, highlighting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. Genetic defects in VPS13D can lead to abnormal mitochondrial morphology and impaired mitophagy, contributing to various diseases (Ugur2020Role; Leonzino2021Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS13D gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily characterized by movement disorders such as spastic ataxia, spastic paraplegia, and hyperkinetic movement disorders. These conditions often present with symptoms including developmental delay, axial hypotonia, chorea, dystonia, tremor, and progressive spastic ataxia or paraparesis (Seong2018Mutations; Gauthier2018Recessive). MRI findings in affected individuals typically show basal ganglia or diffuse white matter T2 hyperintensities, resembling those seen in Leigh syndrome and chorea-acanthocytosis (Gauthier2018Recessive).

The phenotypic spectrum of VPS13D-related disorders is broad, with symptoms ranging from early childhood onset to adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. These disorders are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by altered mitochondrial morphology and reduced ATP synthesis in patient-derived fibroblasts (Seong2018Mutations). The gene is implicated in mitochondrial fission and autophagy, with mutations leading to impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics, contributing to the neurological pathophysiology observed in patients (Insolera2021Mitochondrial).

VPS13D mutations can also result in a variety of other symptoms, including intellectual disability, oculomotor dysfunction, and Leigh-like leukoencephalopathy, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining neurological health (Pauly2023Not).

## Interactions
VPS13D is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy. It interacts with the mitochondrial fission gene Drp1, where both VPS13D and Drp1 mutants exhibit enlarged mitochondria and defects in mitochondrial clearance, suggesting related functions in mitochondrial homeostasis (Anding2018Vps13D). VPS13D also interacts with the mitochondrial fusion regulator Marf (mitofusins in mammals), and the loss of Marf can suppress the phenotypes associated with VPS13D mutations, indicating a pathway involving VPS13D and Marf/MFN2 that regulates interorganelle contacts (Shen2021Vmp1).

VPS13D binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase Miro (Miro1 and Miro2) via its β-propeller/WD40-like/VAB domain, localizing at membrane contact sites such as between the ER and mitochondria, and between mitochondria and lipid droplets (Leonzino2021Insights). This interaction is not conserved in yeast, highlighting a unique role in higher eukaryotes. Additionally, VPS13D interacts with Vmp1, an ER-localized transmembrane protein, suggesting that VPS13D mediates the disassembly of membranes at mitochondria and ER contact sites, which is important for mitophagy and mitochondrial morphology (Shen2021Vmp1). These interactions underscore the critical role of VPS13D in maintaining mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis.
