# BBS10

## Overview
BBS10 is a gene that encodes the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10 protein, a chaperonin-like protein involved in the assembly of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary function. Unlike typical chaperonins, BBS10 lacks ATP-dependent folding activity, yet it plays a significant regulatory role in the interaction of BBS proteins with CCT chaperonins (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl). The BBS10 protein is essential for the proper folding and assembly of BBSome subunits, impacting processes such as vesicle trafficking and signal transduction within cilia (Seo2010BBS6). Mutations in the BBS10 gene are a significant cause of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including obesity, retinal degeneration, and renal abnormalities (Seo2010BBS6; ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl).

## Structure
The BBS10 protein is a chaperonin-like protein involved in the assembly of the BBSome complex, crucial for ciliary function. It shares structural similarities with the CCT family of group II chaperonins but lacks the ATP-dependent folding activity typical of these proteins (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl). The primary structure of BBS10 includes typical chaperonin domain architecture, comprising apical, intermediate, and equatorial domains, with specific insertions that may confer unique roles (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl).

BBS10 is not a structural member of the BBS/CCT/TRiC-chaperonin complex but plays a regulatory role in the interaction of the BBS6-BBS12-BBS7 intermediate with CCT proteins (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl). It can exist in monomeric and dimeric forms and is found at a substoichiometric ratio or transiently associates with the BBS/CCT complex, which has a molecular weight of 770-1,000 kDa (Seo2010BBS6). The quaternary structure of BBS10 is not typical of CCT-like complexes due to specific insertions that prevent monomer-monomer contact (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl). The ATP hydrolysis motif, crucial for protein folding, is significantly different in BBS10 compared to other BBS proteins, suggesting a lack of catalytic activity (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl).

## Function
The BBS10 gene encodes a protein that is part of a chaperonin-like complex involved in the assembly of the BBSome, a crucial protein complex for ciliary function. In healthy human cells, BBS10 interacts with BBS6 and BBS12 to form a complex with CCT/TRiC family chaperonins, which are essential for the proper folding and assembly of BBSome subunits (Seo2010BBS6). Although BBS10 is not a direct component of the BBSome, it plays a critical role in the molecular chaperone function, facilitating the assembly and stability of the BBSome complex, which is vital for vesicle trafficking to the ciliary membrane (Seo2010BBS6).

The BBSome is involved in the transport of proteins and vesicles along microtubules, which is essential for maintaining ciliary structure and function, impacting processes such as signal transduction and sensory perception (Seo2010BBS6). BBS10 is also implicated in broader cellular processes, including membrane receptor signaling and energy metabolism, as evidenced by its role in regulating glycolytic enzyme expression and interactions with proteins involved in mTOR signaling (Marchese2022MultiOmics). These functions highlight the importance of BBS10 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BBS10 gene are a significant cause of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including obesity, retinal degeneration, polydactyly, renal abnormalities, and cognitive impairment (Seo2010BBS6; ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl). BBS is primarily inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, but there is evidence suggesting a more complex oligogenic inheritance model, which may account for the clinical variability observed in patients (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl).

Mutations in BBS10, along with BBS6 and BBS12, are associated with more severe phenotypes of BBS, including earlier onset and a higher prevalence of primary diagnostic features (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl). These mutations can lead to renal abnormalities, which are significant as they can progress to kidney failure and sudden death (Manara2019Mutation). The BBS10 gene is frequently mutated in BBS patients, with studies showing it as one of the most commonly involved genes, affecting a significant portion of patients (Ece2015Targeted; Manara2019Mutation).

The clinical significance of BBS10 mutations is underscored by their impact on the assembly of the BBSome, a multiprotein complex essential for ciliary function. Disruptions in this process due to BBS10 mutations contribute to the diverse and severe clinical manifestations of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (Seo2010BBS6).

## Interactions
BBS10 is a chaperonin-like protein that interacts with other proteins to facilitate the assembly of the BBSome complex, which is essential for ciliogenesis. BBS10 forms a multisubunit complex with BBS6 and BBS12, as well as CCT chaperonins, which are crucial for the assembly of the BBSome (Seo2010BBS6). This complex assists in the folding and stabilization of BBSome subunits, such as BBS7, and mediates their interaction with canonical CCT chaperonins (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl).

BBS10 interacts with BBS7 and BBS9, and its depletion leads to a reduced association of BBS2 and BBS7 with BBS9, indicating its necessity for stable interactions among these subunits (Seo2010BBS6). Mutations in BBS10 can disrupt its interactions with other BBS proteins, such as BBS7, BBS9, and BBS12, which are critical for the formation of the multimeric complex necessary for BBSome assembly (Seo2010BBS6).

Although BBS10 is not a structural component of the BBSome, it plays a regulatory role in the assembly process by interacting with BBSome subunits and assisting in their folding (ÁlvarezSatta2017BardetBiedl).
