# AK2

## Overview
Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) is a gene located on chromosome 1, encoding a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular energy homeostasis. The protein product, adenylate kinase 2, is a kinase that facilitates the reversible transfer of phosphate groups among adenine nucleotides, crucial for maintaining the balance of ATP, ADP, and AMP within cells. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the mitochondrial intermembrane space of various tissues, including the heart, liver, spleen, and kidney, and is integral to processes such as mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis (Ionescu2019Adenylate; Panayiotou2014The). AK2's interactions with proteins like FADD and DUSP26 underscore its involvement in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis (Kim2014The). Clinically, mutations in the AK2 gene are linked to reticular dysgenesis, a severe immunodeficiency disorder, highlighting its critical role in immune function and cellular metabolism (Hoenig2017Reticular; Chou2020Hypomorphic).

## Structure
Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) is a mitochondrial enzyme encoded by the AK2 gene located on chromosome 1 at 1p35.1. The protein consists of 239 amino acid residues and is highly expressed in the mitochondrial intermembrane space of tissues such as the heart, liver, spleen, and kidney (Ionescu2019Adenylate). AK2 shares significant sequence identity with other adenylate kinase isoenzymes, including 45% with human AK3 and 40% with human AK4, and also shows similarity with prokaryotic adenylate kinases, such as 54% identity with Escherichia coli (Ionescu2019Adenylate).

The structure of AK2 includes three functional domains: the CORE domain, which contains the phosphate donor binding glycine-rich region (p-loop), the LID domain, and the substrate binding site. In the absence of ligands, AK2 is in an 'open' conformation, and upon phosphate donor binding, the LID domain closes, facilitating substrate binding and phosphoryl transfer (Panayiotou2014The). AK2 is known to form a complex with FADD and Caspase-10, which is involved in apoptosis (Panayiotou2014The). The enzyme's role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and its correlation with certain medical conditions, such as reticular dysgenesis, highlight its functional importance (Ionescu2019Adenylate).

## Function
Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular energy homeostasis by catalyzing the reversible transfer of phosphate groups among adenine nucleotides, specifically converting AMP and ATP into two molecules of ADP. This reaction occurs in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is essential for the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP by ATP synthase in the mitochondrial matrix, facilitated by the ADP/ATP translocase (Dzeja2009Adenylate; Wang2021Reticular). AK2 is crucial for maintaining the balance of ATP, ADP, and AMP within cells, which is vital for various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and signal transduction (Wang2021Reticular).

AK2 is involved in the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, which is essential for the development and differentiation of leukocytes (Dzeja2009Adenylate). It also plays a role in the conversion of mechanical stimuli to electrical signals in systems like the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells, which is associated with Ca2+ dynamics and myosin motor movement (Dzeja2009Adenylate). AK2's activity is particularly important in cells that do not express its cytosolic counterpart, AK1, as it cannot be compensated by other isoenzymes (Wang2021Reticular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AK2 gene are primarily associated with reticular dysgenesis (RD), a severe form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). RD is characterized by congenital agranulocytosis, profound T-cell lymphopenia, and sensorineural deafness. Patients with RD often present with severe infections shortly after birth due to the lack of immune cells, and the only curative treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Hoenig2017Reticular; Hoenig2017Recent). Various mutations in AK2, including missense, nonsense, splice-site mutations, and deletions, have been identified in patients with RD, leading to impaired protein function and energy metabolism (Hoenig2017Reticular; Chou2020Hypomorphic).

AK2 deficiency also affects hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell development, increasing oxidative stress and apoptosis, as observed in zebrafish models (Rissone2015Reticular). In addition to its role in RD, low expression of AK2 has been linked to poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting its function as a tumor suppressor (Fujisawa2023Regulation). AK2 is also involved in circadian rhythm generation and is necessary for sensory hair cell development and survival, indicating its broader significance in cellular processes beyond immune function (Fujisawa2023Regulation).

## Interactions
Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. AK2 physically interacts with dual-specificity phosphatase 26 (DUSP26), forming a protein complex that enhances the phosphatase activity of DUSP26. This interaction is crucial for the dephosphorylation of the fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), which is involved in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis (Kim2014The). The interaction between AK2 and DUSP26 is enhanced by AK2 overexpression and reduced by AK2 knockdown, indicating a regulatory role of AK2 in this complex (Kim2014The).

AK2 also interacts directly with FADD, facilitating its dephosphorylation. This interaction is independent of AK2's kinase activity, suggesting a structural or regulatory role rather than an enzymatic one (Kim2014The). The N-terminal and middle regions of AK2, including the NMPbind and LID domains, are identified as mediators of FADD dephosphorylation (Kim2014The). AK2's interaction with DUSP26 and FADD is linked to its role in reducing FADD phosphorylation, which correlates with decreased tumorigenicity in vivo (Kim2014The).
