# SLC35F6

## Overview
SLC35F6 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member F6, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes. This protein is primarily localized to lysosomes, where it plays a critical role in lysosomal sorting and function. The proper localization of SLC35F6 is mediated by a specific motif in its cytoplasmic tail, which is essential for its trafficking to lysosomes. The protein's function is significant in maintaining lysosomal integrity and facilitating cellular glycosylation processes, which are crucial for cell growth, survival, and metabolism. Mutations affecting the localization of SLC35F6 can disrupt these processes, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Van2024Residence).

## Function
SLC35F6 is a member of the solute carrier family involved in the transport of nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes. In healthy human cells, SLC35F6 is primarily localized to lysosomes, where it plays a crucial role in lysosomal sorting and function. This localization is mediated by a dileucine-based motif (EQERLL 360) in its cytoplasmic tail, which is essential for its proper trafficking to lysosomes. Mutations in this motif can lead to mislocalization of SLC35F6 to the plasma membrane, indicating its importance in maintaining lysosomal function (Van2024Residence).

SLC35F6 is implicated in the delivery of nucleotide sugars to lysosomes, potentially contributing to the remodeling of the lysosomal glycocalyx. This process is significant as the glycocalyx protects the lysosomal membrane from hydrolytic enzymes. The presence of nucleotide sugars in lysosomes and the potential for SLC35F6 to facilitate their storage and release may also be relevant for extracellular glycosylation processes (Van2024Residence).

The protein's activity in lysosomes suggests a role in cellular glycosylation processes, which are vital for cell growth and survival. Its function in nucleotide sugar transport and lysosomal maintenance underscores its importance in cellular energy homeostasis and metabolism (Van2024Residence).
