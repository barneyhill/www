# GALT

## Overview
The GALT gene encodes the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, a critical component of the Leloir pathway responsible for galactose metabolism. This enzyme, categorized as a transferase, facilitates the conversion of galactose-1-phosphate and UDP-glucose into UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate, thereby playing a vital role in the utilization of galactose derived from dietary sources such as milk. The GALT protein functions as a homodimer, with its enzymatic activity dependent on the proper formation and stability of this dimeric structure. Mutations in the GALT gene can lead to classic galactosemia, a metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites due to impaired galactose metabolism. This condition manifests with severe symptoms in the neonatal period and can result in long-term complications despite dietary management (Coelho2014Functional; McCorvie2011Structural; Bosch2005Identification).

## Structure
The GALT protein, encoded by the GALT gene, is a homodimeric enzyme crucial for galactose metabolism. Each monomer of the enzyme consists of a single domain architecture that includes six alpha-helices and a beta-sheet formed by 13 antiparallel and one parallel strand (Facchiano2009Analysis). The enzyme's active sites are located at the interface of the two subunits, with residues contributed by both subunits forming these sites (Verdino2021Analysis). The catalytic mechanism involves a conserved His-Pro-His sequence, with a nucleophilic histidine at residue 186 playing a key role (Coelho2014Functional).

The tertiary structure of GALT is modeled based on the E. coli GALT structure, given their sequence identity, and has been validated through homology modeling (Marabotti2005Homology). The quaternary structure is a dimeric form, essential for its enzymatic activity, and is stabilized by intersubunit interactions (Verdino2021Analysis). The enzyme also contains two zinc ions, although they are not involved in catalysis (Verdino2021Analysis). Mutations, such as p.Q188R, can disrupt the enzyme's stability and function, leading to conditions like classic galactosemia (Coelho2014Functional).

## Function
The GALT gene encodes the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of galactose-1-phosphate and UDP-glucose into UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate, a key step in the metabolism of galactose, a sugar found in milk and other foods (Lai2003GALT; McCorvie2016Molecular). The GALT enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for converting galactose into glucose, which can then be used for energy production and other cellular functions (Elsas1998The).

In healthy human cells, the proper function of GALT ensures the maintenance of normal levels of UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose, which are important for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. These macromolecules are involved in various cellular processes, including cell-cell recognition, regulation of cell-cycle control, and receptor function (Petry1998The). The enzyme's activity is also crucial for the metabolism of UDP-N-acetyl-hexose-amines, substrates of glycosyltransferases, and important structural elements of glycosaminoglycans (McCorvie2016Molecular). Deficiency in GALT activity can lead to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, resulting in the disorder known as classic galactosemia (Reichardt1991Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GALT gene lead to classic galactosemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. This deficiency impairs the proper metabolism of galactose, resulting in the accumulation of toxic substances in the body. Classic galactosemia presents with acute symptoms in the neonatal period, such as vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, lethargy, hypotonia, and liver dysfunction upon exposure to milk. If untreated, it can lead to severe complications like cataracts, E. coli sepsis, and neonatal death (Coelho2014Functional; Bosch2005Identification).

Despite dietary management to restrict galactose intake, patients often experience long-term complications, including cognitive and neurological disabilities, speech impairment, motor function abnormalities, and ovarian dysfunction in females (Schulpis2017Mutational; Boutron2012Mutation). The most common mutation, p.Q188R, disrupts enzyme function by affecting substrate binding and enzyme stability (Coelho2014Functional; McCorvie2011Structural). Over 230 mutations have been identified in the GALT gene, with significant allelic heterogeneity contributing to the variability in clinical outcomes (Boutron2012Mutation; McCorvie2011Structural).

## Interactions
The human enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) primarily functions as a dimer, forming both homodimers and heterodimers. Studies have shown that GALT can interact with itself to form these dimers, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity. Wild-type GALT forms homodimers with substantial activity, while mutant forms such as Q188R and R333W can form both homodimers and heterodimers with reduced activity. The heterodimers, particularly those involving one wild-type and one mutant subunit, retain 20-30% of the activity of wild-type homodimers (Elsevier1996Heterodimer).

The Q188R mutation, associated with classical galactosemia, affects the stability and activity of GALT dimers. This mutation alters the enzyme's interaction with its ligands and the dimeric interface, leading to impaired enzymatic activity and destabilization of both homo- and heterodimers. The mutation causes steric hindrance and unfavorable electrostatic interactions, reducing the number of hydrogen bonds at the dimer interface (Marabotti2005Homology). These interactions highlight the importance of dimer formation in GALT's function and the impact of genetic mutations on its activity.
