# TBXT

## Overview
The TBXT gene encodes the T-box transcription factor T, commonly referred to as Brachyury, which is a pivotal transcription factor involved in embryonic development and cellular differentiation. This protein is characterized by its T-box domain, a conserved DNA-binding motif that facilitates its role as a transcriptional regulator. TBXT is crucial for the formation of the mesoderm and the development of the notochord, influencing processes such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration. It functions by binding to specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression, thereby impacting cell fate and tissue patterning. Beyond its developmental roles, TBXT is implicated in the pathogenesis of chordoma, a rare cancer, where it acts as an oncogene. Its expression and activity are regulated through various interactions and post-translational modifications, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Bulger2023TBXT; Wilson2002TheTboxfamily; Umbaugh2024Selective).

## Structure
The TBXT protein, also known as Brachyury, is characterized by a conserved T-box domain, which is essential for its DNA-binding function. This domain is relatively large, comprising about a third of the protein, and is crucial for sequence-specific DNA binding to the consensus sequence TCACACCT (Wilson2002TheTboxfamily). The T-box domain features a seven-stranded β-barrel core related to an s-type immunoglobulin fold, which is inherently flexible, particularly in the 'dimerization' region (El2011Structure). This flexibility allows for protein-protein interactions, which are important for the protein's function as a transcriptional regulator (Wilson2002TheTboxfamily).

TBXT can function as a transcriptional activator or repressor, with its regulatory activity requiring sequences in the carboxy-terminal portion of the protein (Wilson2002TheTboxfamily). The protein's structure has been partially elucidated through crystallographic analysis, revealing its unique DNA-binding domain compared to other transcription factors (Wilson2002TheTboxfamily). TBXT may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. Additionally, splice variants of TBXT can result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Umbaugh2024Selective).

## Function
The TBXT gene, also known as Brachyury, is a critical transcription factor involved in early human embryonic development, particularly in mesoderm formation and differentiation. It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression necessary for the development of the notochord and axial skeleton. TBXT is expressed in the primitive streak of early embryos and is essential for the development of the posterior mesoderm (Li2024Contextdependent). 

TBXT influences the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cell motility and migration away from the primitive streak. It regulates the expression of genes involved in EMT, such as SNAI1 and SNAI2, which are upregulated in wild-type cells, promoting a mesenchymal phenotype (Bulger2023TBXT). TBXT also affects the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and signaling pathways, such as the noncanonical WNT signaling, which is important for directed cell migration and mesoderm development (Bulger2023TBXT).

In terms of molecular activity, TBXT binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate the transcription of target genes, influencing cell fate and tissue patterning. It is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcription factors to regulate gene expression (Naiche2005TBox).

## Clinical Significance
The TBXT gene, also known as brachyury, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of chordoma, a rare cancer of the axial skeleton. In chordoma, TBXT acts as an oncogene, with its expression being crucial for tumor formation and maintenance of cancer stem cell populations (Shah2017BrachyuryYAP; Cottone2018Epigenetic). Aberrant expression of TBXT is implicated in chordoma development, with the gene being amplified, duplicated, or overexpressed in a significant number of cases (Umbaugh2024Selective). Inhibition of TBXT expression through targeting histone demethylases or using designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) has been shown to reduce tumor growth and induce cell death in chordoma cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cottone2020Inhibition; Umbaugh2024Selective).

Germline tandem duplication of TBXT is a genetic predisposition event in familial chordoma, and a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within TBXT is associated with increased risk in sporadic cases (Baumhoer2018An; Cottone2018Epigenetic). These genetic alterations underscore the clinical significance of TBXT in chordoma and its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
TBXT, also known as T-box transcription factor T, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function as a transcription factor. TBXT binds to specific DNA enhancer elements, such as hs_T3, hs_C, and hs_I, which are crucial for its autoregulatory mechanism in the notochord (Kemmler2023Conserved). In chordoma cells, TBXT interacts with signaling pathways, including the TGF-β pathway, and may act as a transcription factor or co-regulator, affecting processes like DNA repair and apoptosis (Umbaugh2024Selective).

TBXT is also implicated in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, where it interacts with STAT3 as a potential binding partner. This interaction is significant for maintaining high baseline interferon signaling in chordoma cells (Umbaugh2024Selective). The inhibition of TBXT leads to the modulation of the interferon response pathway, with IGFBP3 playing a role in fine-tuning the modulation of STAT proteins (Umbaugh2024Selective).

Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) have been developed to target TBXT, disrupting its DNA binding and transcriptional activity. These DARPins effectively bind to TBXT, preventing it from interacting with its specific transcription factor binding motifs, thereby inhibiting its function in chordoma cells (Umbaugh2024Selective).
