# SLC37A3

## Overview
SLC37A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 37 member 3, which is a member of the solute carrier family of proteins. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane transporter, predicted to have 12 transmembrane segments, and is involved in the transport of specific molecules across cellular membranes (Yu2018Identification). SLC37A3 forms a functional complex with the type I transmembrane protein ATRAID, localizing to lysosomes where it plays a critical role in the release of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates into the cytosol (Yu2018Identification). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants, and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including insulin secretion and response to osteoporosis treatments (Cappello2018The; Yu2018Identification). Despite its recognized roles, the complete functional and structural properties of SLC37A3 remain to be fully elucidated (Cappello2018The).

## Structure
The SLC37A3 protein is predicted to be a membrane protein with 12 transmembrane segments, suggesting its role as a transporter (Yu2018Identification). It is part of the solute carrier family and shares sequence homology with bacterial organophosphate/phosphate antiporters, although it lacks the predicted glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter activity (Cappello2018The; Yu2018Identification). The protein is encoded by the SLC37A3 gene, which undergoes alternative splicing to produce three different transcripts, with one isoform consisting of 494 amino acids (Cappello2018The).

SLC37A3 forms a complex with ATRAID, a type I transmembrane protein, and this complex localizes to lysosomes, facilitating the release of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates into the cytosol (Yu2018Identification). The interaction between SLC37A3 and ATRAID is crucial for the proper glycosylation and function of SLC37A3, indicating a mutual dependency for their stability (Yu2018Identification). Despite these insights, the precise functional properties and detailed structural characteristics of SLC37A3 remain unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its complete molecular structure and role in cellular processes (Cappello2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC37A3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A mutation in SLC37A3 has been identified in a patient with congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy (CHI), suggesting a potential role in insulin secretion dysregulation, although its exact biological role in pancreatic insulin secretion remains unclear (Cappello2018The). The gene's expression is notably high in murine neutrophils and the pancreas, with lower levels in the liver, kidney, intestine, and macrophages, indicating a possible involvement in immune system function and pancreatic activity (Cappello2018The).

SLC37A3 is also implicated in the transport of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs), which are used in treating osteoporosis. It forms a lysosomal transporter complex with ATRAID, facilitating the release of N-BPs into the cytosol. Genetic variants in SLC37A3 or ATRAID may alter responses to N-BP treatments, potentially affecting susceptibility to side effects (Yu2018Identification). Additionally, SLC37A3 expression is overexpressed in follicular lymphoma, with a fold change of 2.59, suggesting a role in the disease's progression (Magi2019The). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in metabolic regulation and disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
SLC37A3 is known to physically interact with the protein ATRAID, a type I transmembrane protein. This interaction is crucial for the function of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) in cells. SLC37A3 and ATRAID co-localize in lysosomes, where they form a lysosomal transporter complex responsible for the release of N-BP molecules into the cytosol after lysosomal trafficking. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated that SLC37A3 and ATRAID are mutually dependent for their stable expression. The absence of one protein affects the stability of the other, although mRNA levels remain unchanged (Yu2018Identification).

The interaction between SLC37A3 and ATRAID is essential for the glycosylation and stability of SLC37A3. In the absence of ATRAID, only the un-glycosylated form of SLC37A3 is present, indicating that ATRAID is necessary for the proper expression of the mature glycosylated form of SLC37A3 (Yu2018Identification). This interaction is specific to the action of N-BPs, as knockout of these genes does not affect sensitivity to other compounds like lovastatin (Yu2018Identification).
