# MARCKS

## Overview
The MARCKS gene encodes the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and structural dynamics. As a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC), the MARCKS protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal regulation, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction. It is characterized by its myristoylation, which facilitates membrane association, and a highly basic effector domain that interacts with calmodulin and actin. This protein is crucial for modulating the availability of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at the cell membrane, thereby influencing downstream signaling pathways. MARCKS is implicated in numerous physiological functions, such as immune response regulation and neural development, and its dysregulation is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders (Fong2017Myristoylated; Blackshear1993The; MančekKeber2012MARCKS).

## Structure
The MARCKS protein is characterized by its myristoylation at the N-terminus, which facilitates its association with cellular membranes (Blackshear1993The). The protein contains a highly basic effector domain, also known as the phosphorylation site domain (PSD), which is rich in lysine and alanine residues. This domain is crucial for binding to calmodulin and actin, and it contains multiple phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC) (Qin1996Membrane; Blackshear1993The). The phosphorylation of serine residues within this domain by PKC modulates the protein's interaction with membranes and calmodulin, affecting its function in signal transduction (Blackshear1993The).

The secondary structure of the MARCKS protein includes segments of alpha-helix and alpha-turn, but lacks beta-sheet structures (Stumpo1989Molecular). The protein's tertiary structure is influenced by its interaction with membranes, where it adopts an extended conformation at the membrane interface (Qin1996Membrane). The protein's quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the available context.

MARCKS undergoes post-translational modifications, including myristoylation and phosphorylation, which are essential for its membrane association and functional regulation (Blackshear1993The). The protein can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
The MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) protein is a critical component in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It serves as a major substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) and is involved in cytoskeletal control, chemotaxis, motility, inflammatory response mediation, secretion, exocytosis, and neurological function (Fong2017Myristoylated). MARCKS is tethered to the plasma membrane but can shuttle between the cytosol and plasma membrane via the myristoyl-electrostatic switch, a process regulated by phosphorylation (Fong2017Myristoylated).

MARCKS plays a significant role in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at the cell membrane, inhibiting its hydrolysis by phospholipase C, which affects downstream signaling pathways (Fong2017Myristoylated). It also interacts with F-actin, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility (Fong2017Myristoylated). In the immune system, MARCKS acts as a negative regulator of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling, modulating the immune response by binding and neutralizing LPS, thereby impacting TLR4 activation (MančekKeber2012MARCKS).

In the nervous system, MARCKS is highly expressed and necessary for normal brain development, with its disruption leading to severe developmental abnormalities (Stumpo1995MARCKS). The protein's ability to bind to anionic phospholipids and its involvement in actin crosslinking are crucial for its function in cellular processes (MančekKeber2012MARCKS).

## Clinical Significance
The MARCKS gene plays a significant role in various hematological malignancies and solid tumors, with its expression and phosphorylation status influencing cancer progression and treatment resistance. In hematological cancers, MARCKS is implicated in the development of blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. Its expression is upregulated in Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt Lymphoma cells, suggesting a role in B-lymphocyte activation (Iyer2021Pathophysiological). In chronic myelogenous leukemia, MARCKS is involved in cell differentiation and is affected by treatments like curcumin (Iyer2021Pathophysiological). In multiple myeloma, MARCKS is associated with drug resistance, particularly against bortezomib, and its inhibition can enhance drug sensitivity (Iyer2021Pathophysiological).

In solid tumors, MARCKS is linked to cancer progression and metastasis. In lung cancer, its phosphorylation correlates with advanced stages and metastasis, predicting shorter survival (Chiu2022The). In breast cancer, MARCKS overexpression is associated with aggressive subtypes and poor survival (Chiu2022The). In glioblastoma, MARCKS affects radiation sensitivity, with non-phosphorylated mutants showing increased radiation sensitization (Eustace2019Myristoylated). These findings highlight the context-dependent role of MARCKS in cancer, influenced by its phosphorylation status and cellular localization.

## Interactions
MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with actin, playing a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton by binding and cross-linking actin filaments. This interaction is modulated by protein kinase C (PKC) and calmodulin (CaM), which inhibit MARCKS' ability to bind actin, suggesting a role in actin dynamics and cytoskeletal regulation (ARBUZOVA2002Crosstalk).

MARCKS also interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), sequestering it at the plasma membrane. This interaction is regulated by PKC and CaM, affecting PIP2 availability for other cellular processes (ARBUZOVA2002Crosstalk). The protein's effector domain is crucial for these interactions, as it binds to acidic lipids in membranes and is involved in reversible translocation between the membrane and cytosol (ARBUZOVA2002Crosstalk).

In neuronal cells, MARCKS interacts with a CDC42-centered signaling network, influencing neurite initiation and dendritic arborization. It is suggested to coordinate the localization and interaction of proteins involved in neurite formation, such as CDC42, ARF1, SRGAP2, and PAK4, which are implicated in actin polymerization and neurite dynamics (Brudvig2018MARCKS).
