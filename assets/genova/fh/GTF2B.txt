# GTF2B

## Overview
The GTF2B gene encodes the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB), a pivotal component in the transcription machinery of eukaryotic cells. TFIIB is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, acting as a bridge between the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and RNA polymerase II to facilitate the assembly of the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter regions of genes (O’Brien2021Beyond). This protein is involved not only in transcription initiation but also in transcription termination and gene looping, processes that enhance transcription efficiency and accuracy (O’Brien2021Beyond; Medler2011Evidence). TFIIB's interactions with other transcription factors and its dynamic expression across different cell types underscore its importance in regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation (Gelev2014A). Dysregulation of GTF2B has been implicated in various diseases, including certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Cai2021Transcription; Ruan2021Overexpression).

## Function
The GTF2B gene encodes the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB), which plays a critical role in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in human cells. TFIIB is essential for the formation of the preinitiation complex (PIC), where it acts as a bridge between the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and RNA polymerase II, facilitating the recruitment of the polymerase to the promoter region of genes (O’Brien2021Beyond). TFIIB interacts with promoter DNA and other transcription factors, such as TFIID and TFIIF, to ensure accurate transcription start site selection and initiation (O’Brien2021Beyond).

Beyond its role in transcription initiation, TFIIB is involved in transcription termination and gene looping. It localizes to the 3' end of genes, interacting with components of the 3' end processing-termination machinery, which is crucial for the recruitment of termination factors (O’Brien2021Beyond). TFIIB also participates in gene looping by forming complexes with poly(A) polymerase and cleavage factor 1 subunits, which bring the 5' and 3' ends of a gene in proximity, enhancing transcription efficiency (Medler2011Evidence).

TFIIB's expression is dynamically regulated and varies between cell types, influencing cell growth and differentiation. It is not universally required for transcription initiation across all human genes, as some genes can initiate transcription without TFIIB (Gelev2014A).

## Clinical Significance
GTF2B (general transcription factor IIB) plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases. In growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas, GTF2B regulates the expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP), a tumor suppressor gene. Alterations in GTF2B's interaction with AIP can influence tumor phenotypes, leading to more aggressive forms of these adenomas. Low expression of AIP, regulated by GTF2B, is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to conventional therapies in these tumors (Cai2021Transcription).

In colon cancer, GTF2B is involved in the LINC00355-GTF2B-ITGA2 axis, where it mediates the expression of integrin alpha-2 (ITGA2), promoting cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. The overexpression of LINC00355 enhances GTF2B's activity, contributing to the aggressive characteristics of colon cancer. Targeting this axis may offer therapeutic potential in managing colon cancer progression (Ruan2021Overexpression).

While GTF2B's expression levels were not significantly altered in neuroblastoma, its role in transcriptional regulation suggests that it may still contribute to the disease's pathogenesis through complex interactions with other transcription factors and regulatory elements (Di2008Involvement).

## Interactions
GTF2B, also known as general transcription factor IIB, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for transcription initiation. It is a component of the transcription preinitiation complex and interacts with RNA polymerase II, facilitating its recruitment to the transcription start site. GTF2B also interacts with other transcription factors such as TFIID, TFIIE, and TFIIF, playing a role in stabilizing the transcription machinery at the promoter region (Gelev2014A).

In the context of growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas, GTF2B binds to the intergenic-5U element of the AIP promoter, enhancing AIP transcription. This interaction is crucial for regulating AIP expression, which influences tumor phenotypes (Cai2021Transcription). GTF2B's binding to the intergenic-5U element is essential for AIP transcription, as demonstrated by luciferase reporter assays (Cai2021Transcription).

In colon cancer, GTF2B interacts with the long non-coding RNA LINC00355, which recruits GTF2B to the ITGA2 promoter region. This interaction enhances ITGA2 expression, promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. The physical interaction between GTF2B and LINC00355 is confirmed through RIP and ChIP assays (Ruan2021Overexpression). These interactions highlight GTF2B's role in transcription regulation and its involvement in various cellular processes.
