# DGAT2

## Overview
The DGAT2 gene encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2, which is a critical component of lipid metabolism, specifically in the synthesis of triglycerides. This enzyme is categorized as an integral membrane protein and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the esterification of diacylglycerol with fatty acyl-CoA to form triacylglycerols (TAGs) (BhattWessel2018Role; Yen2008Thematic). DGAT2 is essential for energy storage and is highly expressed in tissues such as the liver and adipose tissue, which are involved in lipid droplet formation and energy homeostasis (BhattWessel2018Role). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining physiological functions, including skin barrier integrity and energy balance during the perinatal period (Yen2008Thematic). Mutations in the DGAT2 gene have been linked to metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Kantartzis2009The).

## Structure
The DGAT2 protein is an integral membrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in triglyceride synthesis. It contains two transmembrane domains near its N-terminus, which are separated by a short loop of approximately 5-8 amino acids. These domains are responsible for targeting DGAT2 to the ER, with both the N- and C-termini exposed to the cytosol (Stone2006Membrane; McFie2018Diacylglycerol). A specific 17-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region (amino acids 293-309) is necessary for targeting DGAT2 to lipid droplets, allowing interaction with lipid droplets even in the absence of its transmembrane domains (McFie2018Diacylglycerol).

The protein contains a conserved sequence, HPHG, crucial for enzymatic function, and a neutral lipid-binding domain within the first transmembrane domain, essential for full enzymatic activity (Stone2006Membrane). DGAT2 is susceptible to thiol-specific modifying reagents, with cysteine residues playing a significant role in its function. Mutations at specific cysteine residues result in decreased catalytic activity, indicating their importance (Jung2017Inactivation). The protein may function as part of a multimeric complex, with disulfide crosslinking affecting its regulation (Jung2017Inactivation).

## Function
The DGAT2 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism by catalyzing the final step of triglyceride synthesis. This enzyme is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells, where it facilitates the esterification of diacylglycerol (DG) with fatty acyl-CoA to form TAGs (BhattWessel2018Role; Yen2008Thematic). DGAT2 is integral to lipid metabolism and energy storage, contributing to the formation of lipid droplets, which are essential for storing energy-dense TAGs (BhattWessel2018Role).

DGAT2 is highly expressed in tissues that produce large amounts of TAGs, such as the liver and adipose tissues, and is involved in channeling TAG products into cytosolic lipid droplets or TG-rich lipoproteins for secretion (Yen2008Thematic). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis, as evidenced by its role in adipocyte differentiation and its significant expression during this process (Cases2001Cloning).

In addition to its metabolic functions, DGAT2 is involved in maintaining skin barrier function and is essential for synthesizing TAGs during the perinatal period, with its deficiency leading to severe physiological consequences (Yen2008Thematic). The enzyme's activity is sensitive to substrate concentrations and is more potent than DGAT1, particularly at lower concentrations of oleoyl-CoA (Yen2008Thematic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DGAT2 gene have been implicated in several metabolic disorders. DGAT2 is involved in triglyceride synthesis, and its dysfunction can lead to conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance. Studies have shown that variations in the DGAT2 gene may contribute to the dissociation between liver fat accumulation and insulin resistance, suggesting a complex role in metabolic regulation (Kantartzis2009The). 

In humans, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DGAT2, such as rs1944438, have been associated with differences in liver fat reduction during lifestyle interventions, although these variations do not appear to directly affect insulin sensitivity (Kantartzis2009The). 

In animal models, DGAT2 deficiency leads to severe lipopenia and skin barrier abnormalities, highlighting its critical role in lipid metabolism and skin function. DGAT2-deficient mice exhibit significant reductions in triglyceride content, leading to energy homeostasis issues and early postnatal death (Stone2004Lipopenia). These findings suggest that DGAT2 is essential for maintaining normal lipid levels and energy balance, and its deficiency can result in severe physiological disruptions. 

While DGAT2's role in obesity is less clear, studies have not found significant associations between common DGAT2 polymorphisms and early onset obesity, although rare variants may still influence body weight regulation (Friedel2007Mutation).

## Interactions
DGAT2 (diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2) is known to participate in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in triglyceride synthesis. It interacts with monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (MGAT2), forming a complex that enhances triacylglycerol (TG) synthesis. This interaction is facilitated by the transmembrane domains of DGAT2 and is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, showing that DGAT2 and MGAT2 co-localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and on lipid droplets (Jin2014Diacylglycerol).

DGAT2 also interacts with calnexin, an ER chaperone involved in protein folding and calcium homeostasis. This interaction was identified using a BioId approach and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. The interaction with calnexin does not affect DGAT2's localization or stability but is associated with changes in lipid droplet morphology and triglyceride levels in calnexin-deficient cells (Brandt2019Identification).

Additionally, DGAT2 forms complexes with other proteins such as fatty acid transporter protein 1 (FATP1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which are involved in lipid metabolism. These interactions facilitate efficient substrate channeling for TG synthesis (BhattWessel2018Role; McFie2018Diacylglycerol).
