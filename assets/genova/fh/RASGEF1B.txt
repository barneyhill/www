# RASGEF1B

## Overview
RASGEF1B is a gene that encodes the protein RasGEF domain family member 1B, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specifically for Ras-related proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating Ras proteins involved in critical cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Telkoparan2013CoiledCoil). As a GEF, RasGEF domain family member 1B is integral to the regulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which is essential for cell cycle progression and immune response modulation (Korotayev2008ERK; Fernandes2023Transcriptomic). The protein's interactions, particularly with the coiled-coil domain containing protein 124 (Ccdc124) and the small G protein Rap2, underscore its role in cytokinesis and immune function (Telkoparan2013CoiledCoil). Alterations in the RASGEF1B gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and immune-related diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Komlósi2015Phenotypic; Fernandes2023Transcriptomic).

## Function
RASGEF1B encodes a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ras-related proteins, specifically facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP. This activity is crucial for activating Ras proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Telkoparan2013CoiledCoil). In healthy human cells, RASGEF1B plays a significant role in cytokinesis, the process of cell division, by interacting with the coiled-coil domain containing protein 124 (Ccdc124) and the small G protein Rap2. RASGEF1B colocalizes with Ccdc124 at the midbody during late stages of cytokinesis, suggesting a role in linking cytokinesis to RasGEF1B-dependent signaling (Telkoparan2013CoiledCoil).

RASGEF1B is also involved in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, where it is a transcriptional target of E2F1. This pathway is essential for E2F1-induced S phase entry, highlighting RASGEF1B's role in cell cycle regulation (Korotayev2008ERK). In macrophages, RASGEF1B regulates gene expression related to immune functions, affecting genes involved in chemotaxis and cytokine responses, which are crucial for monocyte recruitment and immune response (Fernandes2023Transcriptomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RASGEF1B gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. RASGEF1B is located within the 4q21 chromosomal region, and its deletion is associated with 4q21 microdeletion syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by growth restriction, developmental delay, speech absence, and distinctive facial features. The gene is considered a strong candidate for the neurodevelopmental features observed in this syndrome due to its high expression in the central nervous system and potential influence on cognitive impairment (Komlósi2015Phenotypic; Lebedev2016A).

In addition to deletions, microtriplications involving RASGEF1B have been reported, leading to similar developmental delays and speech absence, suggesting that both loss and gain of function in this region can contribute to these phenotypes (Lebedev2016A). The gene's role in immune responses is also significant, as its deletion in macrophages affects the expression of genes involved in chemotaxis and cytokine responses, potentially linking it to immune-related diseases (Fernandes2023Transcriptomic). These findings highlight the importance of RASGEF1B in both neurodevelopmental and immune system functions, with alterations potentially leading to a range of clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
RASGEF1B, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. One of its primary interactions is with the coiled-coil domain containing protein 124 (Ccdc124). This interaction is crucial for cytokinesis, as Ccdc124 and RASGEF1B colocalize at the midbody during the late stages of cell division. Although Ccdc124 does not affect the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of RASGEF1B, it may influence the spatial regulation of RASGEF1B, potentially recruiting it to specific cellular locations such as the midbody, where it can activate its substrate G protein(s) (Telkoparan2013CoiledCoil).

RASGEF1B specifically activates the small G protein Rap2 by stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange. This activation is significant for the regulation of cytokinetic abscission, as Rap2 is involved in the reorganization of the cortical actomyosin network during this process (Telkoparan2013CoiledCoil). The interaction between RASGEF1B and Rap2 has been confirmed in HEK-293 cells, where knockdown of RASGEF1B resulted in reduced levels of active Rap2 (Rap2.GTP), indicating a functional link between RASGEF1B and Rap2 activation (Telkoparan2013CoiledCoil).
