# TMEM168

## Overview
TMEM168 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 168, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with other proteins such as osteopontin (OPN), which plays a role in the extracellular matrix (Fu2017Involvement). TMEM168 has been implicated in both neurological and oncological contexts, notably influencing dopaminergic function in the nucleus accumbens and participating in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in glioblastoma multiforme (Xu2019Inhibition). Its expression levels have been associated with various diseases, including methamphetamine dependence, glioblastoma, and psychiatric disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Norris2019Increased; Fu2017Overexpression).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM168 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and potential mutations. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor, TMEM168 is overexpressed, and higher expression levels are associated with shorter survival times in patients. Silencing TMEM168 in GBM cell lines has been shown to reduce cell viability, induce cell cycle arrest, and promote apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Xu2019Inhibition).

In psychiatric conditions, overexpression of TMEM168 in the mouse nucleus accumbens has been linked to increased anxiety-like behavior and sensorimotor gating deficits, which are relevant to disorders such as schizophrenia. These behavioral changes were reversible with diazepam and risperidone, indicating a potential role for TMEM168 in anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms (Fu2017Overexpression).

Additionally, TMEM168 has been identified as differentially expressed in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, although the specific implications of this finding are not fully detailed (Norris2019Increased). These associations highlight TMEM168 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various conditions.

## Interactions
TMEM168, or transmembrane protein 168, is known to interact with osteopontin (OPN), a member of the extracellular matrix family. This interaction has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation studies, indicating a physical association between TMEM168 and OPN (Fu2017Involvement). The overexpression of TMEM168 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice leads to increased levels of both intracellular and extracellular OPN, suggesting that TMEM168 may influence the secretion and function of OPN (Fu2017Involvement). This interaction is significant in the context of methamphetamine (METH) dependence, as the TMEM168-OPN pathway appears to modulate dopaminergic function in the NAc, thereby affecting METH-induced behaviors (Fu2017Involvement).

In addition to its role in METH dependence, TMEM168 has been implicated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), where its expression is associated with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Silencing TMEM168 in GBM cells results in the suppression of this pathway, as evidenced by decreased expression of β-catenin and related proteins, suggesting a regulatory interaction (Xu2019Inhibition). These findings highlight TMEM168's involvement in both neuronal and cancer-related processes through its interactions with other proteins.
