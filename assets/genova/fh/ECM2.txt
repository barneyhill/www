# ECM2

## Overview
ECM2 is a gene that encodes the extracellular matrix protein 2, which is a component of the extracellular matrix involved in various cellular processes. The protein plays a significant role in the structural integrity and biochemical signaling within the extracellular matrix, influencing cell behavior and tissue homeostasis. ECM2 is implicated in the modulation of tumor microenvironments, particularly in glioma and breast cancer, where it contributes to tumor progression and treatment resistance. The protein is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, as well as immune cell infiltration and immune evasion mechanisms (Li2023High; Bergamaschi2008Extracellular; Giussani2015Tumorextracellular).

## Clinical Significance
High expression of the ECM2 gene is associated with poor clinical outcomes in glioma, particularly in low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of glioma cells, correlating with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. High ECM2 expression is linked to increased immune cell infiltration, including macrophages and neutrophils, which are associated with poor prognosis. It also correlates with enhanced expression of immune checkpoints, suggesting a role in immune evasion. Patients with high ECM2 expression show higher frequencies of TP53, EGFR, and PTEN mutations, which are linked to poor prognoses, and a lower frequency of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, which are associated with favorable outcomes (Li2023High).

In breast cancer, ECM2 is part of a gene cluster associated with tumor progression and treatment resistance. ECM2 tumors are characterized by a clinically aggressive phenotype, often containing luminal B tumors, which are a transition between more aggressive basal-like and less aggressive luminal A phenotypes. These tumors frequently exhibit HER2 amplification and increased levels of hyaluronan, promoting tumor adhesion and metastatic progression (Bergamaschi2008Extracellular; Giussani2015Tumorextracellular).
