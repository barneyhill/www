# BICD2

## Overview
BICD2 (BICD cargo adaptor 2) is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a motor adaptor, crucial for dynein-mediated intracellular transport processes. The BICD2 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate its role as a dynein adaptor by enabling the recruitment of the dynein motor complex to various cellular structures. This recruitment is essential for the microtubule minus end-directed transport of organelles, such as mitochondria and peroxisomes, towards the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) (Hoogenraad2003Bicaudal; Splinter2012BICD2). BICD2 is involved in the positioning of the Golgi apparatus and the trafficking of Rab6-positive vesicles, which are critical for maintaining cellular organization and function (Schlager2014Bicaudal; Splinter2012BICD2). Mutations in the BICD2 gene are associated with several neuromuscular and developmental disorders, including Spinal Muscular Atrophy Lower Extremity Predominant 2 (SMALED2) and brain developmental defects, highlighting its clinical significance (Rossor2020Loss; Tsai2020Impairment).

## Structure
The BICD2 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which are crucial for its function as a dynein adaptor. It contains three predicted coiled-coil domains (CC1-CC3), with the C-terminal CC3 domain being essential for cargo binding (Gibson2023A). The coiled-coil structure of BICD2 undergoes a transition to an α-helix upon binding to cargo proteins like Nup358, which is vital for activating dynein recruitment (Gibson2022Coiltoαhelix). This structural transition is facilitated by a coiled-coil registry shift, promoting the opening of a loop in BICD2 and allowing dynein/dynactin binding (Gibson2022Coiltoαhelix).

BICD2 forms a homodimeric coiled coil, which is a secondary structure that plays a significant role in its interaction with cargo proteins such as Rab6. The interaction with Rab6 involves the Switch 1 and Switch 2 regions, forming a 2:2 hetero-tetramer complex (Zhao2024Molecular). The protein's quaternary structure is further exemplified by its ability to form complexes with Nup358 in a 2:2 stoichiometry, indicating its role in regulating motility by linking dynein dimers to cargoes (Gibson2023A). The structural dynamics of BICD2, including its coiled-coil registry shifts, are crucial for its function in intracellular transport.

## Function
The BICD2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a motor adaptor, playing a crucial role in dynein-mediated intracellular transport processes. BICD2 facilitates the recruitment of the dynein motor complex to various cellular structures, enabling microtubule minus end-directed transport of organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes towards the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) (Hoogenraad2003Bicaudal). The N-terminal domain of BICD2 is particularly important for binding to dynein and dynactin, forming a stable complex essential for the transport of organelles and vesicles (Splinter2012BICD2).

BICD2 is involved in the positioning of the Golgi apparatus and the trafficking of Rab6-positive vesicles, which are critical for maintaining cellular organization and function (Schlager2014Bicaudal; Splinter2012BICD2). The protein also plays a role in nuclear positioning during cell division by recruiting dynein to the nuclear envelope (Splinter2012BICD2). BICD2's interaction with dynein and dynactin is regulated by its C-terminal domain, which binds to cargo, allowing the N-terminal domain to recruit dynein for transport (Hoogenraad2003Bicaudal). This function is essential for proper cellular transport mechanisms and is conserved across species (Splinter2012BICD2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BICD2 gene are associated with several neuromuscular and developmental disorders. Autosomal dominant missense mutations in BICD2 cause Spinal Muscular Atrophy Lower Extremity Predominant 2 (SMALED2), characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy primarily in the lower limbs (Rossor2020Loss; Yi2023Role). These mutations can increase the binding affinity of BICD2 to the dynein-dynactin complex, disrupting intracellular transport and leading to motor neuron degeneration (Oates2013Mutations; Peeters2013Molecular).

BICD2 mutations are also linked to brain developmental defects, such as lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia, due to impaired neuronal migration. These conditions result from disruptions in BICD2's interactions with proteins like Nesprin-2, which are crucial for proper brain development (Tsai2020Impairment; Yi2023Role). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg694Cys, are associated with severe congenital neuromuscular diseases, including arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and cortical malformations (Storbeck2017Phenotypic; Ravenscroft2016Recurrenta).

Additionally, BICD2 mutations have been implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegia and dilated cardiomyopathy, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of BICD2-related disorders (Oates2013Mutations; Luo2022Identification).

## Interactions
BICD2 (BICD cargo adaptor 2) is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in intracellular transport processes. It acts as an adaptor for the dynein-dynactin motor complex, facilitating microtubule-based transport. BICD2 directly binds to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) component RanBP2, which is essential for recruiting dynein to the nuclear envelope and ensuring proper nuclear positioning relative to centrosomes before mitosis (Splinter2010Bicaudal). This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal coiled coil segment of BICD2 binding to a specific fragment of RanBP2 (Splinter2010Bicaudal).

BICD2 also interacts with kinesin-1, although this interaction is distinct from its interaction with dynein and involves a different portion of BICD2 (Splinter2010Bicaudal). The N-terminal region of BICD2 forms a complex with dynein and dynactin, stabilizing their interaction and promoting minus-end-directed transport along microtubules (Splinter2012BICD2). BICD2's interaction with Rab6, a small GTPase, is crucial for its role in vesicle trafficking, as it recruits dynein/dynactin to Rab6-positive exocytotic vesicles (Splinter2010Bicaudal). These interactions highlight BICD2's role as a linker protein, connecting cargo to motor proteins for efficient intracellular transport.
