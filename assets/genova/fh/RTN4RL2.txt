# RTN4RL2

## Overview
RTN4RL2, also known as NgR2, is a gene that encodes the protein reticulon 4 receptor-like 2, which is a member of the Nogo receptor family. This protein is categorized as a synaptic adhesion molecule and is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. It plays a significant role in the development and function of synapses, particularly in the cochlea, where it is involved in neurotransmission between inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. RTN4RL2 is implicated in limiting synaptic plasticity and axonal outgrowth, thereby influencing neuronal growth and connectivity. The protein interacts with various molecules, including myelin-associated glycoprotein and versican, suggesting its involvement in transsynaptic signaling and synapse development (chong2019extracellular; Karagulyan2024Probing).

## Function
RTN4RL2, also known as NgR2, is a synaptic adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in the development and function of synapses in the cochlea, particularly between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). It is part of the Nogo receptor family, which is involved in limiting synaptic plasticity, axonal outgrowth, and regeneration after injury. In the cochlea, RTN4RL2 is expressed in both IHCs and SGNs, where it is essential for normal hearing by ensuring precise neurotransmission at IHC-SGN synapses (Karagulyan2024Probing).

RTN4RL2 is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and interacts with molecules such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), versican, and BAI. These interactions suggest a role in transsynaptic signaling and synapse development (Karagulyan2024Probing). The protein is also involved in the regulation of synaptogenesis and neurite outgrowth, functioning redundantly with other Nogo receptors in vivo (chong2019extracellular). RTN4RL2's expression is enriched in the brain, indicating its involvement in neuronal growth and synapse formation (chong2019extracellular).

## Interactions
RTN4RL2, also known as NgR2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence neuronal growth and connectivity. It interacts with versican, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, particularly binding to its C-terminal G3 domain. This interaction is crucial for mediating the repulsive effects of versican on sensory neurons, affecting epidermal innervation by controlling the density of nonpeptidergic nociceptive fibers (Bäumer2014Nogo). NgR2 also binds to versican isoforms V0, V1, and V3, with the interaction being specific and independent of glycosaminoglycan chains (Bäumer2014Nogo).

RTN4RL2 interacts with the αVβ3 integrin in neuroendocrine prostate cancer, where it acts as a cofactor affecting integrin function. This interaction is associated with neuroendocrine differentiation and is regulated by the expression of αVβ3 integrin (Quaglia2022The).

Additionally, RTN4RL2 has been identified as a binding partner of ADGRB1, a member of the Nogo receptor family. This interaction is mediated by the thrombospondin repeats on ADGRB1 and is specific, as it does not occur with the closely related ADGRB2 (chong2019extracellular).
