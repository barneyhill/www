# GLIPR1L2

## Overview
GLIPR1L2 is a gene that encodes the GLIPR1-like 2 protein, which is part of the GLIPR subfamily of proteins. This subfamily includes GLIPR1, GLIPR1L1, and GLIPR1L3, and is characterized by the presence of a glutamate-rich domain, which may contribute to the protein's structural stability and its ability to engage in protein-protein interactions (Gaikwad2020The). The GLIPR1-like 2 protein has been identified as a novel interactor with protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α) in the human brain, suggesting a potential role in cellular signaling pathways (Esteves2012Protein). Although the precise biological functions of GLIPR1L2 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including its tumor-suppressor role in lung cancer and its association with psychiatric conditions and child appetitive traits, highlights its significance in human health and disease (Hutarew2024GenomeWide; Kuo2015GenomeWide; Harris2023An).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The GLIPR1L2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and genetic mutations. In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the GLIPR1L2 gene is located in a region associated with ASD risk, although its specific role remains unclear. A nonsense de novo mutation in GLIPR1L2 has been identified in schizophrenic patients, suggesting a potential link to psychiatric conditions (Kuo2015GenomeWide).

In cancer research, GLIPR1L2 is noted for its tumor-suppressor role in lung cancer. Its expression is downregulated during lung tumorigenesis, indicating that reduced GLIPR1L2 expression may contribute to tumor growth and progression (Hutarew2024GenomeWide). The gene is also expressed in various diseased tissues, including the prostate, bladder, kidney, and bone marrow, suggesting a potential role in these conditions, although specific clinical implications are not detailed (Gaikwad2020The).

GLIPR1L2 is associated with child appetitive traits, particularly food avoidance behaviors. DNA methylation in GLIPR1L2 is linked to maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, but its association with appetitive traits persists independently of maternal BMI, indicating a potential role in early expression of these traits (Harris2023An).

## Interactions
GLIPR1L2 is identified as a novel interactor of protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α) in the human brain, as discovered through a Yeast Two-Hybrid (YTH) screening method. This study identified 66 different protein-protein interactions, with GLIPR1L2 being one of the novel proteins interacting with PP1α. However, the specific details about the physical interactions of GLIPR1L2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the study (Esteves2012Protein).

GLIPR1L2 is part of the GLIPR subfamily of proteins, which includes GLIPR1, GLIPR1L1, and GLIPR1L3. GLIPR1L2 is noted to have a glutamate-rich domain (ERD) containing 32 glutamate residues, which is suggested to mediate structural stability during protein-protein interactions. Despite this, the specific function of this domain in GLIPR1L2 remains unknown, and no direct evidence of its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids is provided (Gaikwad2020The).

Overall, while GLIPR1L2 is implicated in protein-protein interactions, particularly with PP1α, detailed mechanisms or specific interaction partners remain to be elucidated.
