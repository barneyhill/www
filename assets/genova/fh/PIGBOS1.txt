# PIGBOS1

## Overview
PIGBOS1 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial microprotein PIGB opposite strand 1, which is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane. This microprotein is characterized as a single-pass transmembrane protein and plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis by regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and calcium homeostasis. PIGBOS1 interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein CLCC1 at ER-mitochondria contact sites, facilitating inter-organelle communication essential for modulating UPR signaling and preventing ER stress-induced apoptosis. The gene is located on the opposite strand of the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class B (PIGB) gene and consists of two exons. The protein's involvement in calcium dynamics also suggests potential neuroprotective effects, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular function and survival (Seemanti2023Mitochondrial; Chu2019Regulation).

## Structure
PIGBOS1 is a 54-amino acid microprotein localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane. It is characterized as a single-pass transmembrane protein, with its transmembrane region spanning amino acids 7-29 (Chu2019Regulation; Lafranchi2020Universal). The protein's C-terminus is cytoplasmic and is essential for its interaction with the ER protein CLCC1, occurring at ER-mitochondria contact sites (Chu2019Regulation). 

The tertiary structure of PIGBOS1 is suggested to involve oligomerization, potentially forming a homodimer through its transmembrane region, as predicted by TMDOCK analysis. This oligomerization is thought to compensate for the protein's small size, allowing it to maintain a specific structure necessary for its role in unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling (Chu2019Regulation). 

PIGBOS1 is located on the opposite strand of the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class B (PIGB) gene and consists of two exons (Chu2019Regulation). The protein's interaction with CLCC1 is crucial for its function in regulating ER stress-induced apoptosis, highlighting its role in cellular homeostasis and survival (Chu2019Regulation).

## Function
PIGBOS1 is a mitochondrial microprotein that plays a crucial role in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) in healthy human cells. It is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein CLCC1 at ER-mitochondria contact sites. This interaction is essential for modulating UPR signaling, which is a cellular stress response related to protein folding in the ER (Chu2019Regulation). The absence of PIGBOS1 leads to heightened UPR activity and increased sensitivity to ER stressors, resulting in elevated apoptosis, indicating its protective role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Chu2019Regulation).

PIGBOS1 is also involved in cellular calcium homeostasis, which is critical for various physiological processes. It influences calcium dynamics by facilitating the transfer of calcium ions from the ER to mitochondria, potentially offering neuroprotective effects and playing a role in preventing neurodegenerative diseases (Seemanti2023Mitochondrial). The protein's function in these processes underscores its importance in inter-organelle communication and stress response regulation, contributing to cell survival and homeostasis (Liao2020The; Chu2019Regulation).

## Interactions
PIGBOS1, a microprotein localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane, is known to interact with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein CLCC1. This interaction occurs at ER-mitochondria contact sites and is crucial for the regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Chu2019Regulation). The interaction between PIGBOS1 and CLCC1 is not a simple tethering mechanism but involves specific contact sites that facilitate inter-organelle communication (Chu2019Regulation). The C-terminal region of PIGBOS1 is essential for its interaction with CLCC1, as alterations in this region disrupt the interaction (Chu2019Regulation).

PIGBOS1's interaction with CLCC1 is significant for cellular stress responses, as the absence of PIGBOS1 leads to heightened UPR and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Steinberg2021The; Chu2019Regulation). The interaction is not influenced by ER stress, suggesting a stable association under various cellular conditions (Chu2019Regulation). PIGBOS1 may also oligomerize to form a tertiary structure necessary for its function and interaction with CLCC1, supported by evidence of interactions between human and rat PIGBOS proteins (Chu2019Regulation).
