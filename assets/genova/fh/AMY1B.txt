# AMY1B

## Overview
The AMY1B gene is a member of the amylase gene family, which encodes the enzyme amylase alpha 1B, a type of glycoside hydrolase. This enzyme is primarily responsible for the breakdown of dietary starches into simpler sugars, facilitating carbohydrate digestion and absorption. Located on chromosome 1p21.1, AMY1B is part of a gene cluster that includes other amylase genes, such as AMY1A and AMY1C, and is characterized by significant copy number variation among individuals. This genetic variability influences the enzyme's concentration and activity, impacting metabolic processes such as glucose metabolism and visceral fat accumulation (Barber2020AMY1; Liu2020Salivary). Beyond its digestive role, amylase alpha 1B is expressed in various tissues, indicating potential functions in the central nervous system, liver, and reproductive organs (Marquina2019Increased).

## Function
The AMY1B gene encodes for the enzyme salivary amylase, which plays a crucial role in the initial stages of starch digestion. This enzyme is primarily active in the salivary glands, where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch, breaking it down into simpler sugars such as maltose, isomaltose, and oligosaccharides (Elder2018Human; Barber2020AMY1). This process begins in the oral cavity during mastication, facilitating the digestion of dietary carbohydrates and influencing glucose metabolism (Liu2020Salivary).

The AMY1B gene is part of a gene cluster located on chromosome 1p21.1, which includes other amylase genes such as AMY1A and AMY1C. These genes exhibit significant copy number variation (CNV) among individuals, which affects the concentration and activity of salivary amylase (Barber2020AMY1). The enzyme's activity is not limited to the digestive tract; it is also expressed in other tissues, including the central nervous system, liver, and reproductive organs, suggesting additional roles beyond starch digestion (Marquina2019Increased). The variation in AMY1B copy number is associated with metabolic traits, including glucose absorption and visceral fat volume, although it does not correlate with insulin resistance (Barber2020AMY1).
