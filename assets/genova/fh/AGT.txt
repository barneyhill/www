# AGT

## Overview
The AGT gene encodes angiotensinogen, a non-inhibitory serpin protein that plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system, which is essential for regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. Angiotensinogen is primarily synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma, where it serves as the precursor to angiotensin I. Upon cleavage by the enzyme renin, angiotensin I is further processed into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that significantly influences cardiovascular function (Lu2016Structure; Corvol2003Inhibition). Beyond its role in blood pressure regulation, angiotensinogen exhibits antiangiogenic properties, contributing to vascular stability and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (Célérier2002Angiotensinogen). Mutations and polymorphisms in the AGT gene are associated with various clinical conditions, including hypertension and renal disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Inoue1997A; Gribouval2011Spectrum).

## Structure
Angiotensinogen (AGT) is a member of the non-inhibitory serpin superfamily and serves as the precursor for all angiotensin peptides. The primary structure of AGT includes a unique N-terminal extension that encodes Angiotensin I (AngI), distinguishing it from other serpins (Lu2016Structure). The secondary structure of AGT features a central beta-sheet and a surface-exposed reactive loop, typical of serpins (Yan2019Structural). 

The tertiary structure of AGT is globular, with the N-terminal tail sequestered in its native form, forming hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with the body of the protein. This configuration protects the scissile bond from non-specific cleavage (Yan2019Structural). AGT undergoes significant conformational changes upon binding to renin, which are necessary for the exposure of the cleavage site (Yan2019Structural). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are significant for AGT's function. Glycosylation at Asn14 affects the efficiency of angiotensin I release, with unglycosylated AGT being a better substrate for renin (Yan2019Structural). AGT can also polymerize under certain conditions, forming beadlike, linear chains through non-covalent and disulfide linkages (Stanley2006Polymerization). These structural features and modifications are crucial for AGT's role in the renin-angiotensin system.

## Function
Angiotensinogen (AGT) is a precursor to angiotensin I, playing a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin system, which is vital for blood pressure regulation and fluid balance. AGT is primarily synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma. Upon cleavage by renin, it produces angiotensin I, which is further processed into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that influences blood pressure and fluid homeostasis (Lu2016Structure; Corvol2003Inhibition).

Beyond its role in the renin-angiotensin system, AGT and its derivative des(Ang I)AGT exhibit antiangiogenic properties, inhibiting the formation of new blood vessels. This function is significant in maintaining vascular stability, such as in the blood-brain barrier, and is observed at physiological concentrations (Célérier2002Angiotensinogen; Corvol2003Inhibition). AGT is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and astrocytes in the brain, where it may contribute to blood-brain barrier integrity (Stornetta1988Astrocytes; Corvol2003Inhibition).

AGT's structure is similar to other serpins, although it is classified as a noninhibitory serpin, suggesting its antiangiogenic effects are not related to typical protease inhibition (Célérier2002Angiotensinogen; Corvol2003Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AGT gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily related to hypertension and renal disorders. A nucleotide substitution in the promoter region of the AGT gene, where adenine replaces guanine six base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site, is linked to essential hypertension. This substitution affects the basal transcription rate of the gene, potentially predisposing individuals to hypertension by influencing gene expression (Inoue1997A). The presence of adenine at this position results in higher expression levels, which may contribute to increased blood pressure (Inoue1997A).

The AGT gene is also implicated in autosomal recessive renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD), a severe condition characterized by renal failure and hypotension. Mutations in the AGT gene, including missense and truncating mutations, have been identified in patients with RTD, leading to low angiotensin I production despite high plasma renin levels (Gribouval2011Spectrum).

Additionally, AGT polymorphisms, such as the M235T variant, have been associated with increased plasma AGT levels and a higher prevalence of hypertension in certain populations (Dickson2006Genetic). These genetic variations may confer a small risk for hypertension and are linked to various cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular phenotypes (Dickson2006Genetic).

## Interactions
Angiotensinogen (AGT) interacts with several proteins within the renin-angiotensin system, playing a crucial role in blood pressure regulation. AGT is cleaved by renin, an aspartic protease, to release angiotensin I, which is further processed into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. The interaction between AGT and renin is highly specific, involving the docking of AGT's N-terminal tail into the substrate-binding pocket of renin. This interaction is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, with significant conformational changes in AGT facilitating the cleavage process (Yan2019Structural).

Glycosylation of AGT, particularly at Asn14, affects its interaction with renin by altering enzyme kinetic parameters. Unglycosylated AGT is a better substrate for renin cleavage compared to its glycosylated form, as the carbohydrate at Asn14 forms stabilizing hydrogen bonds that are disrupted during renin binding (Yan2019Structural).

AGT also interacts with the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-KB) transcription factor, specifically the Rel A subunit, in the context of gene expression regulation. Angiotensin II induces AGT gene expression in hepatocytes through this interaction, which is mediated by the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) (Li1996Angiotensinogen).
