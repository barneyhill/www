# ASPDH

## Overview
The ASPDH gene encodes the aspartate dehydrogenase domain-containing protein, which plays a significant role in cellular metabolism and signaling. This protein is primarily involved in the dehydrogenation of L-aspartate, a critical step in the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway, essential for energy production and metabolic processes (He2022Identification; Brunner2020Is). Additionally, ASPDH has been identified as a novel NAADP-binding protein, suggesting a potential role in calcium signaling pathways, although its precise function in these pathways is not yet fully understood (He2022Identification). The protein is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels in the liver and kidneys, indicating its importance in these organs (Brunner2020Is). While mutations in the ASPDH gene have been linked to certain skin disorders, further research is necessary to elucidate its broader clinical significance and potential involvement in other diseases (Brunner2020Is).

## Function
The ASPDH gene encodes the aspartate dehydrogenase protein, which is involved in the dehydrogenation of L-aspartate to iminoaspartate, a process that utilizes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or NADP as electron acceptors (He2022Identification). This reaction is part of the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway, which is crucial for cellular metabolism and energy production (Brunner2020Is). ASPDH is expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of various human tissues, with the highest levels found in the liver and kidneys (Brunner2020Is).

In addition to its role in amino acid metabolism, ASPDH has been identified as a novel NAADP-binding protein. NAADP (Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is a signaling molecule that induces calcium release from intracellular stores, playing a role in various physiological processes (He2022Identification). ASPDH binds NAADP with medium affinity, suggesting a potential involvement in calcium signaling pathways, although its specific function in these pathways remains unclear (He2022Identification). The protein's activity in these processes highlights its potential importance in cellular signaling and metabolic regulation, although further research is needed to fully understand its role in healthy human cells (He2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASPDH gene have been implicated in certain skin disorders, as evidenced by a case study involving a Holstein calf. The calf exhibited ulcerative skin lesions, alopecia, and deep ulcerative lesions, which were linked to a de novo nonsense variant in the ASPDH gene. Histopathological examination suggested a subepidermal vesicular dermatosis, indicating a potential connection between ASPDH mutations and skin conditions. Although the ASPDH gene is primarily associated with the synthesis of iminoaspartate in the NAD(+) biosynthesis pathway and is highly expressed in the liver and kidneys, its role in skin disorders is not well-established. The findings from this study suggest that haploinsufficiency of the ASPDH gene might contribute to the development of these skin lesions, although ASPDH has not been previously associated with genodermatoses (Brunner2020Is).

Further research is needed to confirm the involvement of ASPDH in skin disorders and to explore its potential role in other diseases. Understanding the clinical significance of ASPDH mutations could provide insights into novel therapeutic targets for conditions related to its altered expression or function.
