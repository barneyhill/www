# ZYG11A

## Overview
ZYG11A is a gene that encodes the protein zyg-11 family member A, a cell cycle regulator that is part of the ZYG11 protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an armadillo-like (ARM) domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for its function. ZYG11A plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system as a substrate recognition subunit of the E3 ligase enzyme complex, contributing to the regulation of protein degradation pathways. It is particularly involved in the degradation of cyclin B1, a key protein for cell cycle progression, thereby influencing mitotic exit and cell division. The protein's function is essential in various cellular contexts, including pancreatic beta-cells, where it supports cell cycle regulation and proliferation. Mutations in the ZYG11A gene have been linked to diseases such as diabetes and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in cell cycle regulation and disease pathogenesis (Achlaug2021ZYG11A; Charoensuk2021Autosomal; Balachandran2016The).

## Structure
The ZYG11A protein is a member of the ZYG11 protein family and is composed of 759 amino acids. It features an armadillo-like (ARM) domain and three leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Charoensuk2021Autosomal). The ARM domain and LRR motifs contribute to the protein's secondary structure, which likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of these domains. The tertiary structure of ZYG11A has been modeled using I-TASSER, revealing a confidence score of -0.75 and a topological similarity score of 0.62±0.14, indicating a predicted 3D conformation (Charoensuk2021Autosomal).

A specific mutation, p.L475P, located between the LRR2 and LRR3 motifs, is noted for its potential to disrupt the protein's structure due to the unique backbone structure of proline, which may lead to a loss of hydrophobic interactions essential for proper protein folding (Charoensuk2021Autosomal). This mutation is associated with deleterious effects on the protein's function, particularly in the context of cell cycle regulation in pancreatic beta-cells (Charoensuk2021Autosomal). The protein's role in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex suggests it may undergo post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which are critical for its function in protein degradation pathways (Charoensuk2021Autosomal).

## Function
The ZYG11A gene encodes a protein that is part of the ZYG11 protein family, which includes an armadillo-like (ARM) domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. In humans, ZYG11A is a protein of 759 amino acids, featuring one ARM domain and three LRR motifs. It functions as a substrate recognition subunit of the E3 ligase enzyme complex, which is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation of specific protein substrates, crucial for cell cycle regulation (Charoensuk2021Autosomal).

ZYG11A plays a significant role in the degradation of cyclin B1, a G2/M-specific protein essential for the progression from the G2 phase into mitosis. The degradation of cyclin B1 by the ZYG11A-associated E3 ligase complex facilitates mitotic exit and cell division (Balachandran2016The). This process is particularly important when the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is inhibited, as ZYG11A can regulate cyclin B1 levels independently of APC/C (Balachandran2016The).

In healthy human cells, ZYG11A is expressed in pancreatic beta-cells and is involved in cell cycle regulation, promoting beta-cell growth by regulating the cell cycle (Charoensuk2021Autosomal). Its activity is crucial for maintaining normal cell cycle progression and beta-cell proliferation, which is important for adapting to increased insulin demand (Charoensuk2021Autosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZYG11A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of diabetes and cancer. A novel missense mutation, p.L475P, in the ZYG11A gene has been associated with autosomal dominant diabetes in a Thai family. This mutation leads to cell cycle arrest in pancreatic beta-cells, which are essential for insulin production, potentially contributing to chronic hyperglycemia and diabetes pathogenesis (Charoensuk2021Autosomal).

In cancer, ZYG11A expression has been linked to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and endometrial cancer. In EOC, high ZYG11A expression is associated with low-grade tumors, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role. The gene's expression is inversely correlated with p53 levels, indicating a complex interaction that may influence tumor biology (Achlaug2021ZYG11A). In endometrial cancer, ZYG11A is identified as a candidate proto-oncogene, with its silencing leading to increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation, highlighting its role in promoting cell growth and survival (Achlaug2019Identification).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZYG11A in disease development, particularly through its impact on cell cycle regulation and interaction with other cellular pathways.

## Interactions
ZYG11A is involved in several interactions that play a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. It functions as a substrate recognition subunit of the E3 ligase enzyme complex, which is involved in targeting proteins for proteasome degradation. This complex is implicated in the degradation of cyclin B1, a process essential for mitotic progression and cell division. Although a direct physical interaction between ZYG11A and cyclin B1 has not been confirmed, it is suggested that cyclin B1 is a substrate of the CRL2ZYG11A complex (Charoensuk2021Autosomal).

In mammalian cells, ZYG11A, along with its paralogue ZYG11B, contributes to the degradation of cyclin B1 independently of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). This interaction is crucial for facilitating mitotic slippage, especially when APC/C activity is inhibited (Balachandran2016The). ZYG11A/B can bind to cyclin B1 through a Cdk1-independent mechanism, highlighting its role in regulating cyclin B1 levels during mitosis (Balachandran2016The).

ZYG11A's interactions are part of a broader regulatory network that includes its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it may participate in protein complex formations that regulate cell cycle progression and stability (Balachandran2016The).
