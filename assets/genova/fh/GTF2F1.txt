# GTF2F1

## Overview
GTF2F1 is a gene that encodes the general transcription factor IIF subunit 1, also known as RAP74, which is a critical component of the transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the transcription process by RNA polymerase II, particularly in the initiation and regulation of transcription. As a transcription factor, RAP74 is involved in stabilizing the interaction between RNA polymerase II and the transcription pre-initiation complex, facilitating the enzyme's correct positioning onto the promoter. The protein is characterized by its structural features, including two globular domains and a highly charged segment, which are essential for its function in transcription initiation. GTF2F1 is located on chromosome 19p13.3 and is implicated in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and ovarian function, with mutations in the gene linked to conditions such as premature ovarian insufficiency (Tan2023Singlecell; Purrello1995Genetic; Zhang2022General).

## Structure
The GTF2F1 gene encodes the RAP74 subunit of the general transcription factor IIF (TFIIF), which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The RAP74 protein is composed of 517 amino acids and features two globular domains connected by a highly charged segment rich in acidic amino acids (Purrello1995Genetic). The carboxyl terminus of RAP74 shows sequence similarity to bacterial sigma proteins, suggesting a conserved function in transcription initiation (Purrello1995Genetic).

The protein's structure includes a conserved N-terminal domain and a central region with helical motifs, which are typical features of transcription factors. The C-terminal domain is involved in interactions with other transcription factors, contributing to the formation of the TFIIF complex. This complex is a heterodimer, consisting of RAP74 and another subunit, RAP30, which together facilitate the binding of RNA polymerase II to DNA (Zhang2022General).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, influencing the protein's function and interactions. These structural features enable GTF2F1 to play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by modulating the activity of RNA polymerase II.

## Function
GTF2F1, or general transcription factor IIF subunit 1, is a crucial component of the transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) complex, which plays a significant role in the initiation and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. In healthy human cells, GTF2F1 is involved in stabilizing the interaction between RNA polymerase II and the transcription pre-initiation complex, facilitating the enzyme's recognition and correct positioning onto the promoter. This stabilization is essential for the initiation of RNA synthesis at class II promoters (Purrello1995Genetic).

GTF2F1, along with its partner subunit Rap 30, forms a heterodimer that is vital for the transcription process. The large 74 kDa subunit encoded by GTF2F1, known as Rap 74, enhances the interaction of Rap 30 with RNA polymerase II, thereby aiding in the recruitment of the polymerase to gene promoters and promoting promoter escape (Purrello1995Genetic). This activity is crucial for the precise regulation of gene expression, impacting various cellular processes and organismal development. GTF2F1 is active in the cell nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression, ensuring proper cellular function and development (Purrello1995Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GTF2F1 gene have been implicated in premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by the loss of normal ovarian function before the age of 40. Specific mutations, such as Lys315Glu and Arg199Cys, have been identified in patients with secondary amenorrhea, a symptom of POI. These mutations are predicted to be deleterious and are located in a conserved functional domain, potentially disrupting protein function by altering charge and size, which may lead to a loss of interactions. The study found that these mutations resulted in decreased levels of GTF2F1 in plasma, suggesting a dosage-dependent effect on ovarian function (Tan2023Singlecell).

GTF2F1 is also involved in primordial follicle formation (PFF), with its knockdown leading to downregulation of JNK signaling and upregulation of E-cadherin and Wnt4, impairing PFF. This indicates that GTF2F1 may play a crucial role in ovarian development and function (Tan2023Singlecell). While the direct association of GTF2F1 mutations with POI through genetic mutations remains unclear, the gene's involvement in these pathways suggests its potential significance in ovarian health (Tan2023Singlecell).

## Interactions
GTF2F1, also known as RAP74, is a subunit of the general transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) complex, which plays a crucial role in the initiation and elongation phases of transcription by RNA polymerase II. GTF2F1 interacts with RNA polymerase II, stabilizing its interaction with the other TFIIF subunit, Rap 30, which is characterized by a high number of basic residues. This interaction facilitates the recognition of the preinitiation complex and the correct positioning of RNA polymerase II onto the promoter (Purrello1995Genetic).

GTF2F1 contains two globular domains and a highly charged segment rich in acidic amino acids, with sequence similarity to bacterial sigma proteins. This structural configuration allows GTF2F1 to stabilize the interaction of Rap 30 with RNA polymerase II, enhancing the transcription initiation process at class II promoters (Purrello1995Genetic).

The GTF2F1 gene is located at the 19p13.3 locus in the human genome and is present in a single copy. Its dispersion across different regions of the genome, along with related genes, suggests an early evolutionary origin of the transcription apparatus in eukaryotes (Purrello1995Genetic).
