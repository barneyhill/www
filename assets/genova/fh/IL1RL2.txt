# IL1RL2

## Overview
IL1RL2, also known as interleukin 1 receptor-like 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein belonging to the interleukin-1 receptor family. The IL1RL2 protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating inflammatory responses through its interaction with IL-36 cytokines, including IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ (Boraschi2013The). Structurally, the receptor is characterized by an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like features and an intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain essential for signal transduction (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2017The). Upon cytokine binding, IL1RL2 forms a heterodimeric complex with the accessory protein IL-1R3, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAP kinases, which are crucial for inflammatory and immune responses (Boraschi2013The). The receptor's activity is modulated by antagonists like IL-36Ra and potentially IL-38, which inhibit its signaling (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2017The). IL1RL2 is implicated in various inflammatory conditions, including psoriasis, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Mahil2017An).

## Structure
IL1RL2, also known as interleukin 1 receptor-like 2, is a protein that is part of the interleukin-1 receptor family. The protein is characterized by an extracellular portion containing immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and an intracellular portion with a Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is crucial for signal transduction (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2017The). The extracellular region is responsible for ligand binding, interacting with IL-36 cytokines such as IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ (Boraschi2013The).

The IL1RL2 protein forms heterodimeric complexes with an accessory chain, typically IL-1R3, upon binding an agonist cytokine. This interaction leads to the approximation of the TIR domains in the intracellular portions of the two receptor chains, initiating signaling pathways that activate NF-κB and MAP kinases (Boraschi2013The). The receptor's activity can be inhibited by IL-36Ra, a receptor antagonist, and potentially by IL-38, although this requires further confirmation (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2017The).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common in membrane proteins like IL1RL2, although specific modifications for this protein are not detailed in the available context. Splice variants may exist, leading to different isoforms with potential functional diversity (Boraschi2013The).

## Function
IL1RL2, also known as interleukin 1 receptor-like 2, is a receptor involved in the IL-36 signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in mediating inflammatory responses. This receptor binds to IL-36 cytokines, including IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ, using IL-1R3 as a co-receptor to initiate inflammatory signaling (Boraschi2013The). The activation of IL1RL2 leads to the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of immune cells to sites of inflammation, which is particularly relevant in conditions like psoriasis (Mahil2017An).

IL1RL2 is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, where it is involved in cutaneous inflammatory responses. The receptor's activity is regulated by the binding of IL-36Ra, which inhibits signaling, and potentially by IL-38, which may also exhibit inhibitory effects (Boraschi2013The). Despite its role in inflammation, studies on individuals with IL1RL2 knockout mutations have shown that the absence of functional IL-36R does not impair general immune function, suggesting that IL1RL2 is not essential for overall immune health but may be involved in specific immune responses (Mahil2017An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL1RL2 gene, which encodes the IL-36 receptor, have been studied for their clinical significance, particularly in the context of psoriasis. Research has shown that individuals with homozygous knockout mutations in IL1RL2 maintain normal immune function, suggesting that IL-36 signaling blockade is likely to be well tolerated. This finding supports the potential use of IL-36 blockade as a therapeutic strategy for psoriasis, as IL-36 cytokines are implicated in the disease's pathogenesis by promoting inflammatory responses in skin keratinocytes (Mahil2017An).

The study of IL1RL2 mutations in a sample of British-Pakistani individuals revealed that those with likely knockout mutations did not exhibit significant health issues, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, or immune-mediated conditions. This suggests that IL1RL2 mutations do not significantly impair immune function, reinforcing the safety of targeting IL-36 signaling in therapeutic interventions (Mahil2017An).

IL-36 cytokines, which signal through the IL-36 receptor encoded by IL1RL2, are involved in the abnormal activation of T helper 17 (TH17) cells, a major driver of psoriasis. Blocking IL-36 signaling has been shown to reduce inflammation in psoriatic skin, highlighting IL-36 as a promising therapeutic target (Mahil2017An).

## Interactions
IL1RL2, also known as interleukin 1 receptor-like 2, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in inflammatory signaling. It interacts with interleukin-36 cytokines, including IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ, to activate NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways, which are crucial for immune responses (Boraschi2013The). IL-36Ra acts as an antagonist to IL1RL2, inhibiting these signaling pathways (Boraschi2013The).

IL1RL2 also interacts with IL-1ε, which acts as an agonist, activating NF-κB through this receptor. Conversely, IL-1δ functions as an antagonist, specifically inhibiting the IL1RL2-mediated response to IL-1ε (Debets2001Two). The receptor forms a complex with the accessory protein IL-1R3 (also known as IL-1RAcP) to mediate these signaling events (Boraschi2013The).

In the brain, IL1RL2 may interact with alternative proteins such as IL-1R3b and IL-1R8, potentially modulating inflammatory signaling differently compared to other tissues (Boraschi2013The). The interaction of IL1RL2 with IL-38 has been proposed, although this requires further confirmation (Boraschi2013The).
