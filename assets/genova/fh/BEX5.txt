# BEX5

## Overview
BEX5, or brain expressed X-linked 5, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is part of the BEX family of proteins. These proteins are known for their involvement in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The BEX5 protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and is implicated in neural development and function. It is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in modulating signaling pathways and gene expression. The precise mechanisms by which BEX5 influences these processes are still under investigation, but its expression pattern suggests a critical role in maintaining neural health and function. Understanding the function and regulation of BEX5 could provide insights into neurological disorders and potential therapeutic targets (Qiu2020aarFDC).
