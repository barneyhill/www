# FOXI2

## Overview
FOXI2 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box I2 protein, which is a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a distinct forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain, which plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in various biological processes, including development, metabolism, and cell differentiation. The forkhead box I2 protein is involved in the transcriptional regulation of target genes, contributing to the modulation of cellular pathways and physiological functions. Although the specific functions and interactions of FOXI2 are not fully elucidated, it is part of a larger network of transcription factors that influence cellular behavior and development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
