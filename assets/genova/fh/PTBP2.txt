# PTBP2

## Overview
PTBP2, or polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, particularly within the nervous system. The protein, categorized as an RNA-binding protein, is characterized by its four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which enable it to interact with RNA sequences and influence splicing events. PTBP2 is predominantly expressed in neurons and testis, where it plays a critical role in neuronal differentiation and development by modulating the splicing of specific mRNA isoforms. The protein's function is further regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which affect its splicing activities and localization. PTBP2's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in broader cellular processes, such as chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular function and development (Licatalosi2012Ptbp2; Pina2018PostTranslational; Boutz2007A).

## Structure
PTBP2, or polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2, is an RNA-binding protein characterized by its four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which facilitate its interaction with RNA sequences. These RRMs are connected by linker regions and are crucial for the protein's role in alternative splicing regulation (Keppetipola2016Multiple; Pina2018PostTranslational). PTBP2 shares a high degree of sequence identity with its paralog PTBP1, particularly in the RRM regions, with 87% identity over the RRM2 region (Pina2018PostTranslational).

The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications that influence its function. PTBP2 is subject to phosphorylation at multiple sites, including Ser16, Ser21, Ser26, Ser27, Ser30, Ser34, Thr38, and Ser44, which may affect its splicing activities and nuclear localization (Pina2018PostTranslational). Acetylation occurs at lysine residues such as Lys45, Lys46, Lys92, and Lys94, with Lys94 interacting with the RNA phosphate backbone (Pina2018PostTranslational).

PTBP2 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with high levels in neurons and testis, and can be alternatively spliced to produce different isoforms (Romanelli2013New). These structural and functional features underscore PTBP2's role in RNA processing and its regulation of alternative splicing.

## Function
PTBP2, also known as polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2, is an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of alternative splicing, particularly in the nervous system. It is predominantly expressed in post-mitotic neurons and is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during neuronal differentiation and development (Boutz2007A). PTBP2 functions as a negative regulator of alternative exon splicing, maintaining the expression of specific mRNA isoforms necessary for proper neuronal precursor generation and differentiation in the embryonic brain (Licatalosi2012Ptbp2).

In healthy human cells, PTBP2 is involved in the repression of adult-specific splicing events, which is essential for the development and maintenance of neuronal progenitors and migrating neurons (Licatalosi2012Ptbp2). The protein's activity is crucial for regulating the splicing of transcripts that control cytoskeletal dynamics and cell proliferation, impacting brain development and function (Licatalosi2012Ptbp2). PTBP2 also interacts with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, suggesting its role in broader cellular processes beyond splicing (Pina2022Polypyrimidine). The switch from PTBP1 to PTBP2 expression during neuronal differentiation is a key regulatory mechanism that influences the splicing of neuron-specific exons, contributing to neuronal maturation and function (Boutz2007A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in PTBP2 expression and its interactions have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), PTBP2 exon 10 inclusion is associated with disease progression and is dependent on BCR-ABL1 expression. Increased PTBP2 expression is observed in advanced phases of CML, such as blast crisis, and is linked to cell survival and proliferation. Knockdown of PTBP2 in CML cells results in reduced growth and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role as a potential therapeutic target (Nandagopalan2019PTBP2; Barik2024PTBP2).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), PTBP2 is released from the SFPQ/PTBP2 complex by the long non-coding RNA MALAT1, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. PTBP2 expression is higher in malignant tissues and correlates with invasion and metastasis, indicating its oncogenic role in CRC (Ji2014Long).

PTBP2 also plays a critical role in the nervous system, where its dysregulation can impact neural development. It is essential for proper neuronal differentiation and the maintenance of progenitor pools during brain development. Alterations in PTBP2 expression could potentially affect neurogenesis and are linked to neurological disorders (Licatalosi2012Ptbp2).

## Interactions
PTBP2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in neuronal development and axon growth. In neurons, PTBP2 is involved in regulating alternative splicing by interacting with splicing co-regulators such as Matrin3, Raver1, and hnRNPM. These interactions are modulated by the kinase KIS, which phosphorylates PTBP2, leading to the dissociation of PTBP2 from these protein complexes and affecting its RNA binding capacity (MorenoAguilera2023KIS).

In motoneurons, PTBP2 binds to the 3' UTR of Hnrnpr mRNA, facilitating its axonal transport and local translation. This interaction is crucial for axon growth and involves the formation of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes that are transported into axons for local synthesis of hnRNP R (Salehi2023Cytosolic). PTBP2 also interacts with the translation factor eIF5A2, which is essential for the translation of hnRNP R. This interaction is independent of mRNA, suggesting a role for PTBP2 in modulating protein synthesis through its association with translation machinery (Salehi2023Cytosolic).

These interactions highlight PTBP2's multifaceted role in RNA processing and protein synthesis, impacting neuronal development and function.
