# ARHGEF28

## Overview
The ARHGEF28 gene encodes the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 28 (RGNEF), a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in cellular signaling and RNA metabolism. RGNEF is categorized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and is unique for its dual functionality, combining a GEF domain with an RNA binding domain. This protein is involved in the regulation of Rho-family GTPases, which are essential for processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. Additionally, RGNEF is implicated in RNA processing, particularly in the stability of neurofilament mRNA, which is significant for neuronal cytoskeletal architecture. The protein's interactions with microtubule subunits and its involvement in the formation of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions highlight its importance in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Song2020Rare; Di2020Inclusion). Furthermore, the circular RNA derived from ARHGEF28 has been associated with cancer pathogenesis, particularly in ovarian and breast cancers, where it influences drug resistance and cell proliferation (Tao2024Clinical; Lei2024Circular).

## Structure
The ARHGEF28 gene encodes the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RGNEF) protein, which is a 191 kDa RNA binding protein involved in various cellular processes. RGNEF is characterized by several specific domains that contribute to its function. These include a leucine-rich region at the amino-terminus, a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a cysteine-rich zinc-finger domain, a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) binding domain, a microtubule binding domain, and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Di2020Inclusion). The leucine-rich region is particularly important for its interaction with TDP-43 and its localization to micronuclei (Di2020Inclusion).

RGNEF is unique in the human proteome for combining a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain with an RNA binding domain, which is crucial for its role in cellular signaling and RNA metabolism (Di2020Inclusion). The GEF domain is essential for the protein's toxicity when overexpressed, although it is not sufficient on its own to induce toxicity (Di2020Inclusion). RGNEF interacts with microtubule subunits and regulators, suggesting a role in microtubule network regulation (Di2020Inclusion). The protein's misfolding and aggregation are linked to its cytotoxicity, particularly in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Di2020Inclusion). The molecular structure of RGNEF, including its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
ARHGEF28, also known as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 28, is involved in the regulation of Rho-family GTPases, which are critical for various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. It facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho proteins, thereby activating them. This activation is essential for maintaining cellular structure and signaling pathways (Chen2021Utility).

In healthy human cells, ARHGEF28 plays a role in regulating the activity of RhoA, a member of the Rho GTPase family, which is involved in actin cytoskeletal dynamics, membrane protrusion, and cell migration. These processes are crucial for cell motility, invasion, and metastasis (Chen2021Utility). ARHGEF28 is also involved in RNA processing, particularly in regulating the stability of neurofilament mRNA, which is significant for the organization of the cytoskeletal architecture in neurons (Abbassi2023Axon).

The protein predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm of motor neurons, with some presence in the nucleus. It contains functional domains such as the Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain and the Dbl Homology domain, which are crucial for its guanine exchange function and RNA binding (Abbassi2023Axon).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARHGEF28 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and certain cancers. In familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), a novel frameshift mutation in the ARHGEF28 gene has been identified, leading to premature truncation of the gene product. This mutation, along with regions of homozygosity, suggests a potential genetic contribution to ALS pathology, possibly affecting RNA processing or metabolism (Droppelmann2013Detection). In sporadic ALS (sALS), rare coding variants of ARHGEF28, such as the p.Asn1046Ser variant, have been associated with the disease, indicating that these rare variants may influence the age of onset and contribute to ALS development (Song2020Rare).

In cancer, the circular RNA circ_ARHGEF28, derived from the ARHGEF28 gene, has been linked to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. It inhibits MST1/2 dimerization, suppressing the Hippo pathway, which is crucial for tumor suppression, thereby contributing to drug resistance (Lei2024Circular). In breast cancer, circ-ARHGEF28 is differentially expressed and has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and treatment (Tao2024Clinical).

## Interactions
The ARHGEF28 gene encodes the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RGNEF), which is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. As a dual regulator, RGNEF modulates the activation of RhoA GTPase, a small GTPase that switches between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound form. This active form interacts with downstream targets to regulate cellular processes such as cell-cell adhesion, migration, and reorientation (Song2020Rare).

RGNEF also functions as an RNA-binding protein, interacting with low-molecular-weight neurofilament (NFL) mRNA. This interaction affects the stability of NFL mRNA through 3'-untranslated region destabilization, contributing to the formation of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. These inclusions may form independently or through interactions with other proteins involved in RNA metabolism, such as SOD1, TDP-43, FUS, and C9orf72, particularly within spinal motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Song2020Rare).

In the context of ovarian cancer, the circular RNA circ_ARHGEF28, derived from the ARHGEF28 gene, interacts with the MST1 protein, a component of the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction inhibits MST1/2 dimerization, affecting the pathway's downstream effectors and contributing to cisplatin resistance (Lei2024Circular).
