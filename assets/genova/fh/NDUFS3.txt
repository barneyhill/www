# NDUFS3

## Overview
NDUFS3 is a gene that encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S3, a crucial component of mitochondrial Complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. As a core subunit, NDUFS3 is involved in the assembly and structural integrity of Complex I, interacting with other subunits to form the Q-module, a critical part of the enzyme's assembly process (Mimaki2012Understanding; D’Angelo2021NDUFS3). Although NDUFS3 does not have a direct catalytic role, its function is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis. Alterations in the expression or mutations of the NDUFS3 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are implicated in various clinical conditions, including certain cancers and mitochondrial disorders (Suhane2011Biomarker; Mckenzie2010Assembly).

## Structure
The NDUFS3 protein is a subunit of mitochondrial Complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It is composed of 264 amino acids, resulting in a molecular mass of approximately 30.2 kDa (Procaccio2000Human). The primary structure of NDUFS3 includes a sequence that is highly conserved, indicating its essential role in the assembly and function of Complex I (D’Angelo2021NDUFS3).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of NDUFS3 are not provided, the protein is known to be part of a subcomplex within Complex I, interacting with other subunits such as NDUFS2 and NDUFA5 to form the Q-module, which is crucial for the enzyme's assembly (D’Angelo2021NDUFS3). NDUFS3 does not have a direct catalytic role but is essential for the structural integrity and assembly of Complex I (D’Angelo2021NDUFS3).

Post-translational modifications of NDUFS3 include phosphorylation, with a specific site identified at Ser59, which may play a role in regulating its function within Complex I (Gowthami2019Mapping). The protein's expression and function can be affected by various conditions, such as diabetes, which leads to a significant decrease in its expression and activity (Taurino2012Mitochondrial).

## Function
NDUFS3 is a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. This enzyme complex is responsible for the oxidation of NADH and the transfer of electrons to ubiquinone, contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Vogel2007Human; Mimaki2012Understanding).

In healthy human cells, NDUFS3 is part of the peripheral arm of complex I and is involved in the early stages of its assembly. It forms a hydrophilic assembly complex with other subunits such as NDUFS2, NDUFS7, and NDUFS8, which are crucial for the formation of a 400 kDa assembly intermediate (Mckenzie2010Assembly; Mimaki2012Understanding). This intermediate is membrane-anchored by the mtDNA-encoded subunit ND1, facilitating the integration of additional subunits and the eventual formation of mature complex I (Vogel2007Human).

NDUFS3's role in the assembly and stability of the peripheral arm of complex I is vital for maintaining proper mitochondrial function and energy production in human cells (Mimaki2012Understanding; Ugalde2004Differences). Its function is critical for cellular energy homeostasis, as disruptions in its activity can lead to complex I deficiencies and associated disorders (Mckenzie2010Assembly).

## Interactions
NDUFS3 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is involved in the electron transport chain. It plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of complex I by interacting with various other subunits and assembly factors. NDUFS3 is part of the early assembly intermediates of complex I, initially forming intermediate 1 with NDUFS2, and later integrating with NDUFS7 and NDUFS8 to form intermediate 2 (Mckenzie2010Assembly). These interactions are essential for the formation of the mature complex I.

NDUFS3 also interacts with assembly factors such as NDUFAF3 and NDUFAF4, which are crucial for anchoring early intermediates to the membrane, facilitating the assembly of complex I (Mckenzie2010Assembly). In the context of mitochondrial translation, NDUFS3 is part of a relatively stable hydrogenase module, which remains stable without mtDNA-encoded subunits (Dieteren2011Defective).

In pathological conditions, such as in diabetic rat brains, the expression of NDUFS3 is significantly downregulated, which is linked to decreased complex I activity and mitochondrial dysfunction (Taurino2012Mitochondrial). This highlights the importance of NDUFS3 interactions in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity.
