# FOXM1

## Overview
FOXM1 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box M1 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the forkhead family of proteins. This protein is characterized by a conserved forkhead DNA-binding domain, which adopts a winged-helix fold, allowing it to interact with specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression (Littler2010Structure). FOXM1 plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the transitions from G1 to S phase and G2 to M phase, by modulating the expression of genes essential for DNA replication and mitosis (Kalin2011Multiple; Sanders2015FOXM1). The protein's activity is tightly regulated through phosphorylation, which influences its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity (Sanders2015FOXM1). Beyond its role in normal cellular processes, dysregulation of FOXM1 is implicated in various cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Barger2019PanCancer; Nandi2018FoxM1:).

## Structure
The FOXM1 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved forkhead DNA-binding domain (DBD) that adopts a winged-helix fold, a common structural motif among Forkhead proteins. This fold consists of three alpha-helices and three beta-strands, forming a topology of abaabb. The alpha-helices create a core structure that interacts with DNA, with helix h3 inserting into the major groove to facilitate sequence-specific contacts (Littler2010Structure). The DBD of FOXM1 has a unique conformation where the 'wing' regions do not significantly contact the DNA, contributing to its lower DNA-binding affinity compared to other Forkhead proteins (Littler2010Structure).

FOXM1 contains several functional domains, including a negative regulatory domain (NRD), a region with cyclin-dependent kinase consensus sites, and a transactivation domain (TAD). The NRD can bind to the TAD, forming a structured core that inhibits transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation events, particularly by Cdk and Plk1, disrupt this interaction, allowing the TAD to transition from an ordered to a disordered state, facilitating co-activator binding (Marceau2019An).

The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which plays a crucial role in regulating its function during the cell cycle (Marceau2019An).

## Function
FOXM1 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle in healthy human cells. It is particularly involved in the transitions from G1 to S phase and G2 to M phase, essential for DNA replication and mitosis (Kalin2011Multiple; Sanders2015FOXM1). FOXM1 functions by binding to DNA sequences in gene promoters, including both canonical FKH motifs and non-canonical sequences, which allows it to regulate a wide range of genes and cellular functions (Sanders2015FOXM1).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where its activity is regulated by CDK-cyclin mediated phosphorylation, crucial for its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity during the cell cycle (Sanders2015FOXM1). FOXM1 is involved in the regulation of genes critical for cell cycle progression, such as AURKB, CENPF, and PLK1, which are essential for processes like chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle formation (Sanders2015FOXM1).

FOXM1 also plays a role in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation, suggesting its involvement in broader cellular processes beyond direct DNA binding (Sanders2015FOXM1). Its function is vital for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division, contributing to normal cellular functions and organismal development (Kalin2011Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
FOXM1 is a transcription factor whose overexpression or dysregulation is implicated in various cancers. High levels of FOXM1 are associated with poor prognosis and survival in cancer patients, as it plays a role in promoting tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance (Nandi2018FoxM1:). FOXM1 is overexpressed in several cancer types, including breast, lung, gastric, and colorectal cancers, and is linked to genomic instability and epigenetic modifications (Barger2019PanCancer; Nandi2018FoxM1:).

In colorectal cancer, FOXM1 promotes growth and metastasis by activating the β-catenin signaling pathway, increasing the expression of cyclin D1, TCF-4, and c-Myc (p&gt; FOXM1; Yang2019&lt). In pancreatic cancer, FOXM1 enhances stem cell-like characteristics and is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, contributing to tumorigenesis and metastasis (Quan2013The). FOXM1 also mediates resistance to chemotherapeutic agents by interfering with apoptosis and altering microtubule dynamics, affecting the efficacy of drugs like docetaxel and cisplatin (Nandi2018FoxM1:).

The gene's expression is modulated by microRNAs, which are inversely correlated with cancer invasiveness, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Nandi2018FoxM1:).

## Interactions
FOXM1, a transcription factor, engages in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cancer progression and cell cycle regulation. In glioblastoma cells, FOXM1 interacts with STAT3, contributing to radiation resistance (Gartel2017FOXM1). In chronic myelogenous leukemia, it forms a positive feedback loop with NF-kB (p65) and β-catenin, enhancing oncogenic activity (Gartel2017FOXM1). In gastric cancer, FOXM1 binds to lncRNA-PVT1, preventing its degradation and promoting tumor growth (Gartel2017FOXM1).

FOXM1 also interacts with SMAD3 in breast cancer, stabilizing the SMAD3/SMAD4 complex and promoting TGF-β signaling (Gartel2017FOXM1; Zhang2019The). In renal cell carcinoma, FOXM1 interacts with HIPK2, which may influence tumor progression (Liu2019Homeodomain). The protein also binds to non-consensus DNA sequences, facilitated by protein-protein interactions, which is crucial for its transcriptional activity (Sanders2015FOXM1).

In the context of cell cycle regulation, FOXM1 interacts with CDC25A, enhancing its transcriptional activity through CDK1-mediated phosphorylation (Sullivan2012Novel). These interactions underscore FOXM1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
