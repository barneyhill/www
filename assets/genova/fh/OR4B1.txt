# OR4B1

## Overview
The OR4B1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily B member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transmits signals from the external environment to the interior of the cell, facilitating communication and response to olfactory stimuli. The olfactory receptors, including OR4B1, are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a hallmark of GPCRs, and are encoded by single-exon genes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
