# NBR1

## Overview
NBR1 (Neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1) is a gene that encodes the NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor, a multifunctional protein involved in selective autophagy. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and organelles, contributing to cellular homeostasis and stress responses. The NBR1 protein is characterized by several domains, including a PB1 domain for protein-protein interactions, a ZZ-type zinc finger domain for cargo recognition, and a UBA domain that binds ubiquitin, with a preference for K63-linked chains (Kirkin2009A). It interacts with ATG8 family proteins and forms oligomers, facilitating the sequestration of cargo into autophagosomes (Kirkin2009A). Beyond its autophagic functions, NBR1 is implicated in oxidative stress response regulation and cell migration, highlighting its diverse roles in cellular processes (Kenific2016NBR1; Sánchez‐Martín2020NBR). Mutations in the NBR1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including renal tumors and osteoporosis, underscoring its clinical significance (Adolphe2021Germline; RochaBraz2020Comprehensive).

## Structure
NBR1 is a selective autophagy receptor characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in targeting ubiquitinated proteins for degradation. The protein contains a PB1 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and a ZZ-type zinc finger domain, which is involved in cargo recognition (Kirkin2009A). The ZZ domain adopts a cross-brace zinc finger fold, crucial for binding specific cargo proteins such as Ams1 and Ape4, with the N-terminal dipeptide of these cargos fitting into an acidic pocket of the ZZ domain (Wang2021Molecular).

NBR1 also possesses a UBA domain that binds ubiquitin, showing a preference for K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which is essential for its role in autophagosomal degradation (Kirkin2009A). The protein can form oligomers through its CC1 domain, contributing to its quaternary structure and enabling it to cooperate with other autophagy receptors like p62 in recognizing and clearing ubiquitinated cargo (Kirkin2009A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function of NBR1, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure and domain organization are integral to its function in autophagy and protein aggregate clearance.

## Function
NBR1 (Neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1) functions as a selective autophagy receptor, playing a crucial role in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and organelles. It binds to LC3 and ubiquitin, facilitating the sequestration of cargo into autophagosomes, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Kirkin2009A; Lamark2009NBR1). NBR1 is involved in the autophagosomal degradation of ubiquitinated substrates, interacting with ATG8 family proteins and forming oligomers through its CC1 domain, which aids in recognizing and clearing ubiquitinated cargo (Kirkin2009A).

In addition to its role in autophagy, NBR1 is implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress responses. It mediates the formation of p62-liquid droplets, which are necessary for the activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, a major oxidative stress response pathway (Sánchez‐Martín2020NBR). NBR1 also plays a role in cell migration by promoting focal adhesion turnover, which is crucial for cell motility. It interacts with focal adhesion components and recruits autophagosomes to these sites, facilitating their disassembly and enhancing migratory capacity (Kenific2016NBR1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NBR1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A study identified a germline mutation in the NBR1 gene, specifically a frameshift mutation c.1581dupA (p.E528fs * 17), in a family with renal tumors. This mutation was associated with different histological subtypes of renal tumors, including angiomyolipoma, oncocytic papillary renal cell carcinoma, and clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. The mutation leads to a truncated NBR1 protein, which disrupts normal autophagic processes and may contribute to renal carcinogenesis by acting as a dominant-negative, affecting the degradation of p62, a marker of autophagy (Adolphe2021Germline).

In the context of bone health, variants in the NBR1 gene have been associated with conditions related to bone fragility, such as osteoporosis. Specific variants, like p.(Gly759Val) and p.(Asp40Gly), were identified in patients with severe osteoporosis, suggesting a potential link between NBR1 mutations and bone strength (RochaBraz2020Comprehensive).

NBR1 also plays a role in metabolic regulation. In p62-deficient adipocytes, NBR1 represses thermogenesis through the PPARγ pathway. Alterations in NBR1 can influence obesity-related phenotypes and metabolic conditions, such as glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, particularly in the context of p62 deficiency (Huang2021NBR1).

## Interactions
NBR1 is an autophagy cargo receptor that engages in various protein interactions crucial for its function in selective autophagy. It interacts with ATG8-family proteins, including LC3A, through its LC3-interacting region (LIR), which serves as a protein interaction hub facilitating optimal autophagic flux (North2024The). NBR1 also binds to FIP200 and TAX1BP1, with these interactions mediated by overlapping short linear motifs (SLiMs) within NBR1 (North2024The). The interaction with TAX1BP1 is particularly significant, as it enhances NBR1's lysosomal delivery and autophagic activity (North2024The).

NBR1's role in autophagy extends to its interactions with focal adhesion (FA) components, such as paxillin, vinculin, zyxin, and FAK, which are essential for autophagy-dependent FA turnover (Kenific2016NBR1). The interaction with LC3 is critical for this process, as demonstrated by the autophagy incompetence of an NBR1 mutant lacking the LIR motif (Kenific2016NBR1).

NBR1 also interacts with ubiquitinated substrates, facilitating their degradation, and cooperates with p62/SQSTM1 in the autophagic process, although p62 is not essential for NBR1 flux (North2024The). These interactions highlight NBR1's role in cellular clearance mechanisms and its importance in autophagy regulation.
