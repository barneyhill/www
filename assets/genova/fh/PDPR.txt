# PDPR

## Overview
The PDPR gene encodes the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase regulatory subunit, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism by modulating the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). This regulatory subunit is crucial for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, thereby linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle and facilitating aerobic respiration (Wang2018MiR195). As a regulatory protein, it influences the dephosphorylation and reactivation of the PDC, impacting mitochondrial energy output and overall metabolic balance (Lawson1997Cloning). The pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase regulatory subunit is active within the mitochondria, where it interacts with other components of the PDC to ensure efficient energy conversion. Dysregulation of PDPR can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is implicated in various metabolic and neurological disorders (Wang2018MiR195).

## Function
The PDPR gene encodes the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase regulatory subunit, which plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism by regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). This complex is essential for converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, a key substrate for the citric acid cycle, thereby linking glycolysis to aerobic respiration (Wang2018MiR195). PDPR modulates the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, which is responsible for dephosphorylating and reactivating the PDC, thus influencing the rate of acetyl-CoA production and overall mitochondrial energy output (Lawson1997Cloning).

In healthy human cells, PDPR is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production. It is associated with the regulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain activities, which are critical for ATP production and cellular respiration (Wang2018MiR195). The protein is active within the mitochondria, where it interacts with other components of the PDC to ensure efficient energy conversion and metabolic balance. Dysregulation of PDPR can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is implicated in various metabolic disorders (Wang2018MiR195).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PDPR gene have been implicated in various neurological and developmental disorders. A study identified a de novo truncating variant in the PDPR gene, specifically c.826C>T, resulting in a p.(Gln276*) protein change. This variant was associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a male proband, who exhibited clinical features such as language and psychomotor delay, isolationist tendencies, and craniofacial dysmorphisms (Bruno2021New). Another patient with a homozygous missense variant in PDPR presented with global developmental delay and Joubert-like symptoms, suggesting PDPR as a novel candidate gene for ID (Bruno2021New).

The PDPR gene is also involved in mitochondrial function, and its dysregulation can contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. In the context of preeclampsia, miR-195, which targets PDPR, is downregulated, leading to increased PDPR expression. This alteration is associated with oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and decreased mitochondrial energy production in human trophoblasts, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (Wang2018MiR195). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PDPR in both neurodevelopmental and mitochondrial disorders.

## Interactions
The pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase regulatory subunit (PDPr) is involved in several interactions that modulate the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDPr interacts with the catalytic subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDPc), influencing its sensitivity to magnesium ions (Mg2+). This interaction decreases the sensitivity of PDPc to Mg2+, increasing the apparent Km from about 0.35 mM to 1.6 mM (Yan1996Role). The polyamine spermine can reverse this effect by interacting with PDPr, causing a conformational change that restores PDPc's sensitivity to Mg2+ (Lawson1997Cloning; Yan1996Role).

PDPr is also involved in the Ca2+-dependent binding of PDP to the E2 component of the PDC. This interaction is crucial for the dephosphorylation and activation of the PDC, as both phosphorylated E1 (P-E1) and PDP must bind to the E2 component to achieve maximum dephosphorylation rates (Yan1996Role). The presence of Ca2+ enhances the binding of PDP and PDPc to E2, facilitating the activation of the PDC (Yan1996Role). These interactions highlight the regulatory role of PDPr in modulating the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex through its interactions with PDPc and other components.
