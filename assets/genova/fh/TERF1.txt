# TERF1

## Overview
TERF1, or telomeric repeat binding factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a critical component of the shelterin complex involved in telomere maintenance and protection. The TERF1 protein is characterized as a DNA-binding protein, specifically recognizing and binding to the TTAGGG repeat sequences at telomeres through its Myb-like DNA-binding domain (Bianchi1997TRF1). It plays a pivotal role in regulating telomere length and maintaining genomic stability by acting as a negative regulator of telomerase, the enzyme responsible for telomere elongation (Palm2008How). Additionally, TERF1 is involved in the structural organization of telomeres, contributing to the formation of the T-loop structure that protects chromosome ends from degradation and inappropriate DNA damage responses (Lim2021Shaping). The protein's interactions with other shelterin components and its regulation through post-translational modifications underscore its importance in cellular processes related to telomere integrity and stability (Chan2017Aurora).

## Structure
TERF1, also known as telomeric repeat binding factor 1, is a protein that plays a critical role in telomere maintenance by binding to telomeric DNA. The protein contains a Myb-like DNA-binding domain located at the C-terminus, which is essential for its interaction with telomeric DNA (Chan2017Aurora; Lim2021Shaping). This domain is involved in recognizing and binding to the TTAGGG repeat sequences found at telomeres (Bianchi1997TRF1).

TERF1 forms homodimers through a TRF-specific conserved domain, which is necessary for its DNA-binding capability (Bianchi1997TRF1). The dimerization is crucial as it allows the protein to bring together two Myb-related DNA-binding motifs, enhancing its binding to telomeric DNA (Bianchi1997TRF1). The protein's structure includes a TRF homology (TRFH) domain, which is similar to that of TRF2, another component of the shelterin complex (Lim2021Shaping).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate TERF1's activity. Aurora kinase B (AURKB) phosphorylates TERF1 at the S404 site within the Myb-like DNA-binding domain, influencing its binding to telomeres (Chan2017Aurora). This phosphorylation is significant for modulating TERF1's interaction with telomeric DNA and maintaining telomere integrity (Chan2017Aurora).

## Function
TERF1, also known as telomeric repeat binding factor 1, is a crucial component of the shelterin complex, which is essential for telomere maintenance and protection in healthy human cells. TERF1 binds specifically to the double-stranded DNA region of telomeres, playing a significant role in regulating telomere length and maintaining genomic stability (Lim2021Shaping; Martínez2011Telomeric). It acts as a negative regulator of telomerase, the enzyme responsible for adding telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes, thereby controlling telomere elongation in a length-dependent manner (Palm2008How).

In addition to its role in telomere length regulation, TERF1 is involved in the structural organization of telomeres. It helps form the telomere loop (T-loop) structure, which protects the telomeric tail by hiding it within the double-stranded region, thus preventing inappropriate DNA damage responses (Lim2021Shaping). TERF1 also interacts with other shelterin components, such as TIN2, to recruit proteins involved in DNA repair and replication, further contributing to telomere integrity (Palm2008How).

The absence or dysfunction of TERF1 can lead to genomic instability, increased telomere fusions, and fragility, highlighting its importance in preventing chromosomal instability and potential tumorigenesis (Martínez2011Telomeric).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TERF1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in telomere maintenance. In aplastic anemia, a condition characterized by bone marrow failure, genetic variations in TERF1, particularly a significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 9, have been associated with an increased risk of the disease. This SNP was found to have a variant allele frequency of 37.3% in aplastic anemia cases compared to 31.8% in controls, suggesting it as a potential risk factor (Savage2006Genetic).

In prostate cancer, TERF1 amplifications are linked to a worse prognosis. Approximately 6% of primary prostate cancer patients and 26% of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients exhibit TERF1 amplifications, which correlate with increased expression levels and are associated with more aggressive disease and poorer survival outcomes (dos2021Prognostic).

TERF1 is also involved in melanoma risk through its interaction with genetic variants at the AFAP1L2 locus. These interactions suggest that telomere dysfunction involving TERF1 may contribute to melanoma development, highlighting the gene's role in cancer susceptibility (Brossard2015Integrated).

## Interactions
TERF1, also known as TRF1, is a key component of the shelterin complex, which is essential for telomere protection and maintenance. It interacts with several proteins, including TIN2, through its TRFH domain, which is crucial for its function within the shelterin complex (Palm2008How; Kappei2017Phylointeractomics). TERF1 also binds to telomeric DNA repeats, specifically the TTAGGG sequence, using its Myb DNA-binding motif (Court2005How).

In addition to its role in the shelterin complex, TERF1 interacts with TERRA, a telomeric repeat-containing RNA, suggesting a regulatory role in TERRA-mediated processes. The depletion of TERF1 leads to a decrease in cellular TERRA levels, indicating its importance in TERRA transcription or stability (Scheibe2013Quantitative).

TERF1 also forms interactions with other proteins such as tankyrase1 and tankyrase2, which bind outside the TRFH domain, highlighting the complexity of its protein interactions (Palm2008How). These interactions are crucial for maintaining telomere length and stability, as well as for regulating telomere-associated processes.
