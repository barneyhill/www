# HINFP

## Overview
HINFP is a human gene that encodes the histone H4 transcription factor, a zinc finger protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of histone H4 gene expression during the cell cycle. This transcription factor is integral to the cyclin E/CDK2/p220 NPAT pathway, which is essential for the activation of histone H4 genes at the G1/S phase transition, operating independently of the E2F/pRB pathway (Xie2009The). The protein encoded by HINFP is unique in its ability to interact directly with NPAT, a coactivator that controls transcription of multiple histone genes, and is localized in histone locus bodies (HLBs) where it colocalizes with histone genes and the transcription machinery (Ghule2014Fidelity). The absence of HINFP leads to reduced expression of histone H4 genes, which is crucial for DNA replication and chromosomal segregation, thereby maintaining genomic stability and cell viability (Ghule2016Maternal; Xie2009The).

## Function
The human gene HINFP encodes a transcription factor that is crucial for the regulation of histone H4 gene expression during the cell cycle. HINFP is a highly conserved zinc finger protein that binds to a conserved histone H4 promoter regulatory element. It is unique in its ability to interact directly with the nuclear protein ataxia-telangiectasia locus (NPAT), an essential coactivator that controls transcription of multiple histone genes in response to cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) (Ghule2014Fidelity). HINFP, along with NPAT, resides in subnuclear domains called histone locus bodies (HLBs), where they colocalize with histone genes and the transcription machinery (Ghule2014Fidelity).

HINFP functions as a nonredundant effector in the cyclin E/CDK2/p220 NPAT pathway, which is essential for the activation of histone H4 genes at the G1/S phase transition (Xie2009The). This pathway operates independently of the E2F/pRB pathway, establishing HINFP as a unique transcription factor in the CDK2 responsive gene regulatory mechanism (Xie2009The). The absence of HINFP leads to reduced expression of histone H4 genes, which is crucial for DNA replication and chromosomal segregation (Xie2009The). HINFP is essential for maintaining genomic stability and cell viability by ensuring adequate histone production, which is crucial for normal embryonic development and cell proliferation (Ghule2016Maternal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the HINFP gene have been implicated in various pathological conditions, particularly cancer. HINFP is crucial for the regulation of histone H4 gene expression, and its dysfunction can lead to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer progression. Disruption of histone locus bodies (HLBs), where HINFP plays a key role, has been observed in some cancer cells, suggesting a link between HINFP dysfunction and tumorigenesis (Ghule2018Higher). The loss of HINFP, especially when combined with the absence of the tumor suppressor p53, exacerbates genomic instability and increases the risk of cellular transformation, indicating a potential role in cancer development (Ghule2015p53).

HINFP is also essential for early embryonic development, and its deficiency results in embryonic lethality due to impaired histone H4 expression and subsequent chromosomal instability (Ghule2016Maternal; Xie2009The). The gene's location in a chromosomal region associated with fragile sites and potential tumor suppressor genes further underscores its significance in maintaining genomic integrity and its potential involvement in cancer when altered (Xie2009The).

## Interactions
HINFP, a transcription factor, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of histone gene expression, particularly histone H4. It forms a complex with NPAT (Nuclear Protein Ataxia-Telangiectasia locus), which is essential for the transcriptional activation of histone genes during the cell cycle. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of histone H4 gene expression, as NPAT acts as a coactivator that controls transcription in response to cyclin E/CDK2 signaling (Ghule2014Fidelity; Xie2009The).

HINFP binds to a specific promoter element, Site II, on histone H4 genes, facilitating the recruitment of NPAT to multiple histone H4 genes. This binding is essential for the cell cycle-dependent activation of histone H4 genes and operates independently of the classical E2F/pRB pathway (Liu2011Functional; Xie2009The). HINFP also interacts with RNA polymerase II at the histone H4 gene locus, supporting its positioning near the transcription start site, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of histone H4 genes (Medina2012Epigenetic).

HINFP is located in subnuclear domains called histone locus bodies (HLBs), where it colocalizes with histone genes and the transcription machinery. The organization of HLBs is disrupted in the absence of HINFP, leading to genomic instability and chromosomal aberrations (Ghule2018Higher; Ghule2015p53).
