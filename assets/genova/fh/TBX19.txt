# TBX19

## Overview
TBX19 is a gene that encodes the T-box transcription factor 19, a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain known as the T-box. This transcription factor plays a pivotal role in the development and function of the pituitary gland, particularly in the differentiation of corticotroph and melanotroph cell lineages. The protein is essential for the activation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) transcription, a precursor to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is crucial for adrenal function and cortisol production (Lamolet2001A; Weijing2019A). TBX19's function extends beyond the pituitary, as it is also involved in various interactions that influence gene regulation, including roles in cancer progression (Li2024Contextdependent). Mutations in the TBX19 gene can lead to congenital isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (CIAD), underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining normal endocrine function (Weijing2019A; Akcan2017A).

## Structure
The TBX19 protein, also known as T-box transcription factor 19, is characterized by a conserved T-box DNA-binding domain, which is crucial for its function as a transcriptional regulator. This domain spans amino acids 45 to 218 and is essential for binding to specific DNA sequences, playing a significant role in gene expression regulation (Weijing2019A; Akcan2017A). The T-box domain forms a prominent fold that is typical of the T-box family of transcription factors, allowing it to interact with DNA as either dimers or monomers (Liu2001Tbx19).

Mutations within or near this domain can significantly impact the protein's function. For instance, a missense mutation within the T-box region, c.205C>T (p.R69W), may disrupt DNA binding, highlighting the domain's importance in maintaining the protein's structural integrity and function (Weijing2019A). The TBX19 protein is involved in the regulation of pituitary gland development and function, specifically influencing the expression of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene (Liu2001Tbx19). While the context does not provide detailed information on the tertiary or quaternary structures, the T-box domain's role in DNA binding is a critical aspect of the protein's molecular structure.

## Function
TBX19, also known as Tpit, is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and function of the pituitary gland, particularly in the differentiation of corticotroph and melanotroph cell lineages. In healthy human cells, TBX19 is essential for the activation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) transcription, a precursor to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is crucial for adrenal function and cortisol production (Lamolet2001A; Weijing2019A). TBX19 functions by binding to specific DNA elements in the POMC promoter and forming a complex with Pitx1, enhancing transcriptional activity (Lamolet2001A). This interaction is vital for the differentiation of corticotroph cells, which produce ACTH, and melanotroph cells, which are involved in pigmentation (Kelberman2009Genetic).

TBX19 is expressed in the developing pituitary gland and is maintained into adulthood, indicating its ongoing role in pituitary function (Kelberman2009Genetic). It also represses the expression of genes associated with gonadotrope identity, thereby promoting corticotrope and melanotrope fate (Kelberman2009Genetic). Mutations in TBX19 can lead to isolated ACTH deficiency, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal endocrine function (Weijing2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBX19 gene are associated with congenital isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (CIAD), a rare disorder characterized by low levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. This condition often presents with severe hypoglycemia, seizures, and prolonged jaundice, particularly in the neonatal period (Weijing2019A; Akcan2017A). CIAD is typically caused by mutations that disrupt the function of the TBX19 gene, leading to insufficient ACTH production and subsequent adrenal insufficiency (Abali2019Evaluation; Vieira2022A).

Patients with TBX19 mutations may experience a range of symptoms, including hypoglycemia, seizures, and gastrointestinal issues, which can be managed with hydrocortisone treatment (Abali2019Evaluation; Peng2020Congenital). The condition is autosomal recessive, and early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent severe complications such as developmental delays and neurological impairments (Peng2020Congenital; Vieira2022A).

The TBX19 gene is located on chromosome 1q24.2 and consists of 8 exons. Mutations in this gene are rare, with only a limited number of different mutations described in the literature (Abali2019Evaluation; Kardelen2019A).

## Interactions
TBX19, also known as T-box transcription factor 19, participates in various interactions that influence its role in gene regulation. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TBX19 forms a transcriptional complex with protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). This complex leads to epigenetic modifications, such as histone H4R3me2a and H3K9ac-mediated transactivation of the Mitochondrial Fission Factor (MFF), which helps reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and prevents ROS-mediated degradation of the pluripotent transcription factor OCT4. This interaction enhances tumor formation, cellular self-renewal, and proliferation in tumor cells (Li2024Contextdependent).

TBX19 is also involved in the regulation of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression in the pituitary gland. It can activate POMC gene expression and repress the α glycoprotein subunit and thyroid-stimulating hormone β promoters, suggesting its role as a component of the POMC gene activation program and as a repressor of other gene expressions (Liu2001Tbx19). These interactions highlight TBX19's role in both cancer progression and pituitary gland development, demonstrating its diverse functional capabilities through various protein and nucleic acid interactions.
