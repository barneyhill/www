# SLC22A1

## Overview
The SLC22A1 gene encodes the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), a transmembrane protein that is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). OCT1 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it plays a critical role in the transport of a wide array of organic cations, including drugs, toxins, and endogenous compounds, across cell membranes. This transporter is characterized by its 12 α-helical transmembrane domains and operates independently of sodium and proton gradients, relying instead on substrate concentration gradients and membrane potential (Koepsell2007Polyspecific; Jonker2003Pharmacological). The structural features of OCT1, such as its large glycosylated extracellular loop and phosphorylation sites, are essential for its function and regulation (Keller2011The; Volk2013OCTs). Variations in the SLC22A1 gene can significantly impact drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic responses, highlighting its clinical importance in personalized medicine (Qiu2017Imatinibinduced; Zazuli2020The).

## Structure
The SLC22A1 gene encodes the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) characterized by 12 α-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Koepsell2007Polyspecific; Volk2013OCTs). The protein features a large glycosylated extracellular loop between TMDs 1 and 2, which contains conserved cysteines that may form disulfide bridges, crucial for oligomerization (Keller2011The; Volk2013OCTs). An intracellular loop between TMDs 6 and 7 contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinases, indicating a role in regulatory processes (Volk2013OCTs).

The tertiary structure of OCT1 has been modeled using the structure of bacterial transporters like LacY, revealing a large cleft accessible from the aqueous phase where substrate binding occurs (Koepsell2013The; Volk2013OCTs). This cleft is formed by several TMDs and can exist in inward- or outward-oriented conformations, affecting substrate affinity (Volk2013OCTs). Specific amino acids, such as a conserved glutamate in the 11th TMD, are crucial for substrate binding (Volk2013OCTs).

OCT1 is known to form oligomers, with the large extracellular loop playing a pivotal role in this process (Keller2011The). The presence of disulfide bridges is essential for maintaining the oligomeric state, as reducing agents can disrupt this structure (Keller2011The).

## Function
The SLC22A1 gene encodes the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), which is primarily expressed in the liver, specifically in the sinusoidal membranes of hepatocytes. OCT1 facilitates the transport of a wide range of organic cations, including drugs, toxins, and endogenous compounds, across cell membranes. This transporter operates in a sodium- and proton-independent manner, driven by substrate concentration gradients and membrane potential (Jonker2003Pharmacological; Koepsell2019Organic).

OCT1 plays a crucial role in the hepatic uptake and elimination of various substrates, including clinically used drugs such as metformin, antiparkinsonians, and antidiabetics, as well as biogenic amines like dopamine and norepinephrine. It is involved in the detoxification processes in the liver by mediating the transport and clearance of these compounds (Rulcova2013Glucocorticoid; Jonker2003Pharmacological).

The expression and function of OCT1 are regulated by several transcription factors, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), which is involved in bile acid-dependent regulation. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the physiological role of OCT1 in healthy human cells, impacting drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (Koepsell2019Organic; Ciarimboli2021Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the SLC22A1 gene, which encodes the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), have significant clinical implications. Variants such as rs34130495 (G401S), rs72552763 (M420del), and rs622342 are associated with altered drug pharmacokinetics, particularly affecting the transport and clearance of drugs like metformin and morphine. These genetic variations can lead to metformin intolerance and affect its glycemic response in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, although the clinical significance regarding metformin's effectiveness remains inconclusive (Zazuli2020The).

In different ethnic populations, the SLC22A1 gene exhibits distinct haplotype structures, influencing the pharmacokinetics of metformin. Variants such as R61C, G401S, and G465R are linked to higher rates of renal clearance of metformin and decreased glucose-lowering response, suggesting that genetic variations in SLC22A1 can affect drug response (Cheong2011Screening).

Additionally, polymorphisms in SLC22A1 have been associated with imatinib-induced ophthalmological side effects, such as conjunctival hemorrhage, in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The SNP rs683369 is significantly correlated with these side effects, indicating that genetic variations in SLC22A1 may influence drug toxicity and therapeutic response (Qiu2017Imatinibinduced).

## Interactions
The SLC22A1 gene encodes the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), which is primarily expressed in the liver and plays a crucial role in the uptake of various organic cations, including drugs and endogenous compounds. OCT1 is known to form homo-oligomers, as demonstrated in studies using rat protein, where it was shown to form dimers and tetramers under specific conditions. This oligomerization is dependent on the presence of disulfide bridges and is influenced by detergents such as LMPG and CHAPS (Keller2011The). 

Despite its ability to form homo-oligomers, OCT1 does not form hetero-oligomers with other transporters like OCT2 or OAT1 (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). The oligomerization of OCT1 does not appear to impact its transport function, as functional studies have shown similar substrate affinities in reconstituted systems compared to overexpressing cells (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). The large extracellular loop of OCT1 is pivotal for its oligomerization and substrate affinity, with mutations in this region affecting its function independently of oligomerization (Keller2011The). These interactions and structural characteristics are essential for understanding the transporter's role in drug metabolism and potential drug-drug interactions.
