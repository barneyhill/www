# LRRC56

## Overview
The LRRC56 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 56 protein, which is integral to the function and assembly of motile cilia. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for its role in intraflagellar transport (IFT) processes. LRRC56 is not a structural component of the axoneme but acts as a cargo protein, interacting with IFT proteins such as IFT88 to ensure the proper assembly and transport of dynein arm complexes, essential for ciliary motility (Bonnefoy2018Biallelic; ivare2020characterization). Mutations in the LRRC56 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, leading to clinical manifestations such as chronic respiratory infections and laterality defects (Asseri2023Clinical; ivare2020characterization). The protein's evolutionary conservation across species with motile cilia underscores its critical role in maintaining normal ciliary activity and function (Bonnefoy2023Novel).

## Structure
The LRRC56 gene encodes a protein that is 542 amino acids long and contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (ivare2020characterization). Specifically, the LRRC56 protein includes four LRR motifs located near the N-terminal region (ivare2020characterization). These motifs are characterized by a consensus sequence LxxLxLxxN/CxL, where 'x' can be any amino acid, and 'L' positions can also be occupied by valine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine (ivare2020characterization).

The protein is associated with intraflagellar transport (IFT) and interacts with the IFT protein IFT88, indicating its role in the assembly and transport of dynein arm complexes during flagellar assembly (Bonnefoy2018Biallelic; ivare2020characterization). The LRRC56 protein is not a core component of the axoneme but acts as a cargo, suggesting it is involved in the transport processes rather than being a structural element of the cilia (Bonnefoy2018Biallelic).

The LRRC56 protein is conserved across species with motile cilia, and its function is crucial for ciliary motility, as mutations in the gene can lead to defects in ciliary function (Bonnefoy2023Novel). The protein's association with IFT and its role in dynein arm maturation highlight its importance in cellular processes involving cilia and flagella.

## Function
The LRRC56 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and function of motile cilia in human cells. This protein is involved in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) process, which is essential for the proper assembly of outer dynein arms (ODAs) on cilia. The ODAs are crucial for ciliary motility, which impacts various physiological processes, including respiratory function and the correct placement of internal organs (Poprzeczko2019Rare; ivare2020characterization).

LRRC56 interacts with IFT proteins, such as IFT88, to facilitate the transport and assembly of dynein arms, which are necessary for the structural integrity and motility of cilia (Poprzeczko2019Rare). The protein contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs that are primarily involved in protein-protein interactions, allowing it to perform its role in ciliary function effectively (ivare2020characterization).

Mutations in the LRRC56 gene can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition characterized by impaired ciliary motility, resulting in respiratory infections and laterality defects such as situs inversus totalis (Asseri2023Clinical; ivare2020characterization). The gene's function is crucial for maintaining normal ciliary activity and ensuring proper cellular and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRRC56 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function leading to chronic respiratory tract infections, situs inversus, and reduced fertility. Specifically, LRRC56 mutations can result in the absence of outer dynein arms in the distal portion of the axoneme, which is crucial for proper ciliary movement (Asseri2023Clinical). In a study involving prenatal genetic diagnosis, a compound heterozygous variant in LRRC56 was identified in a fetus with situs inversus totalis and mirror-image dextrocardia, highlighting its role in laterality defects (Xue2024Prenatal).

The gene has been implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia type 39, an autosomal recessive disorder, with pathogenic variants classified according to ACMG/AMP guidelines (Xue2024Prenatal). In a clinical study conducted in southwest Saudi Arabia, LRRC56 mutations were found in 10.7% of PCD cases, affecting three individuals from one family, indicating its role in familial PCD cases (Asseri2023Clinical). The study also noted that PCD is a heterogeneous disease with poor phenotype-genotype correlation, often leading to delayed diagnosis (Asseri2023Clinical).

## Interactions
The LRRC56 protein is involved in several interactions crucial for its role in ciliary function. It is identified as an intraflagellar transport (IFT) cargo protein, interacting with the IFT machinery, particularly with the IFT81 protein, as part of its transport within the flagellum of Trypanosoma brucei (Bonnefoy2023Novel). LRRC56's interaction with the distal docking complex (dDC) proteins, such as dDC1 and dDC2, is essential for its localization to the flagellum. Knockdown of dDC2 results in the accumulation of LRRC56 in the cytoplasm, indicating a dependency on dDC proteins for its proper localization (Bonnefoy2023Novel).

In vertebrates, LRRC56 interacts with the IFT protein IFT88, which supports its role in the maturation and transport of outer dynein arms (ODAs), essential for ciliary motility (ivare2020characterization). The protein contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, further suggesting its involvement in complex formation necessary for ciliary function (ivare2020characterization). These interactions are critical for understanding the genetic basis of conditions like primary ciliary dyskinesia, where defects in ODA assembly can lead to clinical manifestations (ivare2020characterization).
