# CNTFR

## Overview
The CNTFR gene encodes the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor, a glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the nervous system by mediating the effects of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and related cytokines. This receptor is categorized as a transmembrane receptor and is a key component of a tripartite receptor complex that includes gp130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). The CNTFR is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage, which is essential for its localization and function. It is primarily expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it is involved in neuronal survival, differentiation, and regeneration. The receptor's interactions with various ligands, including CNTF, cardiotrophin-like cytokine, and neuropoietin, facilitate the activation of intracellular signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT, which are crucial for maintaining neuronal health (Rousseau2008Ciliary; Ip1993The). Additionally, CNTFR has clinical significance in neurodegenerative diseases and muscle strength variations, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (De2007Polymorphisms; Fan2017Hypomethylation).

## Structure
The ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) is a glycoprotein that forms part of a tripartite receptor complex, which includes gp130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) (PlunFavreau2001The). CNTFR is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage, directing it to specific membrane domains (Neugart2009Detection). The primary structure of CNTFR includes a cytokine binding domain (CBD) composed of two fibronectin III domains linked by a proline-rich sequence (Rousseau2008Ciliary). The N-terminal fibronectin III domain (D2 domain) contains two conserved disulfide bridges, while the C-terminal domain (D3 domain) features a conserved WSXWS motif (Rousseau2008Ciliary).

The tertiary structure of CNTFR involves an elbow-shaped module bent at an angle of approximately 90°, which interacts with cytokines through loops at the boundary of the fibronectin III domains (Rousseau2008Ciliary). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are significant, with all four putative glycosylation sites utilized (Neugart2009Detection). The addition of an ACP-tag introduces an additional glycosylation site, which does not impair the protein's function (Neugart2009Detection). These structural features are crucial for the receptor's role in mediating the functional responses of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and related cytokines.

## Function
The ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) is a critical component of the receptor complex for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which is involved in various signaling pathways essential for neuronal health and function. CNTFR is primarily expressed in the nervous system, including the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it plays a significant role in motor neuron function and neuropoiesis (Ip1993The). The receptor complex, which includes CNTFRα, gp130, and LIFRβ, facilitates the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT pathways. These pathways are crucial for promoting neuron survival, differentiation, and regeneration (Pasquin2015Ciliary; Fantone2020Ciliary).

CNTFR is also involved in the development and maturation of neuronal precursors, particularly during embryonic development, where it is expressed in regions with actively dividing cells, such as the subependymal zone of the lateral ventricle (Ip1993The). In addition to its role in the nervous system, CNTFR is expressed in other tissues, including skeletal muscle, where it may contribute to maintaining motor system function (Ip1993The). The receptor's ability to mediate CNTF responses is enhanced by its soluble form, sCNTFRα, which can facilitate CNTF signaling in cells lacking the full receptor complex (Davis1993Released).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and methylation of the CNTFR gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In lower grade gliomas (LGG), hypomethylation of the CNTFRα gene is associated with its overexpression, which correlates with poor prognosis and increased tumor proliferation. This hypomethylation is linked to shorter survival times in LGG patients, suggesting that CNTFRα could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in these tumors (Fan2017Hypomethylation).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, the CNTFR is part of a receptor complex that mediates the neuroprotective effects of Humanin, a peptide known to inhibit neuronal cell death. Alterations in CNTFR interactions, particularly with WSX-1 and gp130, can impact the efficacy of Humanin in protecting neuronal cells, which may have implications for conditions like Alzheimer's disease (Hashimoto2009Humanin).

Additionally, polymorphisms in the CNTFR gene have been associated with muscle strength variations in different age groups and genders. These genetic variations can influence muscle performance, which is crucial for maintaining health, especially in the elderly (De2007Polymorphisms).

## Interactions
The ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) is a key component of a receptor complex that includes the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and gp130. This complex is essential for the signaling pathways mediated by ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). CNTFR interacts with CNTF to form a tripartite receptor complex, which is crucial for the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor subunits, leading to signal transduction (Davis1993LIFRβ). The formation of this complex involves the heterodimerization of gp130 with LIFR, rather than the homodimerization seen in interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling (Davis1993LIFRβ).

CNTFR also interacts with other ligands such as cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) and neuropoietin (NP), sharing a conserved binding site for these interactions (Rousseau2008Ciliary). Additionally, CNTFR is involved in the neuroprotective effects of Humanin (HN), where it forms a hetero-oligomeric receptor complex with WSX-1 and gp130. This complex is crucial for HN's ability to inhibit neuronal cell death (Hashimoto2009Humanin). The interaction of CNTFR with extracellular alpha-synuclein (eSNCA) has also been identified, suggesting a role in mediating neurotoxicity through the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway (Liu2010Identification).
