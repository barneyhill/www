# SEL1L3

## Overview
SEL1L3 is a gene that encodes the protein SEL1L family member 3, which is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This pathway is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis by identifying and targeting misfolded proteins for degradation, thereby playing a significant role in cellular quality control processes (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated). The SEL1L3 protein is characterized by its involvement in cellular stress regulation and is expressed in various tissues, including rod photoreceptor cells and lymphoid tissue, indicating its potential roles in aging and the immune system (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated). Notably, SEL1L3 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as hyper-N-glycosylation, which have been linked to autoimmune reactions in diseases like primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated). The protein's interactions and modifications underscore its importance in both normal cellular functions and disease pathologies.

## Structure
SEL1L3 is a protein encoded by the SEL1L3 gene, located on chromosome 4, and consists of 1132 amino acids (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated). The protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including hyper-N-glycosylation at asparagine 527, which contributes to its increased molecular weight in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL) patients (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated). This hyper-N-glycosylation is a significant modification that may lead to chronic immune reactions and is implicated in the development of PVRL (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated).

The SEL1L3 protein is expressed in various tissues, including rod photoreceptor cells of the eye and lymphoid tissue, suggesting a role in cellular stress regulation and potential involvement in aging and the immune system (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated). While the specific domains and secondary or tertiary structures of SEL1L3 are not detailed in the provided context, the protein's interaction with B-cell receptors (BCRs) in PVRL highlights its importance as an auto-antigenic target. The reactive epitope of SEL1L3 spans amino acids 560-580, which is crucial for its recognition by BCRs in a subset of PVRL cases (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated).

## Function
The SEL1L3 gene encodes Protein sel-1 homolog 3, a member of the SEL1L family, which is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This pathway is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by identifying and targeting misfolded proteins for degradation, thus playing a critical role in cellular quality control processes (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated). SEL1L3 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it impacts protein folding and degradation, contributing to the regulation of cell stress (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated).

SEL1L3 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including rod photoreceptor cells of the eye and lymphoid tissue, suggesting a broad role in cellular functions across different organ systems (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated). Although the precise function of SEL1L3 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, it is suggested to be involved in the regulation of cell stress and potentially in aging and the immune system (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated). The protein's involvement in these processes indicates its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, although specific molecular activities in healthy cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
SEL1L3 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular processes. In primary vitreoretinal lymphomas (PVRL), SEL1L3 is identified as a hyper-N-glycosylated auto-antigenic target for B-cell receptors (BCRs). This modification at asparagine 527 triggers autoimmune reactions, contributing to the disease pathology. The hyper-N-glycosylation of SEL1L3 is associated with chronic immune reactions and B-cell neoplasia development in PVRL patients (Elbert2024HyperNglycosylated).

SEL1L3 is also involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer. In CRC, SEL1L3 is expressed at higher levels in tumor tissues, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression. It is considered a potential tumor marker, particularly in endometrial cancer, where it correlates with reactive oxygen species and is linked to tumor growth and metastasis (Yuan2023Effective).

In Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease, SEL1L3 is downregulated, with a fold change of -2.223. This downregulation is part of broader changes in gene expression related to cytoskeletal signaling, inflammation, and oxidative stress, although SEL1L3's specific role in NPC is not detailed (HetmańczykSawicka2020Changes).
