# ALOX15B

## Overview
ALOX15B is a gene that encodes the enzyme arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase type B, a member of the lipoxygenase family of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily involved in the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, to produce bioactive lipid mediators like 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) (Snodgrass2019Regulation). Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase type B plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis, influencing processes such as cholesterol metabolism and the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (Snodgrass2019Regulation). The enzyme is constitutively expressed in human macrophages and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including atherogenesis, cancer, and inflammatory diseases (Benatzy2022Arachidonate; Snodgrass2019Regulation).

## Structure
ALOX15B is a mammalian lipoxygenase enzyme structured as a single polypeptide chain that folds into a two-domain structure. It consists of a C-terminal α-helical domain and an N-terminal β-barrel domain. The α-helical domain contains a non-heme iron within a putative substrate-binding pocket, crucial for its catalytic activity. The β-barrel domain is involved in substrate acquisition and calcium-dependent membrane binding via a polycystin-1-lipoxygenase α-toxin (PLAT) domain (Benatzy2022Arachidonate).

The enzyme's active site features a U-shaped conformation that positions the C13 atom of arachidonic acid adjacent to the catalytic iron, facilitating hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation at C15. This orientation is regulated by conserved amino acids, and mutations can alter substrate entry orientation and positional specificity (Benatzy2022Arachidonate).

ALOX15B predominantly exists as monomers in solution, and evidence for monomeric allosteric regulation is lacking. The enzyme's activity is modulated by its own hydroperoxide products, which can alter substrate specificity and enzyme activity (Benatzy2022Arachidonate). No alternative splice variants of ALOX15B have been described to localize to the nucleus, and they show minimal arachidonic acid metabolizing activity (Benatzy2022Arachidonate).

## Function
ALOX15B encodes the enzyme arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase type B, which is involved in the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid (AA) to produce 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) (Snodgrass2019Regulation). This enzyme is constitutively expressed in human macrophages and plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Snodgrass2019Regulation). ALOX15B is involved in the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, contributing to foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesions, highlighting its role in atherogenesis (Snodgrass2019Regulation).

In terms of cellular lipid homeostasis, ALOX15B influences cholesterol metabolism by modulating sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) signaling. Silencing ALOX15B impairs SREBP-2 activation, reducing cellular cholesterol levels and affecting the expression of liver X receptor (LXR) target genes (Snodgrass2018A). The enzyme's activity is also linked to the regulation of cholesterol ester hydrolysis and cholesterol efflux in macrophages (Snodgrass2019Regulation).

ALOX15B's enzymatic activity is characterized by its ability to oxygenate esterified PUFAs in biomembranes and lipoproteins, a unique feature among mammalian lipoxygenase isoforms (Snodgrass2019Regulation). This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing protein-membrane interactions (Snodgrass2019Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
The ALOX15B gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases through alterations in its expression or function. In cardiovascular diseases, ALOX15B contributes to atherosclerosis by promoting macrophage foam cell formation and atherogenesis, with its expression being upregulated under hypoxic conditions. Polymorphisms in ALOX15B have been linked to coronary artery disease (CAD), although the exact role remains unclear (Benatzy2022Arachidonate; Wuest2014Association).

In cancer, ALOX15B exhibits a dual role. It acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate and breast cancers, where its expression is associated with reduced tumor size and increased apoptosis. Conversely, in lung adenocarcinoma, ALOX15B and its product 15-HETE are linked to cell proliferation and migration, particularly under hypoxic conditions (Benatzy2022Arachidonate).

ALOX15B is also implicated in inflammatory diseases. In psoriasis, its expression is lower compared to normal skin, but its metabolites are increased in lesions, potentially aiding in resolution by modulating inflammation. In asthma, ALOX15B expression is elevated in severe cases, possibly due to Th2 cytokine activity (Benatzy2022Arachidonate).
