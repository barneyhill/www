# CCDC14

## Overview
CCDC14, or coiled-coil domain containing 14, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is part of the coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of centrosome function and cell cycle progression. It plays a crucial role in maintaining centrosome organization by negatively regulating centriole duplication and influencing the localization of key centrosomal proteins such as CEP63 and CDK2, which are vital for proper cell division (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil). CCDC14 is categorized as a centrosome-associated protein and is known to interact with several centriolar satellite proteins, indicating its involvement in centriole architecture and function (FiratKaralar2014Proximity). The protein's expression in various tissues, including reproductive organs, suggests potential roles in broader physiological processes, although specific functions in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil).

## Structure


## Function
CCDC14 is a protein involved in maintaining proper centrosome function and cell cycle regulation. It plays a critical role in centrosome organization by negatively regulating centriole duplication and the centrosomal localization of CEP63 and CDK2, which are essential for cell division processes (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil). This regulation is crucial for ensuring accurate cell cycle progression and preventing abnormal cell division, which can lead to various cellular dysfunctions.

CCDC14 is part of the broader family of coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) proteins, which are involved in numerous physiological processes, including signaling pathways, chromosome segregation, and centriole architecture (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil). These proteins are expressed in a wide range of tissues and have diverse cellular localizations, contributing to their roles in cellular and organismal functions.

While the specific influence of CCDC14 on male reproductive physiology remains unexplored, CCDC proteins, in general, are known to be expressed in the testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle, and prostate, suggesting potential roles in reproductive processes (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil). Further research could elucidate the specific functions of CCDC14 in these contexts.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CCDC14 is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, particularly in the context of centriolar satellites and centriole duplication. It has been identified as a centrosome component and localizes to centriolar satellites. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells have demonstrated that CCDC14 physically interacts with CEP63, a protein involved in centriole duplication (FiratKaralar2014Proximity). BioID proximity labeling has identified several centriolar satellite proteins as interactors of CCDC14, including PCM1, OFD1, CEP90, and CDK1, suggesting that CCDC14 is a component of centriolar satellites (FiratKaralar2014Proximity).

The functional significance of CCDC14 was explored by depleting it from U2OS cells, which resulted in an increased percentage of cells with more than four centrioles. This phenotype was not due to prolonged S phase arrest and could be rescued by expression of RNAi-resistant GFP-CCDC14, indicating that CCDC14 negatively regulates centriole duplication (FiratKaralar2014Proximity). The interaction of CCDC14 with CEP63 was further examined, revealing that depletion of CCDC14 increased the CEP63 immunofluorescence signal at the centrosome, suggesting that CCDC14 and KIAA0753 regulate CEP63 levels antagonistically at the centrosome (FiratKaralar2014Proximity).
