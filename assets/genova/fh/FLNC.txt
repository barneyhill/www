# FLNC

## Overview
The FLNC gene encodes filamin C, a crucial actin-binding protein predominantly expressed in striated muscle tissues, such as cardiac and skeletal muscles. Filamin C is categorized as a structural protein, playing a vital role in maintaining the mechanical stability and integrity of muscle cells. It achieves this by crosslinking actin filaments and interacting with various proteins at the Z-discs, sarcolemma, and intercalated discs, thereby facilitating sarcomere organization and function. The protein's structure, characterized by an N-terminal actin-binding domain and 24 immunoglobulin-like domains, allows it to form a V-shaped dimer essential for its function. Filamin C is also involved in mechanotransduction, acting as a nodal point for transmitting mechanical signals within muscle cells. Mutations in the FLNC gene are linked to several cardiomyopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac health (Eden2021Cardiac; Wu2023Filamin; Lazzarino2024Defective).

## Structure
Filamin C (FLNC) is a large actin-binding protein primarily expressed in striated muscle tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscles. The protein is composed of an N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD) followed by 24 immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, which are crucial for its structural and functional roles (Wu2023Filamin; Sellung2023Novel). The C-terminal Ig-like domain 24 is responsible for dimerization, forming a V-shaped dimer that allows FLNC to crosslink actin filaments into orthogonal networks, promoting high-angle branching (Lazzarino2024Defective; GonzálezMorales2017Filamin).

The protein's structure includes two hinges that provide flexibility, separating the Ig repeats R15 from R16 and R23 from R24 (Lazzarino2024Defective). These domains are composed of β-sheets, which confer high strength and resistance under load, although they fail in a more brittle manner compared to α-helices (Lazzarino2024Defective). FLNC interacts with various proteins at the Z-discs, sarcolemma, and intercalated discs, playing a critical role in maintaining sarcomere organization and function (Wu2023Filamin; Sellung2023Novel).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence FLNC's function and interactions. Multiple splice variants of FLNC exist, potentially affecting its structural and functional properties (Mehdizadeh2024Combination).

## Function
The FLNC gene encodes filamin C, a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Filamin C is primarily expressed in striated muscle tissues and is localized to the Z-discs, intercalated discs, and sarcolemma within cardiomyocytes. It functions as a structural crosslinker of actin filaments, contributing to the mechanical stability of cells by linking the internal actin network with membrane receptors and mechanosensitive components (Eden2021Cardiac; Lazzarino2024Defective).

Filamin C is involved in mechanotransduction, serving as a nodal point for transmitting mechanical signals within muscle cells. It interacts with various proteins at the sarcomeric Z-discs, including calsarcins, myopalladin, cypher, actin, myotilin, and myopodin, and binds to the sarcolemma via integrin-1β and sarcoglycan-delta, part of the muscular dystrophin complex (Eden2021Cardiac). The protein's ability to crosslink actin filaments into orthogonal networks increases the structural rigidity of the actin network, which is facilitated by its elongated, V-shaped dimer structure (Lazzarino2024Defective).

In healthy cells, filamin C is essential for maintaining structural integrity and facilitating cellular responses to mechanical stress, contributing to muscle contraction and cell shape conservation (Wu2023Filamin; Reimann2020Phosphoproteomics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FLNC gene, which encodes the protein filamin C, are associated with a range of cardiomyopathies. These include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. In HCM, FLNC mutations lead to sarcomeric abnormalities and are linked to a higher incidence of sudden cardiac death (ValdésMas2014Mutations). In DCM, FLNC mutations result in ventricular enlargement and systolic dysfunction, often leading to a severe clinical course and sudden cardiac death (Begay2016FLNC; Cai2023Multiple). Truncating mutations in FLNC are particularly associated with high-risk dilated and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, characterized by left ventricular dilation and frequent ventricular arrhythmias (OrtizGenga2016Truncating).

FLNC mutations are also implicated in RCM, a condition marked by ventricular stiffness and severe diastolic dysfunction, often requiring heart transplantation (Brodehl2016Mutations). These mutations can lead to the formation of protein aggregates that disrupt normal cardiac function (ValdésMas2014Mutations). The clinical manifestations of FLNC mutations can vary widely, even among individuals with the same mutation, due to factors like incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity (Baban2022Cardiovascular).

## Interactions
Filamin C (FLNC) is a crucial protein in muscle cells, interacting with various proteins to maintain structural integrity and function. It binds to myotilin and FATZ-1, both Z-disc proteins, through its Ig-like repeats 19-24. These interactions are essential for the crosslinking of actin filaments and sarcomere assembly (Gontier2005The). FLNC also interacts with the β1A integrin subunit, with its C-terminal region associating with the cytoplasmic domain of β1A, a process crucial for linking the Z-disc to the sarcolemma (Gontier2005The).

FLNC forms complexes with myopodin, a novel binding partner, through its Ig-like domains 20-21. This interaction is significant for the early assembly and stabilization of the Z-disc (Linnemann2010The). FLNC also interacts with components of the dystrophin-dystroglycan complex and sarcoglycans at the sarcolemma, linking myofibrils to the sarcolemma and maintaining muscle integrity (Wu2023Filamin; Sellung2023Novel).

Phosphorylation of FLNC by kinases such as Akt and PKCα modulates its interactions, particularly with FILIP1, reducing binding affinity and protecting FLNC from degradation. This regulation is crucial for its stability and function in muscle cells (Reimann2020Phosphoproteomics).
