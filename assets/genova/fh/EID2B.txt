# EID2B

## Overview
The EID2B gene encodes the protein known as EP300 interacting inhibitor of differentiation 2B, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional regulator, playing a crucial role in modulating gene expression by interacting with the EP300 protein, a well-known transcriptional co-activator. The interaction between EID2B and EP300 is significant in the regulation of differentiation and proliferation pathways, impacting cellular development and homeostasis. The precise mechanisms by which EID2B influences these pathways are still under investigation, but its role in transcriptional regulation suggests potential implications in various physiological and pathological contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC).
