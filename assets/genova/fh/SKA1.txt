# SKA1

## Overview
The SKA1 gene encodes the spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 1, a protein integral to the spindle and kinetochore-associated (Ska) complex. This complex is essential for the stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachments during mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and preventing aneuploidy. The SKA1 protein, characterized by its winged-helix domain, interacts with microtubules and other kinetochore proteins, playing a regulatory role in cell cycle progression. It is subject to regulation by phosphorylation, particularly by Aurora B kinase, which modulates its interactions with the Ndc80 complex. Dysregulation of SKA1 has been implicated in various cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Chen2018SKA1; Abad2014Structural; Sivakumar2016The).

## Structure
The SKA1 protein is a critical component of the SKA complex, which plays a vital role in stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachments during cell division. Structurally, SKA1 is a 255 amino acid protein with distinct functional regions. The N-terminal region (residues 1-130) includes a coiled-coil domain essential for forming the SKA complex and interacting with SKA2 and SKA3 (Sucularli2019Computational). The C-terminal region (residues 133-255) serves as the primary microtubule-binding domain (MTBD), crucial for microtubule recognition and binding (Abad2014Structural; Sucularli2019Computational).

The SKA1 MTBD is characterized by a modified winged-helix domain, which is typically involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions. This domain includes eight alpha-helical segments and a C-terminal beta-hairpin, allowing SKA1 to bind both straight and curved microtubule structures (Abad2014Structural). The MTBD interacts with specific regions of tubulin monomers, such as helices H3 and H4 of β-tubulin and H12 of α-tubulin, through multiple contact sites (Abad2014Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Aurora B kinase, regulate SKA1's microtubule-binding activity. Phosphorylation at specific sites can reduce its binding ability, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for its function (Abad2014Structural). The SKA complex forms a W-shaped structure, with the MTBDs protruding at the ends, facilitating a transversal mode of microtubule binding (Abad2014Structural).

## Function
The SKA1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the human spindle and kinetochore-associated (Ska) complex, which plays a vital role in chromosome segregation during mitosis. The Ska complex, which includes subunits Ska1, Ska2, and Ska3, is essential for stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule interactions, ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, and preventing aneuploidy (Abad2014Structural; Zhang2018Multitasking).

Ska1 interacts with microtubules through its C-terminal domain, which forms a winged-helix-like structure, allowing it to bind both straight and curved microtubule structures. This interaction is crucial for the Ska complex's ability to track depolymerizing microtubules and maintain stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments (Abad2014Structural). The Ska complex also recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to kinetochores, a process essential for opposing spindle checkpoint signaling and promoting anaphase onset (Sivakumar2016The).

The Ska complex's function is regulated by phosphorylation events, particularly by Aurora B kinase, which modulates its interactions with the Ndc80 complex during different cell cycle phases (Zhang2018Multitasking). The proper functioning of the Ska complex is crucial for maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells (Sivakumar2016The).

## Clinical Significance
The SKA1 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and chromosome segregation. Alterations in SKA1 expression are associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), breast, lung, and gastric cancers. In HCC, SKA1 overexpression correlates with larger tumor size, higher serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, and advanced TNM stage, serving as an independent prognostic factor for overall and recurrence-free survival (Chen2018SKA1; Song2022SKA123). High SKA1 expression is also linked to increased cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, while its inhibition can lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Sucularli2019Computational).

Mutations in SKA1, particularly in its microtubule-binding domain, can disrupt its function, leading to chromosomal instability and contributing to tumorigenesis. These mutations are often deleterious and affect the structural integrity of the SKA complex, which is crucial for proper kinetochore-microtubule interactions during mitosis (Sucularli2019Computational). In oral adenosquamous carcinoma, silencing SKA1 results in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2013Spindle). Overall, SKA1's dysregulation and mutations play a significant role in cancer progression and prognosis.

## Interactions
The SKA1 protein is a component of the spindle and kinetochore-associated (Ska) complex, which plays a critical role in the metaphase-anaphase transition of the cell cycle. SKA1 interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) through its C-terminal domain (CTD), facilitating the recruitment of PP1 to kinetochores. This interaction is essential for the dephosphorylation of kinetochore proteins and the promotion of anaphase onset (Sivakumar2016The). The SKA1 CTD does not contain clear matches for known PP1-binding motifs, yet it is crucial for PP1 kinetochore targeting and KNL1 dephosphorylation (Sivakumar2016The).

SKA1 also interacts with microtubules, binding through multiple sites on its CTD. This interaction is important for stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule interactions, although it primarily serves a regulatory role rather than a mechanical one (Sivakumar2016The). The Ska complex, including SKA1, interacts with the Ndc80 complex, a key player in kinetochore-microtubule attachments. This interaction is enhanced by Cdk1 phosphorylation, which is crucial for the Ska complex's localization to kinetochores (Zhang2019In; Zhang2020Multisite). These interactions highlight SKA1's role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation during mitosis.
