# CCDC24

## Overview
CCDC24, or coiled-coil domain containing 24, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC24 protein may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. Although the precise biological functions of CCDC24 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in various cellular pathways has been implicated in cancer biology. The gene's expression levels have been associated with the progression and prognosis of certain cancers, including colorectal and breast cancer, indicating its potential as a biomarker for these diseases (Yue2020Silencing; Kim2008Gene). Further research is needed to clarify the specific mechanisms by which CCDC24 influences cellular function and contributes to disease pathology.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
CCDC24 has been implicated in various diseases, primarily through alterations in its expression levels. In sporadic colorectal cancers, CCDC24 is one of the genes downregulated in association with alterations in the p53 pathway. These alterations are linked to immune response, extracellular matrix structure, and sensory perception, particularly affecting antigen presentation-related genes in right colon cancers (Kim2008Gene). 

In the context of breast cancer, CCDC24 is identified as one of the top five protein-coding genes correlated with poor prognosis in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. This suggests that changes in CCDC24 expression may contribute to the malignancy and progression of breast cancer (Yue2020Silencing).

While CCDC24 is mentioned in studies related to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), specific diseases or conditions directly associated with mutations or alterations in CCDC24 are not detailed in the available literature. The gene is included in frequency analyses of discriminatory genes for mutations like SF3B1, but no direct link to specific conditions is provided (Fernández‐Martínez2017Genomic). Overall, CCDC24's role in cancer highlights its potential clinical significance, warranting further investigation into its contributions to disease pathology.
