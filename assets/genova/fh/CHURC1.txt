# CHURC1

## Overview
CHURC1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as Churchill domain containing 1, which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by the presence of a Churchill domain, which is crucial for its interaction with other molecules and its regulatory functions. This domain allows the protein to participate in various cellular processes, potentially undergoing post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation that can modulate its activity. The CHURC1 protein's structure includes primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, with potential splice variant isoforms arising from alternative splicing events, which may affect its function. The gene has been implicated in neurobehavioral phenotypes, including autism spectrum disorder, suggesting its importance in neuronal development and function (Griswold2011A; Griswold2012Evaluation).

## Structure
The CHURC1 gene encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, characterized by the presence of a Churchill domain, which is essential for its function. This domain plays a critical role in the protein's ability to interact with other molecules and perform its regulatory functions. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions.

The primary structure of the CHURC1 protein consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-level structures. The secondary structure likely includes common motifs such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other cellular components. Information on the quaternary structure, which would describe the assembly of multiple protein subunits, is not provided.

Splice variant isoforms of CHURC1 may exist, potentially leading to variations in the protein's structure and function. These isoforms can result from alternative splicing events, which may alter the protein's domain composition and its regulatory capabilities. Understanding these structural aspects is vital for elucidating the functional mechanisms of the CHURC1 protein.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHURC1 gene have been implicated in various neurobehavioral phenotypes, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study identified a de novo 1.5 Mb microdeletion on chromosome 14q23.2-23.3, which includes the CHURC1 gene, in a 14-year-old boy with autism and spherocytosis. This deletion suggests a potential role for CHURC1 in contributing to autism risk, as its homologs are known to regulate neuronal development in model organisms (Griswold2011A). The deletion of CHURC1, along with other neurodevelopmental genes, may have pleiotropic effects, influencing both neuropsychiatric conditions and hematological disorders like spherocytosis (Griswold2012Evaluation).

While the specific mechanisms by which CHURC1 mutations contribute to these conditions are not fully understood, the gene's involvement in transcriptional regulation and neuronal development suggests that its dysregulation could impact neurological function. The study of CHURC1 in the context of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders highlights its potential pathogenic effects and underscores the need for further research to elucidate its role in these diseases (Griswold2012Evaluation).
