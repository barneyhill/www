# MMGT1

## Overview
MMGT1 is a gene that encodes the protein membrane magnesium transporter 1, which is integral to the transport of magnesium ions (Mg2+) across cellular membranes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is essential for maintaining magnesium homeostasis within cells. Membrane magnesium transporter 1 is predominantly localized in the Golgi complex and post-Golgi vesicles, implicating its role in cellular magnesium metabolism and various cellular processes, including protein assembly and vesicle trafficking (Goytain2008Identification; Quamme2010Molecular). The gene is expressed across a wide range of tissues, suggesting its fundamental role in cellular magnesium balance (Quamme2010Molecular). The protein's structure includes two predicted transmembrane domains, which may facilitate the formation of functional oligomers necessary for its transporter activity (Goytain2008Identification).

## Function
MMGT1 is a membrane magnesium transporter involved in the transport of magnesium ions (Mg2+) across cellular membranes, playing a crucial role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis. This protein is primarily localized in the Golgi complex and post-Golgi vesicles, suggesting its involvement in cellular magnesium metabolism and possibly in other cellular processes such as protein assembly, lipid biosynthesis, and vesicle trafficking (Goytain2008Identification; Quamme2010Molecular). 

MMGT1 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, indicating a potential housekeeping role in maintaining Mg2+ balance across different cell types (Quamme2010Molecular). The protein has two predicted transmembrane domains, which implies that it may form functional oligomers, possibly as homo- or heterooligomers, necessary for its activity as a transporter (Goytain2008Identification; Quamme2010Molecular). 

In conditions of magnesium deficiency, the localization of MMGT1 changes, with increased presence in the Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles, highlighting its role in adapting to cellular magnesium needs (Goytain2008Identification). The transport of Mg2+ by MMGT1 is saturable, indicating a regulated transport mechanism (Kolisek2018Magnesium).
