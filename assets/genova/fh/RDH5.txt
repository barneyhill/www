# RDH5

## Overview
RDH5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme retinol dehydrogenase 5, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) superfamily. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the visual cycle by catalyzing the conversion of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal, a critical step in the regeneration of rhodopsin, the visual pigment necessary for vision under low-light conditions. Retinol dehydrogenase 5 is predominantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is integral to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it forms complexes with other proteins involved in retinol metabolism. Mutations in the RDH5 gene are linked to retinal dystrophies such as fundus albipunctatus and retinitis punctata albescens, which are characterized by night blindness and progressive vision loss. Beyond its role in vision, RDH5 has been implicated in various biological processes, including interactions with signaling pathways relevant to cancer progression (Sahu2016Retinol; SkorczykWerner2015Fundus; Unknownauthors2023BioinformaticsanalysisofthediagnosticsignificanceandfunctionsofRDH5inbreastcancer).

## Structure
The RDH5 protein is a 32-kDa membrane-associated enzyme consisting of 318 amino acids. It is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) superfamily, characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a Rossmann-fold, which is typical for this family and does not require metal for catalytic activity (Sahu2016Retinol; SkorczykWerner2015Fundus). The primary structure of RDH5 includes specific conserved motifs: Gly-Cys-Asp-Ser-Gly-Phe-Gly (residues 35-41) for cofactor binding and Tyr-Cys-Val-Ser-Lys (residues 175-179) with an invariant tyrosine residue in the active site, crucial for its enzymatic function (SkorczykWerner2015Fundus).

RDH5 is an integral membrane protein with distinct domains: an N-terminus within the membrane, an ectodomain with the active site in the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), a C-terminal membrane-spanning domain, and a C-terminal tail in the cytosol of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (SkorczykWerner2015Fundus). The protein can form dimers or tetramers and localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Sahu2016Retinol). The eight amino acids at the C-terminal tail are crucial for its activity, and mutations in this region are linked to Fundus albipunctatus (FA) (Sahu2016Retinol).

## Function
RDH5 (retinol dehydrogenase 5) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the visual cycle, particularly in the conversion of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal. This conversion is essential for the regeneration of rhodopsin, the visual pigment in photoreceptor cells, which is crucial for vision, especially under low-light conditions (Sahu2016Retinol; Lidén2003Structure). RDH5 is predominantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), where it functions as a membrane-associated protein, forming a complex with RPE65 and anchoring to RPE microsomes (Sahu2016Retinol). 

The enzyme exhibits a preference for NAD+ as a cofactor and shows the highest specificity towards 11-cis-retinal, followed by 13-cis-retinal and 9-cis-retinal (Sahu2016Retinol). RDH5 is also involved in the oxidation of 9-cis-retinol, although its role in 9-cis-retinoic acid synthesis is not considered essential (Lidén2003Structure). The activity of RDH5 is crucial for maintaining normal visual function, as mutations in the RDH5 gene can lead to fundus albipunctatus, a form of night blindness characterized by delayed regeneration of cone and rod photopigments (Parés2008Medium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RDH5 gene are associated with several retinal dystrophies, most notably fundus albipunctatus (FA) and retinitis punctata albescens (RPA). Fundus albipunctatus is characterized by night blindness and the presence of numerous small, white or pale-yellow dots scattered in the retina. This condition is typically non-progressive, but can sometimes show slow progression, particularly affecting cone function in older patients (SkorczykWerner2015Fundus; Wang2012Multimodal). The mutations in RDH5 disrupt the visual cycle by impairing the conversion of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal, leading to the accumulation of toxic retinyl esters in the retinal pigment epithelium (SkorczykWerner2015Fundus).

Retinitis punctata albescens, another condition linked to RDH5 mutations, is characterized by progressive vision loss, impaired color vision, and specific retinal changes such as macular atrophy and whitish-yellow dots (Khan2020A). The RDH5 mutations can lead to both stationary and progressive forms of these conditions, with variability in clinical presentation and severity (SkorczykWerner2015Fundus; Katagiri2020RDH5Related).

Genetic studies have identified various RDH5 mutations, including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations, which contribute to these retinal disorders (Wang2012Multimodal; Khan2020A). The phenotypic variability and overlap with other retinal conditions, such as those caused by RLBP1 mutations, highlight the importance of genetic analysis for accurate diagnosis (SkorczykWerner2015Fundus).

## Interactions
RDH5, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function. It interacts with proteins such as RDH10, RLBP1, and RPE65, which are part of the retinol metabolism and vitamin digestion pathways (Unknownauthors2023BioinformaticsanalysisofthediagnosticsignificanceandfunctionsofRDH5inbreastcancer). RDH5 is suggested to function as a homodimer and requires interaction with other proteins for proper intracellular localization and catalytic activity (Lidén2003Structure). 

In the context of breast cancer, RDH5 is associated with the SWI-SNF complex and several signaling pathways, including mTOR, WNT, MYC/MYCN, RTK, and p53/Rb, which are involved in cancer progression (Unknownauthors2023BioinformaticsanalysisofthediagnosticsignificanceandfunctionsofRDH5inbreastcancer). In hepatocellular carcinoma, RDH5 interacts with the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, where it suppresses cell migration by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Hu2020Retinal). 

These interactions highlight RDH5's role in various biological processes, including its involvement in the visual cycle and its potential impact on cancer progression through its interactions with key signaling pathways.
