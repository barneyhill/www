# HOXC13

## Overview
The HOXC13 gene is a member of the homeobox (HOX) gene family, which plays a pivotal role in regulating the development and differentiation of various tissues in the human body. It encodes the homeobox protein C13, a transcription factor characterized by a conserved homeodomain that facilitates DNA binding and gene regulation. This protein is primarily involved in the development of hair and nails, acting as a key regulator of keratin and keratin-associated protein genes. The HOXC13 gene is located within the HOXC gene cluster on chromosome 12, and its expression is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of ectodermal appendages. Mutations or dysregulation of HOXC13 can lead to developmental disorders such as pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia (PHNED) and are also implicated in various cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal development and disease (Fernandez-Guerrero2020Mammalian-specific; Luo2017HOXC13; Farooq2013A).

## Structure
The HOXC13 protein is composed of 330 amino acids and features a highly conserved homeodomain, which is a 61-amino acid region crucial for DNA binding and gene regulation (Wang2018The; JuárezRendón2023Variants). This homeodomain is located in the second exon of the gene and is responsible for the protein's nuclear localization and interaction with DNA replication origins (Comelli2009The). The homeodomain adopts a helix-turn-helix motif, a common structural feature in homeobox proteins, facilitating its binding to DNA (Comelli2009The).

The primary structure of HOXC13 includes a polyalanine tract encoded by exon 1, which consists of 15 alanines (JuárezRendón2023Variants). The protein lacks a Hexapeptide motif and a PY motif, which are typically found in other Abd-B class proteins (Sander2004Structure). The secondary structure of the homeodomain is characterized by alpha helices, which are essential for its DNA-binding function (Rezsohazy2015Cellular).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, although specific modifications for HOXC13 are not detailed in the provided context. The gene structure includes two exons and a single intron, with potential splice variants leading to different isoforms (JuárezRendón2023Variants).

## Function
The HOXC13 gene encodes a transcription factor that is crucial for the development and differentiation of hair and nails in humans. It is part of the HOXC gene cluster located near the type II keratin gene cluster on chromosome 12. In healthy human cells, HOXC13 acts as a key transcriptional regulator for several hair keratin and keratin-associated protein (KR-TAP) genes, such as KRT35 and KRTAP11-1, which are involved in hair and nail formation (Farooq2013A). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcription of target genes involved in cellular differentiation and morphogenesis.

HOXC13 is essential for the production of hard keratins and keratin-associated proteins, which are critical for the structural integrity of hair and nails. In mice, the absence of HOXC13 leads to brittle hair shafts and severe nail phenotypes, indicating its importance in maintaining the structural components of these ectodermal appendages (Fernandez-Guerrero2020Mammalian-specific). Mutations in HOXC13 can result in conditions like pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia (PHNED), characterized by abnormal hair and nail development due to the mislocalization of the protein and failure to activate its target genes (Farooq2013A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the HOXC13 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In cancer, HOXC13 is implicated in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), where it promotes proliferation by repressing CASP3, a gene involved in apoptosis (Luo2017HOXC13). HOXC13 is also overexpressed in other cancers, such as ameloblastoma, odontogenic tumors, and lung adenocarcinoma, correlating with poor outcomes (Botti2019Paralogous).

In congenital disorders, mutations in HOXC13 are linked to ectodermal dysplasia syndromes, characterized by hair and nail abnormalities. In mice, mutations result in brittle hair and alopecia, indicating its crucial role in hair development (Godwin1998Hoxc13). Deletions in the HOXC13 gene are associated with congenital lower limb malformations, such as clubfoot and vertical talus, due to its involvement in limb morphogenesis (Alvarado2016Deletions).

HOXC13 is also involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) when fused with NUP98, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Kasiri2013Antisense). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both developmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
HOXC13 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in DNA replication and cancer progression. It specifically binds to DNA fragments corresponding to the pre-replicative complex of the human lamin B2 replication origin, as well as other origins near the TOP1 and MCM4 genes in actively growing cells. This binding is facilitated by its homeodomain, which is crucial for its nuclear localization and interaction with replication foci during the early S phase of the cell cycle (Comelli2009The).

In cancer, HOXC13 interacts with ORC2, a component of the origin recognition complex, indicating its involvement in DNA replication processes (Kasiri2013Antisense). It is also part of a gene cluster with HOXC10 and HOXC12, which is distinctively regulated in prostate cancer, suggesting a unique role in DNA damage repair and tumor progression (Li2023Silencing).

HOXC13's interaction with keratin gene promoters is critical for hair follicle development. It regulates the expression of various keratins, such as KRT84 and KRT38, by binding to their promoters, although mutations in its homeodomain can impair this regulatory function (Wang2018The).
