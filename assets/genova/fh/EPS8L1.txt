# EPS8L1

## Overview
EPS8L1 (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Pathway Substrate 8 Like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating various cellular processes. The protein, EPS8 like 1, is categorized as a cytoskeletal regulatory protein and plays a pivotal role in actin filament dynamics, influencing cell shape, motility, and signaling pathways. It interacts with several proteins, including SOS1 and ABI1, to modulate signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization, thereby impacting cell growth, differentiation, and migration. EPS8L1 has been implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as ovarian cancer, where it influences tumor cell migration and metastasis through pathways like Rac1/MAPK. Its expression levels are associated with clinical outcomes, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Wang2024The; Yi2019The).

## Function
EPS8L1 (EPS8 like 1) encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component for maintaining cell shape, motility, and signaling. The protein encoded by EPS8L1 interacts with other cytoskeletal proteins to regulate the dynamics of actin filaments, which are essential for various cellular processes such as endocytosis and cell migration. These processes are vital for tissue development and repair, as they enable cells to move and adapt to their environment effectively. The activity of EPS8L1 in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function. By influencing actin filament dynamics, EPS8L1 contributes to the structural and functional plasticity of cells, facilitating their ability to respond to physiological cues and participate in complex biological processes.

## Clinical Significance
EPS8L1 is implicated in the progression and metastasis of ovarian cancer. Overexpression of EPS8L1 in ovarian cancer cells upregulates TIAM2, which promotes cytoskeleton remodeling through the Rac1/MAPK signaling pathway. This process enhances the migration and metastasis of cancer cells, contributing to the disease's progression (Wang2024The). Knockdown of EPS8L1 has been shown to inhibit cellular migration in vitro and reduce tumor colonization in vivo, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2024The).

EPS8L1 expression is significantly correlated with advanced FIGO stages and lymph node metastasis in ovarian cancer patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes (Wang2024The). In addition, EPS8L1 is involved in regulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, which are crucial for extracellular matrix degradation and tumor invasion (Wang2024The).

In contrast, in the context of depression in ovarian cancer patients, EPS8L1 is identified as a downregulated gene, with lower expression levels associated with worse overall survival and progression-free survival (Yi2019The).

## Interactions
EPS8L1, a member of the EPS8 family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and signal transduction. It interacts with SOS1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which is important for the activation of the RAS signaling pathway. This interaction suggests a role for EPS8L1 in modulating signal transduction pathways that influence cell growth and differentiation. EPS8L1 also associates with ABI1, a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, indicating its participation in cytoskeletal organization. The interaction with ABI1 highlights EPS8L1's involvement in cellular processes that require dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton, such as cell movement and shape changes. Additionally, EPS8L1 interacts with SH3 domain-containing proteins, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions in various signaling pathways. These interactions collectively underscore the role of EPS8L1 in cellular processes that depend on precise regulation of the cytoskeleton and signal transduction mechanisms.
