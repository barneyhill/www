# DNAH14

## Overview
DNAH14 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein axonemal heavy chain 14, a critical component of the axonemal dynein motor complex. This protein is categorized as a motor protein and is integral to the function and motility of cilia and flagella, which are essential for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and fluid movement across epithelial surfaces. The DNAH14 gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and motility of cilia by being part of the inner dynein arm within the axonemal structure. Variants in DNAH14 have been linked to several clinical conditions, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, underscoring its importance in normal ciliary function and organismal health (Wang2020Coding; Wang2020Rare; Sakamoto2024Loss).

## Function
DNAH14 (dynein axonemal heavy chain 14) is a gene that encodes a protein component of the dynein motor complex, which is crucial for the function and motility of cilia and flagella. This protein is primarily active in the axonemes of these structures, where it plays a significant role in microtubule-based transport. The axonemal dynein complex, including DNAH14, is essential for the movement of cilia, which are hair-like projections on the surface of cells that are involved in various physiological processes, such as respiratory function and the movement of fluids across epithelial surfaces (Wang2020Coding; Sakamoto2024Loss).

In healthy human cells, DNAH14 contributes to the structural integrity and function of motile cilia by being part of the inner dynein arm within the peripheral doublet microtubules. This structural role is critical for maintaining the proper motility of cilia, which is necessary for normal cellular processes and organismal outcomes, such as brain development and respiratory health (Sakamoto2024Loss). Variants in DNAH14 have been associated with conditions like adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, suggesting its importance in maintaining normal ciliary function and spine stability (Wang2020Rare).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH14 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. One notable condition associated with DNAH14 mutations is primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary motility, leading to chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormal organ positioning, and reduced fertility (Sakamoto2021Ependymal). DNAH14 mutations have also been linked to a unique form of hydrocephalus known as panventriculomegaly (PaVM), which is characterized by a wide foramen of Magendie and an enlarged cisterna magna. This condition is thought to arise from the disruption of ciliary function due to the deletion of DNAH14, which encodes axonemal dynein in motile cilia (Sakamoto2021Ependymal).

In the context of cancer, mutations in DNAH14 have been associated with chemotherapy response in gastric adenocarcinoma. Studies have shown that DNAH14 mutations are more frequent in patients who respond well to chemotherapy, particularly with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based therapies, suggesting a potential role for DNAH14 as a biomarker for chemotherapy sensitivity (Zhu2019Somatic). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of DNAH14 mutations across different medical conditions.
