# SREBF2

## Overview
SREBF2, or sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2, is a gene that encodes the protein SREBP-2, a key transcription factor involved in cholesterol homeostasis. SREBP-2 belongs to the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) family of proteins, which are characterized by their role in DNA binding and dimerization. This protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and becomes active through a series of proteolytic cleavages when cellular cholesterol levels are low. The active form of SREBP-2 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to sterol regulatory elements in the promoters of target genes, thereby regulating the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis. The activity of SREBP-2 is tightly regulated to maintain lipid balance and prevent pathological conditions associated with cholesterol accumulation (Kober2020Identification; Hua1993SREBP-2).

## Structure
SREBF2 encodes the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2), a transcription factor involved in cholesterol homeostasis. SREBP-2 is a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) protein, which is crucial for its role in DNA binding and dimerization (Hua1993SREBP-2). The protein consists of approximately 1141 amino acids and shares significant sequence identity with SREBP-1, particularly in the bHLH-Zip region, where it has a 71% identity (Hua1993SREBP-2). 

SREBP-2 is anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane through a hairpin structure formed by two long hydrophobic sequences separated by a short hydrophilic loop, with both the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions facing the cytosol (Hua1995Hairpin). The COOH-terminal domain of SREBP-2 is involved in its regulation and contains a degradation signal that is masked when bound to the cholesterol-sensing protein Scap (Kober2020Identification). 

Post-translational modifications of SREBP-2 include glycosylation, as indicated by the presence of N-linked sugars in the lumenal loop, which are in high mannose forms (Hua1995Hairpin). The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage to release the active transcription factor domain, which then translocates to the nucleus to activate lipogenic genes (Kober2020Identification).

## Function
SREBF2, or sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2, is a crucial transcription factor involved in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in human cells. It regulates the expression of genes responsible for cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis. SREBF2 is synthesized as an inactive precursor bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. When cellular cholesterol levels are low, SREBF2 is transported to the Golgi apparatus by the cholesterol-sensing protein Scap. In the Golgi, it undergoes proteolytic cleavage to release its active amino-terminal domain, which translocates to the nucleus (Kober2020Identification; Nagoshi2001Dimerization).

In the nucleus, SREBF2 binds to sterol regulatory elements in the promoters of target genes, enhancing their transcription. This process is essential for the synthesis of cholesterol and other lipids, ensuring cellular lipid balance and overall metabolic health (Gerin2010Expression; Fan2008Expression). SREBF2 also interacts with the SREBF cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) to facilitate its transport and activation, highlighting its role in cholesterol regulation (Fan2008Expression). The protein's activity is tightly regulated to prevent excessive cholesterol accumulation, which could lead to pathological conditions (Kober2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SREBF2 gene have been implicated in several metabolic disorders. A rare variant, c.-405A>G, located in the promoter region of SREBF2, has been associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) and increased glycemic levels. This mutation leads to elevated transcription of the SREBF2 gene, resulting in increased cholesterol synthesis and altered glucose metabolism. Carriers of this mutation exhibit higher fasting glucose levels and insulin levels, suggesting a potential link to insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus (GarcíaGarcía2022A).

SREBF2 polymorphisms have also been linked to osteoarthritis (OA). The 1784G.C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the SREBP-2 gene is associated with OA development, potentially through its role in lipid metabolism and interaction with signaling pathways such as TGF-b. This SNP is linked to increased expression of interleukin-1b and metalloproteinase-13, contributing to cartilage degradation in OA (Kostopoulou2012Central).

In the context of knee osteoarthritis (KOA), the G595C polymorphism in SREBP2 has been associated with an increased risk, particularly in individuals with higher body mass index (BMI). This variant is linked to metabolic conditions such as obesity and hypercholesterolemia (Poornima2019Role).

## Interactions
SREBF2, or sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. One of the primary interactions of SREBF2 is with the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (Scap). This interaction is essential for the regulation of cholesterol synthesis. The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of SREBF2 binds to the CTD of Scap in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This binding is necessary for the transport of SREBF2 to the Golgi apparatus, where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage to release its active N-terminal domain, which then translocates to the nucleus to activate lipogenic genes (Kober2020Identification).

The interaction between SREBF2 and Scap is mediated by specific residues in exon 18 of SREBF2, with arginine 1040 being particularly critical. Mutations at this residue, such as R1040E, disrupt the binding to Scap, affecting the stability and processing of SREBF2 (Kober2020Identification). This interaction also plays a role in masking the degradation signal on SREBF2, thereby stabilizing the protein when bound to Scap (Kober2020Identification).

SREBF2 also interacts with DNA by binding to sterol regulatory elements (SREs) to regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism (Kotzka2000Sterol).
