# KRTAP19-2

## Overview
KRTAP19-2 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 19-2, a member of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family. This protein is primarily involved in the structural organization and integrity of hair fibers, interacting with keratin intermediate filaments to enhance the mechanical strength and resilience of hair. Located on chromosome 21q22.1, KRTAP19-2 is characterized by a high content of glycine and tyrosine, which contributes to its unique structural properties and evolutionary clustering patterns (Rogers2006Human). The protein is predominantly expressed in the matrix cell region of the hair follicle, indicating its significant role in hair development and structure (Rogers2006Human).

## Structure
The KRTAP19-2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family, located on chromosome 21q22.1. These proteins are characterized by a high content of glycine (26.9-38.9 mol %) and tyrosine (15.4-23.6 mol %), along with moderate amounts of serine and phenylalanine residues (Rogers2006Human). The primary structure of KRTAP19-2 includes a significant number of dimeric and trimeric glycine and/or tyrosine-containing repeat structures, which contribute to its unique clustering pattern in evolutionary analyses (Rogers2006Human).

The secondary structure of KRTAP19-2 likely involves alpha-helices, a common feature in keratin-associated proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, typical of proteins in this family, which facilitate interactions with keratin proteins in the hair fiber. The quaternary structure involves these interactions, contributing to the formation and stability of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, although specific modifications for KRTAP19-2 are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's expression is notably high in the matrix cell region of the hair follicle, indicating its significant role in hair structure (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP19-2 encodes keratin-associated protein 19-2, which plays a significant role in the structural integrity of hair. This protein is involved in the formation and organization of hair fibers by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair (Rogers2006Human). KRTAP19-2 is primarily active in the proliferating matrix cell region of the hair follicle, where it is strongly expressed, suggesting a unique role in hair follicle development (Rogers2006Human). The protein is characterized by a high glycine-tyrosine content, which is typical of proteins involved in the structural organization of hair, potentially influencing characteristics like hair bending (Rogers2006Human).

The expression of KRTAP19-2 in the matrix cell region indicates its involvement in both cortical and cuticular expression, which is crucial for the proper formation and texture of hair (Rogers2006Human). Although the specific molecular activities of KRTAP19-2 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its expression pattern and interaction with keratin suggest a critical role in maintaining hair structure and quality (Rogers2006Human).
