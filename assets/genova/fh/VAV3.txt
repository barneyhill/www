# VAV3

## Overview
VAV3 is a gene that encodes the vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3, a member of the Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This protein is primarily involved in the activation of Rho/Rac GTPases, which are critical for various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. VAV3 contains several structural domains, such as the calponin homology (CH) domain, Dbl homology (DH) domain, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which contribute to its function and regulation (Zugaza2002Structural; Barreira2014The). The protein is activated through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and participates in complex signaling networks by interacting with receptor protein tyrosine kinases and other signaling molecules (Zeng2000Vav3; Barreira2014The). VAV3 is expressed in various human tissues and has been implicated in several cancers, where its altered expression is associated with disease progression and therapeutic resistance (Lin2012Vav3Rac1; Kwon2015VAV3).

## Structure
The VAV3 protein is a member of the Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and is involved in the activation of Rho/Rac GTPases. It contains several structural domains, including a calponin homology (CH) domain, an acidic (Ac) region, a Dbl homology (DH) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a zinc finger (ZF) region, and Src homology (SH2 and SH3) domains (Zugaza2002Structural; Barreira2014The). 

The CH domain plays a role in stabilizing the inactive conformation of VAV3 by interacting with the ZF region. Upon activation, typically through tyrosine phosphorylation, the CH domain is displaced, leading to conformational changes that expose the catalytic site (Llorca2005Global). The DH domain is crucial for the exchange activity, interacting with Rho/Rac proteins to facilitate GDP/GTP exchange (Zugaza2002Structural). 

The PH domain, although not fully understood, is thought to regulate catalytic activity through interactions with phosphatidylinositol biphosphate or triphosphate (Zugaza2002Structural). The SH2 and SH3 domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, contributing to the regulatory and scaffolding functions of VAV3 (Zugaza2002Structural). 

VAV3 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are essential for its activation and function (Barreira2014The). The protein also has multiple splice variants, which may differ in domain composition and function (Zugaza2002Structural).

## Function
VAV3 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that primarily activates Rho family GTPases, including RhoA, RhoG, and to a lesser extent, Rac-1. This activation facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression (Movilla1999Biological). VAV3 is involved in signaling pathways activated by protein tyrosine kinases, leading to cytoskeletal changes like actin relocalization and the formation of stress fibers, lamellipodia, and membrane ruffles (Movilla1999Biological).

In T cells, VAV3 plays a role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling by promoting serum response element-mediated gene transcription. It is recruited to the plasma membrane and immunological synapse upon T cell activation, a process dependent on its association with the adapter protein SLP-76 (Charvet2005Membrane). VAV3's membrane localization is crucial for its function in T cells, including its role in NFAT activation (Charvet2005Membrane).

VAV3 is broadly expressed in human tissues, with high levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen, and brain, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular signaling processes (Movilla1999Biological).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VAV3 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In prostate cancer, elevated VAV3 expression is associated with increased metastasis and progression, particularly through the EphA2-Vav3-Rac1 signaling axis. High VAV3 levels correlate with a higher risk of PSA recurrence post-radical prostatectomy, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Lin2012Vav3Rac1).

In ovarian cancer, VAV3 is overexpressed in cancer stem cells, contributing to poor prognosis and chemoresistance. Its overexpression is linked to distant metastasis and reduced overall survival, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Kwon2015VAV3).

In colorectal cancer, high VAV3 expression is associated with poor disease-free survival and is an independent prognostic marker. It is linked to the dysregulation of cell cycle and metastasis-related molecules via the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (Uen2015VAV3).

VAV3 also plays a role in endocrine therapy resistance in ERα-positive breast cancer. High nuclear VAV3 expression correlates with poorer response to therapy, and targeting VAV3-related pathways may help overcome this resistance (Aguilar2014VAV3).

## Interactions
VAV3, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling. It interacts with receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) such as EGFR, Ros, IR, and IGFR, leading to its tyrosine phosphorylation and association with downstream signaling molecules like Shc, Grb2, PLC-γ, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) (Zeng2000Vav3). VAV3 also interacts with the ERBB4 receptor, where it is phosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues, facilitating its guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity, which is essential for ERBB4-mediated cancer cell migration (Ojala2020The).

In addition to its interactions with RPTKs, VAV3 is involved in the activation of Rho family GTPases, including Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42, which are critical for cell transformation, motility, and morphological changes (Sachdev2002Distinct; Movilla1999Biological). VAV3's interaction with PI3K and MAPK pathways is significant for its role in cell transformation and motility, with PI3K playing a more prominent role (Sachdev2002Distinct). These interactions highlight VAV3's involvement in complex signaling networks that regulate various cellular processes.
