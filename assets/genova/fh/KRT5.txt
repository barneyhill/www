# KRT5

## Overview
Keratin 5 (KRT5) is a gene that encodes the type II intermediate filament protein keratin 5, which is integral to the structural framework of epithelial cells. This protein is predominantly expressed in the basal layer of stratified squamous epithelia, such as the epidermis, where it forms heterodimers with keratin 14 (KRT14) to provide mechanical stability and resilience to the skin and other epithelial tissues (Karantza2010Keratins; Arin2009The). The KRT5 gene plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and response to mechanical stress, through its involvement in pathways like PI3K/Akt and Notch 1 signaling (Ricciardelli2017Keratin). Mutations in KRT5 are linked to several dermatological conditions, such as Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex, highlighting its clinical significance in skin integrity and disease (WertheimTysarowska2015Novel; Uitto2007Diseases). Additionally, KRT5 expression levels have been implicated in cancer prognosis, particularly in melanoma, where its elevated expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and metastasis (Han2021Transcript).

## Structure
Keratin 5 (KRT5) is a type II intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in basal keratinocytes. Its molecular structure is characterized by a central α-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. The α-helical rod domain is organized in a heptad repeat pattern, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers, which are essential for the structural integrity of keratin intermediate filaments (Ho2022Update). 

The primary structure of KRT5 includes specific regions such as the head-1A and L2-2B subdomains, which are crucial for its self-organization and interaction with keratin 14 (KRT14) (Alvarado2014Directed). The secondary structure involves coiled-coil motifs that contribute to the protein's stability and function. 

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT5 forms dimers, which then associate with KRT14 to create heterodimers. These heterodimers are the building blocks for the quaternary structure, forming antiparallel tetramers that are critical for the assembly of higher-order intermediate filament networks (Ho2022Update). 

Common post-translational modifications of KRT5 include phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Ho2022Update). These structural features are vital for the mechanical resilience and integrity of the epidermis.

## Function
Keratin 5 (KRT5) is a type II intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It forms heterodimers with keratin 14 (K14), creating a robust cytoskeletal framework that provides mechanical stability to the epidermis and other stratified epithelial tissues (Karantza2010Keratins; Arin2009The). KRT5 is predominantly expressed in the basal cell layer of stratified squamous epithelia, such as the epidermis, where it is essential for the resilience and repair of the skin (Ricciardelli2017Keratin).

In healthy cells, KRT5 is involved in various cellular processes, including apico-basal polarization, cell size determination, and protein translation control (Karantza2010Keratins). It also plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation, modulating these processes through pathways such as PI3K/Akt and Notch 1 signaling (Ricciardelli2017Keratin). KRT5's interaction with desmosomes and hemidesmosomes enhances intercellular adhesion, contributing to the overall mechanical stability of epithelial tissues (Chen2021Damaged).

The protein's expression is regulated by neuroendocrine factors like prolactin, which can up-regulate KRT5 expression, influencing keratinocyte behavior and potentially affecting skin and hair follicle biology (Ramot2010Prolactin—a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT5 gene are associated with several skin disorders, most notably various forms of Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS). EBS is characterized by skin fragility and blistering, often triggered by minor trauma. Specific mutations in KRT5, such as those affecting the alpha-helical rod domains, lead to different EBS subtypes, including EBS Dowling-Meara (EBS-DM), EBS Köbner (EBS-K), and EBS Weber-Cockayne (EBS-WC), with EBS-DM being the most severe (WertheimTysarowska2015Novel; Uitto2007Diseases). A novel mutation, 1649delG, causes a unique EBS variant with migratory circinate erythema, characterized by blistering and pigmentation changes (Gu2003A).

KRT5 mutations are also linked to other conditions such as Dowling-Degos disease, which involves progressive hyperpigmentation, and EBS with mottled pigmentation, caused by a specific missense mutation affecting pigment distribution (Uitto2007Diseases).

Alterations in KRT5 expression levels have clinical significance in melanoma. Elevated KRT5 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to tumor stage and metastasis in melanoma patients (Han2021Transcript). These findings suggest that KRT5 could serve as a prognostic marker in melanoma (Han2021Transcript).

## Interactions
Keratin 5 (KRT5) is a type II intermediate filament protein that forms heterodimers with keratin 14 (KRT14) to create the structural framework of epithelial cells. KRT5 interacts with various proteins that are crucial for maintaining cell structure and integrity. It forms part of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton in basal keratinocytes, interacting with desmosomal and hemidesmosomal proteins, which are essential for the formation of a supracellular cytoskeleton and epidermal protection (Betz2006LossofFunction).

The interaction between KRT5 and KRT14 is significant, as mutations in KRT5 can disturb the docking of these two proteins, altering the interface residues and changing the energy of the protein complex (Chen2021Damaged). Despite these structural changes, the steady levels of K5 and K14 proteins remain unaffected, although the keratin network can be disturbed, leading to irregular clumping of filaments (Chen2021Damaged).

KRT5 is also associated with proteins like actin-related protein 3, annexin A2, and microtubule-actin cross-linking factor, which were found in KRT5 spots in basal airway epithelial cells (Olatona2024Candidate). These interactions highlight the role of KRT5 in linking the cytoskeleton to cell junctions and maintaining cellular integrity.
