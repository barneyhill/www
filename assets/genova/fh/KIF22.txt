# KIF22

## Overview
KIF22 is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 22, a motor protein that plays a pivotal role in chromosome segregation during cell division. As a member of the kinesin family, KIF22 is characterized by its motor domain, which facilitates ATP binding and interaction with microtubules, essential for its function in mitosis. The protein is involved in the orientation and movement of chromosomes on the mitotic spindle, contributing to chromosomal stability and genomic integrity. KIF22's activity is regulated through phosphorylation, which modulates its interaction with microtubules and other proteins, such as the Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR). This regulation is crucial for its role in cell proliferation and microtubule dynamics. Alterations in KIF22 expression or mutations in the gene have been associated with various cancers and genetic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in both oncogenesis and skeletal abnormalities (Ohsugi2003Cdc2mediated; Li2021KIF22; Pike2018KIF22).

## Structure
KIF22 is a kinesin-like motor protein involved in chromosome segregation during cell division. It contains a motor domain responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction, located in its N-terminal region (Pike2018KIF22). The coiled-coil domain (CCD) of KIF22 is crucial for its self-association, potentially forming dimers, and is implicated in regulating its interactions with other proteins, such as the Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) (Pike2018KIF22). The CCD may occlude the CAR binding site within the N-terminus, affecting KIF22's subcellular localization and function (Pike2018KIF22).

KIF22 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by CDK1, which enhances its chromosome binding ability (Li2021KIF22). This phosphorylation is crucial for its role in mitosis and microtubule dynamics (Pike2018KIF22). The protein's structure allows it to regulate microtubule stability and EGFR signaling, influencing CAR positioning at the plasma membrane (Pike2018KIF22). While specific details about the full amino acid sequence or three-dimensional conformation are not provided, the functional domains and modifications highlight KIF22's role in cellular processes.

## Function
KIF22, also known as Kid, is a kinesin-like motor protein that plays a critical role in chromosome movement and segregation during mitosis. In healthy human cells, KIF22 is involved in the orientation, oscillation, and congression of chromosomes on the metaphase plate of the mitotic spindle (Yajima2003The). It functions as a plus end-directed motor protein, moving towards the plus end of microtubules, which is essential for generating the polar ejection force that pushes chromosomes away from spindle poles (Yajima2003The).

KIF22 is phosphorylated at specific sites, such as Thr463, which regulates its interaction with microtubules and ensures proper chromosomal localization during prometaphase and metaphase (Ohsugi2003Cdc2mediated). This phosphorylation is crucial for reversible binding to microtubules, allowing for correct spindle formation and function (Ohsugi2003Cdc2mediated).

KIF22 also contains nuclear localization signals that direct it to the nucleus during interphase, and it localizes to condensed chromosomes during mitosis (BruzzoniGiovanelli2010Distinct). Its activity is vital for maintaining chromosomal stability and proper cell division, contributing to genomic integrity in healthy cells (Ohsugi2003Cdc2mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KIF22 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cancer, KIF22 is highly expressed in various types, including bladder, gastric, and colon cancers, where it promotes tumor progression and cell proliferation. In bladder cancer, KIF22 activates the transcription of CDCA3, a gene associated with cell cycle regulation, leading to increased cancer cell proliferation and poor prognosis (Li2021KIF22). In gastric cancer, KIF22 is up-regulated and associated with poor differentiation and survival, affecting the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway (Yu2020Effect). In colon cancer, KIF22 suppression reduces cell proliferation and tumor growth, highlighting its role in tumorigenesis (Li2020Suppression).

KIF22 mutations are also linked to spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity, leptodactylic type (lepto-SEMDJL), a rare skeletal disorder. Specific mutations, such as p.Pro148Leu and p.Arg149Gln, affect the motor domain of KIF22, leading to skeletal abnormalities and joint laxity (Boyden2011Recurrent; Min2011WholeExome). These mutations are often autosomal dominant and can be de novo, contributing to the clinical manifestations of lepto-SEMDJL (Tüysüz2014Spondyloepimetaphyseal).

## Interactions
KIF22, a member of the kinesin family, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell proliferation and microtubule dynamics. KIF22 interacts with the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, which is influenced by Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling. This interaction is essential for CAR's relocalization to cell junctions and subsequent cell division processes (Pike2018KIF22). KIF22 also forms a complex with CAR and localizes to the cytoplasm, playing a role in CAR-dependent, EGF-induced proliferation (Pike2018KIF22).

KIF22 is involved in the regulation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) dynamics, where it retains EGFR at the plasma membrane, crucial for the assembly of EGFR signaling complexes and the initiation of pathways that promote cell proliferation (Pike2018KIF22). In glioma cells, KIF22 interacts with GBP2, a GTPase, to regulate EGFR signaling, influencing cell proliferation and migration (Ren2022GBP2). Additionally, KIF22 is known to interact with the CDC25C/CDK1/cyclinB1 pathway in multiple myeloma, promoting cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (Zhai2024KIF22). These interactions highlight KIF22's role in coordinating receptor dynamics and cell proliferation in cancer cells.
