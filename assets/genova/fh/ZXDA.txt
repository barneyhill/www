# ZXDA

## Overview
The ZXDA gene encodes the zinc finger X-linked duplicated A protein, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the activation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) genes, which are crucial for immune response (AlKandari2007The). The ZXDA protein functions by forming complexes with other proteins, such as ZXDC and the class II trans-activator (CIITA), to facilitate the transcription of MHC II genes (AlKandari2007The). Additionally, ZXDA is involved in maintaining centromere integrity through interactions with centromeric proteins and is regulated by post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination mediated by FBXO38 (Dibus2022FBXO38a).

## Structure
The ZXDA protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function and interactions. It contains ten C2H2-type zinc fingers, which are essential for mediating interactions with other proteins, including the formation of complexes with ZXDC and CIITA, a key regulator of MHC II gene transcription (AlKandari2007The). The zinc finger region, particularly residues 267-573, is vital for ZXDA's interaction with ZXDC, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (AlKandari2007The).

ZXDA also includes a transcriptional activation domain located between amino acid residues 572-699, which plays a role in enhancing the activation of the HLA-DRA promoter when co-expressed with CIITA (AlKandari2007The). The protein's structure allows it to form dimers or potentially higher-order complexes, as ZXDA can bind to itself and ZXDC (AlKandari2007The).

Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination mediated by FBXO38, regulate the stability of ZXDA. This interaction is facilitated by a zinc finger linker motif, specifically involving amino acid residues 386-408 (Dibus2022FBXO38a). The protein's interaction with FBXO38 and CENP-B is mutually exclusive, suggesting a regulatory mechanism involving overlapping binding sites (Dibus2022FBXO38a).

## Function
The ZXDA gene encodes a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) genes, which are essential for the immune response in human cells. ZXDA forms a complex with another zinc finger protein, ZXDC, and this complex interacts with the class II trans-activator (CIITA) to activate the transcription of MHC II genes. This interaction is vital for the full activation of the HLA-DRA promoter, a component of the MHC II gene complex (AlKandari2007The).

ZXDA contains a transcriptional activation domain and zinc finger regions that are crucial for its function. These regions facilitate its binding to ZXDC and CIITA, forming a tripartite complex necessary for MHC II transcription (AlKandari2007The). The presence of ZXDA at the HLA-DRA promoter, even in the absence of CIITA, suggests that ZXDA can independently regulate gene transcription in cooperation with ZXDC (AlKandari2007The).

In addition to its role in transcription, ZXDA is involved in maintaining centromere integrity. It interacts with centromeric proteins, such as CENP-B, and is regulated by the FBXO38 ubiquitin ligase, which controls its stability through ubiquitination (Dibus2022FBXO38a).

## Interactions
ZXDA is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation. It forms a complex with ZXDC, another member of the zinc finger X-linked duplicated family, which is essential for binding to the class II trans-activator (CIITA) protein. This tripartite complex is necessary for the transcriptional activation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) genes (AlKandari2007The). The zinc finger regions of ZXDA are critical for its interaction with both ZXDC and CIITA, highlighting the importance of these motifs in mediating protein interactions (AlKandari2007The).

ZXDA also interacts with centromere protein B (CENP-B), casein kinase 2 (CK2), and protein phosphatase 2/6. The interaction with CENP-B is mediated by the fifth and sixth zinc fingers of ZXDA and is enhanced by neddylation inhibition, which increases ZXDA protein levels (Dibus2022FBXO38a). However, ZXDA is not a constitutive centromeric protein, as it does not show enrichment in centromeric spots in cancer cell lines (Dibus2022FBXO38a).

FBXO38, a ubiquitin ligase, interacts with ZXDA, targeting it for degradation. This interaction is mediated by a zinc finger linker motif in ZXDA and is crucial for maintaining centromeric chromatin integrity (Dibus2022FBXO38a).
