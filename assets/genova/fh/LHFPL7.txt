# LHFPL7

## Overview
LHFPL7 is a gene that encodes the protein LHFPL tetraspan subfamily member 7, which is part of the tetraspanin family. This family of proteins is characterized by their four transmembrane domains, which play a crucial role in cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and intracellular trafficking. The LHFPL7 protein is involved in various biological functions and pathways, contributing to its significance in cellular communication and structural integrity. Research into LHFPL7 has highlighted its potential implications in certain clinical conditions, although the precise mechanisms and interactions remain an active area of investigation.
