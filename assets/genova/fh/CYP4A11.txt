# CYP4A11

## Overview
CYP4A11 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily A member 11, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This enzyme is categorized as a monooxygenase and is primarily involved in the ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism. It is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidneys, where it contributes to the metabolism of lauric acid and arachidonic acid, among other substrates. The enzyme's activity is crucial for the production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a metabolite with important physiological functions, including the regulation of blood pressure and renal function. Variations in the CYP4A11 gene have been associated with conditions such as hypertension and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Powell1996Identification; Bellamine2003Characterization; Kim2014Kinetic).

## Function
The human gene CYP4A11 encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 4A11, which is primarily involved in the ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids such as lauric acid and arachidonic acid. This enzyme is active in the liver and kidneys, where it plays a crucial role in the metabolism of these fatty acids (Powell1996Identification; Kim2014Kinetic). In the liver, CYP4A11 is the major lauric acid ω-hydroxylase, catalyzing the conversion of lauric acid to 12-hydroxylaurate, a process important for fatty acid metabolism (Powell1996Identification).

In the kidneys, CYP4A11 is involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a metabolite that has significant signaling properties. 20-HETE acts as a potent renal vasoconstrictor and an inhibitor of vascular calcium-activated potassium channels, playing a significant role in the regulation of blood pressure and kidney function (Bellamine2003Characterization; Gainer2005Functional). The enzyme's activity is influenced by electron transfer processes, particularly involving cytochrome b5, and is associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism that affects its function, with implications for conditions such as salt-sensitive hypertension (Kim2014Kinetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CYP4A11 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily involving hypertension and cancer. The T8590C polymorphism in CYP4A11, which results in a phenylalanine-to-serine substitution, is associated with essential hypertension. This variant leads to a loss of enzyme function, reducing the production of 20-HETE, a metabolite involved in blood pressure regulation. Studies have shown that individuals with the CC genotype of this polymorphism have higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, indicating a significant association with hypertension, particularly under a recessive model (Gainer2005Functional; Mayer2005Association).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low expression of CYP4A11 correlates with poor prognostic factors, such as higher histologic grade and advanced TNM stage, while high expression is linked to better outcomes. This suggests that CYP4A11 could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in HCC (Eun2018Cytochrome). Additionally, CYP4A11 expression is higher in other cancers, such as thyroid and breast cancer, where it is associated with increased production of 20-HETE, which has proto-oncogenic properties (Eun2018Cytochrome). These findings highlight the gene's role in both cardiovascular and oncological diseases.

## Interactions
CYP4A11 interacts with several proteins essential for its enzymatic activity. It requires cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome b5 for optimal function, indicating a physical interaction with these proteins. These interactions are crucial for the enzyme's catalytic cycle, as they facilitate the reduction of the heme iron, which is necessary for substrate binding and catalysis (Dierks1998The; Powell1996Identification). The enzyme's activity is significantly enhanced when reconstituted with P450 reductase and cytochrome b5, demonstrating the importance of these interactions in its function (Powell1996Identification).

CYP4A11 also undergoes conformational changes dependent on the presence of cytochrome P450 reductase and NADPH, suggesting dynamic interactions during its catalytic cycle (Dierks1998The). These interactions are not only essential for the enzyme's activity but also influence its regioselectivity and substrate access to the heme site, as seen in studies involving the L131F mutant of CYP4A11 (Dierks1998The).

While the context does not provide specific details on interactions with nucleic acids, it highlights the enzyme's role in fatty acid metabolism and its potential interactions with other proteins involved in the P450 system (Powell1996Identification).
