# IGF2BP1

## Overview
IGF2BP1, or insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a highly conserved RNA-binding protein involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. The protein is characterized by its six RNA-binding domains, including two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and four K homology (KH) domains, which facilitate its interaction with single-stranded RNAs. IGF2BP1 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes such as mRNA stability, localization, and translation, impacting cell proliferation, differentiation, and motility. It is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, where its dysregulation is associated with poor clinical outcomes in several malignancies, including breast and colorectal cancers. The protein's ability to form ribonucleoprotein condensates and its regulation through post-translational modifications like phosphorylation underscore its dynamic role in cellular signaling and stress responses (Ma2024Insulinlike; Hornegger2023“IGF2BP1; Mahaira2014IGF2BP1).

## Structure
The IGF2BP1 protein is characterized by a canonical structure that includes six RNA-binding domains: two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and four hnRNP K homology (KH) domains. These domains are organized into two pseudo-dimers, KH1-2 and KH3-4, connected by intrinsically disordered regions (Korn2021Structures; Hornegger2023“IGF2BP1). The KH domains are primarily responsible for RNA recognition, interacting with single-stranded RNAs through short recognition motifs, while the RRMs provide less specificity and recognize dinucleotide sequences (Hornegger2023“IGF2BP1). The KH domains are highly conserved and are crucial for the protein's ability to bind RNA, with the KH3-4 di-domain playing a significant role in RNA association (Korn2021Structures; Wächter2013Subcellular).

IGF2BP1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at specific sites like S181 and Y396, which modulate its assembly into ribonucleoprotein condensates and affect its interactions (Hornegger2023“IGF2BP1). The protein exists in two isoforms: IGF2BP1-a, the longer transcript, and IGF2BP1-b, which lacks two alternate in-frame exons compared to IGF2BP1-a (Ma2024Insulinlike). These structural features enable IGF2BP1 to play a crucial role in RNA stability, localization, and translation.

## Function
IGF2BP1, or insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1, is a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. It plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and motility. IGF2BP1 is known to bind to mRNAs, such as c-MYC, GLI1, and β-actin, influencing their stability, localization, and translation, which are essential for cell cycle regulation and stem cell maintenance (Mahaira2014IGF2BP1).

In mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), IGF2BP1 expression is higher in umbilical cord-derived MSCs compared to those from adult tissues, correlating with a greater proliferative capacity. This suggests that IGF2BP1 is involved in maintaining the stem cell characteristics and proliferative potential of MSCs (Mahaira2014IGF2BP1). The protein's expression is regulated by TET1 and TET2 demethylases, which modulate its activity through epigenetic mechanisms (Mahaira2014IGF2BP1).

IGF2BP1 is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with stress granules and ribonucleoprotein complexes, where it facilitates the local translation of mRNAs in response to cellular signals. This activity is crucial for processes like axon outgrowth and cell migration, highlighting its importance in both cellular and organismal development (Gaynes2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IGF2BP1 gene are associated with various cancers and hematological diseases. Overexpression of IGF2BP1 is linked to poor clinical outcomes in cancers such as breast, colorectal, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gallbladder cancer (Ma2024Insulinlike). In breast cancer, high IGF2BP1 expression correlates with poor overall survival and is associated with advanced stages and specific subtypes like PR-negative, ER-negative, and HER2-positive tumors (Hao2023A). In colorectal cancer, IGF2BP1 interacts with Wnt/β-catenin signaling, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Singh2023Global).

In hematological malignancies, IGF2BP1 is overexpressed in advanced leukemia, where it inhibits the differentiation of cancer stem cells and maintains leukemia stem cell properties. Silencing IGF2BP1 can induce cell cycle arrest and reduce proliferation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (Ma2024Insulinlike). IGF2BP1 also plays a role in sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia by regulating fetal hemoglobin expression, offering potential therapeutic applications (Ma2024Insulinlike).

IGF2BP1's involvement in cancer is further supported by its role in stabilizing and translating cancer-related mRNA targets, impacting tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and growth (Huang2018Insulin-like).

## Interactions
IGF2BP1 (insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1) is a conserved RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in regulating RNA stability, localization, and translation. It interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates essential for regulating RNA outputs. IGF2BP1 contains six RNA-binding domains, including four K homology (KH) domains and two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are responsible for RNA recognition and interaction with single-stranded RNAs through specific motifs (Hornegger2023“IGF2BP1).

The KH3-4 domains of IGF2BP1 are particularly crucial for RNA binding and condensate formation, with a high affinity for RNA. Mutations in these domains can significantly reduce RNA binding and prevent condensate formation (Hornegger2023“IGF2BP1). IGF2BP1 also interacts with mRNAs such as those encoding for MYC and ACTB, and it binds preferentially to the 3' UTRs of target mRNAs, which is a common feature among IGF2BP paralogues (Müller2018IGF2BP1).

IGF2BP1's interactions are modulated by phosphorylation, particularly at the S181 and Y396 sites, which affects its assembly into RNP granules. Phosphorylation at these sites can alter the size and dynamics of IGF2BP1-containing condensates by impacting low-affinity protein-RNA interactions (Hornegger2023“IGF2BP1).
