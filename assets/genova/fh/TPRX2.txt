# TPRX2

## Overview
TPRX2, or tetrapeptide repeat homeobox 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in early human embryonic development. The protein encoded by TPRX2 is a member of the homeobox family, specifically the ETCHbox family, which is characterized by its role in transcriptional regulation during critical stages of embryogenesis (Dunwell2016Diversity; Maeso2016Evolutionary). TPRX2 is expressed exclusively in early embryos, where it functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, influencing the transition from pluripotency to differentiation by downregulating key genes such as SOX2 (Madissoon2016Characterization). The gene's expression is tightly regulated and epigenetically silenced in later developmental stages, highlighting its specific role in early developmental processes (Madissoon2016Characterization).

## Function
TPRX2 (tetrapeptide repeat homeobox 2) is a transcription factor involved in early human embryonic development. It is expressed exclusively in early embryos and plays a significant role in transcriptional dynamics during embryonic genome activation (EGA) and preimplantation development (Madissoon2016Characterization). TPRX2 functions primarily as a repressor, downregulating several target genes, including SOX2, which is crucial for maintaining pluripotency (Madissoon2016Characterization). This suggests that TPRX2 may influence the transition from pluripotency to differentiation in early embryonic cells.

The gene is part of the ETCHbox family, which includes other homeobox genes derived from the CRX gene through tandem duplication and divergence. These genes are expressed during the totipotent stages of development, particularly from the 8-cell to the morula stage, and are tightly regulated (Dunwell2016Diversity; Maeso2016Evolutionary). TPRX2 is involved in regulating genes associated with human gamete generation and germ cell-related processes, indicating its role in preparing cells for subsequent specialization (Madissoon2016Characterization). The expression of TPRX2 is epigenetically silenced in later developmental stages, as indicated by methylation patterns (Madissoon2016Characterization).
