# CLDN24

## Overview
The CLDN24 gene encodes claudin 24, a transmembrane protein that is part of the claudin family, which plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. These tight junctions are essential for preserving cell polarity and regulating paracellular permeability, thereby controlling the movement of ions and molecules between cells (LalNag2009The). Claudin 24 is integral to the structural integrity and functional capacity of cellular barriers, contributing to tissue homeostasis and various signaling pathways. The protein's interaction with other claudin family members is necessary for the proper formation of tight junctions, as evidenced by its co-localization with ZO-1 in cell contacts (Baumholtz2020Functional). Alterations in CLDN24 expression or mutations in the gene have been linked to certain diseases, including neural tube defects and breast cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Yang2021Comprehensive; Baumholtz2020Functional).

## Function
Claudin 24 (CLDN24) is a member of the claudin family, which are integral membrane proteins essential for the formation of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. These tight junctions are crucial for maintaining cell polarity and regulating paracellular permeability, which involves controlling the passage of ions and molecules between cells (LalNag2009The). In healthy human cells, CLDN24 contributes to the integrity and function of cellular barriers, playing a significant role in tissue homeostasis and signaling pathways.

The protein is involved in forming tight junction strands, which are vital for cell-cell contact and maintaining cell polarity. Studies have shown that CLDN24 requires the presence of other claudin family members to function properly in forming tight junctions. For instance, in MDCK II cells, which naturally express many claudin family members, both wild-type and variant CLDN24 proteins can co-localize with ZO-1 at cell contacts, indicating its role in tight junction formation (Baumholtz2020Functional). This function is essential for maintaining the integrity and function of epithelial and endothelial barriers, which are critical for the proper physiological functioning of tissues and organs.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CLDN24 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of neural tube defects (NTDs), rare and novel missense variants of CLDN24, such as p.G94R and p.E161K, have been identified in patients. These variants are predicted to be pathogenic and may contribute to NTDs by affecting protein-protein interactions at tight junctions, although they do not significantly impact the protein's localization to tight junctions (Baumholtz2020Functional). The p.E161K variant, in particular, involves a substitution that changes the charge of the residue, potentially affecting protein function (Baumholtz2020Functional).

In breast cancer, CLDN24 mRNA expression is downregulated in patients positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors compared to normal samples, suggesting a potential role in the disease's progression (Yang2021Comprehensive). However, there is no specific information on diseases or conditions directly associated with mutations or expression level changes of CLDN24 beyond its expression in breast cancer (Yang2021Comprehensive). In colorectal cancer, CLDN24 has not been reported to be expressed in human tissues, and its role remains unclear (Cox2024The).
