# COQ5

## Overview
The COQ5 gene encodes the enzyme coenzyme Q5, methyltransferase, which is a crucial component in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone. This enzyme is categorized as a methyltransferase and is involved in the C2-methylation step of the CoQ biosynthesis pathway, a vital process for mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (GonzálezMariscal2014The; HernándezCamacho2021Coenzyme). The COQ5 protein is localized to the mitochondrial matrix and is part of a multi-enzyme complex known as the CoQ-synthome, which is essential for the proper synthesis and function of CoQ10 (Nguyen2014Molecular). Structurally, COQ5 features a Rossmann-like fold typical of class I SAM-dependent methyltransferases, and it functions as a dimer, which is critical for its enzymatic activity (Dai2014Crystal). Mutations in the COQ5 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including retinitis pigmentosa and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining mitochondrial health and function (Jurkute2022Biallelic).

## Structure
The COQ5 protein is a C-methyltransferase involved in coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis. It is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 12q24.31 and consists of 327 amino acids, including a mitochondrial targeting sequence (Nguyen2014Molecular). The protein shares 45% identity and 60% similarity with its yeast counterpart, excluding the targeting region (Nguyen2014Molecular).

COQ5 is localized to the mitochondrial matrix and is peripherally associated with the inner membrane (Nguyen2014Molecular). The protein is part of a multi-enzyme complex known as the CoQ-synthome, which is essential for coenzyme Q biosynthesis (Nguyen2014Molecular). The COQ5 protein has a Rossmann-like fold, typical of class I SAM-dependent methyltransferases, which includes a mixed α/β core domain (Dai2014Crystal). This core domain consists of six parallel β-strands surrounded by five α-helices, with an additional antiparallel β-strand (Dai2014Crystal).

The protein forms a dimer, with each subunit contributing to the dimeric interface through hydrophobic interactions involving 32 residues (Dai2014Crystal). The dimerization is crucial for its enzymatic activity, as indicated by structural studies showing slight conformational changes upon S-adenosylmethionine binding (Dai2014Crystal). The COQ5 protein also contains a glycine-rich motif, DVAGGSG, which is a minor variation typical of SAM-MTases (Dai2014Crystal).

## Function
The COQ5 gene encodes a methyltransferase enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q (CoQ), also known as ubiquinone, within the mitochondria. This enzyme is responsible for the C2-methylation step in the CoQ biosynthesis pathway, converting demethoxy-demethyl-coenzyme Q (DDMQ) to demethoxy-coenzyme Q (DMQ) (GonzálezMariscal2014The; HernándezCamacho2021Coenzyme). COQ5 is part of a larger complex of proteins known as the CoQ synthome, which is essential for the proper synthesis of CoQ (HernándezCamacho2021Coenzyme).

CoQ is crucial for electron transport in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), playing a significant role in cellular energy production through ATP synthesis. It also participates in various metabolic pathways, including iron-sulfur cluster synthesis, nucleotide synthesis, and sulfide metabolism (HernándezCamacho2021Coenzyme). The activity of COQ5 and its associated complex is primarily located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to maintaining cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function (LópezLluch2021Coenzyme).

In addition to its catalytic role, COQ5 is involved in the stabilization and function of the CoQ biosynthetic complex, contributing to the formation of a 700-kDa pre-complex that accumulates DMQ6, a precursor in CoQ biosynthesis (GonzálezMariscal2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COQ5 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which is crucial for mitochondrial function. Biallelic variants in COQ5 have been linked to retinitis pigmentosa, a form of inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by progressive vision loss. This association was identified in individuals from two unrelated families, where specific COQ5 variants were found to contribute to the disease phenotype through mis-splicing and altered transcript processing (Jurkute2022Biallelic).

Additionally, a homozygous partial tandem duplication of the 3' end of the COQ5 gene has been reported in three siblings, leading to cerebellar ataxia, encephalopathy, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and cognitive disability (Jurkute2022Biallelic). These findings underscore the gene's importance in neurological function and its potential involvement in broader mitochondrial disorders.

Disruption of the COQ5-containing protein complex has also been associated with diminished CoQ10 levels under conditions of mitochondrial energy deficiency, suggesting that COQ5 plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production. This disruption can lead to secondary CoQ10 deficiency, which is linked to various mitochondrial diseases (Yen2016Disruption).

## Interactions
The human COQ5 protein is involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 and participates in various interactions with other proteins within the mitochondria. COQ5 is part of a multi-enzyme complex associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it interacts with other COQ proteins such as COQ4, COQ6, COQ7, and COQ9 (Yen2020Characterization; Nguyen2014Molecular). Immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated a physical association between COQ5 and COQ4, suggesting a direct interaction within this complex (Nguyen2014Molecular).

In yeast, COQ5 is part of the CoQ-synthome, a high-molecular-weight complex essential for coenzyme Q biosynthesis, and similar interactions are hypothesized in human cells (Nguyen2014Molecular). The COQ5 protein complex in human cells is sensitive to mitochondrial energy status, as treatments affecting mitochondrial membrane potential can destabilize the complex (Yen2016Disruption). Despite these findings, the exact nature of COQ5's interactions, whether direct or indirect, remains to be fully elucidated, and further research is needed to clarify these interactions (Yen2016Disruption; Yen2020Characterization).
