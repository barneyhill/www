# SETD2

## Overview
SETD2 is a gene that encodes the protein SET domain containing 2, a histone lysine methyltransferase. This enzyme is primarily involved in the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a critical modification for maintaining chromatin integrity and facilitating DNA repair processes. The SETD2 protein is characterized by its catalytic SET domain, which is essential for its methyltransferase activity, and several other domains that mediate interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. These interactions are crucial for its roles in transcription regulation, RNA splicing, and DNA damage response. SETD2's function in maintaining genomic stability underscores its importance in preventing tumorigenesis, and mutations in the SETD2 gene have been implicated in several cancers and genetic disorders (Carvalho2014SETD2; McDaniel2017Shaping; Parra2023Clinical).

## Structure
The SETD2 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function as a histone lysine methyltransferase. The catalytic domain of SETD2 includes an N-terminal AWS zinc finger motif, a central SET domain, and a C-terminal Post-SET motif. The SET domain is notable for its three discrete β sheets arranged in a triangular shape, which undergo significant conformational changes upon binding to histone H3 peptides (Yang2016Molecular). 

The SETD2 protein can adopt two conformations: an auto-inhibitory closed conformation and a substrate-accessible open conformation. The presence of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) induces a compact configuration with an auto-inhibitory post-SET loop, while the presence of inhibitors like Pr-SNF 3c allows the post-SET loop to reconfigure, facilitating substrate access (Zheng2012Sinefungin).

SETD2 also contains intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), particularly in its N-terminal region, which influence the protein's half-life by making it more susceptible to proteolysis (Bhattacharya2021The). The SHI domain within these disordered regions mediates interactions with hnRNP L, involving a conserved leucine pair that inserts into hydrophobic pockets of hnRNP L (Bhattacharya2021Structural). 

These structural features and domain interactions are crucial for SETD2's role in histone modification and its regulation of gene expression.

## Function
The SETD2 gene encodes a histone methyltransferase responsible for the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a modification crucial for maintaining chromatin integrity and facilitating DNA repair processes. In healthy human cells, SETD2 is essential for the activation of the ATM kinase, a key player in the DNA damage response (DDR) to double-strand breaks (DSBs). It promotes homologous recombination repair by aiding the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments, which are necessary for error-free DNA repair using homologous sequences as templates (Carvalho2014SETD2).

SETD2 also plays a significant role in the regulation of the p53-mediated checkpoint, which is crucial for cell cycle control and preventing the propagation of damaged DNA. It facilitates the phosphorylation and stabilization of the p53 protein, leading to the activation of downstream targets involved in cell cycle arrest (Carvalho2014SETD2). The gene is involved in RNA splicing, influencing exon choice by recruiting splicing factors through interactions with chromatin-associated proteins (McDaniel2017Shaping).

SETD2 is active in the nucleus, where it maintains chromatin structure and function, ensuring genomic stability and proper gene expression. Its role in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation underscores its importance in preventing genomic instability and tumorigenesis (McDaniel2017Shaping; Hacker2016Structure/Function).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SETD2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions and cancers. SETD2 mutations are linked to three main disorders: Luscan-Lumish syndrome (LLS), Rabin-Pappas syndrome (RAPAS), and intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 70 (MRD70). LLS is characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, tall stature, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder. RAPAS is associated with microcephaly, intellectual disability, and congenital abnormalities, often linked to the missense variant p.Arg1740Trp. MRD70 involves mild developmental delay and intellectual disability, with the missense variant p.Arg1740Gln (Parra2023Clinical).

In cancer, SETD2 mutations are implicated in renal cell carcinoma, leukemia, and other malignancies. In renal cancer, SETD2 loss leads to impaired DNA repair and increased genomic instability, contributing to tumor progression (Kanu2015SETD2). In leukemia, SETD2 mutations are associated with aggressive disease and chemotherapy resistance, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor (Skucha2019Roles; Zhu2014Identification). SETD2 loss also affects DNA methylation, influencing the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, which can exacerbate cancer aggressiveness (Javaid2023A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SETD2 in various diseases and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
SETD2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcription and splicing. It engages with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) through its Set2-Rpb1 interacting (SRI) domain, which is essential for its histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation activity. This interaction is facilitated by the positive charge of the SRI domain binding to the negatively charged phosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNAPII (Molenaar2022SETD2:).

SETD2 also interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), particularly hnRNP L and its paralog hnRNP LL, through a novel domain termed the SETD2-hnRNP L Interaction (SHI) domain. This interaction is crucial for regulating alternative splicing events targeted by hnRNP L. The SHI domain mediates the interaction with the RRM2 domain of hnRNP L, and deletion of this domain significantly reduces the binding of SETD2 to hnRNP L and other RNA processing proteins (Bhattacharya2021Structural; Bhattacharya2020Thea).

SETD2 also interacts with non-histone proteins, such as α-tubulin, where it methylates lysine 40 during mitosis and cytokinesis, promoting proper chromosome segregation. This interaction is regulated by the SRI domain of SETD2 (Molenaar2022SETD2:). Additionally, SETD2 interacts with actin, influencing cell migration through its methylation activity (Seervai2020The).
