# JADE2

## Overview
JADE2 is a gene that encodes the protein jade family PHD finger 2, which is a member of the jade family of proteins characterized by the presence of plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger motifs. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of histone modifications and chromatin dynamics. JADE2 specifically targets the histone H3K4 demethylase LSD1 for degradation, a process that is essential for neural differentiation and development. By facilitating the degradation of LSD1, JADE2 influences the epigenetic landscape, promoting the transition of embryonic stem cells towards neural lineages and supporting neurogenesis (Han2014Destabilizing). The protein is predominantly localized in the cell nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin-associated proteins and is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, often as part of the HBO1/HAT complex (Han2014Destabilizing; Ebert2021JADE).

## Function
JADE2, a member of the jade family PHD finger proteins, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets LSD1, a histone H3K4 demethylase, for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process is crucial for neural differentiation, as it promotes the transition of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) towards the neural lineage by relieving the inhibitory effect of LSD1 on neural commitment (Han2014Destabilizing). The degradation of LSD1 by JADE2 facilitates neurogenesis by allowing the epigenetic landscape to adapt quickly without extensive transcriptional changes (Han2014Destabilizing).

JADE2's role in neurogenesis is supported by its ability to regulate several LSD1 target genes associated with neural development, such as Pax3, Ascl1, Zic1, and Neurog1. Changes in the recruitment of LSD1 and histone modifications on these gene promoters during neural differentiation are influenced by JADE2 levels (Han2014Destabilizing). In vivo experiments in mouse cortices and zebrafish embryos have demonstrated the importance of the JADE2-LSD1 pathway in nervous system development (Han2014Destabilizing). JADE2's activity is primarily localized to the cell nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin-associated proteins to influence gene expression and cell fate determination during early embryogenesis (Han2014Destabilizing).

## Interactions
JADE2 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, specifically targeting the histone H3K4 demethylase LSD1 for degradation. This interaction is crucial for neural differentiation, as JADE2 promotes the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of LSD1, facilitating neurogenesis by relieving the inhibitory effects of LSD1 on neural commitment (Han2014Destabilizing).

JADE2 interacts with LSD1 through its first PHD domain, which is essential for its E3 ligase activity. The interaction is mediated by the AOD/Tower domains of LSD1 and the C terminus of JADE2. This specificity is highlighted by the fact that JADE2 does not associate with REST or CoREST, indicating a targeted interaction with LSD1 (Han2014Destabilizing).

JADE2 is also part of the HBO1/HAT complex, suggesting its involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It shares structural similarities with other JADE family proteins, such as JADE1 and JADE3, which include PHD zinc finger domains. These proteins can form homodimers, homomultimers, and hetero-multimeric complexes, indicating a potential for diverse interactions within cellular pathways (Ebert2021JADE).
