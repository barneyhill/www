# SNRPD3

## Overview
The SNRPD3 gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein D3 polypeptide, a critical component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) involved in pre-mRNA splicing. The protein, commonly referred to as SmD3, is part of a heteroheptameric ring structure that associates with small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) such as U1, U2, U4, and U5, playing a vital role in the assembly and stability of the spliceosome complex. This complex is essential for the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNA, a key step in mRNA maturation and gene expression regulation (Scruggs2012SmD3). SmD3 is also involved in the biogenesis of intronic noncoding RNAs, including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and mirtrons, by contributing to the formation and stability of intron lariats (Scruggs2012SmD3). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various cancers, such as neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis (Blijlevens2020Silencing; Salib2023MYCN).

## Function
The SNRPD3 gene encodes the SmD3 protein, a core component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. SmD3, along with other Sm proteins, forms a heteroheptameric ring around small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) such as U1, U2, U4, and U5, facilitating the assembly and stability of the spliceosome. This complex is crucial for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA, a critical step in mRNA maturation and gene expression regulation (Scruggs2012SmD3).

In healthy human cells, SmD3 plays a specific role in the biogenesis of intronic noncoding RNAs, including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and mirtrons. It is involved in the formation and stability of intron lariats, structures necessary for the processing of these noncoding RNAs. SmD3 haploinsufficiency does not significantly affect global mRNA splicing but specifically impacts the production of intronic snoRNAs by reducing the expression of U4 and U5 snRNPs, which are essential for intron lariat formation (Scruggs2012SmD3). SmD3 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining the integrity and function of the spliceosome, ensuring proper RNA processing and splicing (Salib2023MYCN).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the SNRPD3 gene have been implicated in several cancers, notably neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In neuroblastoma, high expression of SNRPD3 is associated with poor patient outcomes and is considered an independent prognostic factor. The gene is a transcriptional target of the oncogene MYCN, and its expression is crucial for the survival and proliferation of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. Knockdown of SNRPD3 in these cells leads to reduced viability and proliferation, indicating its role in MYCN-driven tumorigenesis. SNRPD3 is involved in maintaining the balance of MYCN-driven alternative splicing events, which are necessary for neuroblastoma progression (Salib2023MYCN).

In NSCLC, silencing SNRPD3 induces specific alternative splicing events, including a cytotoxic splicing switch in the proteasome subunit beta 3 (PSMB3) mRNA. This switch leads to decreased expression of the long splice variant and increased expression of a non-coding short variant, resulting in reduced cell viability and proteasomal activity. This suggests that targeting SNRPD3 could selectively induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells by affecting proteasome activity (Blijlevens2020Silencing). These findings highlight the potential of SNRPD3 as a therapeutic target in certain cancers.

## Interactions
SNRPD3 is a core component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with other proteins such as SNRPB, SNRPD1, and SNRPD2 to form the core snRNP complex. SNRPD3 also associates with U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 snRNPs, facilitating spliceosome assembly (Scruggs2012SmD3).

In the context of neuroblastoma, SNRPD3 interacts with the MYCN oncogene and PRMT5, forming a protein complex that enhances SNRPD3 methylation. This complex is crucial for the function of the spliceosome in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma, maintaining splicing fidelity and supporting cancer cell viability (Salib2023MYCN). MYCN directly binds to SNRPD3 and PRMT5, suggesting a cooperative role in enhancing SNRPD3 methylation and spliceosome assembly (Salib2023MYCN).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SNRPD3 forms part of a protein complex involved in splicing and RNA processing, interacting with proteins such as SNRPD2 and NHP2L1. This complex is associated with splicing and RNA processing pathways, and its disruption affects mitosis and cell proliferation in TNBC cells (Koedoot2021Splicing).
