# MTG2

## Overview
MTG2, also known as GTPBP5, is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosome-associated GTPase 2 protein, which is integral to mitochondrial function. This protein is categorized as a GTPase and is primarily involved in the maturation of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mtLSU). It plays a pivotal role in the methylation of 16S rRNA, a process essential for the proper assembly and function of the mitoribosome, thereby ensuring efficient mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular energy production. The absence or dysfunction of MTG2 can lead to impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, underscoring its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Lopez2021Human; Maiti2020Human).

## Function
MTG2, also known as GTPBP5, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the maturation of the large subunit of the mitoribosome (mtLSU) in healthy human cells. It is involved in the methylation of 16S rRNA, a critical step in mtLSU maturation, by interacting with the 16S rRNA methyltransferase MRM2. This interaction is essential for the 2'-O-methyl modification at position U1369 in the human mitochondrial 16S rRNA, which is crucial for the peptidyl transferase center involved in ribosome-tRNA interactions (Maiti2020Human).

MTG2 facilitates the proper assembly and function of the mitoribosome by ensuring efficient methylation of 16S rRNA residues and coordinating the release of late-stage assembly factors. This process provides a quality control checkpoint during mtLSU assembly to prevent premature subunit joining and ensure the formation of the mature 55S monosome (Maiti2020Human). The absence of MTG2 results in significantly reduced levels of the 55S monosome and impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, highlighting its essential role in mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Lopez2021Human; Maiti2020Human).

## Interactions
MTG2, also known as GTPBP5, is involved in several critical interactions within the mitochondria, particularly in the maturation of the mitoribosome large subunit (mtLSU). It directly interacts with the 16S ribosomal RNA and the 16S rRNA methyltransferase MRM2, facilitating the methylation of specific residues such as U1369 and G1145 in the 16S rRNA (Maiti2020Human). This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the mitoribosome, as the absence of MTG2 leads to decreased methylation levels and disrupted mtLSU assembly (Maiti2020Human).

MTG2 also interacts with several mtLSU proteins and assembly factors, including MTERF4, MTG1, and MALSU1, which are involved in the final stages of mtLSU maturation and monosome formation (Maiti2020Human). The interaction with MRM2 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a high-affinity physical interaction (Maiti2020Human). These interactions suggest that MTG2 plays a role in coordinating the release of late-stage mtLSU assembly factors, acting as a quality control checkpoint to prevent premature subunit joining and ensure proper ribosome assembly (Maiti2020Human).
