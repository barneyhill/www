# METTL5

## Overview
The METTL5 gene encodes the methyltransferase 5, N6-adenosine protein, a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family, which plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional modification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This enzyme specifically catalyzes the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification at the A1832 position of 18S rRNA, a modification essential for ribosome biogenesis and function (van2019The). METTL5 forms a heterodimeric complex with the coactivator TRMT112, which is crucial for its stability and enhances its methyltransferase activity (van2019The). While METTL5 is not indispensable for cell growth, its activity is vital for proper neural development, and mutations in the METTL5 gene have been associated with intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders (Wang2022Mettl5). Additionally, aberrant expression of METTL5 has been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis (Wang2023METTL5; Sun2021Construction).

## Structure
The METTL5 protein is a methyltransferase that catalyzes the m6A modification at the A-1832 position of 18S rRNA. It contains a single class I methyltransferase domain with a canonical Rossman fold, characterized by a central seven-stranded β-sheet sandwiched by alpha helices (Turkalj2022The). The active site of METTL5 is located between residues V16 and T31, the substrate binding site between D185 and D199, and the catalytic site between N126 and F129, which contains a canonical NPPF motif typical for N6-adenosine methyltransferases (Turkalj2022The).

The tertiary structure of METTL5 involves its interaction with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) at the C-terminal region of the β-sheet to catalyze the methylation process. METTL5 forms a complex with its coactivator, TRMT112, which stabilizes the β3-β4 loop and enhances the binding of METTL5 to SAM (Turkalj2022The). The METTL5-TRMT112 complex is characterized by a parallel β-zipper interface, contributing to its stability (van2019The). This quaternary structure is crucial for the metabolic stability and activity of METTL5, although TRMT112 is not required for its catalytic activity (Turkalj2022The). The interaction between METTL5 and TRMT112 involves a large hydrophobic core and is surrounded by polar residues that form hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (van2019The).

## Function
The METTL5 gene encodes a methyltransferase enzyme responsible for the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification on 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at position A1832 in human cells. This modification is crucial for ribosome biogenesis and function, as it occurs near the decoding center of the ribosome, potentially influencing translation processes (van2019The). METTL5 forms a heterodimeric complex with TRMT112, which is essential for its stability and function. This complex is structurally distinct from other m6A RNA methyltransferases and is necessary for the methylation activity of METTL5 (van2019The).

In healthy human cells, METTL5 is primarily involved in the methylation of 18S rRNA, contributing to efficient protein synthesis by potentially fine-tuning the structural conformation of the ribosomal decoding center (Turkalj2022The). Despite its role in rRNA modification, METTL5 is not essential for cell growth or ribosome biogenesis, as its absence does not significantly impact these processes (van2019The). However, METTL5-mediated rRNA modifications are important for proper neural function and development, as mutations in METTL5 can lead to intellectual disabilities and other developmental abnormalities (Wang2022Mettl5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the METTL5 gene have been linked to autosomal-recessive intellectual disability and microcephaly. Specifically, bi-allelic frameshift variants such as c.344_345delGA and c.571_572delAA lead to premature truncation of the METTL5 protein, affecting its stability and function. These mutations disrupt the protein's secondary structure, removing conserved regions essential for its role, and have been associated with symptoms like muscular hypotonia, seizures, and short stature (Turkalj2022The; Richard2019Bi-allelic).

In cancer, METTL5 expression is significantly elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD). In HCC, overexpression of METTL5 correlates with poor survival outcomes and is linked to immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in immune evasion. METTL5's involvement in oncogenic signaling and cancer progression highlights its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Wang2023METTL5). In LUAD, METTL5 expression is upregulated, and its prognostic significance has been validated, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Sun2021Construction).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of METTL5 mutations and expression alterations in various diseases, particularly in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
METTL5 interacts with the multifunctional methyltransferase subunit TRMT112, forming a heterodimeric complex that is crucial for its metabolic stability and methyltransferase activity. This interaction is characterized by a large interface area involving hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, including a central hydrophobic core and a parallel β-zipper formation between the main chain atoms of METTL5 and TRMT112. This structural arrangement is similar to other eukaryotic Trm112 protein complexes (van2019The).

The METTL5-TRMT112 complex is essential for the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of 18S rRNA at position A1832. TRMT112 acts as a co-activator, enhancing METTL5's ability to bind S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), which is necessary for the methylation process (van2019The; Turkalj2022The). The interaction with TRMT112 is not only important for METTL5's stability but also potentially increases its substrate-binding capacity by interacting with the 40S ribosomal subunit (van2019The).

In Drosophila, the interaction between METTL5 and its ortholog of TRMT112, CG12975, is conserved, forming a complex independently of RNA. This suggests a similar mode of interaction across species (Leismann2020The).
