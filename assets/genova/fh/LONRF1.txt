# LONRF1

## Overview
LONRF1 is a gene that encodes the protein LON peptidase N-terminal domain and ring finger 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a LON peptidase domain and a ring finger motif, suggesting its role in protein degradation and ubiquitination pathways. LONRF1 is implicated in the regulation of protein quality control and cellular stress responses, although its precise biological functions and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The protein's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its possible implications in disease states. Further research is needed to understand the full spectrum of LONRF1's functions and interactions within the cell.
