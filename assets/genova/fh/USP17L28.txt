# USP17L28

## Overview
USP17L28 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 28, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family. These enzymes play a critical role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thus rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The USP17L28 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and stress responses. Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The precise mechanisms by which USP17L28 influences these processes are still under investigation, highlighting the importance of further research to fully elucidate its biological functions and potential as a therapeutic target.
