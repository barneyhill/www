# SUV39H2

## Overview
SUV39H2 is a gene that encodes the SUV39H2 histone lysine methyltransferase, an enzyme categorized as a histone methyltransferase. This enzyme is primarily involved in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), a key modification that contributes to the formation of heterochromatin and the regulation of gene expression. The SUV39H2 protein contains a SET domain, which is crucial for its catalytic activity, and a chromodomain, which facilitates binding to methylated lysine residues. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can have distinct biological roles and tissue-specific expression patterns. SUV39H2 plays a significant role in chromatin modification, gene repression, and the regulation of various cellular processes, including neurodevelopment and differentiation. Its dysregulation is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders (Guerra2022H3K9; Mauger2015Alternative; Weirich2021Structure).

## Structure
The SUV39H2 protein is a histone lysine methyltransferase involved in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), playing a crucial role in chromatin modification and gene regulation. It contains a SET domain, which is the catalytic core responsible for transferring methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the target lysine residue. This domain is characterized by several small β-sheets surrounding a knot-like structure that forms the active site (Wu2010Structural; Weirich2021Structure). The SET domain is flanked by Pre-SET and Post-SET regions, which contribute to substrate binding and structural stability. The Post-SET domain includes a ZnCys motif, which is important for peptide binding and exists in multiple conformational states (Wu2010Structural).

SUV39H2 also features a chromodomain, which is expected to recognize methylated lysine residues, similar to its paralog SUV39H1 (Weirich2021Structure). The protein undergoes alternative splicing, particularly involving exon 3, resulting in multiple isoforms with variations in the SET domain and chromodomain, affecting its stability and sub-nuclear localization (Mauger2015Alternative). These isoforms can have different biological roles and are expressed in various tissues (Mauger2015Alternative).

## Function
SUV39H2 is a histone lysine methyltransferase that plays a critical role in the maintenance of heterochromatin and gene repression by introducing di- and trimethylation at histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) (Weirich2021Structure). This modification is essential for the formation of heterochromatin, leading to transcriptional silencing, particularly in repeat-rich pericentromeric regions (Keenan2024Suv39hcatalyzed). SUV39H2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression by maintaining the structure of euchromatic regions and organizing the genome into active and repressive compartments (Keenan2024Suv39hcatalyzed).

The enzyme contains a SET domain necessary for its catalytic activity and a chromodomain that binds H3K9me2/3, facilitating its targeting and regulation (Weirich2021Structure). SUV39H2 is expressed in various tissues, with higher levels in the brain, testis, and thymus, and is involved in early neurodevelopment (Weirich2021Structure). It also plays a role in the differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus, where it is crucial for the progression from type 2a to type 2b cells and further differentiation into neuroblasts and granule neurons (Guerra2022H3K9).

Alternative splicing of SUV39H2 results in different isoforms with distinct functions, affecting the enzyme's stability, sub-nuclear localization, and histone methyltransferase activity (Mauger2015Alternative). These isoforms can modulate the expression of target genes, indicating that SUV39H2 has a significant impact on gene regulation through its various forms (Mauger2015Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
The SUV39H2 gene is implicated in various cancers and conditions due to its role in histone modification and gene expression regulation. In hematological malignancies, SUV39H2 overexpression is linked to chemoresistance in acute lymphocytic leukemia and serves as a potential diagnostic marker in acute myeloid leukemia (Li2019The). In non-small cell lung cancer, SUV39H2 is upregulated, contributing to resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy (Li2019The). Its overexpression in lung adenocarcinoma is associated with poorer survival outcomes, potentially due to DNA copy number alterations (Zheng2018Identification). In breast cancer, SUV39H2 is enriched in lung metastases and correlates with poor prognosis, particularly in basal-like and triple-negative subtypes (Li2019The).

SUV39H2 is also involved in colorectal carcinoma, where it promotes proliferation and metastasis by silencing tumor suppressor genes (Saha2021Insight). In gastric cancer, SUV39H2 upregulation leads to the repression of the p16 gene, contributing to cancer progression (Li2019The). Beyond cancer, a loss-of-function variant in SUV39H2 has been identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, causing altered H3K9 trimethylation and dysregulation of protocadherin β-cluster genes in the developing brain (Balan2021A). These findings highlight SUV39H2's significant role in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SUV39H2 is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin modification and gene regulation. It specifically methylates lysine 141 of the protein phosphatase PPP1CA, disrupting its interaction with the regulatory subunit PPP1R9B. This disruption affects the recruitment of PPP1CA to the transcription factor TFEB, leading to decreased TFEB activity and impaired autophagy, which contributes to intervertebral disc degeneration (Liang2023Lysine).

SUV39H2 also interacts with histone H3, where it catalyzes the trimethylation of lysine 9 (H3K9me3), a modification associated with heterochromatin formation. This interaction is facilitated by the chromodomain of SUV39H2, which binds to methylated H3K9, and the SET domain, which is responsible for its catalytic activity (Nakamura2023Regulation).

In addition to histone interactions, SUV39H2 binds to single-stranded RNAs derived from major satellite repeats, suggesting a role in targeting higher-order nucleosome structures containing RNA (Nakamura2023Regulation). These interactions highlight SUV39H2's involvement in both protein and nucleic acid interactions, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression.
