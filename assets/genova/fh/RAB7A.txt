# RAB7A

## Overview
RAB7A is a gene that encodes the RAB7A protein, a member of the RAS oncogene family, which functions as a small GTPase. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of endosomal transport, particularly in the maturation and trafficking of endosomes and lysosomes. RAB7A is involved in critical cellular processes such as endocytosis, autophagy, and lysosomal biogenesis, where it facilitates the fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and nutrient recycling (Bucci2000Rab7:; Hyttinen2013Maturation). The protein's activity is modulated by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, which is essential for its interactions with various effector proteins and its subcellular localization (Sun2019Control). Mutations in the RAB7A gene have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Cogli2012Charcot–Marie–Tooth). Additionally, altered expression of RAB7A has been linked to cancer progression, underscoring its role in disease pathogenesis (Liu2022High).

## Structure
The RAB7A protein is a small GTPase involved in endosomal transport, belonging to the RAS oncogene family. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes a GTP-binding domain essential for its function (Bucci2000Rab7:). The secondary structure of RAB7A includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact, globular tertiary structure. This structure is crucial for its role in binding and hydrolyzing GTP, which regulates its activity in endosomal transport (Bucci2000Rab7:).

RAB7A undergoes post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, which facilitate its attachment to cellular membranes, particularly the late endosome and lysosome membranes (Khan2021Structural). This modification is vital for its function in membrane tethering and lipid transport at membrane contact sites (Khan2021Structural).

The protein also interacts with various effectors, including PDZD8, through its switch I and II loops, which are active in the GTP-bound state. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of PDZD8 at the ER-late endosome interface (Khan2021Structural). The structural arrangement of RAB7A allows it to play a significant role in lysosome biogenesis and endosomal maturation (Bucci2000Rab7:).

## Function
RAB7A is a small GTPase protein that plays a crucial role in the endocytic and autophagic pathways in human cells. It is primarily active on late endosomes and lysosomes, where it regulates the maturation of early endosomes into late endosomes and their subsequent transport to lysosomes (Guerra2016Multiple; Sun2019Control). RAB7A is essential for the fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes, facilitating the degradation of cellular components and recycling of nutrients (Gutierrez2004Rab7; Hyttinen2013Maturation).

In the autophagic pathway, RAB7A is involved in the maturation of autophagosomes into autolysosomes, a process critical for cellular homeostasis and the clearance of damaged organelles (Gutierrez2004Rab7; Hyttinen2013Maturation). It interacts with various effector proteins, such as the HOPS complex and SNARE proteins, to mediate membrane fusion events (Hyttinen2013Maturation). RAB7A also plays a role in lysosomal biogenesis and positioning, impacting lysosomal function and signal transduction (Guerra2016Multiple).

RAB7A's activity is regulated by its binding to GTP or GDP, which influences its interactions with other proteins and its subcellular localization (Sun2019Control). Its proper function is vital for processes like apoptosis, neurotrophin trafficking, and phagocytosis, contributing to overall cellular and organismal health (Guerra2016Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAB7A gene are linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B (CMT2B), a hereditary autosomal dominant neuropathy characterized by sensory and motor deficits, foot ulcers, and infections. These mutations, including L129F, K157N, N161I, N161T, and V162M, result in a constitutively active GTP-bound state of Rab7a, disrupting neurotrophin-mediated retrograde signaling and leading to premature degradation of neurotrophin receptors (Banworth2017Consequences). A novel mutation, p.K126R, has been identified, which affects the GTP-binding domain and alters interactions with peripherin, a protein important for neuronal morphology, contributing to a predominantly motor phenotype (Saveri2020CharcotMarieTooth).

Altered RAB7A expression is also implicated in cancer progression. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), high RAB7A expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to the regulation of TP53 activity and oncogenic MAPK signaling pathways (Liu2022High). The gene's dysregulation affects endosomal trafficking and lysosome biogenesis, which are crucial for cellular homeostasis and can contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (Mulligan2023Regulation).

## Interactions
RAB7A, a small GTPase, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for endosomal trafficking and cellular processes. It interacts with Rubicon, a protein that regulates endosome maturation. Rubicon binds specifically to the GTP-bound form of RAB7A, indicating its role as a RAB7A effector. This interaction is competitive with UVRAG, as both proteins vie for binding to Rubicon, influencing endosome maturation (Sun2010Rubicon).

RAB7A also interacts with PDZD8, a protein involved in ER-late endosome tethering. The PDZD8 coiled-coil domain binds two RAB7A molecules in a GTP-dependent manner, facilitating membrane tethering and lipid transport at membrane contact sites (Khan2021Structural).

In the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B disease, RAB7A interacts with peripherin, a neuronal intermediate filament protein. This interaction is altered in disease-causing RAB7A mutants, affecting peripherin's soluble/insoluble ratio and potentially disrupting neurofilament dynamics, which may contribute to the disease pathology (Cogli2012Charcot–Marie–Tooth).

RAB7A also interacts with effectors such as RILP and PLEKHM1, which are important for EGFR degradation. The interaction with PLEKHM1 is modulated by CLN3, affecting the efficiency of EGFR degradation (Yasa2020CLN3).
