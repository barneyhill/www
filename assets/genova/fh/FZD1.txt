# FZD1

## Overview
FZD1, or frizzled class receptor 1, is a gene that encodes a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral to the Wnt signaling pathway. The FZD1 protein is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) at the N-terminus, essential for binding Wnt ligands (Ain2013Prediction). This receptor plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, by mediating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Wang2005Wnt7b). FZD1 is also involved in neuroprotective mechanisms, particularly in the survival of dopaminergic neurons, highlighting its significance in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (L’Episcopo2011A). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several cancers, including glioblastoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression (Jia2023FZD1KLF10hsamiR47625pmiR2243pcircular; Yang2017Overexpression).

## Structure
The FZD1 protein is a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. It features a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is characteristic of GPCRs. The protein includes a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) at the N-terminus, which is crucial for ligand binding, particularly with WNT ligands (Ain2013Prediction). The CRD domain is highly conserved among vertebrates and is characterized by extensive disulfide bridges due to conserved cysteine residues, which are essential for maintaining its structural integrity and function (Ain2013Prediction).

The tertiary structure of FZD1 involves a U-shaped groove that accommodates the CRD, facilitating the interaction with WNT proteins. This interaction is critical for the initiation of the WNT signaling cascade (Ain2013Prediction). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in FZD1, which may influence its processing and function (Ain2013Prediction). Alternative splicing of the FZD1 gene can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting the protein's function and interaction with ligands (Ain2013Prediction). These structural features make FZD1 a significant target for drug development, particularly in the context of diseases like cancer and schizophrenia (Liu2019Wnt).

## Function
FZD1 (frizzled class receptor 1) is a receptor involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, FZD1 is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with Wnt ligands to initiate intracellular signaling cascades. This interaction is essential for the activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which involves the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, leading to the activation of LEF/TCF-mediated gene transcription. This process is vital for cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in the development of lung and vascular tissues (Wang2005Wnt7b).

FZD1 is also implicated in neuroprotective mechanisms, particularly in the survival and protection of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. The Wnt1/Fzd-1/β-catenin signaling pathway is crucial for maintaining the health of these neurons, especially in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. This pathway helps stabilize β-catenin, preventing apoptosis and promoting neuron survival (L’Episcopo2011A). FZD1's role in these signaling pathways underscores its importance in both developmental and neuroprotective processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FZD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In glioblastoma, FZD1 is part of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and is significantly correlated with overall survival rates. High expression levels of FZD1 are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. The involvement of FZD1 in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and migration, underscores its role in GBM pathogenesis (Jia2023FZD1KLF10hsamiR47625pmiR2243pcircular).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, FZD1 overexpression is linked to poor differentiation, larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage, all of which are associated with a worse prognosis. The expression of FZD1 is positively correlated with CAIX expression, and both are considered independent prognostic factors for poor survival outcomes in PDAC patients. The upregulation of FZD1 in PDAC suggests its role as an oncogene, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (Yang2017Overexpression).

## Interactions
FZD1 interacts with several WNT proteins, including WNT-1, -2, -3, -3A, -5A, and -7B. These interactions have been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, which provide direct evidence of receptor-ligand binding. For instance, WNT-5A binds to FZD1 but does not enhance TOPflash reporter activity, a common assay for measuring WNT activity. In contrast, WNT-7B can bind to overexpressed FZD1 on the cell surface and cooperatively activate the TOPflash reporter in the presence of LRP5 (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled).

FZD1 also interacts with intracellular proteins such as Dishevelled (DVL) and heterotrimeric G proteins, which are crucial for the signaling pathways activated by these receptors. Specific motifs like KTxxxW in FZD1 are essential for these interactions, and mutations in these motifs can abolish FZD signaling (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled).

In the context of spinal cord injury, FZD1 interacts with WNT1, which has been shown to improve motor recovery and neuronal survival in animal models. This interaction suggests a potential therapeutic role for FZD1 in neuroprotection (González2020Frizzled). Additionally, FZD1 is involved in canonical WNT signaling pathways, particularly in cooperation with LRP5 and WNT7B, which significantly increases stabilized levels of β-catenin (Wang2005Wnt7b).
