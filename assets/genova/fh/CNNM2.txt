# CNNM2

## Overview
CNNM2 is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin and CBS domain divalent metal cation transport mediator 2, which is integral to magnesium homeostasis in human cells. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily expressed in the kidney, where it plays a critical role in magnesium reabsorption, particularly in the distal convoluted tubule. The CNNM2 protein features a complex structure with multiple domains, including cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains, which are essential for its function in magnesium transport. It acts as a Na+/Mg2+ exchanger, facilitating the efflux of magnesium ions from cells. Mutations in the CNNM2 gene can lead to various clinical conditions, such as hypomagnesemia, seizures, and intellectual disabilities, underscoring its importance in maintaining magnesium balance and proper neurological function (Zhang2021CNNM2Related; Funato2018Molecular; de2012Membrane).

## Structure
The CNNM2 protein is an integral membrane protein involved in magnesium transport, characterized by a complex structure comprising several domains. It includes an extracellular N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain (DUF21), and a large cytosolic region with a CBS-pair domain and a CNBH domain (Chen2020Mg2+ATP). The CBS domains are crucial for ATP binding, and mutations in these domains, such as T568I, can disrupt this function, leading to conditions like hypomagnesemia (de2012Membrane). The CNBH domain, although structurally similar to cyclic nucleotide-binding domains, does not bind cyclic nucleotides but is essential for Mg2+ efflux activity (Chen2018The).

CNNM2 undergoes significant post-translational modifications, including the cleavage of a large N-terminal signal peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum and glycosylation at Asn-112, which stabilizes the protein on the plasma membrane (de2012Membrane). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with CNNM2a and CNNM2b forming homo- and heterodimers (de2012Membrane). The structure of CNNM2 is proposed to be similar to glutamate receptor ion channels, with three full membrane-spanning regions and an additional re-entrant loop (de2012Membrane).

## Function
The CNNM2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in magnesium (Mg2+) homeostasis in human cells. It is primarily active in the kidney, particularly in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), where it facilitates the reabsorption of Mg2+ from the tubular lumen into the body, thus maintaining proper magnesium levels (Funato2018Molecular; de2012Membrane). CNNM2 is expressed on the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, suggesting its involvement in apical-to-basolateral Mg2+ transport (Arjona2018CrossTalk).

The protein contains several domains, including cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains, which are important for its function. These domains may dimerize by binding with Mg2+-ATP, altering the protein's conformation and facilitating Mg2+ efflux from cells (Tseng2022Novel; Zhang2021CNNM2Related). CNNM2 is also involved in the extrusion of Mg2+ from cells, acting as a Na+/Mg2+ exchanger, which is essential for regulating intracellular Mg2+ levels (Funato2018Molecular).

Mutations in CNNM2 can lead to conditions such as hypomagnesemia, characterized by low serum magnesium levels, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms, highlighting its importance in maintaining magnesium balance in healthy human cells (Chen2018The; de2012Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CNNM2 gene are associated with a range of disorders characterized by hypomagnesemia, seizures, and intellectual disability. Hypomagnesemia, Seizures, and Intellectual Disability (HSMR) syndrome is a notable condition caused by CNNM2 mutations, leading to renal magnesium wasting, epileptic seizures, and intellectual disability. Some patients also exhibit severe obesity, impaired motor skills, or autism spectrum disorder (Franken2021The). 

CNNM2 mutations can result in impaired brain development, with symptoms such as cerebral convulsions, developmental delays, microcephaly, and significant cognitive and motor skill impairments. Neuroimaging often reveals defects in myelinization and opercularization (Arjona2014CNNM2). The severity of these conditions can vary based on the mode of inheritance, with autosomal recessive cases often presenting more severe phenotypes, including brain malformations and refractory epilepsy (Zhang2021CNNM2Related; Accogli2019CNNM2).

CNNM2 mutations are also linked to cardiovascular traits, glycemic traits, body mass index, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, although the exact role of CNNM2 in these conditions remains unclear (Franken2021The). Despite magnesium supplementation, patients with CNNM2 mutations often continue to experience neurological symptoms, indicating a complex relationship between CNNM2 function and magnesium homeostasis (Arjona2014CNNM2).

## Interactions
CNNM2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in magnesium homeostasis and cellular signaling. One significant interaction is with the phosphatase PRL-1, forming a complex that influences magnesium transport and cellular proliferation. This interaction involves structural rearrangements in both proteins, particularly in the loop L553-559 of CNNM2, which becomes ordered upon entering the catalytic cavity of PRL-1. The interaction reduces PRL-1's phosphatase activity and is linked to cancer progression due to increased intracellular magnesium concentration (GiménezMascarell2017Structural).

CNNM2 also interacts with the TRPM7 channel, facilitating the entry of divalent cations like Zn2+ into cells. This interaction is dependent on functional TRPM7 channels, as demonstrated by increased Zn2+ uptake in cells overexpressing CNNM2 (Bai2021CNNM).

Additionally, CNNM2 binds to ARL15, a small GTP-binding protein, through its CBS domains. This interaction occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, affecting the N-glycosylation of CNNM2 and modulating magnesium transport. ARL15 acts as a negative regulator of Mg2+ transport by promoting complex N-glycosylation of CNNM2 (Zolotarov2021ARL15).
