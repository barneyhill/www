# TAMALIN

## Overview
TAMALIN is a gene that encodes the protein tamalin, a PDZ domain-containing scaffold protein involved in the regulation and trafficking of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), particularly group 1 mGluRs. Tamalin plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and intracellular signaling by facilitating the assembly of protein complexes necessary for receptor trafficking and signaling. It is predominantly expressed in the telencephalic region of the central nervous system and is enriched in postsynaptic membrane fractions. The protein's structure includes several characteristic domains, such as a PDZ domain, leucine zipper, and YXXL motifs, which enable its interactions with various proteins, including mGluRs and cytohesin-2. These interactions are essential for maintaining proper receptor levels and preventing excitotoxicity, which can lead to neurodegeneration (Sugi2007Crystal; Kitano2002Tamalin; Seo2022Tamalin).

## Structure
Tamalin, a protein encoded by the human gene TAMALIN, is a PDZ domain-containing scaffold protein involved in intracellular signaling and trafficking of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The primary structure of tamalin consists of 394 amino acids, and it was initially isolated from an adult rat forebrain cDNA library. Sequence analysis shows a high degree of homology with mouse EST clones, with a sequence identity of 97% (Kitano2002Tamalin).

The protein features several characteristic domains, including a PDZ domain, an alanine-rich, proline-rich, and glycine-rich region, a leucine zipper sequence, and four YXXL motifs involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It also has a PDZ-binding motif (SQL) at the C terminus (Kitano2002Tamalin). The PDZ domain of tamalin can self-associate, forming a dimeric structure that allows interactions with binding partners while maintaining PDZ dimerization (Sugi2007Crystal).

The tertiary structure of tamalin includes a novel dimeric architecture, with the dimer interface formed by the crossing and packing of the β2 and β3 strands from each protomer. This structure is stabilized by hydrophobic residues, including the aromatic side chains of Tyr118 and Phe133 (Sugi2007Crystal). The quaternary structure involves a tetrameric assembly, comprising a dimer of PDZ dimers, stabilized by polar interactions and salt bridges (Sugi2007Crystal).

## Function
Tamalin, also known as trafficking regulator and scaffold protein tamalin, is a crucial component in the regulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), particularly group 1 mGluRs, in healthy human cells. It functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly of protein complexes that are essential for the trafficking and signaling of these receptors. Tamalin contains a PDZ domain, which allows it to interact with the C-termini of mGluRs, and a leucine zipper that interacts with the coiled-coiled region of cytohesin-2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Kitano2002Tamalin; Enz2012Metabotropic).

In the central nervous system, tamalin is predominantly expressed in the telencephalic region and is enriched in postsynaptic membrane fractions. It plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity by controlling the ligand-dependent trafficking of mGluRs, such as mGluR1a and mGluR5, to the cell surface and neurites (Kitano2002Tamalin; Seo2022Tamalin). This regulation is critical for maintaining proper receptor levels and preventing excitotoxicity, which can lead to neurodegeneration (Seo2022Tamalin).

Tamalin's interaction with mGluRs is autoregulatory, as it can self-assemble into autoinhibited conformations in the absence of mGluR, which is disrupted upon mGluR binding, facilitating receptor trafficking (Sugi2007Crystal). This dynamic regulation is essential for synaptic signaling and the maintenance of neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival (Seo2022Tamalin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TAMALIN gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, studies have shown a significant dysregulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and its endogenous regulators, including TAMALIN. Specifically, TAMALIN protein levels were found to be reduced by 30.4% in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia, although this reduction's significance was affected by factors such as freezer storage time and age at death (Matosin2015Alterations). Another study reported increased levels of mGluR5 and its trafficking molecules, including TAMALIN, in the hippocampal CA1 region of schizophrenia subjects, suggesting that these alterations might contribute to cognitive dysfunctions associated with the disorder (Matosin2015Metabotropic).

TAMALIN dysfunction is also linked to neurodegenerative conditions. In animal models, the loss of TAMALIN leads to neurodegeneration and oligodendrocyte degeneration, indicating its crucial role in maintaining central nervous system integrity. This degeneration is associated with increased mGluR5 expression, which contributes to excitotoxicity and cell death (Seo2022Tamalin). These findings suggest that TAMALIN's role in regulating glutamate receptors is vital for preventing neurodegenerative processes.

## Interactions
TAMALIN, also known as GRASP-1, is a scaffold protein that interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in intracellular signaling pathways. It contains a PDZ domain that facilitates interactions with group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), specifically mGluR1a and mGluR5, forming complexes at the postsynaptic site of neurons (Kitano2002Tamalin). TAMALIN also interacts with cytohesin-2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, through its C-terminal domain, forming a ternary complex with mGluR1a and cytohesin-2 in both transfected cells and rat brain tissue (Kitano2002Tamalin).

The PDZ domain of TAMALIN is involved in the dimerization of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with mGluR5, leading to a 2:2 stoichiometric ratio of the protein complex (Sugi2007Crystal). This interaction is crucial for the trafficking and cell-surface expression of mGluRs, as TAMALIN regulates the ligand-dependent trafficking of these receptors (Seo2022Tamalin). Additionally, TAMALIN interacts with Dock180 and cytohesin 2/ARNO, facilitating crosstalk between Arf and Rac GTPases, which are important for cell motility (Attar2013The).
