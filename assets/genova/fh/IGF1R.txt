# IGF1R

## Overview
The IGF1R gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in cellular growth, development, and survival. This receptor is integral to the mediation of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), primarily IGF-I and IGF-II, which are crucial for normal mammalian development and various cellular processes. The protein structure of IGF1R includes a complex arrangement of alpha and beta chains, forming a homodimer that facilitates ligand binding and signal transduction through pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK (Delafontaine2004Expression; Adams2000Structure). IGF1R is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues, influencing functions such as glucose uptake, DNA synthesis, and angiogenesis, and is particularly significant in endothelial cells and keratinocytes (Muraguchi2019IGF1R; Delafontaine2004Expression). Mutations or dysregulation of IGF1R are associated with various growth disorders and have implications in tumorigenesis, highlighting its clinical significance in both developmental biology and oncology (Forbes2020Disorders; Kruis2010Heterozygous).

## Structure
The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of IGF1R includes a 1367-amino acid precursor, which is processed to form a mature receptor composed of two alpha (α) and two beta (β) chains, linked by disulfide bonds (Adams2000Structure; Ward2001The). The secondary structure features include L1 and L2 domains, which are characterized by single-stranded, right-handed β-helices, and a cysteine-rich region composed of disulfide-bonded modules (Garrett1998Crystal; Ward2001The).

The tertiary structure of IGF1R is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the extracellular domain (Adams2000Structure). The receptor's quaternary structure forms a homodimer, with the ectodomain adopting a U-shaped prism configuration, allowing for ligand binding in a central cleft (Adams2000Structure).

IGF1R contains several key domains, including the ligand-binding L1, cysteine-rich, and L2 domains, as well as three fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Adams2000Structure; Ward2001The). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are critical for receptor biosynthesis and function, enhancing solubility and preventing aggregation (Adams2000Structure). An alternate mRNA transcript with a 3bp deletion results in a variant with altered internalization and signaling properties (Adams2000Structure).

## Function
The IGF1R gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase crucial for mediating the effects of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in healthy human cells. IGF1R is ubiquitously expressed and plays a significant role in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Upon binding with its ligands, IGF-I or IGF-II, IGF1R undergoes autophosphorylation, activating intracellular signaling pathways such as the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. These pathways are involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism, proliferation, and protection against apoptosis (Delafontaine2004Expression; Riedemann2006IGF1R; Forbes2020Disorders).

IGF1R is essential for normal mammalian development, as evidenced by studies showing that mice lacking functional IGF1R exhibit severe growth deficiencies and organ hypoplasia (Liu1993Mice; Riedemann2006IGF1R). In endothelial cells, IGF1R influences functions such as glucose uptake, DNA synthesis, and angiogenesis, while in keratinocytes, it is crucial for maintaining epidermal homeostasis and stem cell maintenance (Muraguchi2019IGF1R; Delafontaine2004Expression). The receptor's activity is primarily located at the cell membrane, where it facilitates the interaction with its ligands and subsequent signal transduction (Riedemann2006IGF1R).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IGF1R gene are associated with a range of growth disorders. Heterozygous mutations can lead to intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, characterized by short stature, microcephaly, and sometimes intellectual disabilities, although mental development can remain normal in some cases (Gkourogianni2020Pre‐; Kruis2010Heterozygous). These mutations often result in impaired IGF1R function, affecting downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras-MAPK, which are crucial for growth and development (Stróżewska2022Mutations).

Alterations in IGF1R expression levels can also contribute to various conditions. Underexpression or haploinsufficiency of IGF1R is linked to growth deficiencies, as seen in cases with chromosomal deletions involving the IGF1R gene (Choi2011Clinical). Conversely, overexpression of IGF1R is often associated with tumorigenesis, as the receptor plays a role in cell proliferation and survival.

IGF1R mutations can also lead to IGF-1 resistance, which is associated with prenatal and postnatal growth restrictions (Stróżewska2022Mutations). Some patients with IGF1R defects exhibit elevated serum IGF-I concentrations, indicating a resistance to IGF-I signaling (Forbes2020Disorders). These genetic alterations underscore the critical role of IGF1R in growth regulation and its potential impact on various growth-related conditions.

## Interactions
The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its signaling functions. IGF1R interacts with insulin-like growth factors IGF1 and IGF2, which bind to the receptor's ectodomain, primarily adopting a Γ-shaped conformation. This binding involves the αCT, L1′, and FnIII-1′ domains, with the αCT inserting into a hydrophobic crevice between the A and B chains (Turvey2022Recent).

IGF1R also interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a tyrosine kinase that plays a significant role in cancer cell survival. The FAK-NT2 domain directly interacts with the N-terminal part of the IGF1R intracellular domain, providing survival signals in cancer cells (Zheng2009Targeting; Liu2008FAK). This interaction is crucial for activating signaling pathways such as the MAPK and PI3K pathways, which are important for tumor growth and metastasis (Ucar2012Disruption).

Additionally, IGF1R interacts with proteins containing SH2 and PTB domains, which are recruited to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the receptor. These interactions are essential for signal transduction and are more prevalent with physiological peptides compared to nonphysiological ones (Kaushansky2008A). The receptor's interaction with these proteins is crucial for defining signaling specificity and cellular responses (Kaushansky2008A).
