# SLC29A3

## Overview
The SLC29A3 gene encodes the protein known as solute carrier family 29 member 3 (hENT3), which is a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. This protein is characterized by its role as a transmembrane transporter, facilitating the movement of nucleosides, nucleobases, and nucleotide analogs across cellular membranes, particularly within lysosomes and mitochondria (AlHaggar2014Novel; Riachi2019A). hENT3 is integral to maintaining nucleoside homeostasis and is involved in various cellular processes, including the nucleoside salvage pathway and energy metabolism (Morgan2010Mutations). Mutations in the SLC29A3 gene are linked to a range of genetic disorders, collectively referred to as SLC29A3 spectrum disorders, which include H syndrome and other related conditions (Morgan2010Mutations; Çağdaş2020Autoinflammation). These disorders are characterized by defects in lysosomal and mitochondrial function, underscoring the critical role of hENT3 in cellular homeostasis and immune function (Çağdaş2020Autoinflammation).

## Structure
The SLC29A3 gene encodes the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 (hENT3), a protein that is part of the ENT family of nucleoside transporters. hENT3 is a 475-amino acid protein characterized by 11 transmembrane alpha helices, with a cytoplasmic N terminus and an extracellular C terminus (Çağdaş2020Autoinflammation; Riachi2019A). The protein is localized in late endosomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria, where it functions as a transporter of nucleosides, nucleobases, and nucleotide analogs across lysosomal membranes to the cytoplasm, and across the inner mitochondrial membrane (AlHaggar2014Novel; Riachi2019A).

The secondary structure of hENT3 includes alpha helices and beta strands, contributing to its role in maintaining nucleoside homeostasis (Askari2019Structural). The protein's tertiary structure is predicted to include a folded globular anti-parallel beta sheet and an unstructured helix, as visualized using PyMOL software (Askari2019Structural). The transmembrane topology of hENT3 has been confirmed using the CCTOP method, which supports the presence of these structural features (Askari2019Structural).

Mutations in the SLC29A3 gene can lead to structural changes that affect the protein's function, such as impairing nucleoside binding due to amino acid substitutions (Askari2019Structural). These mutations are associated with various genetic disorders, including H syndrome (Askari2019Structural).

## Function
The SLC29A3 gene encodes the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 (ENT3), which is crucial for the transport of nucleosides and nucleobases across cellular membranes. ENT3 is primarily localized to the mitochondria, late endosomes, and lysosomes, where it facilitates the translocation of hydrophilic nucleosides. This function is essential for maintaining a cytoplasmic pool of nucleosides, which supports various cellular processes, including the nucleoside salvage pathway and the generation of ATP and GTP for energy metabolism and signal transduction pathways (Morgan2010Mutations; Nair2019Adult).

In healthy human cells, ENT3 plays a significant role in lysosomal homeostasis and macrophage biology. It is involved in regulating salvage DNA synthesis and purinergic signaling, which are critical for proper cellular function. ENT3's activity is vital for preventing the accumulation of nucleosides within lysosomes, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing immune activation (Shibata2019Nucleosides; Nair2019Adult).

ENT3 also influences autophagy by mobilizing lysosomal adenosine pools, which regulate the AMPK-mTOR-ULK signaling pathway. This regulation is crucial for autophagy, stem cell differentiation, and tissue maintenance, highlighting ENT3's role in cellular and tissue homeostasis (Nair2019Adult).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC29A3 gene, which encodes the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 (hENT3), are associated with a spectrum of rare autosomal recessive disorders collectively known as SLC29A3 spectrum disorders. These include H syndrome, Faisalabad histiocytosis, familial Rosai-Dorfman disease, and pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus syndrome (PHID) (Morgan2010Mutations; Çağdaş2020Autoinflammation; Noavar2019A).

H syndrome is characterized by systemic autoinflammatory symptoms such as recurrent febrile attacks, hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, deafness, diabetes, and short stature (Çağdaş2020Autoinflammation). Faisalabad histiocytosis presents with joint deformities, sensorineural hearing loss, and generalized lymphadenopathy (Morgan2010Mutations). Familial Rosai-Dorfman disease is marked by painless lymphadenopathy and specific lymph node histology (Morgan2010Mutations). PHID syndrome involves pigmented hypertrichotic skin lesions and a high risk of diabetes (Morgan2010Mutations).

These disorders are linked to defects in lysosomal and mitochondrial function, leading to altered nucleoside transport and increased lysosomal pH, which can activate inflammation-associated pathways and result in defects in adaptive immunity (Çağdaş2020Autoinflammation). The phenotypic variability among these conditions suggests the involvement of genetic and environmental modifiers (Morgan2010Mutations).

## Interactions
The SLC29A3 gene encodes the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 (ENT3), which is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. ENT3 interacts with proteins such as STX11, UNC13D, and STXBP2, which are involved in protein transport and exocytosis, potentially affecting antigen presentation and T lymphocyte cytotoxicity (Çağdaş2020Autoinflammation). The STRING database analysis identified several first shell interactors of SLC29A3, including SLC29A2, SLC29A1, SLC28A3, SLC28A2, SLC28A1, CD63, CLINT1, VTI1B, OSTM1, and SLC47A1, with SLC29A2 having the highest interaction score of 0.925 (Rezaie2024A). These interactions suggest a role in nucleoside transport and cellular metabolism.

ENT3 is also implicated in the regulation of the AMPK-mTOR-ULK signaling pathway, which is crucial for autophagy and stem cell function. Disruption of ENT3 affects lysosomal adenosine transport, leading to autophagic insufficiency and stem cell exhaustion (Nair2019Adult). The protein's role in lysosomal homeostasis and macrophage biology further underscores its importance in immune function and cellular integrity (Nair2019Adult). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SLC29A3 in cellular processes and its potential impact on various genetic disorders.
