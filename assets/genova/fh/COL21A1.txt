# COL21A1

## Overview
The COL21A1 gene encodes the collagen type XXI alpha 1 chain, a protein that belongs to the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. This protein is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), contributing to the structural integrity and organization of various tissues, including the heart, stomach, kidney, skeletal muscle, and placenta. It plays a significant role in linking fibrillar collagen to other matrix elements, which is essential for maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating processes such as cell adhesion and tissue repair (Paco2013Gene; MISAWA2013Prognostic). The COL21A1 gene has been implicated in several medical conditions, including nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate, aortic dissection, and dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological functions and disease pathogenesis (Li2016Variants; D’Agostino2022WholeExome; Mohamad2019Two).

## Function
The COL21A1 gene encodes collagen type XXI alpha 1 chain, a member of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. This protein is an integral component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. It is localized in various tissues, including the heart, stomach, kidney, skeletal muscle, and placenta, where it contributes to the structural framework of blood vessel walls (MISAWA2013Prognostic).

Collagen type XXI interacts with other ECM components, linking fibrillar collagen to other matrix elements, which is crucial for ECM organization and tissue integrity (Paco2013Gene). This interaction plays a significant role in cell adhesion, tissue repair, and development, particularly in connective tissues. The protein's involvement in ECM remodeling is highlighted in conditions like Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, where its upregulation may serve as a compensatory mechanism in response to collagen VI deficiency (Paco2013Gene).

In healthy human cells, COL21A1 contributes to the maintenance of the ECM's structural integrity, ensuring proper tissue function and resilience. Its role in linking different ECM components underscores its importance in maintaining the mechanical properties and stability of various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the COL21A1 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. In the context of nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCLP), a study identified a potential association between reduced copy number of COL21A1 and the condition in a specific Malay family. The mean copy number of COL21A1 in affected individuals was significantly lower than in controls, suggesting a correlation between this genetic variation and NSCLP, although direct evidence of causative mutations was not established (Mohamad2019Two).

In the realm of cardiovascular diseases, COL21A1 has been linked to aortic dissection (AD). Research identified pathogenic variants in collagen genes, including COL21A1, which may contribute to the risk of developing AD. These findings highlight the role of collagen gene variants in the structural integrity of the aorta (Li2016Variants).

Additionally, COL21A1 has been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) through its involvement in extracellular matrix organization and remodeling. The gene was part of a top-ranked gene set linked to DCM, emphasizing its potential role in the pathogenesis of this condition (D’Agostino2022WholeExome).
