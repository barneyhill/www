# TBC1D10A

## Overview
TBC1D10A is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 10A, which is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. The protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of exosome secretion and angiogenesis. TBC1D10A exerts its function primarily through its interaction with Rab GTPases, such as Rab35, influencing endocytic recycling and exosome biogenesis (Xie2019Regulation; Hsu2010Regulation). Additionally, TBC1D10A is implicated in the modulation of VEGFR2 trafficking and signaling, which is crucial for endothelial cell function and angiogenesis (Xie2019Regulation). Through its interactions with other small GTPases like Arf6 and Rab27A, TBC1D10A also contributes to the regulation of microvillar structure and actin dynamics (Fukuda2011TBC). These multifaceted roles underscore the importance of TBC1D10A in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating complex signaling pathways.

## Function
TBC1D10A, a member of the TBC1 domain family, functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases, playing a crucial role in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. In endothelial cells, TBC1D10A is involved in the regulation of VEGFR2 trafficking and signaling, which is essential for angiogenesis. It enhances the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Y1175 and PLCγ, and is associated with increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2, facilitating normal p38 signaling and tube formation. TBC1D10A colocalizes with VEGFR2 on the membranes of filopodia, suggesting its role in facilitating VEGFR2 transport and signaling, thereby contributing to angiogenesis (Xie2019Regulation).

TBC1D10A also regulates exosome secretion through its GAP activity on Rab35. In oligodendroglial cells, TBC1D10A, along with TBC1D10B and TBC1D10C, modulates exosome release by affecting the accumulation of endosomal vesicles. This regulation is crucial for processes like intercellular signaling and protein turnover (Hsu2010Regulation). TBC1D10A's activity is specific to Rab35, highlighting its role in the endocytic recycling pathway and exosome biogenesis (Hsu2010Regulation). These functions underscore TBC1D10A's importance in cellular signaling and homeostasis.

## Interactions
TBC1D10A, also known as EPI64, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Rab35, a small GTPase, and acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab35, regulating exosome secretion and Weibel-Palade body (WPB) exocytosis in endothelial cells. This interaction is crucial for controlling the docking and tethering of endocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane, which is essential for exosome release (Hsu2010Regulation; Biesemann2017Rab35).

TBC1D10A also interacts with Arf6, another small GTPase, through its TBC domain, playing a role in regulating microvillar structure (Fukuda2011TBC). It has been shown to bind GTP-Arf6, indicating its involvement in cellular structural regulation.

In addition to its interactions with Rab35 and Arf6, TBC1D10A has been implicated in the regulation of actin-based melanosome transport by interacting with Rab27A. Overexpression of TBC1D10A in melanocytes inhibits this transport, highlighting its role in actin dynamics (Fukuda2011TBC).

TBC1D10A's interactions extend to its involvement in autophagy, where it indirectly affects Rab7b localization, although it does not directly regulate Rab7b's GTPase activity (Borg2018TBC1D5).
