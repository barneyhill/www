# MYPOP

## Overview
The MYPOP gene encodes the Myb-related transcription factor, partner of profilin, a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation and cellular immunity. MYPOP functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, contrasting with the proto-oncogene MYB, by interacting with nuclear actin and the histone variant H2A.Z to modulate chromatin structure and gene expression (Florin2024The). It plays a crucial role in restricting the early gene expression of oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV), particularly types 16 and 18, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor and contributing to intrinsic cellular immunity (Wüstenhagen2018The). MYPOP's interactions with proteins such as profilin and the HPV16 L2 protein underscore its involvement in cellular processes like chromatin remodeling and viral restriction (Wüstenhagen2018The; Lederer2005Profilin). The gene's downregulation is associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Wüstenhagen2018The; Florin2024The).

## Function
The MYPOP protein functions as a transcriptional regulator in healthy human cells, primarily by repressing the transcriptional expression of the MYB-recognition element (MRE). This activity contrasts with the proto-oncogene MYB, which typically induces transcriptional expression. MYPOP interacts with nuclear actin and the histone variant H2A.Z, both of which are involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair processes (Florin2024The). 

MYPOP is also known to interact with the minor capsid protein L2 and the viral DNA of oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV), particularly types 16 and 18. It silences early promoter activity and early gene expression of these HPV types, acting as a restriction factor. This suggests a role in intrinsic cellular immunity and tumor suppression by restricting HPV early gene expression (Wüstenhagen2018The).

In terms of cellular localization, MYPOP is active in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with α-tubulin or condensed chromatin. This nuclear activity is associated with its role in regulating the cell cycle and inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as evidenced by morphological changes such as nuclear shrinkage and fragmentation (Florin2024The).

## Clinical Significance
The MYPOP gene has been identified as a significant factor in cancer biology, particularly in its role as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in MYPOP expression levels are associated with various cancers, including cervical cancer and other HPV-related malignancies. In HPV-transformed cervical cancer cell lines, MYPOP levels are notably reduced compared to normal cells, suggesting that its downregulation may facilitate tumor progression (Wüstenhagen2018The; Florin2024The). This reduction is attributed to the action of the HPV16 oncoprotein E7, which decreases MYPOP expression, while the E6 protein does not have this effect (Wüstenhagen2018The).

MYPOP acts as a restriction factor for oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18 by binding to the viral DNA and repressing the expression of viral oncogenes E6 and E7, which are crucial for HPV-induced oncogenesis (Wüstenhagen2018The; Florin2024The). The gene's tumor-suppressive properties are further supported by its ability to downregulate oncogenes such as MYC and induce tumor-suppressive cytokines like interleukin-24, leading to reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (Florin2024The). These findings highlight MYPOP's potential as a target for anti-cancer therapies.

## Interactions
MYPOP, a Myb-related transcription factor, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and viral restriction. MYPOP was identified as an interaction partner of the HPV16 L2 protein through a yeast two-hybrid screening approach. This interaction was confirmed through co-localization and interaction analyses, demonstrating that MYPOP associates with the incoming virally transduced DNA in the nucleus of infected cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that MYPOP binds to the long control region (LCR) of the HPV genome, with this binding enhanced in the presence of L2, suggesting a role in modulating viral gene expression (Wüstenhagen2018The).

MYPOP also interacts with profilin, an actin-binding protein. Profilin binds to the monomeric form of MYPOP, but not to its dimers. This interaction increases profilin's nuclear concentration, dependent on the proline cluster motif of MYPOP (Lederer2005Profilin). MYPOP forms physical complexes with nuclear actin and the histone variant H2A.Z, which are involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair (Florin2024The). These interactions highlight MYPOP's role in transcriptional repression and its potential as a tumor suppressor by modulating oncogene expression and inducing tumor-suppressive cytokines (Florin2024The).
