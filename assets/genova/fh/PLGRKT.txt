# PLGRKT

## Overview
PLGRKT is a gene that encodes the plasminogen receptor with a C-terminal lysine, known as Plg-R KT, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of plasminogen activation on the cell surface. This receptor plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including fibrinolysis, tissue remodeling, and inflammatory responses. Plg-R KT facilitates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, an enzyme crucial for degrading fibrin clots and other proteins, by exposing a C-terminal lysine that binds plasminogen. The protein is widely expressed across different tissues, including neuroendocrine and epithelial tissues, and is involved in interactions with other proteins such as the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) to enhance plasminogen activation. Alterations in PLGRKT expression have been linked to pathological conditions such as cancer and impaired wound healing, underscoring its clinical significance (Miles2020Functions; Schramek2024Aneuploidy; Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased).

## Structure
The PLGRKT gene encodes the Plg-R KT protein, a plasminogen receptor with a unique molecular structure. The primary sequence of Plg-R KT is highly conserved across species, with no polymorphisms identified in the six exons of the gene located on chromosome 9p24.1 (Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased). The protein consists of 147 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 17,261 Da (Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased).

Plg-R KT is predicted to have two transmembrane helices. The first helix extends from residues F53 to L73, and the second from P78 to Y99. These helices are oriented such that the primary helix spans from inside the cell to outside, while the secondary helix spans from outside to inside (Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased). Between these helices, a highly positively charged loop (residues 74-77) is conserved across mammalian orthologs, supporting the model of the N-terminus being outside the cell (Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased).

The C-terminal lysine of Plg-R KT is exposed on the cell surface and is crucial for its function in plasminogen binding and activation (Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased). This structural feature allows Plg-R KT to promote plasminogen activation without the need for proteolytic cleavage (Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased).

## Function
PLGRKT, or plasminogen receptor with a C-terminal lysine, plays a crucial role in the regulation of plasminogen activation on the cell surface, which is essential for processes such as fibrinolysis and tissue remodeling. This receptor is an integral membrane protein that exposes a C-terminal lysine, facilitating the binding and activation of plasminogen to plasmin, an enzyme that degrades fibrin clots and other proteins (Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased). 

PLGRKT is broadly distributed across various tissues, including neuroendocrine tissues, brain, spleen, lymph nodes, vasculature, and prominently in epithelial tissues such as the kidney, breast, lung, intestine, and colon. It is expressed in lymphocytes, peripheral blood monocytes, and endothelial cells, with lower expression in neutrophils and no detectable expression in red blood cells (Miles2020Functions). 

The receptor is involved in promoting plasminogen activation by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), enhancing cellular invasion through the extracellular matrix, chemotaxis, and macrophage recruitment in inflammatory responses (Parmer2013Plasminogen). PLGRKT also plays a role in macrophage migration and recruitment during inflammation, impacting processes such as wound healing and tissue remodeling (Lighvani2011Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLGRKT gene have been implicated in various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer and wound healing. In cancer, PLGRKT is identified as an oncogene that accelerates tumorigenesis in breast and skin cancers. Overexpression of PLGRKT leads to rapid development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and mammary tumors in mice, suggesting its significant role in cancer progression (Schramek2024Aneuploidy). The gene's oncogenic potential is linked to mitochondrial reprogramming, promoting stress-resistant mitochondria and enhancing cell survival under stress conditions (Schramek2024Aneuploidy). In breast cancer, high PLGRKT expression is associated with increased extracellular matrix remodeling, contributing to tumor progression (Schramek2024Aneuploidy).

In the context of wound healing, PLGRKT plays a crucial role in plasminogen activation, which is essential for fibrinolysis and tissue remodeling. Deletion of the PLGRKT gene in mice results in delayed wound healing, impaired fibrin clearance, and altered cytokine expression, indicating its importance in the inflammatory and proliferation phases of wound healing (Ny2020The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PLGRKT in both cancer and wound healing processes.

## Interactions
The plasminogen receptor PLGRKT, also known as Plg-R KT, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins that facilitate its role in plasminogen activation. PLGRKT directly binds to plasminogen through its C-terminal lysine, a critical interaction that promotes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin on the cell surface (Miles2012The; Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased). This interaction is inhibited by the lysine analog EACA, highlighting the importance of the lysine residue in binding (Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased).

PLGRKT also colocalizes and interacts with the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) on the cell surface, enhancing plasminogen activation (Miles2012The; Andronicos2010Proteomicsbased). This colocalization suggests a cooperative role in promoting plasminogen activation, which is crucial for processes like cell migration and invasion (Miles2012The).

In addition to its interactions with plasminogen and uPAR, PLGRKT is involved in the uptake of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], acting as the primary receptor for its internalization. This process is independent of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), indicating a unique role for PLGRKT in Lp(a) uptake (Sharma2017Recycling).
