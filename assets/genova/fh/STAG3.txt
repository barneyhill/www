# STAG3

## Overview
STAG3 is a gene that encodes a protein component of the cohesin complex, specifically involved in meiosis. The STAG3 protein, categorized as a cohesin complex component, plays a critical role in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion, facilitating proper chromosome segregation, synapsis, and DNA repair during meiosis. This function is essential for fertility and genomic stability, as it ensures the accurate distribution of genetic material to gametes. The STAG3 protein is characterized by conserved domains, such as the stromalin conservative domain, which are crucial for its interactions with other cohesin components like SMC1b, RAD21L, and REC8. Mutations in the STAG3 gene are linked to reproductive disorders, including primary ovarian insufficiency in females and non-obstructive azoospermia in males, highlighting its significance in human reproductive health (Jaillard2020STAG3; van2019Mutations; Hopkins2014MeiosisSpecific).

## Structure
The STAG3 protein is a component of the cohesin complex, essential for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. Its primary structure includes a series of conserved domains, such as the stromalin conservative domain (SCD), which is crucial for its function in chromatid cohesion and DNA repair (Hopkins2014MeiosisSpecific). The secondary structure of STAG3 isoforms shows approximately 74% similarity with the crystal structure of human stromal antigen 2 (SA2) in complex with sister chromatid cohesion protein 1 (SCC1), as predicted by Phyre2 software (Lafta2020Characterization). This suggests the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of cohesin components.

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional unit, allowing STAG3 to interact with other cohesin components. In terms of quaternary structure, STAG3 interacts with other proteins in the cohesin complex, such as SMC1b, RAD21L, and REC8, to maintain chromatid cohesion and facilitate DNA repair and synapsis between homologous chromosomes (Hopkins2014MeiosisSpecific).

STAG3 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its function. The protein also exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with each isoform characterized by distinct molecular weights and amino acid compositions (Lafta2020Characterization).

## Function
The STAG3 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the meiosis-specific cohesin complex, which is essential for maintaining centromere chromatid cohesion during meiosis. This cohesion is crucial for proper chromosome segregation, synapsis between homologous chromosomes, and DNA repair processes during meiosis (Hopkins2014MeiosisSpecific). In healthy human cells, STAG3 is expressed in the seminiferous tubules, particularly in the nucleus of spermatogonia and spermatocytes, indicating its role in spermatogenesis and the progression of spermatogenesis beyond the spermatocyte stage (Jaillard2020STAG3).

STAG3 is involved in the formation of the synaptonemal complex, a structure necessary for the synapsis of homologous chromosomes, which is essential for successful meiosis and fertility (van2019Mutations). The protein contains a STAG domain and a stromalin conservative domain (SCD), which includes armadillo repeats suitable for binding large substrates such as proteins and nucleic acids, facilitating interactions with other molecules (Jaillard2020STAG3). STAG3's function is critical for maintaining chromosomal integrity and ensuring proper chromosomal behavior during meiosis, which is vital for fertility and genomic stability (Hopkins2014MeiosisSpecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STAG3 gene are associated with several reproductive disorders, primarily affecting fertility. In females, biallelic variants in STAG3 are linked to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by early loss of ovarian function, leading to infertility, primary amenorrhea, and undeveloped secondary sex characteristics. Patients with high-impact deleterious variants often present with streak gonads, a significant feature of POI (Jaillard2020STAG3; He2017Whole‐exome). In males, STAG3 mutations can result in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), characterized by meiotic arrest and failure in spermatogenesis, due to issues such as shortening of chromosome axial elements and loss of centromeric cohesion (Jaillard2020STAG3; RieraEscamilla2019Sequencing).

STAG3 mutations have been identified in both consanguineous and non-consanguineous families, with various types of mutations, including missense, splice-site, and in-frame variants, contributing to these conditions (Xiao2019InFrame; He2017Whole‐exome). The gene's role in meiosis is crucial, as it is involved in chromosome pairing, synapsis, and segregation, and its dysfunction can lead to infertility in both sexes (van2019Mutations; Mellone2021A). The presence of STAG3-like genes complicates the detection of variants, necessitating careful genetic analysis (Jaillard2020STAG3).

## Interactions
STAG3 is a meiosis-specific cohesin component that plays a crucial role in maintaining chromatid cohesion and facilitating DNA repair and synapsis between homologous chromosomes. It interacts with other meiosis-specific cohesin subunits, including SMC1b, REC8, and RAD21L, to form cohesin complexes essential for chromosome structure and segregation during meiosis (Hopkins2014MeiosisSpecific). STAG3 is unique in that it is present in all meiosis-specific cohesin complexes, and its absence leads to the destabilization of these complexes, resulting in impaired chromosomal functions (Hopkins2014MeiosisSpecific).

In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), STAG3 interacts with REC8 and SMC3, forming a cohesin complex that is involved in chromosome organization and sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear localization and stabilization of REC8, indicating that STAG3 plays a role in the translocation of REC8 into the nucleus (Choi2022Meiosisspecific). STAG3 also interacts with proteins involved in mRNA regulation, such as DDX6 and TNRC6C, suggesting a role in post-transcriptional mRNA regulation in the cytoplasm of mouse embryonic stem cells (Weeks2024STAG3).
