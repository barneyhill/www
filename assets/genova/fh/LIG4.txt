# LIG4

## Overview
LIG4 is a gene that encodes the protein DNA ligase IV, a critical enzyme involved in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. DNA ligase IV is categorized as a ligase, a type of enzyme that facilitates the joining of DNA strands by catalyzing the formation of phosphodiester bonds. The protein functions in concert with XRCC4 and other factors to ensure the accurate repair of DNA breaks, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis (O’Driscoll2001DNA; Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic). LIG4 is also implicated in V(D)J recombination, a process vital for the development of the immune system, although its primary role is in NHEJ (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic). Mutations in the LIG4 gene can lead to various clinical conditions, including LIG4 syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), highlighting its importance in human health (Toita2007Epstein–Barr; Buck2005Severe).

## Structure
DNA ligase IV (LIG4) is a crucial enzyme in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, responsible for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. The primary structure of LIG4 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which includes several key domains. The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets that contribute to its functional conformation (Kaminski2018Structures).

The tertiary structure of LIG4 includes a catalytic core with three subdomains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the nucleotidyltransferase domain (NTD), and the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold (OBD). These subdomains are essential for DNA binding and catalysis, with the DBD and NTD primarily mediating DNA interactions, while the OBD undergoes conformational changes to encircle the DNA during the ligation process (Kaminski2018Structures).

In its quaternary structure, LIG4 forms a complex with XRCC4, which is critical for its function in DNA repair. This complex facilitates the alignment and ligation of DNA ends during NHEJ (Stinson2022Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate LIG4's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned in the context.

## Function
DNA ligase IV (LIG4) is a crucial enzyme in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is a major mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks in human cells. LIG4 functions by forming a complex with XRCC4, which is essential for the final ligation step in the NHEJ process, ensuring genomic stability and preventing potential tumorigenesis (O’Driscoll2001DNA; Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic). This complex also interacts with Ku proteins and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), facilitating the end-bridging and processing of DNA ends (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic).

LIG4 is also involved in V(D)J recombination, a process critical for the development of the immune system, although its reduced activity has a more pronounced effect on NHEJ than on V(D)J recombination (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic). In the absence of LIG4, the fidelity and efficiency of DNA end joining are significantly impaired, leading to genomic instability and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (Smith2003Impact; Mills2004Rad54). LIG4 is active in the nucleus, where it plays a dual role in both ligation and protection of DNA ends, which is critical for maintaining genomic stability (Smith2003Impact).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LIG4 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in DNA double-strand break repair via the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. LIG4 syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by immunodeficiency, developmental delay, microcephaly, and increased cancer risk, including leukemia and lymphoma (Toita2007Epstein–Barr; Ben‐Omran2005A). Patients with LIG4 syndrome often exhibit features similar to Nijmegen breakage syndrome, such as chromosomal instability and radiosensitivity (Ben‐Omran2005A).

Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is another condition linked to LIG4 mutations. Patients with SCID due to LIG4 mutations typically present with a lack of mature B and T cells, while NK cells remain present. This immunodeficiency is often accompanied by microcephaly and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (van2005A; Buck2005Severe). The mutations can lead to impaired V(D)J recombination, crucial for lymphocyte development, resulting in profound lymphocytopenia (van2005A; Buck2005Severe).

Different mutations in LIG4 can result in varying clinical presentations, from developmental defects with minor immunological issues to severe immunodeficiency with normal development (van2005A). Hypomorphic mutations, which result in partial loss of function, are often associated with milder phenotypes compared to null mutations (Buck2005Severe).

## Interactions
DNA ligase IV (LIG4) is a crucial enzyme in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, interacting with several proteins to facilitate DNA double-strand break repair. LIG4 forms a stable complex with XRCC4, which is essential for its ligation activity. This interaction is critical for the recruitment of the XRCC4-LIG4 complex to DNA breaks, a process facilitated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex, which includes Ku70/Ku80 and DNA-PKcs (Ahnesorg2006XLF; Drouet2005DNAdependent).

LIG4 also interacts with the XRCC4-like factor (XLF), which is important for the NHEJ process. XLF binds to the DNA-binding domain of XRCC4, potentially modulating DNA recognition by XRCC4 (Jayaram2008Loss). The presence of LIG4 is necessary for the DNA binding activity of the XRCC4/XLF complex, as its absence leads to a loss of DNA binding by these proteins (Jayaram2008Loss).

Additionally, LIG4 is recruited to DNA ends by Ku proteins, and this recruitment requires the adenylation of LIG4. The interaction between LIG4 and Ku is crucial for the formation of a DNA-adenylate complex, which is necessary for efficient DNA repair (Kysela2003Ku).
