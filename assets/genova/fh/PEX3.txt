# PEX3

## Overview
PEX3 is a gene that encodes the protein peroxisomal biogenesis factor 3, which is integral to the formation and maintenance of peroxisomes in human cells. The PEX3 protein is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in peroxisome biogenesis by facilitating the import of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) and interacting with other proteins involved in peroxisomal assembly. It is initially targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum before being incorporated into peroxisomes, where it serves as a docking factor for PEX19, a cytosolic chaperone and import receptor. This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly of peroxisomal membrane complexes, which are essential for cellular lipid metabolism and detoxification processes (Schmidt2010Insights; Ghaedi2000The). Mutations in the PEX3 gene are linked to peroxisome biogenesis disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Shimozawa2000Identification; Kochaj2022The).

## Structure
The PEX3 protein is integral to the peroxisomal membrane and plays a crucial role in peroxisome biogenesis. Its molecular structure includes a single transmembrane domain, with the N-terminus located inside the peroxisome and the C-terminus extending into the cytoplasm (Soukupova1999Identification). The primary structure of PEX3 includes specific hydrophobic regions, with the N-terminal 45 amino acids being essential for its targeting to peroxisomes via the endoplasmic reticulum (Fakieh2013IntraER).

The secondary structure of PEX3 features a twisted six-helix bundle, forming a prolate spheroidal shape. This structure is characterized by hydrophobic interactions, particularly around the central helical unit, a2, which is shielded from the solvent (Sato2010Structural). The tertiary structure involves the cytosolic domain of PEX3, which can bind to membrane lipids, suggesting a role in perturbing the peroxisomal lipid bilayer to facilitate the insertion of peroxisomal membrane proteins (Pinto2009The).

PEX3 interacts with Pex19p, forming a complex that is crucial for peroxisome biogenesis. The Pex19p peptide binds to PEX3 at one of its apexes, forming a left-handed four-helix bundle with PEX3's surface (Sato2010Structural). The interaction is highly specific, involving complementary hydrophobic interfaces (Sato2010Structural).

## Function
The PEX3 gene encodes a protein that is integral to peroxisomal biogenesis, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of peroxisomes in human cells. PEX3 is involved in the early stages of peroxisome membrane assembly, facilitating the import of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) (Ghaedi2000The). The protein is initially targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before being incorporated into peroxisomes, a process essential for the formation of new peroxisomes (Toro2009Pex3p‐dependent). PEX3 interacts with PEX19, a cytosolic protein that recognizes and transports PMPs to the peroxisomal membrane, through a high-affinity binding site on its cytosolic domain (Schmidt2010Insights). This interaction is critical for the docking of PEX19 to the peroxisomal membrane, a necessary step in peroxisome formation (Schmidt2010Insights).

PEX3 is anchored in the peroxisomal membrane via a short hydrophobic transmembrane segment, with its N-terminus inside the peroxisome and the C-terminus facing the cytoplasm (Soukupova1999Identification). The protein's function is vital for cellular lipid metabolism and detoxification processes, as it ensures the proper assembly and function of peroxisomes, which are essential for these metabolic activities (Fakieh2013IntraER).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX3 gene are associated with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), including Zellweger syndrome, which is part of the Zellweger spectrum disorders. These disorders are characterized by a range of symptoms such as severe hypotonia, developmental delays, seizures, liver dysfunction, and often early childhood death (Shimozawa2000Identification; Kochaj2022The). PEX3 mutations disrupt the proper localization of peroxisomal membrane proteins, leading to impaired peroxisome assembly and function (Shimozawa2000Identification).

A specific mutation, a 1 base insertion at position 544 (544insT), results in a premature termination codon, causing severe Zellweger syndrome with a lack of peroxisomal membrane structures (Shimozawa2000Identification). Another mutation, D347Y, leads to a milder phenotype of PBD, characterized by peroxisomal mosaicism and symptoms such as psychomotor regression and hearing impairment (Matsui2013Newly).

In mice, Pex3 mutations result in progressive hearing loss due to reduced plasmalogens in the inner ear, highlighting the gene's role in lipid metabolism and auditory function (Kochaj2022The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PEX3 in peroxisomal disorders and their diverse phenotypic presentations.

## Interactions
PEX3 is a key player in peroxisome biogenesis, primarily through its interactions with other proteins. It serves as a docking factor for PEX19, a cytosolic chaperone and import receptor, facilitating the import of class I peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). The interaction between PEX3 and PEX19 is crucial for the assembly and disassembly of PMP complexes on the peroxisomal membrane. PEX3 binds to PEX19 through a conserved 17-amino acid segment, and mutations in this region can disrupt their interaction, highlighting its importance for PEX3 function (Fang2004PEX3).

PEX3 also interacts with components of both the docking and translocation subcomplexes, such as Pex13p, Pex14p, Pex17p, Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p. These interactions suggest that PEX3 acts as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly of these complexes necessary for peroxisomal matrix protein import (Hazra2002Peroxisome). The interaction with PEX19 is distinct from other PMP interactions, as PEX19 can form ternary complexes with PMPs by anchoring to PEX3 (Fujiki2006Import). These interactions underscore the essential role of PEX3 in maintaining the structural integrity and functional interactions of peroxisomal subcomplexes.
