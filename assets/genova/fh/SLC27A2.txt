# SLC27A2

## Overview
SLC27A2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 27 member 2, also known as FATP2, which is a transmembrane protein involved in lipid metabolism. This protein functions as both a fatty acid transporter and a long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, playing a critical role in the uptake and activation of long-chain fatty acids. FATP2 is primarily localized in peroxisomes and mitochondria, where it facilitates the β-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids and contributes to the synthesis of complex lipids necessary for cellular functions (Korbecki2023Reduced). The activity of SLC27A2 is essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including energy production and cancer progression (Tao2022MYCNdriven; Zhang2024Risk).

## Function
SLC27A2 encodes a protein known as FATP2, which is a member of the solute carrier family involved in the transport and activation of long-chain fatty acids. In healthy human cells, SLC27A2 functions as both a fatty acid transporter and a long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and energy production. This protein is primarily active in peroxisomes and mitochondria, where it facilitates the β-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids, such as palmitic acid and lignoceric acid, and contributes to the synthesis of glycerophospholipids by incorporating arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Korbecki2023Reduced).

SLC27A2 is also involved in ceramide synthesis and is responsible for fatty acid uptake, which is essential for maintaining intracellular lipid homeostasis (Zhang2024Risk). The protein's activity in lipid metabolic processes is crucial for normal cellular function, as it regulates the uptake of external fatty acids and supports the synthesis of complex lipids necessary for cell membrane integrity and signaling pathways (Park2024SLC27A2as). Despite its significant roles in lipid metabolism, the expression of SLC27A2 in the brain is notably low, suggesting tissue-specific functions (Korbecki2023Reduced).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC27A2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. Low expression of SLC27A2 is associated with poor prognosis in several malignant tumors, including high-grade gliomas, cutaneous melanomas, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSQ). Tumors with low SLC27A2 expression exhibit poorer outcomes, and loss-of-function mutations in this gene correlate with worse prognoses (Kudo2024Unique). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SLC27A2 is significantly downregulated, and its low expression is linked to poor prognosis. Upregulation of SLC27A2 in ccRCC inhibits cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by affecting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway (Xu2022Upregulation).

In neuroblastoma, SLC27A2 is upregulated in MYCN-driven tumors, where it facilitates fatty acid uptake crucial for tumor growth. High expression of SLC27A2 correlates with poor clinical outcomes, and its inhibition impairs tumor growth, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target (Tao2022MYCNdriven). In breast cancer, SLC27A2 is upregulated and promotes tumor growth by affecting lipid and nucleotide metabolism. Knockdown of SLC27A2 in breast cancer cells suppresses proliferation and increases apoptosis (Zhang2024Risk). These findings highlight the gene's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SLC27A2, also known as FATP2, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its role in fatty acid metabolism. In hepatocytes, SLC27A2 interacts with the tetraspanin TM4SF5. This interaction is modulated by the presence of fatty acids, with SLC27A2 binding to TM4SF5 increasing after palmitic acid treatment. This interaction affects free fatty acid uptake and accumulation, suggesting that TM4SF5 regulates SLC27A2 in an inducible manner (Park2021Tetraspanin).

In colorectal cancer, SLC27A2 is associated with the PPARs pathway, particularly interacting with PPARG, a nuclear hormone receptor involved in lipid metabolism. This interaction is significant for the regulation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) metabolic genes and influences cancer progression (Shang2023SLC27A2).

SLC27A2 also plays a role in renal fibrogenesis, where it is involved in lipid droplet uptake and intracellular lipid aggregation. Inhibition of SLC27A2 has been shown to decrease lipotoxicity and alleviate renal fibrosis, indicating its interaction with pathways regulating lipid metabolism and fibrotic cytokine secretion (Chen2020Involvement). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SLC27A2 in different cellular contexts and diseases.
