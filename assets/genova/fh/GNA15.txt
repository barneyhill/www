# GNA15

## Overview
GNA15 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit alpha 15 (Gα15), a member of the Gαq subfamily of heterotrimeric G-proteins. These proteins are integral to signal transduction processes, facilitating communication between cell surface receptors and intracellular effectors. Gα15 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic and epithelial cells, with its expression levels varying during different stages of cell differentiation (Zanini2015GNA15). The protein is known for its ability to couple with a diverse array of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and it is unique in its resistance to desensitization by β-arrestin, allowing for prolonged signaling in response to chronic stimuli (Zanini2015GNA15). Gα15 plays a critical role in activating phospholipase Cβ isoforms, which are essential for regulating intracellular responses to external signals (Davignon1996Gene). The gene has clinical significance, particularly in the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its expression is associated with poor prognosis and potential oncogenic pathways (Innamorati2021Gα15).

## Function
The GNA15 gene encodes the Gα15 protein, a member of the Gαq subfamily of heterotrimeric G-proteins, which are involved in signal transduction processes. In healthy human cells, Gα15 is primarily expressed in specific cell types, such as hematopoietic and epithelial cells, particularly during certain stages of differentiation. Its expression is notably high in hematopoietic progenitor cells and decreases as these cells mature (Zanini2015GNA15). Gα15 is capable of coupling with a wide range of Gs, Gi, and Gq coupled receptors, and it is not effectively attenuated by β-arrestin dependent desensitization, suggesting that it can support sustained signaling in cells exposed to chronic stimuli (Zanini2015GNA15).

Gα15 plays a role in activating phospholipase Cβ isoforms, which are crucial for regulating intracellular responses to various stimuli (Davignon1996Gene). This protein is involved in signaling pathways that influence cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. In hematopoietic cells, Gα15's expression decreases as cells lose their proliferative capacity during differentiation (Zanini2015GNA15). The protein's ability to be activated by various receptors with different physiological functions may lead to unique signaling outcomes in these cells (Zanini2015GNA15).

## Clinical Significance
GNA15, encoding the G protein subunit alpha 15, has been implicated in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Although driver mutations in GNA15 are not commonly observed, its ectopic expression is significant in PDAC, where it can couple with various GPCRs to activate oncogenic pathways, including those involving Kras and PKD1 (Innamorati2021Gα15). Elevated GNA15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, contrasting with other Gα subunit genes like GNAL, GNAO1, and GNA14, which are linked to increased survival (Innamorati2021Gα15). The expression of GNA15 is linked to altered DNA methylation patterns, particularly hypomethylation in the 5′ promoter region, which facilitates its transcriptional activation during PDAC progression (Innamorati2021Gα15).

In PDAC, GNA15 expression correlates with the loss of SMAD4 expression and overexpression of S100A2, both significant prognostic markers (Innamorati2021Gα15). The study suggests that GNA15 could serve as a potential target for early diagnosis and treatment, as its expression is linked to the progression of PDAC during asymptomatic phases (Innamorati2021Gα15). Additionally, GNA15 is noted to be significantly mutated in certain melanoma subtypes, indicating a potential role in these cancers as well (O’Hayre2013The).
