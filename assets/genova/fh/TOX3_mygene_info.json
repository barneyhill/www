an HMG-box, indicating that it may be involved in bending and unwinding of DNA and alteration of chromatin structure. The C-terminus of the encoded protein is glutamine-rich due to CAG repeats in the coding sequence. A minor allele of this gene has been implicated in an elevated risk of breast cancer. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009].", "symbol": "TOX3", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1420847"}, "unigene": ["Hs.460789", "Hs.132574"], "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "O15405", "TrEMBL": ["H3BTZ9", "J3QQQ6"]}}
