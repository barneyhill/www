# THOC3

## Overview
THOC3 is a gene that encodes the protein THO complex subunit 3, a crucial component of the THO complex involved in mRNA processing and export. The THO complex is part of the larger TREX (transcription/export) complex, which plays a significant role in transcriptional elongation, mRNA maturation, and transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. THO complex subunit 3 is characterized by a β-propeller fold, which facilitates its interaction with other subunits, such as THOC2, contributing to the structural integrity of the THO-UAP56 tetramer (PachecoFiallos2023mRNA; Pühringer2020Structure). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA modification, splicing, and nuclear export, and is essential for maintaining genome stability and proper gene expression regulation (Yu2023THOC3; Zhang2024A). THOC3's interactions with other proteins, such as YBX1, are particularly significant in the context of cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and mRNA stabilization (Yu2023THOC3).

## Structure
THOC3 is a component of the human THO complex, which plays a crucial role in mRNA processing and export. Structurally, THOC3 is characterized by a β-propeller fold, which is integral to its function within the THO complex. This β-propeller structure allows THOC3 to make stabilizing contacts with the THOC2 subunit, specifically interacting with the THOC2 'bow' loop, contributing to the structural integrity and assembly of the THO-UAP56 tetramer (PachecoFiallos2023mRNA; Pühringer2020Structure).

The THO complex, including THOC3, forms part of a larger tetrameric assembly within the THO-UAP56 complex, which consists of two asymmetric dimers. Each dimer contains two seven-subunit monomers, highlighting the quaternary structure of THOC3 as part of this multimeric complex (PachecoFiallos2023mRNA; Pühringer2020Structure).

THOC3 is also involved in interactions with other proteins, such as YBX1, which is implicated in mRNA stabilization. This interaction is significant in the context of lung squamous cell carcinoma, where THOC3 is associated with tumor progression and mRNA modification processes (Yu2023THOC3). However, specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variants of THOC3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
THOC3 is a component of the THO complex, which is part of the TREX (transcription/export) complex involved in mRNA processing and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It plays a crucial role in transcriptional elongation and maintaining genome stability. THOC3 is active in the nucleus, facilitating efficient mRNA maturation and transport, impacting gene expression regulation. The THO complex, including THOC3, is integral to transcription, mRNA processing, export, DNA damage prevention, embryonic development, and cell differentiation in specific adult tissues (Zhang2024A). THOC3 is involved in RNA modification, splicing, elongation, and nuclear export of nascent RNA (Yu2023THOC3). It is a highly conserved part of the TREX complex and plays a crucial regulatory role in splicing and recruitment during transcription, regulating RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (Zhang2024A). The THO complex, primarily comprising six subunits (THOC1~3 and THOC5~7), functions via the TREX complex within cells (Zhang2024A). THOC3's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and stability, although specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The THOC3 gene has been implicated in various cancers, particularly lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In LUSC, THOC3 is highly expressed and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and glycolysis through its interaction with YBX1 and the stabilization of PFKFB4 mRNA, a key regulator of glycolysis (Yu2023THOC3). Knockdown of THOC3 in LUSC cells results in reduced tumor growth and metastasis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Yu2023THOC3).

In LUAD, THOC3 expression is linked to poor overall survival and is associated with pro-oncogenic immune cell infiltration. It correlates with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, suggesting potential benefits from immunotherapy (Zhang2024A). THOC3 is also involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, contributing to its oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types (Zhang2024A).

Beyond cancer, THOC3's role in RNA processing and its interactions with RNA-binding proteins may serve as prognostic indicators in other diseases, such as glioblastoma (Zhang2024A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of THOC3 in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
THOC3, a component of the THO complex, is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate its role in mRNA processing and export. It interacts with other subunits of the THO complex, including THOC1, THOC2, THOC5, THOC6, and THOC7, forming a part of the larger TREX complex essential for mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Pühringer2020Structure). THOC3 specifically has a b-propeller structure that interacts with the THOC2 bow and MIF4G domains, contributing to the stabilization of the THO-UAP56 tetramer (Pühringer2020Structure).

In the context of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), THOC3 interacts with the TRiC complex, particularly with proteins such as CCT8 and CCT6A, which assist in its folding (Yu2023THOC3). THOC3 also binds to YBX1, a protein involved in mRNA stabilization, to promote the transcription and stabilization of PFKFB4 mRNA, a key player in glycolysis and cancer progression (Yu2023THOC3). This interaction is crucial for maintaining PFKFB4 mRNA stability and promoting its oncogenic effects in LUSC (Yu2023THOC3).
