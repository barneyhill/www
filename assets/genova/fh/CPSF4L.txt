# CPSF4L

## Overview
CPSF4L is a gene that encodes the protein cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4 like, which is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of pre-mRNA. This protein is part of the larger cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which plays a crucial role in the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA, a critical step in mRNA maturation and stability. The CPSF4L protein is categorized as a component of the RNA-binding protein family, which is essential for recognizing and binding to specific RNA sequences to facilitate the cleavage and polyadenylation process. This function is vital for the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
