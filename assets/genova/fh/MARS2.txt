# MARS2

## Overview
The MARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase 2, a critical enzyme within the family of mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-aaRSs). This enzyme is responsible for the aminoacylation of tRNA with methionine, a fundamental step in mitochondrial protein synthesis. MARS2 is nuclear-encoded and subsequently imported into mitochondria, where it plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of proteins essential for the oxidative phosphorylation system, particularly influencing the activity of mitochondrial complexes I and IV (Webb2015Novel). Proper functioning of MARS2 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial translation and energy production, impacting cellular respiration and metabolism (Diodato2014The). Mutations or dysregulation of MARS2 can lead to mitochondrial disorders and have been implicated in certain cancers, underscoring its significance in both health and disease (Konovalova2013Mitochondrial; Gu2021Increased).

## Function
The MARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme is responsible for covalently linking methionine to mitochondrial tRNA methionine, a key step in the initiation of mitochondrial translation (Webb2015Novel). MARS2 is a nuclear-encoded protein that is imported into mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in the synthesis of proteins necessary for the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, particularly affecting the activity of mitochondrial complexes I and IV (Webb2015Novel). These complexes are essential components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is critical for energy production in cells (Webb2015Novel).

In healthy human cells, MARS2 ensures the proper functioning of mitochondrial translation, which is distinct from cytosolic translation due to differences in the genetic code and mRNA structure (Diodato2014The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal mitochondrial function and energy production, impacting cellular respiration and overall cellular metabolism (Webb2015Novel). Dysfunction in MARS2 can lead to significant clinical outcomes, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal health (Webb2015Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MARS2 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders. One such condition is Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia with Leukoencephalopathy (ARSAL), characterized by cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, cerebellar and cortical atrophy, leucoencephalopathy, and thinning of the corpus callosum. The age of onset for ARSAL varies widely, from 2 to 59 years, and is linked to complex genomic rearrangements in MARS2, including gene duplication events that result in truncated or reduced levels of mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase (mtMetRS) in patient cells (Konovalova2013Mitochondrial).

Another disorder associated with MARS2 mutations involves compound heterozygous single nucleotide variants, leading to a distinct phenotype that includes global developmental delay, growth failure, hypotonia, sensorineural hearing loss, and pectus carinatum. These symptoms are evident at birth and worsen by late infancy. This condition is marked by decreased activities of mitochondrial complexes I and IV, indicating a mitochondrial translation defect (Webb2015Novel).

Alterations in MARS2 expression have also been implicated in gastric cancer, where increased expression is associated with the malignancy of cancer cells. Downregulation of MARS2 in gastric cancer cells reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as an oncogene in this context (Gu2021Increased).

## Interactions
MARS2, or methionyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial, is involved in the aminoacylation process, where it catalyzes the attachment of methionine to its corresponding tRNA. This interaction with tRNA is crucial for protein synthesis within mitochondria (Schwenzer2013Pathogenic). MARS2 is part of the broader family of mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-aaRSs), which are essential for mitochondrial translation and function (Schwenzer2013Pathogenic).

In the context of gastric cancer, MARS2 expression is influenced by interactions with lysine demethylase 5D (KDM5D) and microRNA-4661-5p. KDM5D acts as a transcriptional suppressor by demethylating H3K4me3, a modification that regulates MARS2 expression. The downregulation of KDM5D by miR-4661-5p leads to increased MARS2 expression, which is associated with enhanced malignant behaviors in gastric cancer cells (Gu2021Increased).

MARS2 is also implicated in mitochondrial disorders, where mutations can affect its function and stability. These mutations can lead to complex gene rearrangements, impacting mRNA stability and protein levels, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Diodato2014The; Schwenzer2013Pathogenic).
