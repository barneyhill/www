# ADGRF4

## Overview
ADGRF4, also known as GPR115, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F4, a member of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) family. This receptor is primarily involved in epidermal differentiation, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the skin by interacting with keratin filaments, particularly KRT1 and KRT10, in keratinocytes (Winkler2022The). The protein encoded by ADGRF4 is characterized by its intracellular localization and its involvement in cytoskeletal organization, independent of glycosylation status (Winkler2022The). Beyond its role in skin biology, ADGRF4 has been implicated in various diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and psoriasis, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions (YOON2020ADGRF4; Winkler2022The; Ding2023Relationship).

## Function
The ADGRF4 gene encodes the GPR115 protein, a member of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) family, which plays a significant role in epidermal differentiation. GPR115 is predominantly expressed in suprabasal, noncornified keratinocytes within the stratified epidermis, where it is associated with keratin filaments, particularly KRT1 and KRT10. This association is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the epidermis (Winkler2022The).

In healthy human cells, GPR115 is involved in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation. It is expressed intracellularly along keratin filaments, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal organization. The protein's expression is critical for the proper formation of differentiated epidermal layers, as evidenced by the reduced stratification and abrogation of KRT1 in GPR115 knockout models (Winkler2022The).

GPR115's intracellular localization and its interaction with keratins are independent of its glycosylation status, indicating that its function in epidermal differentiation is not reliant on post-translational modifications like glycosylation (Winkler2022The). This receptor's activity is essential for maintaining normal epidermal structure and function, highlighting its importance in skin biology (Winkler2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The ADGRF4 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ADGRF4 is highly expressed, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, and is associated with patient survival. Silencing ADGRF4 in lung cancer cells leads to significant changes in gene expression and reduces cell invasiveness, highlighting its role in cancer progression (YOON2020ADGRF4).

In Alzheimer's disease, genetic variations in ADGRF4, such as the heterozygote AG at rs1109581, have been linked to increased disease risk in individuals who do not carry the APOE 4 allele. This suggests a potential role for ADGRF4 in Alzheimer's pathogenesis, although the mechanisms remain to be fully understood (Ding2023Relationship).

ADGRF4 is also involved in skin conditions like psoriasis, where its expression is delayed in psoriatic skin, affecting epidermal differentiation and keratin expression. This indicates a role in skin pathology, particularly in conditions characterized by altered keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation (Winkler2022The).

In kidney-related conditions, ADGRF4 expression is significantly higher in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and is associated with increased microvessel density, suggesting a role in tumor growth and survival (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion).

## Interactions
ADGRF4, also known as GPR115, is an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor that interacts with cytoskeletal keratins, particularly KRT1 and KRT10, in keratinocytes. This interaction is suggested by the colocalization of GPR115 with these keratins, as observed through immunofluorescence and proximity ligation assays. GPR115 is found intracellularly, forming a filament-like pattern similar to that of cytoskeletal keratins, and is enriched at keratin filaments in suprabasal, noncornified keratinocytes. The periodic distribution of immunogold particles at intervals of approximately 48 nm suggests an association with the head or tail domains of KRT1 (Winkler2022The).

Despite its intracellular localization, GPR115's interaction with keratins does not depend on these proteins for its localization. The receptor is non-N-glycosylated in its endogenous form, and mutations affecting its glycosylation sites lead to a loss of membrane localization, indicating that glycosylation may influence its cellular distribution (Winkler2022The). The interaction between GPR115 and keratins is crucial for epidermal differentiation, as the deletion of ADGRF4 results in reduced keratinocyte stratification and a decrease in KRT1 expression, highlighting its role in regulating keratin expression and epidermal differentiation (Winkler2022The).
