# DCK

## Overview
Deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) is a gene that encodes the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase, a crucial component of the nucleotide salvage pathway in human cells. This enzyme is classified as a kinase due to its role in phosphorylating deoxynucleosides, such as deoxycytidine, deoxyadenosine, and deoxyguanosine, converting them into their monophosphate forms, which are vital for DNA synthesis and repair (Sabini2003Structure; Chen1995Characterization). DCK is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining the balance of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, particularly in rapidly dividing cells (Sabini2003Structure). The enzyme's activity is regulated by various transcription factors and is implicated in the cellular response to nucleoside analogs used in chemotherapy, making it a significant focus in cancer research and treatment (Sabini2003Structure; Chen1995Characterization).

## Structure
The human deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) is a homodimeric enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 30.5 kDa, consisting of 260 amino acids (Sabini2003Structure; DevilleBonne2010Human). Each monomer of DCK features a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by ten α-helices, forming an α/β domain (Sabini2003Structure; DevilleBonne2010Human). The dimer interface is characterized by a four-helix bundle composed of helices α4 and α7 from each monomer (Sabini2003Structure).

DCK contains several conserved sequence motifs crucial for its function: the P-loop motif, which binds the phosphates of ATP; the Glu-Arg-Ser (ERS) motif, where glutamate contributes to Mg2+ binding and arginine plays a catalytic role; and the LID domain, which closes onto the bound phosphoryl donor and participates in ATP binding and catalysis (Sabini2003Structure; DevilleBonne2010Human). The enzyme's substrate specificity is influenced by structural features such as a 15-residue insert between helices α2 and α3, which is suggested to play a role in substrate specificity (Sabini2003Structure).

DCK does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics but exhibits bimodal kinetics, with a relatively low catalytic efficiency on its natural substrate, deoxycytidine (DevilleBonne2010Human). The enzyme's ability to phosphorylate both D- and L-nucleosides is attributed to its structural adaptability, allowing it to accommodate substrates with different chiral configurations (Sabini2006Structural).

## Function
Deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the salvage pathway of nucleotide synthesis in human cells. It phosphorylates deoxynucleosides, including deoxycytidine, deoxyadenosine, and deoxyguanosine, converting them into their respective monophosphate forms, which are essential precursors for DNA synthesis and repair (Sabini2003Structure; Chen1995Characterization). This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, which are necessary for DNA replication and cell division, particularly in rapidly proliferating cells such as thymocytes and T lymphoblasts (Chen1995Characterization).

DCK is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of nucleotide pools, influencing cell proliferation and survival (Sabini2003Structure). The enzyme's activity is not limited to a specific cell lineage, as it is expressed in both T and B lymphoblasts, although its activity levels can vary between these cell types (Chen1995Characterization). The regulation of DCK is complex, involving several transcription factors such as Sp1, MLTF/USF, and E2F, which bind to its promoter region and modulate its expression (Chen1995Characterization). This regulation is significant for understanding the enzyme's role in cellular responses to nucleoside analogs used in chemotherapy (Sabini2003Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DCK gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer treatment and immune system function. In pancreatic cancer, exosomes can confer chemoresistance by downregulating DCK expression through miR-155, reducing the metabolism of gemcitabine, a key chemotherapeutic agent. This suppression leads to decreased drug efficacy and contributes to treatment resistance (Patel2017Exosomes). 

In the realm of radiation therapy, DCK plays a role in DNA repair and radiation resistance. Its activation by ATM-mediated phosphorylation at Ser 74 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Mutations at this site, such as S74A, result in impaired lymphocyte development and increased DNA double-strand breaks, indicating potential links to immune system disorders (Bunimovich2014Deoxycytidine).

In breast cancer, DCK overexpression can modulate the response to decitabine treatment, impacting therapeutic strategies. However, the effects of DCK expression on drug sensitivity can vary depending on the genetic and epigenetic background of the cancer cells (Buocikova2022Decitabineinduced). These findings underscore the importance of DCK in influencing treatment outcomes and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) is a homodimeric enzyme that participates in several important protein interactions crucial for its function. The enzyme's structure includes a five-stranded parallel β-sheet core surrounded by ten α-helices, forming a dimer interface through a four-helix bundle (Sabini2003Structure; DevilleBonne2010Human). Key interactions involve three conserved sequence motifs: the P-loop, the ERS motif, and the LID region, which are essential for substrate binding and catalysis (Sabini2003Structure).

DCK interacts with various nucleoside substrates and analogs, with specific amino acid residues playing critical roles in these interactions. For instance, the Glu53 and Arg128 residues are crucial for the enzyme's activity, particularly in the phosphorylation of substrates like AraC and gemcitabine (Sabini2003Structure). The enzyme also shows interactions with the 5′-hydroxyl group of deoxycytidine through Arg128, which is part of the ERS motif (Sabini2003Structure).

DCK's substrate selectivity is influenced by interactions with specific residues, such as Gln97, Asp133, and Arg104, which contribute to its ability to phosphorylate deoxycytidine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxyadenosine while discriminating against thymidine and deoxyuridine (Sabini2003Structure). These interactions are vital for DCK's role in the phosphorylation of nucleoside analog prodrugs used in cancer and antiviral therapies (Sabini2003Structure).
