# GAPDHS

## Overview
GAPDHS (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, spermatogenic) is a gene that encodes a sperm-specific isoform of the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is crucial for glycolysis and energy production in sperm cells. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydrogenase and is essential for sperm motility and male fertility, as it facilitates ATP production necessary for flagellar movement (Sexton2011Development; Miki2004Glyceraldehyde). Unlike its somatic counterpart, GAPDHS is expressed exclusively in male germ cells and is the only GAPDH isozyme present in sperm, underscoring its specialized role in sperm energy metabolism (Sexton2011Development). The protein is characterized by a unique N-terminal proline-rich extension that aids in its binding to the fibrous sheath of the sperm tail, further supporting its function in sperm motility (Margaryan2015Characterization). The absence of GAPDHS results in impaired sperm motility and infertility, highlighting its potential as a target for non-hormonal male contraceptives (Sexton2011Development; Miki2004Glyceraldehyde).

## Structure
The human GAPDHS protein is a sperm-specific isoform of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sharing significant structural similarities with the somatic GAPDH enzyme. It features a conserved NAD+ binding domain and a catalytic domain, which are typical of the GAPDH family (Chaikuad2011Structure). The primary structure of GAPDHS includes an additional N-terminal proline-rich extension not found in the somatic form, which influences its biochemical properties and solubility (Margaryan2015Characterization). This extension is proposed to facilitate binding to the fibrous sheath of the sperm tail, indicating a specialized role in sperm motility (Margaryan2015Characterization).

The tertiary structure of GAPDHS, as revealed by structural analysis, shows high similarity to the somatic GAPDH when the N-terminal extension is excluded (Margaryan2015Characterization). The protein typically forms a tetramer, representing its quaternary structure, which is a common feature among GAPDH enzymes (Chaikuad2011Structure). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, potentially affecting the enzyme's activity and stability (Chaikuad2011Structure). These structural characteristics are crucial for its function in energy production and sperm motility, distinguishing it from its somatic counterpart.

## Function
GAPDHS (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, spermatogenic) is a sperm-specific isoform of the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which plays a critical role in glycolysis, a central metabolic pathway for energy production. This enzyme is essential for sperm motility and male fertility, as it facilitates the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a key step in glycolysis that generates ATP necessary for flagellar movement (Sexton2011Development; Miki2004Glyceraldehyde).

GAPDHS is expressed exclusively in male germ cells and is the only GAPDH isozyme present in sperm, highlighting its unique role in sperm energy metabolism (Sexton2011Development). The enzyme is tightly bound to the fibrous sheath of the sperm flagellum, which may facilitate its role in maintaining ATP levels and supporting sperm motility (Huang2017Sperm; Miki2004Glyceraldehyde).

The absence of GAPDHS in mice leads to infertility due to severely impaired sperm motility, despite normal sperm production, indicating that glycolysis, rather than oxidative phosphorylation, is the primary source of ATP for sperm motility (Miki2004Glyceraldehyde). This makes GAPDHS a potential target for developing non-hormonal male contraceptives (Sexton2011Development).
