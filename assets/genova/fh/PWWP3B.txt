# PWWP3B

## Overview
PWWP3B is a gene that encodes the protein PWWP domain containing 3B, which is characterized by the presence of a PWWP domain, a type of protein domain involved in chromatin-associated functions. The PWWP domain is known for its role in binding to methylated histones, suggesting that the protein may be involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling. Although the specific biological functions of PWWP domain containing 3B are not fully understood, its involvement in chromatin dynamics implies a potential role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. Research has highlighted the gene's altered expression in certain pathological conditions, such as serous ovarian cancer and acute stroke, indicating its potential relevance in disease mechanisms (Gendosz2024The; Song2021Bioinformatic).

## Clinical Significance
The PWWP3B gene, also known as MUM1L1, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In the context of serous ovarian cancer, PWWP3B is identified as a down-regulated differentially expressed gene (DEG), with significantly lower expression in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of this cancer type, although the study did not directly associate PWWP3B with specific survival outcomes or functional clusters in the disease (Song2021Bioinformatic).

In the realm of acute stroke, PWWP3B is identified as a common target for specific microRNAs, namely hsa-miR-129-5p and hsa-miR-9-5p. These interactions suggest that PWWP3B may play a role in biological processes related to stroke, such as neuron development and neurogenesis. However, the study does not specifically link PWWP3B to diseases or conditions resulting from mutations or alterations in the gene itself (Gendosz2024The).

Overall, while PWWP3B is associated with altered expression in certain conditions, its direct clinical significance in terms of disease causation or progression remains to be fully elucidated.
