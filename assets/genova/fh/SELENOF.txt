# SELENOF

## Overview
SELENOF is a gene that encodes the protein selenoprotein F, a member of the selenoprotein family characterized by the inclusion of the rare amino acid selenocysteine. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in critical cellular processes such as protein quality control and redox homeostasis. Selenoprotein F functions as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, playing a vital role in the folding of glycoproteins and the metabolism of vitamin A. It interacts with various proteins, including UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase and retinol dehydrogenase 11, highlighting its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes (Tian2018The; Li2022Selenoprotein). The gene's expression and genetic variations have been linked to several diseases, notably prostate cancer, where alterations in SELENOF expression are associated with increased risk and aggressiveness of the disease (Diamond2019Selenoproteins).

## Structure
SELENOF, also known as selenoprotein F, is characterized by the presence of the amino acid selenocysteine, which is encoded by the UGA codon. This unique feature is a hallmark of the selenoprotein family. The primary structure of SELENOF includes this selenocysteine residue, which is crucial for its function in redox reactions and protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum. While the secondary and tertiary structures of SELENOF are not well-defined, it is suggested that the protein may contain domains related to its role in oxidative stress response. These domains could potentially facilitate its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions. Information on post-translational modifications and splice variants of SELENOF is limited, but their existence is possible, which may influence the protein's function and stability. The quaternary structure of SELENOF has not been detailed, and specific structural motifs or prominent folds have not been identified in the available data. Overall, while the primary structure is well-characterized, further research is needed to elucidate the complete structural details of SELENOF.

## Function
Selenoprotein F (SELENOF) is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells, where it is involved in protein quality control and redox homeostasis. It contains a thioredoxin-like domain, suggesting a role as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, which is crucial for maintaining the redox balance within the ER (Tian2018The; Li2022Selenoprotein). SELENOF is implicated in the folding of glycoproteins by potentially interacting with UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT), a chaperone protein that assists in the proper folding of nascent proteins (Hong2021Loss; Li2022Selenoprotein).

In addition to its role in protein folding, SELENOF is involved in the metabolism of vitamin A through its interaction with retinol dehydrogenase 11 (RDH11), influencing the conversion of all-trans-retinaldehyde to all-trans-retinol (Tian2018The). SELENOF is also highly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons, suggesting potential roles in the central nervous system (Tian2018The). Its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis is further supported by its role in modulating mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism, as observed in prostate epithelial cells (Hong2021Loss).

## Clinical Significance
SELENOF, also known as selenoprotein F, has been implicated in various diseases, particularly prostate cancer. Alterations in SELENOF expression and genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its 3′-untranslated region, have been linked to prostate cancer risk and mortality. The SELENOF 811 SNP is associated with increased cancer risk, while the CC genotype at position 1125 is linked to a lower risk of aggressive tumors. Notably, African American men have lower SELENOF levels and a higher frequency of the SELENOF 811 A allele, which correlates with increased prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness, potentially contributing to the higher incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in this group (Diamond2019Selenoproteins).

SELENOF is also involved in cholesterol metabolism, with its loss affecting cholesterol-related gene expression, which may have implications for conditions like hypercholesterolemia (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). In mice, SELENOF knockout results in viable animals with only a mild phenotype of congenital cataract, indicating a degree of tolerance to its loss (Santesmasses2019Tolerance). These findings suggest that SELENOF plays a significant role in disease processes, particularly in cancer and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
SELENOF, also known as selenoprotein F, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes, particularly in vitamin A metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. A significant interaction of SELENOF is with retinol dehydrogenase 11 (RDH11), an enzyme involved in the conversion of all-trans-retinaldehyde to all-trans-retinol, a crucial step in vitamin A metabolism. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and pull-down assays. These methods demonstrated a specific and significant association between SELENOF and RDH11, indicating that SELENOF may modulate RDH11's enzymatic activity, thereby influencing retinol production and retinaldehyde levels (Tian2018The).

SELENOF is also implicated in glycoprotein folding control within the ER, interacting with proteins such as UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT). This interaction is part of a multiprotein complex involved in the quality control of glycoproteins, highlighting SELENOF's role in maintaining redox homeostasis and protein folding (Varlamova2020Protein–protein).
