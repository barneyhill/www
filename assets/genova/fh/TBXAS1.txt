# TBXAS1

## Overview
The TBXAS1 gene encodes thromboxane A synthase 1, an enzyme that belongs to the cytochrome P450 family and is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) from prostaglandin H2. Thromboxane A synthase 1 is a key enzyme in the arachidonic acid pathway, playing a significant role in hemostasis by promoting platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, which are critical for blood clot formation and regulation of blood pressure (Ulrich2005Thromboxane; Guengerich1995Human). The enzyme is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum of platelets and is involved in complex protein-protein interactions, notably with other cytochrome P450 enzymes, which influence its activity and regulatory mechanisms (Svirid2017Direct). Variations in the TBXAS1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and genetic disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Ciftciler2019Ghosal; Ramazi2019Thromboxane).

## Function
The TBXAS1 gene encodes thromboxane A synthase 1, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a potent vasoconstrictor and promoter of platelet aggregation. This enzyme is part of the cytochrome P450 family and is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of platelets (Ulrich2005Thromboxane; Guengerich1995Human). In healthy human cells, TXA2 is produced in response to various physiological stimuli and is involved in regulating blood flow and platelet activity, essential for normal hemostasis and preventing excessive bleeding by forming blood clots (Ramazi2019Thromboxane).

TXA2 acts as a paracrine and autocrine regulator, playing a crucial role in platelet aggregation and blood vessel contraction, which contributes to increased blood pressure (Svirid2017Direct). The enzyme also catalyzes an alternative reaction of prostaglandin H2, resulting in the formation of 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptatrienic acid (12-HHT) and malondialdehyde (MDA), with 12-HHT acting as a partial antagonist to TXA2 by enhancing prostacyclin synthesis and antagonizing the thromboxane receptor (Svirid2017Direct). The balance of TXA2 and other prostanoids is crucial for cardiovascular function and inflammation (Ulrich2005Thromboxane).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TBXAS1 gene, which encodes thromboxane A synthase 1, have been associated with several clinical conditions. In the Iranian population, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TBXAS1 gene, such as rs10256282, rs4590360, and rs10237429, are linked to an increased risk of large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke. These genetic variations are associated with elevated TBXAS1 expression in platelets, potentially contributing to atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke through increased thromboxane A2 production, a potent platelet activator (Ramazi2019Thromboxane).

In a Korean population, TBXAS1 polymorphisms, specifically TBXAS1 +16184G>T and TBXAS1-ht3, have been associated with an increased risk of small artery occlusion (SAO), a subtype of cerebral infarction. These polymorphisms may serve as genetic markers for non-cardiogenic cerebral infarction, particularly the SAO type (Park2009Association).

Additionally, TBXAS1 mutations are implicated in Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia (GHDD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone marrow fibrosis and metadiaphyseal dysplasia of long bones. This condition is responsive to corticosteroid therapy and is associated with biallelic mutations in the TBXAS1 gene (Ciftciler2019Ghosal).

## Interactions
Thromboxane A synthase 1 (TBXAS1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the arachidonic acid pathway. Notably, TBXAS1 interacts with cytochrome P450 enzymes, with a specific and unique interaction identified with CYP2E1. This interaction is significant due to their complementary roles in enzymatic conversion reactions involving substrates like arachidonic acid and prostaglandin H2. The formation of a heteromeric TBXAS1 • CYP2E1 complex has been confirmed through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, highlighting the specificity of this interaction, as similar interactions with other cytochromes P450 were not observed (Svirid2017Direct).

The interaction between TBXAS1 and CYP2E1 is enhanced in the presence of isatin, an endogenous bioregulator, which increases the affinity of the interaction fivefold. This suggests a regulatory role in eicosanoid biosynthesis, potentially affecting the effectiveness of enzymatic processes involving TBXAS1 (Svirid2017Direct). These interactions provide insights into the functional relationships and regulatory mechanisms involving TBXAS1 and its protein partners, which may include specific transport mechanisms for its short-lived products (Svirid2017Direct).
