# TAGLN

## Overview
Transgelin (TAGLN) is a gene that encodes the transgelin protein, a member of the calponin family of actin-binding proteins. Transgelin is characterized by its role in cytoskeletal organization and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, migration, and morphology. The protein is distinguished by its conserved structure, which includes domains for actin binding and interactions with other proteins, such as ezrin. Transgelin is expressed in smooth muscle and non-muscle cells and is implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to cellular stability and response to mechanical stress (Hsieh2023Evolution; Elsafadi2016Transgelin). The gene's expression is modulated by factors such as TGFβ, and it plays a significant role in the differentiation of human skeletal stem cells. Additionally, alterations in TAGLN expression have been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may influence tumor progression and metastasis (Elsafadi2020Transgelin; Fu2020Functional).

## Structure
Transgelin (TAGLN) is a protein characterized by a conserved molecular structure that includes an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, an actin-binding site (ABS), and a C-terminal calponin-like (CLIK) segment (Hsieh2023Evolution). The CH domain is approximately 100 amino acids long and is involved in binding to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), although it is not responsible for actin binding or regulation (Hsieh2023Evolution). The ABS domain facilitates binding to actin, while the CLIK domain interacts with ezrin (Hsieh2023Evolution). 

Transgelin contains two EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs within its CH domain, indicating a role in calcium-mediated cell regulation (Hsieh2023Evolution). The protein also has multiple phosphorylation sites, particularly in transgelin-2 and transgelin-3, suggesting potential regulatory mechanisms through post-translational modifications (Hsieh2023Evolution). 

Transgelin is considered a minimal version of calponin, lacking the isoform-specific C-terminal variable region found in calponins (Hsieh2023Evolution). The protein's structure is highly conserved across vertebrates, with three homologous isoforms identified: transgelin-1, transgelin-2, and transgelin-3, which share approximately 70% sequence similarity (Hsieh2023Evolution).

## Function
Transgelin (TAGLN) is a TGFβ-inducible gene that plays a crucial role in the differentiation of human skeletal stem cells (hMSCs) into osteoblasts and adipocytes. It is involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell differentiation, migration, and morphology (Elsafadi2016Transgelin). TAGLN expression is upregulated during the differentiation process, enhancing the formation of mineralized matrix and mature adipocytes, and is associated with increased expression of osteogenic and adipogenic markers (Elsafadi2016Transgelin).

In healthy human cells, TAGLN influences cellular and nuclear morphology and affects the distribution of actin filaments, thereby regulating cytoskeletal organization (Elsafadi2016Transgelin). It is an actin-crosslinking protein that stabilizes actin filaments, contributing to the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton and facilitating cellular responses to mechanical stress (Shapland1993Purification). TAGLN's role in cytoskeletal regulation is further highlighted by its impact on cell migration and proliferation, where its overexpression enhances cell migration and differentiation while reducing proliferation (Elsafadi2016Transgelin). These functions position TAGLN as a key regulator in maintaining cellular functions and promoting tissue regeneration.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TAGLN gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), lung adenocarcinoma, and gastric cancer. In CRC, TAGLN is generally downregulated compared to normal tissue, but its expression increases with tumor stage progression. High TAGLN expression is associated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival, suggesting it as a poor prognostic factor (Elsafadi2020Transgelin). TAGLN is involved in the TGFβ signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and migration in a TGFβ-dependent manner (Elsafadi2020Transgelin).

In NSCLC, TAGLN is upregulated and correlates with poorer survival outcomes. Knockdown of TAGLN reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and increases chemosensitivity to treatments like Sorafenib and 5-FU (Fu2020Functional). Similarly, in lung adenocarcinoma, high TAGLN expression is linked to advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, with hypoxia further enhancing its expression and cell migration (WU2014Transgelin).

In gastric cancer, TAGLN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts, promoting tumor metastasis by increasing MMP-2 production, which aids in cancer cell invasion (Yu2013Stromal). These findings highlight TAGLN's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Transgelin (TAGLN) is an actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. It interacts directly with actin filaments, influencing cell shape and motility through its actin-crosslinking or actin-gelling properties (Elsafadi2016Transgelin). TAGLN is known to interact with proteins involved in the TRPC signaling pathway, such as F2R, PLCE1, and TRPC 3/5/6, through the regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), which affects intracellular calcium concentration (Ding2021Bioinformatics).

In the context of kidney fibrosis, TAGLN has been identified to interact with fibrosis-related proteins like FN1 and TPM1, as well as SPARC, ACAD10, biglycan, and melanoma cell adhesion molecules. These interactions are associated with processes such as extracellular matrix synthesis, fatty acid β-oxidation, collagen fibril assembly, and cell adhesion (Kwon2024Unveiling).

TAGLN also influences the differentiation of human skeletal stem cells (hMSCs) into osteoblasts and adipocytes by organizing the actin cytoskeleton. This process involves interactions with focal adhesion molecules and signaling pathways related to actin cytoskeleton and TGFβ signaling (Elsafadi2016Transgelin). These interactions highlight TAGLN's role in cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
