# HNRNPR

## Overview
The HNRNPR gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R (hnRNP R), a multifunctional protein involved in RNA processing and regulation. As a member of the hnRNP family, hnRNP R is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, facilitated by three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and an RGG box. This protein plays a crucial role in the nucleus by participating in the packaging and stabilization of pre-mRNAs, as well as in the regulation of alternative splicing and mRNA export. In the cytoplasm, hnRNP R is involved in mRNA trafficking and translation regulation, particularly in neuronal cells, where it influences axonal mRNA transport and local protein synthesis. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as the SMN protein and eIF4G, underscore its significance in cellular differentiation, development, and signaling pathways. Alterations in HNRNPR expression have been linked to various diseases, including breast cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Low2020Heterogeneous; Geuens2016The; Cappelli2018Systematic).

## Structure
The hnRNP R protein, encoded by the HNRNPR gene, is composed of 633 amino acids and exhibits a modular structure. It includes an acidic N-terminal region of approximately 150 amino acids, followed by three RNA binding domains (RBDs) in the central part of the protein, which contain conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs (Hassfeld1998Molecular). The C-terminal portion features a nuclear localization signal and an RGG box, a type of RNA binding motif, which includes eight RGG repeats and 13 RG dimers (Hassfeld1998Molecular). This region also contains three copies of a tyrosine-rich decapeptide (Hassfeld1998Molecular).

The protein has a Q/N-rich domain at the C-terminus and two nuclear localization signals (NLS) (Cappelli2018Systematic). The major isoform of hnRNP R is R1, while a neuronal-specific isoform, hnRNP R2, lacks 41 amino acids between the AcD domain and the first RRM (Cappelli2018Systematic). hnRNP R is predominantly nuclear but is also found in the axons of motor neurons, where it interacts with the SMN protein, suggesting a role in mRNA transport (Rossoll2002Specific).

## Function
HNRNPR, or heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R, is a protein involved in various RNA processing mechanisms in healthy human cells. It contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and an RGG box, which enable it to interact specifically with mRNA targets. In the nucleus, hnRNP R is involved in the packaging and stabilization of freshly transcribed pre-mRNAs, facilitating the removal of introns and alternative exons, and preparing mature mRNAs for export to the cytoplasm for translation (Geuens2016The). It also plays a role in enhancing c-fos transcription by forming a complex with PC4 and Mediator (Geuens2016The).

In the cytoplasm, hnRNP R regulates cap-independent translation by binding to the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of target mRNAs (Geuens2016The). It is predominantly nuclear but also influences cytoplasmic mRNA trafficking, particularly in motor axons, by interacting with the 3' UTR of mRNAs (Cappelli2018Systematic). hnRNP R is implicated in pathways related to cellular differentiation, development, and signaling, playing a significant role in maintaining neuronal homeostasis and influencing gene expression related to brain functions and inflammatory responses (Cappelli2018Systematic).

## Clinical Significance
HNRNPR is implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In invasive breast carcinoma (BRCA), HNRNPR mRNA expression is significantly higher in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissues compared to invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with improved overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in BRCA patients, suggesting its role as a protective gene with a hazard ratio (HR) of less than 1 (Zhou2021Identification). Increased protein expression levels of HNRNPR are linked to higher cancer stages, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker in BRCA (Zhou2021Identification).

In the context of neurological diseases, hnRNP R, a member of the hnRNP family, is involved in axonal transport and interacts with beta-actin mRNA in axons. Its knockdown is associated with impaired axonal growth, and reduced levels lead to depleted 7SK RNA levels, which are crucial for axon elongation. Misregulation of hnRNP R can contribute to neurodegeneration, highlighting its importance in maintaining neuronal health (Low2020Heterogeneous). However, specific diseases directly associated with mutations in the HNRNPR gene are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

## Interactions
HNRNPR (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and translation initiation. It binds to ribosomes and the translation initiation factor eIF4G, with its association with ribosomes being RNA-dependent and its binding to eIF4G mediated by protein contacts (Zare2024hnRNP). HNRNPR also interacts with the cytoplasmic polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (Pabp), affecting the Pabp-eIF4G interaction crucial for translation initiation (Zare2024hnRNP).

HNRNPR forms oligomers, likely dimers, upon binding RNA, with a preference for poly(U) stretches. Its N-terminal RRM domains are the primary RNA binding sites (Rossoll2002Specific). It also interacts with the SMN protein, a key player in spinal muscular atrophy, through its C-terminal arginine-glycine-rich region. This interaction is specific to the wild-type SMN protein and is not observed with mutated forms (Rossoll2002Specific).

In axons, HNRNPR interacts with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (Ogt), facilitating the O-GlcNAcylation of axonal proteins, including eIF4G, which enhances its binding to Pabp and promotes mRNA circularization (Zare2024hnRNP). These interactions highlight HNRNPR's role in regulating axonal translation and protein synthesis.
