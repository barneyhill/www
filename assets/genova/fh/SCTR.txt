# SCTR

## Overview
The SCTR gene encodes the secretin receptor, a member of the Class B1 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to various physiological processes. The secretin receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane segments, a common feature of GPCRs, and is primarily involved in the regulation of water homeostasis, pH balance, and digestive functions. Upon activation by the peptide hormone secretin, the receptor facilitates the activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which are crucial for its downstream signaling pathways (Ishihara1991Molecular; Fukuhara2020Structure). The receptor's structure includes a large extracellular domain and a transmembrane domain, which are essential for ligand recognition and receptor activation (Unknownauthors2020Secretin). The SCTR gene and its encoded receptor have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including renal abnormalities, cancer, and liver pathology, highlighting their significance as potential therapeutic targets (Glaser2010Knockout; Klussmeier2022Secretin; Chu2007Phenotypes).

## Structure
The secretin receptor (SCTR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane segments, a hallmark of the GPCR family (Ishihara1991Molecular). The primary structure of the receptor consists of 449 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 48,696, although this may be reduced due to glycosylation at five N-glycosylation sites (Ishihara1991Molecular). The receptor's secondary structure includes a signal sequence at the N-terminal and seven membrane-spanning segments (Ishihara1991Molecular).

The tertiary structure of the secretin receptor involves a large extracellular domain rich in cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming disulfide bonds that stabilize the receptor's conformation (Unknownauthors2020Secretin). The receptor's quaternary structure includes the ability to form homo-dimeric complexes, which are important for its high-affinity G protein-coupled state (Unknownauthors2020Secretin).

Post-translational modifications of the secretin receptor include glycosylation, which is important for proper folding and protection from degradation, and phosphorylation at threonine and serine residues, which plays a role in desensitization and feedback regulation (Unknownauthors2020Secretin). The receptor's structure is distinct from other GPCRs, lacking some conserved residues found in other members of the superfamily (Ishihara1991Molecular).

## Function
The secretin receptor (SCTR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of water homeostasis, pH balance, and digestive functions. SCTR is activated by secretin, a 27-amino-acid peptide hormone, which leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase via the G protein, Gs, resulting in increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels (Fukuhara2020Structure; Onori2010Secretin).

In the pancreas, SCTR activation stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate-rich fluid, which is crucial for neutralizing stomach acid and facilitating nutrient absorption (Ulrich1998Secretin). The receptor is also involved in renal water reabsorption by regulating the expression and trafficking of aquaporins, particularly aquaporin 2 (AQP2), in the kidneys. This process is essential for maintaining water balance, especially under conditions of water deprivation (Chu2007Phenotypes).

Structurally, SCTR consists of an N-terminal extracellular domain and a transmembrane domain, which are essential for ligand recognition and receptor activation. The receptor's interaction with secretin involves a complex network of hydrogen bonds and specific residues that facilitate G-protein coupling and downstream signaling (Fukuhara2020Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the secretin receptor (SCTR) gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of renal function, SCTR-null mice exhibit significant renal abnormalities, including increased kidney/body weight ratio, mesangial expansion, and nodular glomerulosclerosis. These mice also show altered renal function, producing more diluted urine and exhibiting polydipsia and polyuria, suggesting a predisposition to conditions resembling nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Chu2007Phenotypes).

In cancer, SCTR is overexpressed in various tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This overexpression suggests a potential role for SCTR in tumor pathology and highlights its potential as a target for molecular imaging and therapy in gastrointestinal cancers (Klussmeier2022Secretin).

In breast cancer, SCTR is hypermethylated and downregulated, contrasting with its expression in normal breast tissues. This alteration is associated with a shift from anti-proliferative activity in normal cells to pro-proliferative activity in cancer cells, indicating its involvement in breast cancer progression (KANG2015SCTR).

In liver pathology, SCTR plays a role in cholangiocyte proliferation during cholestasis. Knockout studies show that the absence of SCTR reduces cholangiocyte hyperplasia, suggesting its involvement in biliary growth regulation (Glaser2010Knockout).

## Interactions
The secretin receptor (SCTR) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function. It is a Class B1 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that primarily interacts with the peptide hormone secretin, leading to the activation of Gαs proteins and increased cAMP production (Dengler2021Discovery). This receptor is also modulated by small molecule positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), which enhance its signaling capabilities. These PAMs, such as 2-sulfonyl pyrimidines, 2-mercapto pyrimidines, and 2-amino pyrimidines, have been shown to interact with SCTR, prolonging the residence time of secretin and potentially affecting other receptors like the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) (Dengler2021Discovery).

The interaction of SCTR with β-arrestin-2 is another significant aspect of its function. This interaction is measured using assays that indicate receptor activation and engagement with intracellular signaling proteins (Dengler2021Development). The receptor's binding dynamics are further explored through assays that assess the binding of fluorescein-labeled secretin to SCTR, providing insights into its interaction with various ligands and modulators (Dengler2021Development). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing SCTR activity and its potential as a therapeutic target.
