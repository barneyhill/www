# NDUFB10

## Overview
NDUFB10 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B10, a crucial component of mitochondrial complex I, which is part of the electron transport chain. This protein is categorized as a subunit of the membrane arm of complex I and plays a significant role in the assembly and stabilization of the complex, as well as its associated supercomplexes (Arroum2023Loss). The NDUFB10 protein is characterized by its small, hydrophobic nature and contains structural motifs essential for its function and stability within the mitochondrial inner membrane (Padavannil2022The). It is involved in the Mitochondrial Import and Assembly (MIA) pathway, which is critical for its proper folding and function (Padavannil2022The). Mutations in the NDUFB10 gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and bioenergetics (Helman2020Multiomic; Arroum2023Loss).

## Structure
The NDUFB10 protein is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, involved in the electron transport chain. It is a small hydrophobic protein, consisting of 172 amino acids and weighing approximately 20.7 kDa (Friederich2016Mutations). The protein is part of the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing family and carries CX9C motifs that form disulfide bonds, which are crucial for stabilizing its structure (Padavannil2022The). These motifs are involved in the Mitochondrial Import and Assembly (MIA) pathway, which regulates the redox environment and interacts with antioxidant systems (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFB10 interacts with core subunits ND4 and ND5, as well as several accessory subunits, playing a structural role in complex I (Padavannil2022The). It occupies a binding site on the bottom of ND4, suggesting its importance for the stability of the complex (Padavannil2022The). The protein's structure includes a helix-turn-helix motif that interacts with other subunits, such as NDUFB11, ND5, NDUFB6, NDUFB7, NDUFB8, and NDUFB4 (Padavannil2022The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and potential ubiquitination sites, may affect the function of NDUFB10 (Friederich2016Mutations). These modifications and the protein's structural features are essential for its role in the assembly and stability of complex I.

## Function
NDUFB10 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a critical role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In healthy human cells, NDUFB10 is involved in the assembly and stability of complex I, a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain responsible for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Friederich2016Mutations; Arroum2023Loss). 

NDUFB10 is located in the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria and is imported through a process involving the oxidative folding machinery, specifically the enzymes CHCHD4 and ALR. This import is essential for the proper folding and function of NDUFB10 within complex I (Friederich2016Mutations). The protein acts as a clamp, holding different membrane parts of complex I together, ensuring proper assembly and function (Friederich2016Mutations).

The presence of NDUFB10 is necessary for the formation of supercomplexes, which are essential for efficient electron transport and ATP production. Its absence leads to incomplete assembly of complex I and affects mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing mitochondrial respiration and energy production (Arroum2023Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NDUFB10 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders due to its critical role in the assembly and function of mitochondrial complex I. Mutations in NDUFB10 can lead to isolated complex I deficiency, which is linked to severe clinical manifestations such as fatal infantile lactic acidosis and cardiomyopathy (Arroum2023Loss). A specific deep intronic variant, NM_004548.3:c.131-442G>C, causes aberrant splicing, resulting in a cryptic exon inclusion that leads to a frameshift mutation and premature termination of the protein. This mutation is associated with complex I deficiency, characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and symptoms such as developmental delays, sensorineural hearing loss, and early death (Helman2020Multiomic; Helman2020RNA).

The loss of NDUFB10 affects the assembly of complex I and its integration into supercomplexes, leading to impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced ATP production. This disruption in mitochondrial function can contribute to various disease conditions associated with energy production deficits (Arroum2023Loss). The absence of NDUFB10 also affects the expression of SCAF1, a protein important for stabilizing interactions between complexes III and IV, which may have further functional and structural consequences (Arroum2023Loss).

## Interactions
NDUFB10 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is part of the electron transport chain. It plays a crucial role in the assembly and stabilization of complex I and its associated supercomplexes. NDUFB10 is part of the membrane arm of complex I, specifically within the P D-a module, and is essential for the formation of complex I and its supercomplexes, which include complexes I, III, and IV (Arroum2023Loss).

NDUFB10 interacts with other proteins within complex I, such as DMAC10, an assembly factor, indicating its role in complex I assembly. This interaction is supported by cross-linking mass spectrometry studies, which have shown that DMAC10 cross-links with NDUFB10, suggesting a physical interaction that is crucial for the assembly process (Linden2024Elucidation).

The absence of NDUFB10 disrupts the assembly of complex I, leading to a reduction in the formation of supercomplexes and affecting the electron transport chain's function. This disruption results in impaired respiratory activity and reduced ATP production, highlighting the importance of NDUFB10 in maintaining mitochondrial function and bioenergetics (Arroum2023Loss).
