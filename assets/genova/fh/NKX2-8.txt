# NKX2-8

## Overview
NKX2-8 is a gene that encodes the NK2 homeobox 8 protein, a homeodomain transcription factor involved in the regulation of developmental processes, particularly within the nervous system. The NKX2-8 protein is characterized by a homeobox DNA binding domain at its N-terminus, which is essential for its role in transcriptional regulation, and a C-terminal NK-specific domain that contributes to its transcriptional activity (Safra2013GenomeWide). As a member of the NK2 family of homeodomain proteins, NKX2-8 is evolutionarily conserved across species, including humans, dogs, and zebrafish, and is homologous to the Drosophila NK2 gene (Safra2013GenomeWide). The gene plays a critical role in the development of the neural tube and is implicated in various cancers and neural tube defects, highlighting its importance in both normal development and disease (Safra2013GenomeWide; Qu2014Decreased).

## Structure
The NKX2-8 protein is a homeodomain transcription factor involved in the development of the nervous system. It contains a homeobox DNA binding domain at the N-terminus, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation of developmental processes, and a C-terminus NK specific domain with transcriptional activity (Safra2013GenomeWide). The homeodomain is characterized by a sequence of amino acids that form alpha helices, typical of the secondary structure of homeobox proteins (Boettger1997The).

A frameshift mutation identified in Weimaraner dogs results in a truncated NKX2-8 protein that lacks the NK specific domain, which may impair its function during embryonic development (Safra2013GenomeWide). This mutation introduces an amino acid change and a downstream stop codon, leading to a premature termination of the protein (Safra2013GenomeWide).

The NKX2-8 gene is part of a family of vertebrate developmental regulators, homologous to the Drosophila NK2 gene, and is expressed in the developing neural tube (Safra2013GenomeWide). The protein's structure and function are conserved across several species, including humans, dogs, and zebrafish (Safra2013GenomeWide).

## Function
The NKX2-8 gene encodes a homeodomain transcription factor that plays a significant role in the development of the nervous system. It is part of a family of vertebrate developmental regulators and is homologous to the Drosophila NK2 homeodomain transcription factor. In healthy human cells, NKX2-8 is expressed in the developing neural tube, indicating its involvement in early neural development. The protein contains a conserved homeobox DNA binding domain at the N-terminus, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of key developmental processes, and a conserved NK-specific domain at the C-terminus, which has transcriptional activity (Safra2013GenomeWide).

NKX2-8 is involved in the development of distinct neuronal populations in the hindbrain and ventral spinal cord. It is essential for proper neuronal development and function, including axonal pathfinding and locomotor coordination. Disruptive mutations in related genes, such as Nkx2-9 in mice, have demonstrated the importance of these proteins in neural development (Safra2013GenomeWide). The evolutionary conservation of NKX2-8 across species suggests that its function in healthy human cells likely involves similar roles in neural development and maintenance (Safra2013GenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
The NKX2-8 gene is implicated in several cancers, where its altered expression or deletion is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), decreased expression of NKX2-8 correlates with tumor progression and metastasis, indicating its potential role in carcinogenesis (Qu2014Decreased). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), downregulation of NKX2-8 is linked to advanced clinical stages and poor histologic differentiation, serving as an independent prognostic factor. This downregulation promotes angiogenesis and activates NF-kB signaling, contributing to tumor progression (Lin2013Nkx28).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), coactivation of NKX2-8 with TTF-1 is associated with poor survival outcomes and resistance to cisplatin therapy, suggesting a role in chemoresistance (Hsu2009Characterizing). In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), NKX2-8 deletion leads to reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism, resulting in chemoresistance. This deletion is linked to higher FIGO stages and shorter relapse-free survival (Zhu2019NKX28).

NKX2-8 is also associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) in humans, such as spina bifida, where specific missense variants in the gene have been identified in affected individuals (Safra2013GenomeWide). These findings highlight the gene's significance in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
NKX2-8 is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression in different cancer types. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), NKX2-8 interacts with the AKIP1 promoter, regulating its expression. This interaction affects the NF-kB signaling pathway, as AKIP1 enhances NF-kB-dependent gene expression by retaining nuclear NF-kB and inducing phosphorylated-p65. Overexpression of AKIP1 can counteract the inhibitory effects of NKX2-8 on NF-kB activity and angiogenesis (Lin2013Nkx28).

In breast cancer, NKX2-8 interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) on the PTHrP promoter, leading to reduced histone H3K27 acetylation and downregulation of PTHrP expression. This interaction is crucial for modulating osteoclastogenesis and bone metastasis, as PTHrP is a key factor in osteoclast activation (Abudourousuli2022NKX28PTHrP).

In bladder urothelial carcinoma, NKX2-8 binds directly to the MDR1 promoter, repressing its transcription and reducing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) levels, which enhances chemosensitivity. This interaction is confirmed through ChIP assays and luciferase reporter assays (Zhou2022Nkx2.8). NKX2-8 also binds to the TWIST1 promoter, repressing its transcription and inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby reducing the invasiveness and metastatic potential of cancer cells (Yu2018Nkx2.8).
