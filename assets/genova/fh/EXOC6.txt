# EXOC6

## Overview
EXOC6 is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 6, which is a crucial part of the exocyst complex involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. The exocyst complex is essential for tethering secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, facilitating processes such as protein trafficking and secretion. The protein encoded by EXOC6 plays a significant role in the mammalian constitutive secretory pathway and is involved in various cellular functions, including insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells and glucose uptake in adipocytes. It interacts with small GTPases, such as Rab10 and Ral, which are important for its recruitment to the membrane and function in exocytosis. EXOC6 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the lung and pancreas, and is implicated in cell migration, morphogenesis, and tumor invasion, underscoring its diverse roles in cell biology (Tanaka2016Diverse; Sulaiman2022EXOC6; Pereira2022The).

## Function
The EXOC6 gene, also known as Sec15, encodes a component of the exocyst complex, which is crucial for various cellular processes in healthy human cells. This complex is involved in tethering secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, a key step in exocytosis. EXOC6 plays a significant role in the mammalian constitutive secretory pathway, facilitating the fusion of post-Golgi carriers with the plasma membrane and ensuring the proper trafficking and secretion of proteins (Pereira2022The).

In pancreatic β-cells, EXOC6 is essential for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, playing a role in insulin granule docking and secretion. It is also involved in the translocation of GLUT4 in adipocytes, which is crucial for glucose uptake in response to insulin (Sano2015A; Sulaiman2022EXOC6). The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, including the lung and pancreas, suggesting its involvement in various physiological processes (Sulaiman2022EXOC6).

EXOC6 is also implicated in cell migration, morphogenesis, and tumor invasion, highlighting its diverse roles in cell biology. It interacts with small GTPases like Rab10 and Ral, which are important for its recruitment to the membrane and its function in exocytosis (Sulaiman2022EXOC6; Tanaka2016Diverse).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EXOC6 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), EXOC6 plays a crucial role in insulin granule docking and secretion. Silencing of EXOC6 in pancreatic β-cells leads to impaired insulin secretion, reduced glucose uptake, and increased reactive oxygen species production, contributing to β-cell dysfunction in diabetes (Sulaiman2022EXOC6). Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near EXOC6 that are strongly associated with T2D, although these SNPs do not appear to affect EXOC6 expression in pancreatic islets (Sulaiman2022EXOC6).

EXOC6 has also been linked to intellectual disability and related developmental disorders. Disruptions in the EXOC6B gene, a variant of EXOC6, have been associated with developmental delay, epilepsy, and intellectual disability, suggesting that EXOC6B haploinsufficiency may contribute to these conditions (Frühmesser2013Disruption; Evers2014Mosaic). Additionally, EXOC6B mutations are associated with spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity type 3, a condition characterized by impaired primary ciliogenesis and skeletal abnormalities (Simsek‐Kiper2022Biallelic). These findings highlight the diverse clinical implications of EXOC6 and its variants in human health.

## Interactions
EXOC6, also known as Sec15, is a component of the exocyst complex, which is involved in vesicle trafficking and tethering at the plasma membrane. EXOC6 interacts with Rab10-GTP, a small GTPase, which is crucial for the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface in adipocytes. This interaction is a key link between insulin signaling and GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis (Sano2015A).

EXOC6 also interacts with Rab11, another small GTPase, playing a role in endosome recycling and transferrin recycling, which is important for iron trafficking (Tanaka2016Diverse). In the context of cell motility, EXOC6 is part of the exocyst complex that interacts with PPIP5K1 through its C-terminal intrinsically disordered domain, influencing processes such as wound healing and cell migration (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1).

Additionally, EXOC6 is involved in the interaction with the HIV-1 Nef protein, which enhances intercellular nanotube formation, a process crucial for the cell-to-cell spread of HIV-1 (Mukerji2012Proteomic). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of EXOC6 in cellular processes and its importance in various signaling pathways.
