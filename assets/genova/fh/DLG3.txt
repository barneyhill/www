# DLG3

## Overview
DLG3 is a gene that encodes the protein discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 3, also known as synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102). This protein is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, which is integral to synaptic organization and signaling in neurons. SAP102 is predominantly located at the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses, where it plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity by interacting with NMDA receptors. This interaction is essential for processes such as learning and memory, as it facilitates the coupling of NMDA receptors to downstream signaling pathways like the MAPK/ERK pathway (Kumar2016A; Cuthbert2007SynapseAssociated). The protein's structure, characterized by PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase-like domains, enables it to form multiprotein complexes and participate in various cellular processes, underscoring its importance in maintaining synaptic function and cognitive abilities (He2024DLG3).

## Structure
DLG3, also known as discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 3, is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. The protein is characterized by the presence of PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase-like domains, which are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These domains play a significant role in synaptic signaling and the formation of cellular junctions. The PDZ domain is typically involved in binding to the C-terminus of other proteins, while the SH3 domain is known for its role in mediating interactions with proline-rich sequences. The guanylate kinase-like domain, although not catalytically active, is important for structural stability and interaction with other proteins.

DLG3 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its function and interactions. This protein is involved in forming multiprotein complexes, indicating a quaternary structure. The existence of splice variants suggests that DLG3 may have functional diversity, allowing it to participate in various cellular processes. These structural features and modifications enable DLG3 to contribute to the dynamic regulation of synaptic and cellular junctional complexes, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
The DLG3 gene encodes the synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102), a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, which plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and signaling in neurons. SAP102 is primarily active at the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses, where it interacts with NMDA receptors to facilitate synaptic plasticity, a process essential for learning and memory (Kumar2016A; Cuthbert2007SynapseAssociated).

SAP102 is involved in coupling NMDA receptors to specific downstream signaling pathways, such as the MAPK/ERK pathway, which is crucial for long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic strength modulation (Cuthbert2007SynapseAssociated). This protein is particularly important in the early stages of brain development and is highly expressed in dendrites and axons during fetal and early postnatal stages (Kumar2016A).

In healthy human cells, SAP102 contributes to cognitive functions by regulating the assembly of protein complexes necessary for synaptic transmission and plasticity. It also plays a role in spatial learning and memory, as evidenced by impairments observed in SAP102-deficient models (Cuthbert2007SynapseAssociated). The protein's ability to interact with other MAGUK proteins, such as PSD-95, allows for functional compensation, maintaining synaptic function despite potential deficits (Cuthbert2007SynapseAssociated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DLG3 gene, which encodes the synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102), are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). These mutations can lead to cognitive impairments that vary from mild to severe, often accompanied by additional symptoms such as seizures, abnormal behavior, and facial dysmorphisms. In males, these mutations are typically more severe, while female carriers are usually asymptomatic or mildly affected, although skewed X-inactivation can result in more pronounced symptoms (Sandestig2019A).

DLG3 variants have also been linked to X-linked epilepsy, with or without accompanying neurodevelopmental disorders. These variants can affect protein stability and are often inherited from asymptomatic mothers, consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance. The clinical presentation includes various seizure types, and the severity of epilepsy can correlate with the location of the variants within the gene's functional domains (He2024DLG3).

Additionally, a non-coding variant in the 5ʹ untranslated region (UTR) of DLG3 has been identified, which reduces protein translation efficiency, leading to non-syndromic intellectual disability. This variant results in decreased levels of SAP102, correlating with a milder phenotype compared to other loss-of-function variants (Kumar2016A).

## Interactions
DLG3, also known as SAP102, is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family and plays a crucial role in synaptic signaling and plasticity. It contains three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a GK domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins. DLG3 is involved in the clustering of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) at excitatory synapses, a process essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (He2024DLG3).

DLG3 interacts with a network of 52 proteins, many of which are associated with neurological diseases, including epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Notable interactions include those with GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIK2, and NBEA, which are linked to epilepsy and NDD (He2024DLG3). DLG3 also interacts with other DLG family members, such as DLG4, and is involved in synaptic scaffolding, stabilizing glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic membrane (Wilkinson2020Molecular).

The protein-protein interaction network of DLG3 suggests its involvement in a broad phenotypic spectrum related to epilepsy and NDD, highlighting its role as a scaffold protein in excitatory synapses (He2024DLG3). These interactions underscore the importance of DLG3 in maintaining synaptic structure and function.
