# DRAXIN

## Overview
DRAXIN is a gene that encodes the dorsal inhibitory axon guidance protein, a secreted protein that plays a pivotal role in the development of neural circuits within the central nervous system (CNS). This protein is classified as an axon guidance molecule and is integral to the formation of key neural structures such as the spinal cord commissure, corpus callosum, and thalamocortical projections. DRAXIN functions by interacting with netrin-1 receptors, including Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and Neogenin (Neo1), modulating axon guidance and fasciculation through its role as a netrin-1 antagonist. It is vertebrate-specific and exhibits structural similarities with the Dickkopf (Dkk) family, although it lacks homology with other known proteins. The protein's interactions and concentration-dependent effects on neurite outgrowth underscore its complex role in neural development (Ahmed2021Multiple).

## Function
Draxin is a secreted protein that plays a crucial role in axon guidance during the development of neural circuits in the central nervous system (CNS). It is essential for the formation of various neural circuits, including the spinal cord commissure, corpus callosum, and thalamocortical projections. Draxin functions by interacting with netrin-1 receptors, such as Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and Neogenin (Neo1), and modulates netrin-1-mediated axon guidance and fasciculation. Draxin acts as a netrin-1 antagonist by preventing netrin-1 from binding to the DCC receptor, while also being able to interact with both netrin-1 and DCC simultaneously, suggesting that draxin can form a bridge between axons, promoting adhesion and fasciculation (Ahmed2021Multiple).

Draxin is vertebrate-specific and is not found in invertebrate genomes. In draxin knockout mice, defects are observed in several axonal tracts, indicating its essential role in axon guidance. The protein contains a cysteine-rich domain and shares some structural similarities with the Dickkopf (Dkk) family, although it has no homology with known proteins (Ahmed2021Multiple). Draxin's effects on neurite outgrowth are concentration-dependent, promoting growth at low concentrations and inhibiting it at higher concentrations, with the involvement of DCC and Neo1 receptors (Ahmed2021Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DRAXIN gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. In the context of corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), mutations in DRAXIN can lead to abnormalities in the development of the corpus callosum and hippocampal commissure. This is particularly evident in BTBR mice, where an eight-base pair deletion in the Draxin gene results in a truncated protein, causing defective interhemispheric fissure remodelling and leading to CCD and hippocampal commissure dysgenesis (Morcom2020DRAXIN).

In glioma, a type of brain tumor, high expression levels of DRAXIN are associated with poor prognosis. Studies have shown that increased DRAXIN expression correlates with higher WHO grade gliomas and is linked to pathways involved in cell cycle and DNA replication, which are crucial for glioma progression. Knockdown experiments in glioma cells demonstrate that reducing DRAXIN expression inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its role in promoting malignancy (Jia2022DRAXIN).

Additionally, DRAXIN has been associated with ASD-like features in BTBR mice, where a specific deletion in the gene contributes to neuroanatomic abnormalities and behaviors similar to autism spectrum disorder (Arslan2023Analysis).

## Interactions
DRAXIN, a protein involved in axon guidance, interacts with several receptors, primarily the netrin receptor DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) and Neogenin (Neo1). DRAXIN binds to the IgG domain of DCC, distinct from the netrin-1 binding domain, with a high affinity of 970 pM, which is higher than the DCC-netrin-1 interaction (Ahmed2021Multiple; Ahmed2011Draxin). This binding is crucial for DRAXIN's role in inhibiting axonal outgrowth and inducing growth cone collapse (Ahmed2011Draxin).

DRAXIN also interacts with netrin-1, acting as an antagonist by preventing netrin-1 from binding to DCC. It can bind to both netrin-1 and DCC simultaneously, suggesting a complex role in modulating axon guidance (Ahmed2021Multiple). The protein contains a conserved hydrophobic sequence that binds netrin-1 and a cysteine knot domain that binds DCC (Ahmed2021Multiple).

In addition to DCC and Neo1, DRAXIN interacts with other netrin receptors such as UNC5s and DSCAM, although the functional significance of these interactions in axon guidance is less clear (Shinmyo2015Draxin; Ahmed2011Draxin). These interactions highlight DRAXIN's multifaceted role in neural circuit development.
