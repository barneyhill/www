# BICRA

## Overview
BICRA, also known as GLTSCR1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling, specifically as a component of the non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complex. This protein, referred to as the BRD4 interacting chromatin remodeling complex associated protein, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure, thereby influencing DNA accessibility for transcription. BICRA is particularly significant in neurodevelopmental processes and is broadly expressed in the human brain, highlighting its importance in maintaining pluripotency and regulating gene expression in various cellular contexts, including cancer cells (Barish2020BICRA; Gratacós2024Neurodevelopmental). The protein's interaction with BRD4, a key player in transcription regulation, underscores its involvement in essential cellular functions and its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Zhai2022Spatiotemporalresolved; Marrero2023Current).

## Function
BICRA, also known as GLTSCR1, is a component of the non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complex, a variant of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes. These complexes are essential for regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure, thereby controlling the accessibility of regulatory sequences (Barish2020BICRA). BICRA interacts with BRD4, a protein involved in transcription regulation, and is crucial for chromatin remodeling processes that guide developmental and cognitive functions (Gratacós2024Neurodevelopmental).

In healthy human cells, BICRA is involved in the positive regulation of DNA transcription by modifying DNA-histone interactions in a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. This activity is essential for transcriptional activation, as it promotes changes to the chromatin structure, modulating gene expression (Gratacós2024Neurodevelopmental). BICRA's role in chromatin remodeling is critical for directing cell fate determination by forming cell type-specific complexes through different subunit combinations (Gratacós2024Neurodevelopmental).

BICRA is broadly detected in the human brain, supporting its importance in neurodevelopment. It is involved in maintaining pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells and gene regulation in cancer cells lacking canonical BAF complex members (Barish2020BICRA). The protein's activity in the nucleus suggests its involvement in neurodevelopmental processes (Barish2020BICRA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BICRA gene are associated with SWI/SNF-related intellectual disability disorders (SSRIDDs), which are rare neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders are characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, behavioral abnormalities, and distinct facial dysmorphisms. Notably, individuals with BICRA mutations often lack the fifth digit/nail hypoplasia phenotype, a common feature in other SSRIDDs (Barish2020BICRA). The study identified 12 individuals with rare variants in BICRA, including 10 loss-of-function and 2 missense variants, who exhibited these neurodevelopmental phenotypes (Barish2020BICRA).

BICRA is also implicated in various cancers, particularly oligodendrogliomas, due to sequence and copy number variants (Barish2020BICRA). In zebrafish and Drosophila models, mutations in BICRA lead to craniofacial defects and act as a dominant enhancer of position effect variegation, respectively, indicating its role in development and chromatin structure regulation (Barish2020BICRA).

Additionally, duplications involving the BICRA gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, as observed in a family study where a duplication at 19q13.32q13.33 segregated with these conditions across three generations (Guadagnolo2023Duplication).

## Interactions
BICRA, also known as GLTSCR1, is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, specifically forming part of the GBAF subcomplex. Within this complex, BICRA and its paralog GLTSCR1L are mutually exclusive subunits, meaning they do not coexist in the same complex. BICRA can replace GLTSCR1 in the GBAF complex, which affects the association of other subunits such as BRG1 and BRD9, while reducing the presence of ARID1A, BAF47, and BAF57 (Alpsoy2018Glioma).

BICRA interacts with BRD4, a bromodomain protein involved in transcriptional regulation. This interaction is significant as BRD4 is known to play a role in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and gene expression (Zhai2022Spatiotemporalresolved). BICRA is also identified as a 14-3-3 interaction target within the SWI/SNF complex, with specific residues predicted as 14-3-3-binding sites. This interaction is targeted by a ubiquitination-mediated degradation system, which significantly reduces BICRA levels upon introduction (Li2022A).

In the context of cancer, BICRA has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, with studies suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression levels and interactions may influence cancer development and progression (Marrero2023Current).
