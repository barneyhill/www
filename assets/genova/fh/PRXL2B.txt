# PRXL2B

## Overview
PRXL2B, or peroxiredoxin like 2B, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the peroxiredoxin family, which is primarily involved in cellular redox regulation. The PRXL2B protein functions as an antioxidant enzyme, reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, thus playing a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative damage and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in various physiological processes, including intraocular pressure regulation and arachidonic acid metabolism. The gene's expression and function have been linked to several health conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential significance in disease susceptibility and progression (Zhengdong2024Identification; Ru2024Transcriptomic; Bertrand2021Deletion).

## Structure


## Function
PRXL2B, also known as peroxiredoxin like 2B, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular redox regulation. This protein is part of the peroxiredoxin family, which plays a crucial role in reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage. The PRXL2B protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways.

In the context of intraocular pressure regulation, PRXL2B is associated with the enzyme prostamide/prostaglandin F synthase (PM/PGFS), which is involved in the biosynthesis of prostamide F2α and prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). These molecules are important for maintaining normal intraocular pressure by counteracting prostanoids that raise it (Bertrand2021Deletion). The deletion of the PRXL2B gene in mice has been shown to result in elevated intraocular pressure, indicating its regulatory role in the eye (Bertrand2021Deletion).

PRXL2B is also associated with arachidonic acid metabolism, although its specific function in bone or other tissues remains to be fully elucidated (Ru2024Transcriptomic). Additionally, PRXL2B has been identified as having NAD-capped RNA, suggesting its involvement in NAD-related processes (Niu2022ONEseq:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PRXL2B gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), PRXL2B is associated with risk loci that exhibit cell type-specific expression patterns, suggesting its potential role in influencing susceptibility to conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Perée2024Integrated). The gene's involvement in the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway and its upregulation under chronic hypoxia in the brain of Takifugu rubripes suggest a role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, which may have implications for neurodegenerative diseases (Shang2022Transcriptome).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PRXL2B is part of a prognostic model that predicts patient outcomes, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and prognosis (Zhengdong2024Identification). The gene's expression is also noted during osteogenic differentiation, suggesting its involvement in bone metabolism, although its specific clinical implications in this context are not detailed (Ru2024Transcriptomic). These findings highlight the diverse roles of PRXL2B in disease processes, potentially through its involvement in oxidative stress regulation and redox signaling pathways.
