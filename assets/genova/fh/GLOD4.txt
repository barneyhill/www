# GLOD4

## Overview
GLOD4, or glyoxalase domain containing 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular detoxification and defense mechanisms. The protein, also referred to as GLOD4, is part of the glyoxalase system, which is crucial for metabolizing reactive aldehydes like methylglyoxal into less harmful compounds, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress (Farrera2022The). Although the precise function of GLOD4 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, it is known to contain a glyoxalase domain typical of enzymes that detoxify reactive dicarbonyls (Albee2013Identification). Additionally, GLOD4 is implicated in ciliary protein trafficking, affecting cilia assembly and length control, as well as cell cycle progression (Albee2013Identification). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as mitochondrial ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase NUDT9 and amyloid β precursor protein, suggest its involvement in mitochondrial functions, protein methylation, and neurodegenerative processes (Utyro2024Association; Wang2019Characterization; Lim2022Proteomic).

## Function
GLOD4 (glyoxalase domain containing 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular detoxification processes. It is part of the glyoxalase system, which plays a crucial role in metabolizing reactive aldehydes, such as methylglyoxal, into less harmful compounds, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing damage to cellular components (Farrera2022The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress (Farrera2022The).

In healthy human cells, GLOD4 is suggested to participate in methylglyoxal detoxification, although this function has not been conclusively demonstrated (Utyro2024Association). The protein contains a glyoxalase domain, which is characteristic of enzymes involved in detoxifying reactive dicarbonyls (Albee2013Identification). GLOD4 is also involved in ciliary protein trafficking and has been shown to affect cilia assembly and length control, as well as cell cycle progression (Albee2013Identification). Despite its involvement in these processes, the precise function of GLOD4 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Albee2013Identification).

## Interactions
GLOD4, a protein encoded by the human gene glyoxalase domain containing 4, is involved in several cellular interactions. It has been shown to interact with mitochondrial ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase NUDT9, which may play a role in regulating cell growth (Utyro2024Association; Wang2019Characterization). This interaction suggests a potential involvement in mitochondrial functions and cellular energy regulation.

GLOD4 is also identified as a target for type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) in colorectal cancer cells, indicating its role in protein methylation processes (Lim2022Proteomic). This interaction highlights GLOD4's potential involvement in post-translational modifications, which could affect its function and stability.

In the context of Alzheimer's Disease, GLOD4 interacts with amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) and the autophagy pathway. Disruption of these interactions is associated with amyloid β accumulation and cognitive deficits, suggesting a role in neurodegenerative processes (Utyro2024Association).

While GLOD4's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, these findings indicate its involvement in various cellular pathways and potential implications in disease mechanisms.
