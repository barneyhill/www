# NXPE2

## Overview
NXPE2 is a gene that encodes the protein neurexophilin and PC-esterase domain family member 2, which is part of a family of proteins structurally similar to neuroexophilins. These proteins are implicated in various biological processes, including synaptic function and cell communication, due to their involvement in protein-protein interactions (Duek2018Exploring). NXPE2 is expressed in several tissues, notably in the testis and epididymis, where it plays a role in fluid resorption, and in the gut, where it may influence the gut-brain-microbiota axis (Duek2018Exploring; Vandenbrouck2020The). The protein's interactions with PDZ domains and its role in erythropoiesis further suggest its involvement in complex cellular signaling pathways (Keele2024Cotransfection; Ivarsson2014Largescale). Clinically, NXPE2 has been associated with cancer progression, particularly in diffuse-type gastric cancer and colorectal cancer, and has been linked to COVID-19 susceptibility, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic and prognostic applications (Shi2021Alternative; Kim2019Identification; Redin2022Host).

## Function
NXPE2 is a protein that is moderately and uniformly expressed in the germ cell lineage of the testis and shows strong expression in the head of the epididymis, where it is involved in fluid resorption. This function is similar to that of cells in the salivary gland acini, which also display strong NXPE2 immunoreactivity (Vandenbrouck2020The). NXPE2 is suggested to play a role in the gut-brain-microbiota axis, potentially linked to dietary adaptation, as indicated by its up-regulation in the adult intestine of Xenopus laevis compared to the larval stage (Duek2018Exploring). The NXPE family proteins, including NXPE2, are structurally similar to neuroexophilins, which are brain glycoproteins involved in neuronal circuits, suggesting a possible role in synaptic function and cell communication (Duek2018Exploring). Although specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, NXPE2's expression patterns and potential involvement in secretion processes and the gut-brain-microbiota axis suggest it may play a significant role in maintaining normal physiological functions across different tissues (Duek2018Exploring; Vandenbrouck2020The).

## Clinical Significance
NXPE2 has been identified as a significant factor in the progression of diffuse-type gastric cancer (GC). Research indicates that NXPE2 promotes cell migration and proliferation, contributing to the aggressiveness of this cancer subtype. Overexpression of NXPE2 in gastric cancer cell lines has been shown to significantly enhance migration and proliferation, suggesting its involvement in malignant progression and metastasis (Kim2019Identification). This makes NXPE2 a potential target for understanding the molecular characteristics of diffuse-type GC and for developing prognostic models (Kim2019Identification).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), NXPE2 is part of a group of alternative splicing-related signatures that could serve as predictive prognostic markers. These signatures are closely related to cancer metastasis and survival, indicating their potential clinical significance in CRC (Shi2021Alternative).

Additionally, NXPE2 has been associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Genetic studies have identified novel associations with NXPE2 gene variants, although the specific clinical significance of these variants requires further investigation (Redin2022Host). Despite these findings, the exact role of NXPE2 in these conditions remains to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to clarify its clinical implications.

## Interactions
NXPE2, a member of the neurexophilin and PC-esterase domain family, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that may influence synaptic function and erythropoiesis. In the context of murine erythroid lineages, NXPE2 interacts with murine glycophorin A (mGPA) to form a complex that is recognized by the TER-119 antibody. This interaction is crucial for the reactivity of TER-119, suggesting a potential role for NXPE2 in red blood cell biology (Keele2024Cotransfection).

NXPE2 has also been identified as a ligand for PDZ domains, which are significant in cellular signaling pathways. The ProP-PD approach has been used to profile interactions between PDZ domains and the C-termini of human proteins, including NXPE2. This method allows for the identification of specific dissociation constants between NXPE2 and various PDZ domains, highlighting its role in protein-protein interactions (Ivarsson2014Largescale).

The NXPE family, including NXPE2, is implicated in the gut-brain-microbiota axis, with expression patterns suggesting a role in gut function. However, specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Duek2018Exploring). Overall, NXPE2's interactions suggest its involvement in complex biological processes, including synaptic connectivity and erythropoiesis.
