# NDC80

## Overview
The NDC80 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which plays a vital role in chromosome segregation during cell division. The NDC80 protein, categorized as a kinetochore complex component, is part of a heterotetrameric structure that includes Ndc80, Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25. This complex is essential for the attachment of microtubules to kinetochores, ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Ustinov2020Protein; Wei2005Molecular). The NDC80 complex's interactions with other kinetochore proteins, such as the Mis12 and Ska complexes, enhance its microtubule-binding affinity and stabilize kinetochore-microtubule attachments (Ustinov2020Protein; Wimbish2019Coordination). Dysregulation of NDC80 expression has been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Zeng2020Involvement; Bièche2011Expression; Wei2020Bioinformatic).

## Structure
The NDC80 protein is a key component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. Structurally, NDC80 is part of a heterotetrameric complex composed of Ndc80, Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25. These subunits form two stable heterodimers: Ndc80:Nuf2 and Spc24:Spc25, which assemble into a rod-like structure approximately 57 nm in length (Wang2008Architecture; Valverde2016Conserved). The NDC80 protein features a coiled-coil domain that facilitates dimerization and a calponin homology (CH) domain, which is crucial for microtubule binding (Valverde2016Conserved; Ciferri2008Implications).

The NDC80 complex exhibits a kink in its coiled-coil region, located about 160 Å from the Ndc80/Nuf2 globular head, which is thought to be important for kinetochore geometry and tension sensing (Wang2008Architecture). The N-terminal region of NDC80 is highly positively charged, contributing to its interaction with microtubules, and is regulated by phosphorylation, particularly by Aurora B kinase, which affects its binding affinity (Ciferri2008Implications). The structural flexibility of the NDC80 complex, including its kink and tetramer junction, is conserved across species and is crucial for its function in kinetochore-microtubule interactions (Wang2008Architecture; Valverde2016Conserved).

## Function
The NDC80 complex is a critical component of the kinetochore, a structure that ensures proper chromosome segregation during mitosis by mediating the attachment of chromosomes to microtubules. This complex is conserved across eukaryotes and is essential for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, which are vital for maintaining genomic stability (Wei2005Molecular). The NDC80 complex consists of four proteins: Ndc80p, Nuf2p, Spc24p, and Spc25p, forming a heterotetrameric structure that links microtubule-binding proteins and checkpoint proteins to centromeric DNA-associated proteins (Wei2005Molecular).

In humans, the NDC80 complex interacts with other kinetochore proteins, such as the Mis12 complex and KNL1, to perform its functions. It is primarily attached to the kinetochore through the Mis12 complex, which connects NDC80 with KNL1 and CENP C, crucial for kinetochore localization (Ustinov2020Protein). The complex also interacts with the Ska complex, enhancing its microtubule binding affinity and playing a significant role in microtubule-kinetochore attachments (Ustinov2020Protein).

The NDC80 complex's interaction with microtubules is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects the stability of these attachments (Zaytsev2015Multisite). Its ability to form load-bearing attachments to dynamic microtubule tips is crucial for its function at kinetochores, allowing it to sustain forces similar to those experienced in vivo (Powers2009The). This complex is essential for the proper functioning of the spindle checkpoint, as its absence results in chromosome missegregation and checkpoint failure (McCleland2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NDC80 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In breast cancer, NDC80 is significantly upregulated in benign tumors and continues to increase in expression through ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive ductal grade III tumors, suggesting its role in early tumorigenicity and progression (Bièche2011Expression). The overexpression of NDC80 in breast tumors is associated with aneuploidy and chromosomal instability, which are common features in cancerous cells (Bièche2011Expression).

In NSCLC, particularly lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, NDC80 expression correlates with clinical features such as age, smoking status, and cancer stage. Higher expression levels are linked to poorer survival outcomes, making NDC80 a potential prognostic biomarker (Wei2020Bioinformatic).

In HCC, NDC80 is overexpressed and associated with reduced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, contributing to cancer progression. It interacts with NEK2 and CEP250, and genetic alterations in these genes are linked to shorter survival times in patients (Zeng2020Involvement). The dysregulation of NDC80 in these cancers highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
The NDC80 complex is a key component of the kinetochore, interacting with various proteins to facilitate chromosome segregation during mitosis. In humans, the NDC80 complex interacts with the Mis12 complex, which connects it to KNL1 and CENP C, linking to the centromere-specific histone CENP A (Ustinov2020Protein). The complex also interacts with the Ska complex, which includes Ska1, Ska2, and Ska3, enhancing NDC80's binding to microtubules and stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachments (Ustinov2020Protein; Wimbish2019Coordination). The Ska complex is recruited to the internal coiled-coil domain of the NDC80 complex, with Ska3 playing a crucial role in this interaction (Wimbish2019Coordination).

In yeast, the NDC80 complex interacts with the Dam1/DASH complex, which oligomerizes to form rings around microtubules, enhancing NDC80's binding and processivity (Ustinov2020Protein). The interaction between NDC80 and these complexes is regulated by phosphorylation, particularly by Aurora kinases, which modulate the complex's affinity for microtubules (Ustinov2020Protein). These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the kinetochore and the accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division.
