# FAM90A11

## Overview
FAM90A11 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, specifically member A11. This gene is part of a larger family of genes that are characterized by their conserved sequences, which suggest a shared evolutionary origin and potential functional similarities. The protein encoded by FAM90A11 is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological role remains to be fully elucidated. It is hypothesized to play a role in cellular signaling pathways, given its sequence similarity to other proteins with known signaling functions. Research into FAM90A11 and its encoded protein may provide insights into its involvement in specific cellular mechanisms and its potential implications in human health and disease.
