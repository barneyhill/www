# IL21

## Overview
Interleukin 21 (IL21) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 21, which is a member of the four-helix-bundle cytokine family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the immune system, influencing the activity of various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. The IL21 gene is located on chromosome 4q26-q27 and is primarily expressed in activated CD4+ T cells. The cytokine interleukin 21 is involved in numerous immune processes, such as promoting the expansion of CD8+ T cells, enhancing the cytolytic activity of NK cells, and regulating immunoglobulin production in B cells. It exerts its effects through interaction with the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common gamma chain (γc), activating signaling pathways like JAK/STAT. Dysregulation of IL21 has been implicated in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, making it a significant focus of research for therapeutic interventions (Leonard2008Interleukin; ParrishNovak2000Interleukin; Salzer2014Earlyonset).

## Structure
The IL21 protein is encoded by the human IL21 gene and is initially synthesized as a polypeptide precursor of 162 amino acids. After cleavage, it forms a mature protein with a molecular mass of approximately 15 kDa, consisting of a 131-residue four-helix-bundle cytokine domain (ParrishNovak2002Interleukin21; ParrishNovak2000Interleukin). This structural motif is common among interleukins and hematopoietic growth factors, facilitating its interaction with class I cytokine receptors (ParrishNovak2000Interleukin).

The IL21 protein shares significant homology with other cytokines such as IL2, IL4, and IL15, particularly in the four-helix-bundle structure. It shares two pairs of cysteine residues with IL15, one of which is conserved in IL2, IL4, and GMCSF, indicating structural similarities (ParrishNovak2000Interleukin). The protein's secondary structure includes predicted helical and beta-sheet regions, as indicated by computational predictions (Lee2010Expression).

The IL21 gene is located on chromosome 4q26-q27, close to the IL2 gene, suggesting a possible gene duplication event. The gene structure is similar to IL2, with both having four exons and similar intron positions, except for a small fourth intron in IL21 (ParrishNovak2002Interleukin21). The IL21 protein is primarily expressed in activated CD4+ T cells and is up-regulated during T cell activation (ParrishNovak2002Interleukin21).

## Function
Interleukin 21 (IL-21) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in the regulation of immune responses in healthy human cells. It is primarily produced by activated CD4+ T cells and influences the function of T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. IL-21 acts as a T cell comitogen, promoting the expansion of CD8+ T cells and enhancing the cytolytic activity of both CD8+ T cells and NK cells, which contributes to its antitumor effects (Leonard2008Interleukin).

In B cells, IL-21 is involved in immunoglobulin production and class switching, particularly to IgG1 and IgG3, and plays a role in plasma cell differentiation. It can induce both Bcl-6 and Blimp-1, transcription factors crucial for plasma cell differentiation, while also exerting a proapoptotic effect to eliminate autoreactive cells (Leonard2008Interleukin). IL-21 also modulates memory T cell functions and enhances primary T cell responses, similar to the effects of IL-2, IL-15, and IL-12 (ParrishNovak2002Interleukin21).

IL-21's receptor, IL-21R, is expressed on various immune cells, including B, T, and NK cells, and its expression is regulated by TCR signaling and cytokines like IL-21 itself (Leonard2008Interleukin). The cytokine is involved in activating several signaling pathways, including Jak1, Jak3, and the STAT proteins, primarily activating Stat3 and Stat1 (Leonard2008Interleukin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL21 gene are associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Elevated IL-21 levels have been observed in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and polymorphisms in the IL21 and IL21R genes have been linked to increased susceptibility to SLE (Leonard2008Interleukin; Li2010Interleukin21). In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), IL-21 is implicated in disease pathogenesis due to its pro-inflammatory properties, and blocking the IL-21/IL-21R pathway has shown therapeutic potential (Yuan2010Targeting). IL-21 is also overexpressed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, contributing to gut inflammation (Monteleone2009Interleukin21).

IL-21 deficiency can lead to primary immunodeficiencies, characterized by recurrent infections and impaired immune responses. A specific mutation in the IL21 gene has been identified as a cause of early-onset IBD and a common variable immunodeficiency-like disease, highlighting the critical role of IL-21 in immune regulation (Salzer2014Earlyonset). These findings underscore the dual role of IL-21 in both promoting and suppressing immune responses, making it a potential therapeutic target for various immune-mediated diseases (Leonard2016IL21).

## Interactions
Interleukin 21 (IL21) interacts with its receptor complex, which consists of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common gamma chain (γc). This interaction is crucial for the activation of several signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT pathway. IL-21 binds to IL-21R with a high affinity, forming a binary complex, and subsequently recruits γc to form a ternary complex. This recruitment significantly enhances the binding affinity of γc to IL-21, suggesting an allosteric mechanism or direct contact between IL-21R and γc (Zhang2003Human).

The γc chain is essential for IL-21-induced signaling, particularly for the activation of JAK1 and JAK3 kinases, which subsequently lead to the phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins, including STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 (Habib2002The; Leonard2008Interleukin). The interaction between IL-21 and γc is specific, as demonstrated by the inability of γc to dimerize with IL-21R in the presence of other cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, or IL-15 (ParrishNovak2002Interleukin21).

IL-21 also influences the proliferation and differentiation of immune cells, such as B cells, T cells, and NK cells, through its interactions with these receptor components (ParrishNovak2000Interleukin). The IL-21/IL-21R/γc complex is a critical mediator of immune cell signaling and function.
