# CCDC160

## Overview
The CCDC160 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 160 protein, which is characterized by its structural motif of coiled-coil domains. These domains are integral to the protein's function, as they facilitate the formation of supercoiled structures through the interaction of alpha-helices. The coiled-coil domains are defined by a heptad repeat pattern, which contributes to the protein's stability and specificity through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Mason2004Coiled; Li2015Critical). The CCDC160 protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological roles and interactions remain an area of active research. Computational tools are employed to predict the structural characteristics of CCDC160, providing insights into its potential functions and interactions within the cell (Li2015Critical).

## Structure
The CCDC160 protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs involving two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other to form a supercoil. These domains are defined by a repeating heptad motif, typically denoted as (a-b-c-d-e-f-g), where hydrophobic residues are found at positions a and d, and charged residues at e and g, contributing to the stability and specificity of the coiled-coil structure (Mason2004Coiled; Li2015Critical).

The oligomeric state of coiled-coil domains can vary, forming dimers, trimers, or tetramers, depending on the specific sequence and arrangement of residues. The stability of these structures is largely influenced by hydrophobic interactions at the core positions and electrostatic interactions at the e and g positions (Mason2004Coiled).

Computational methods such as COILS, PCOILS, and Paircoil2 are used to predict the presence and oligomeric state of coiled-coil domains in proteins like CCDC160. These methods utilize amino-acid profiles and pairwise residue correlations to classify coiled-coil regions, aiding in the understanding of the protein's molecular structure (Li2015Critical).
