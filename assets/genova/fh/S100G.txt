# S100G

## Overview
S100G is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein G, also known as calbindin D9k, which is a member of the S100 family of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its monomeric structure and high affinity for calcium ions, distinguishing it from other S100 proteins that typically function as calcium sensors. S100G plays a crucial role in modulating intracellular calcium levels, primarily acting as a calcium buffer in tissues such as the intestine and kidneys, where it facilitates calcium absorption and transport. The protein's structure includes two EF-hand motifs, which are essential for its calcium-binding capabilities, and it undergoes conformational changes upon calcium binding that are critical for its function. S100G's ability to interact with phospholipids suggests a role in intracellular transport, although it does not have known extracellular functions (Donato2012Functions; Permyakov2020Mouse).

## Structure
The S100G protein, also known as calbindin D9k, is a monomeric protein consisting of 79 amino acids and is part of the S100 sub-family of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. It contains two EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that bind calcium ions. In mouse S100G, these EF-hands are located at residues 13-48 and 45-79. The N-terminal EF-hand has a low-affinity calcium-binding site, while the C-terminal EF-hand has a high-affinity site and is canonical. The N-terminal EF-hand includes two additional residues, a feature shared with other S100 proteins (Permyakov2020Mouse).

The overall three-dimensional structure of S100G is described as a four-helix bundle, with hydrophobic interactions among the helices and several essential hydrogen bonds within the calcium-binding loops. Calcium binding induces structural changes, particularly in helices III and IV, and causes rigidification of α-helices II and III (Permyakov2020Mouse). The protein lacks tryptophan residues, as indicated by its UV absorption and fluorescence spectra (Permyakov2020Mouse). S100G does not form a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer (Permyakov2020Mouse). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation.

## Function
S100G, also known as calbindin-D9k, is a unique member of the S100 protein family, characterized by its monomeric structure and high calcium-binding affinity. Unlike other S100 proteins, which typically function as Ca2+-sensor proteins, S100G acts primarily as a Ca2+-modulator. Its main role is to buffer cytosolic calcium ions (Ca2+) in various tissues, particularly in the intestine and kidneys, where it facilitates calcium absorption and transport (Donato2012Functions).

S100G interacts with phospholipids, which may aid in the transport of S100 proteins through cellular membranes, although no extracellular functions have been reported for this protein (Donato2012Functions). The protein's ability to bind calcium ions allows it to regulate intracellular calcium levels, impacting cellular processes such as signal transduction and muscle contraction. This function is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis within cells, influencing various biological processes and organismal outcomes (Donato2012Functions).

S100G's role as a cytosolic Ca2+ buffer highlights its importance in modulating calcium adsorption, which is vital for the proper functioning of cells and tissues where it is expressed (Donato2012Functions).
