# DRC1

## Overview
The DRC1 gene encodes the dynein regulatory complex subunit 1, a critical component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) involved in ciliary and flagellar motility. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating dynein motor activity, which is essential for the conversion of microtubule sliding into the bending motion necessary for ciliary and flagellar movement (Heuser2009The). As a coiled-coil protein, DRC1 forms a complex with DRC2, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the N-DRC by stabilizing its assembly on the doublet microtubule (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). Mutations in the DRC1 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia and other health conditions, underscoring its importance in maintaining proper ciliary function and overall cellular motility (Pereira2023Characterization; Bower2018DRC2CCDC65).

## Function
DRC1, a component of the dynein regulatory complex (DRC), plays a crucial role in the regulation of ciliary and flagellar motility. It is involved in the modulation of dynein motor activity, which is essential for converting microtubule sliding into the bending motion necessary for ciliary and flagellar movement (Heuser2009The). DRC1 is part of the core structure of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), forming a scaffold with other subunits like DRC2 and DRC4. This scaffold is vital for the structural integrity and function of cilia, as it stabilizes the N-DRC and contributes to mechano-regulatory signal transmission (Ghanaeian2023Integrated).

In healthy human cells, DRC1 is active in the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, where it helps maintain proper cellular locomotion and fluid movement across epithelial surfaces (Heuser2009The). The DRC1/2 heterodimer is crucial for the assembly and positioning of the N-DRC on the doublet microtubule, interacting with other coiled-coil proteins to ensure the structural integrity and function of cilia (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). Mutations in DRC1 can lead to defects in ciliary movement, highlighting its importance in maintaining ciliary function (Bower2018DRC2CCDC65).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DRC1 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by defects in the motility of cilia. This condition leads to chronic respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis, and reduced fertility due to impaired ciliary function. In females, DRC1 mutations can cause infertility by affecting the motility of cilia in the fallopian tubes, which is crucial for embryo transport. This was highlighted in a study where a DRC1 null variant was linked to female infertility, marking the first such association, as DRC1 variants were previously only linked to male infertility due to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) (Pereira2023Characterization).

The DRC1 gene is also implicated in congenital heart disease (CHD), as demonstrated by a case report identifying compound heterozygous variations in DRC1 in a neonate with congenital bilateral coronary artery fistulas (Su2022A). Additionally, variations in DRC1 have been associated with severe outcomes in COVID-19, suggesting a broader impact on pulmonary health (Sypniewski2022Gene).

Alterations in DRC1 expression, such as reduced mRNA and protein levels, have been observed in patients with PCD, contributing to the absence of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) and inner dynein arms (IDA) in cilia, which are critical for normal ciliary function (Pereira2023Characterization).

## Interactions
DRC1, also known as CCDC164, is a core component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), which is crucial for ciliary motility. It forms a coiled-coil structure with DRC2 (CCDC65), and this DRC1/2 complex is essential for the assembly and positioning of the N-DRC on the doublet microtubule (DMT) (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). DRC1 interacts intimately with DRC2, forming a subcomplex that is critical for the structural integrity of the N-DRC base plate (Pereira2023Characterization). The absence of DRC1 or DRC2 leads to reduced densities for the entire N-DRC base plate, including the DRC4 subunit (Pereira2023Characterization).

DRC1 also interacts with other proteins within the N-DRC, such as DRC4, DRC5, and DRC8, contributing to the assembly and function of the complex (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). It is involved in stabilizing connections to the central pair complex and radial spokes, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the axoneme (Bower2018DRC2CCDC65). The interactions of DRC1 with these proteins are crucial for the proper function of motile axonemes, and mutations in DRC1 can lead to defects in ciliary movement (Viswanadha2017Ciliary).
