# H2AC8

## Overview
The H2AC8 gene encodes the H2A clustered histone 8 protein, a variant of the histone H2A family, which plays a crucial role in the structural organization of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histones are essential for the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, thereby regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. The H2A clustered histone 8 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, replication, and transcriptional regulation. As a histone variant, it contributes to the dynamic nature of chromatin, influencing chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modifications. The expression and regulation of H2AC8 have been implicated in cancer biology, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and prognosis (Hekmatshoar2024The; Ragusa2023Contribution; Espiritu2021Molecular).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The H2AC8 gene, encoding a variant of the histone H2A protein, plays a significant role in cancer progression and prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma, underexpression of H2AC8 is correlated with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. This underexpression may be influenced by differential DNA methylation, with hypermethylation of the H2AC8 gene associated with adverse outcomes in certain cancers (Espiritu2021Molecular). 

In the context of genomic stability, downregulation of H2AC8 has been linked to increased genomic instability in cancers such as giant cell tumor of bone stromal cells. This suggests that H2AC8 deregulation contributes to chromosomal instability and cancer progression (Ragusa2023Contribution). 

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, H2AC8 is downregulated in cells treated with olaparib, a PARP inhibitor. However, the specific clinical significance of H2AC8 in breast cancer remains underexplored, indicating a need for further research to elucidate its role in cancer prognosis and treatment (Hekmatshoar2024The). These findings highlight the importance of H2AC8 in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
