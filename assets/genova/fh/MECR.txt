# MECR

## Overview
The MECR gene encodes the mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a reductase and plays a crucial role in the production of lipoic acid, a cofactor necessary for the function of several mitochondrial enzyme complexes. The MECR protein is a homodimeric enzyme located in the mitochondrial matrix, where it contributes to lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Structurally, it features a catalytic domain with a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a cofactor-binding domain with a Rossmann fold, essential for NADPH binding (Chen2008Structural). Mutations in the MECR gene can lead to significant developmental and neurological disorders, such as MEPAN syndrome, characterized by childhood-onset dystonia and optic atrophy (Heimer2016MECR). The enzyme's interactions with LYRM adapter proteins and acyl carrier proteins are vital for mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly and function, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and cellular energy production (Chen2008Structural; Rahman2023An).

## Structure
The MECR protein, also known as mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, is a homodimeric enzyme involved in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis. Each monomer of MECR consists of a catalytic domain and a cofactor-binding domain. The catalytic domain is characterized by a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, with helices contributing to the NADPH binding site and the fatty acyl binding pocket (Chen2008Structural). The cofactor-binding domain features a Rossmann fold, formed by two mononucleotide binding βαβαβ motifs, which is crucial for NADPH binding (Chen2008Structural).

The MECR protein structure includes a deep, curved fatty acyl binding pocket extending from the catalytic site, shaped by various residues such as Ile129, Glu107, and Lys316 (Chen2008Structural). This pocket can accommodate fatty acyl tails of up to 16 carbons, essential for substrate recognition and binding (Chen2008Structural). The protein's quaternary structure is maintained through interactions at the dimer interface, primarily involving β-strands and an α-helix (Chen2008Structural).

Mutations in MECR, such as the G165Q variant, can alter the protein's substrate binding capabilities by affecting hydrogen bonding and the conformation of nearby residues, leading to a more confined binding pocket (Rahman2023An). These structural features and mutations highlight the importance of MECR in mitochondrial function and its role in the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids.

## Function
The MECR gene encodes the mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, an enzyme crucial for the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) pathway. This pathway is essential for the production of lipoic acid, a cofactor necessary for the activity of several enzyme complexes within the mitochondrial respiratory chain, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (Heimer2016MECR). MECR is involved in the reduction of enoyl-ACP to saturated acyl-ACP, a critical step in mtFAS, which supports mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism (Nair2017Genetic).

In healthy human cells, MECR plays a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production by ensuring the proper assembly and function of respiratory complexes (Heimer2016MECR). The enzyme is active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it contributes to lipid metabolism and cellular energy homeostasis (Heimer2016MECR). Disruption of MECR function can lead to a loss of lipoylated proteins, affecting cellular respiration and leading to significant developmental and neurological issues (Nair2017Genetic; Heimer2016MECR). The gene's role extends to potential involvement in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-dependent signaling, although this aspect remains debated (Heimer2016MECR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MECR gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, primarily characterized by childhood-onset dystonia and optic atrophy. This condition, known as MEPAN syndrome (mitochondrial enoyl CoA reductase protein-associated neurodegeneration), is marked by basal ganglia degeneration and optic atrophy, while cognition remains relatively preserved (Heimer2016MECR). The disorder is linked to various mutations, including nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations, which lead to protein instability and mild respiratory defects (Heimer2016MECR).

A specific missense mutation, p.Arg258Trp, has been associated with a condition resembling Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), characterized by visual loss and central scotoma. This variant is ultra-rare and has been observed in compound heterozygosity with loss-of-function variants in families with MECR dysfunction (Fiorini2023RecessiveMECRpathogenic). The mutation leads to decreased MECR protein levels and impaired oxidative phosphorylation, affecting mitochondrial function (Fiorini2023RecessiveMECRpathogenic).

Loss of MECR function also impacts iron metabolism and ceramide levels, leading to neurodegenerative disorders. The loss results in elevated ceramide levels and impaired Fe-S cluster biogenesis, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal damage (Dutta2023A; Dutta2023Loss). These findings highlight the critical role of MECR in maintaining mitochondrial and neuronal health.

## Interactions
MECR, or mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and participates in various protein interactions essential for mitochondrial function. MECR is known to interact with LYRM adapter proteins, which are crucial for the assembly and function of respiratory chain components, mitoribosomes, and iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. These interactions facilitate the formation of acyl-ACP-LYRM protein complexes, which are vital for the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory complexes (Rahman2023An).

The enzyme's structure reveals a deep pocket for binding fatty acyl groups, with a pantetheine binding cleft extending to an adjacent monomer, suggesting a potential ACP-binding groove. This structural feature indicates that MECR may engage in interactions with acyl carrier proteins (Chen2008Structural).

Mutations in MECR, such as the p.Arg258Trp variant, have been shown to affect the synthesis of lipoic acid, a cofactor for several mitochondrial enzyme complexes, thereby impacting mitochondrial function and increasing sensitivity to oxidative stress. This suggests that MECR's interactions are critical for maintaining mitochondrial processes and energy production (Fiorini2023RecessiveMECRpathogenic).
