# STK17B

## Overview
STK17B is a gene that encodes the protein serine/threonine kinase 17b, also known as DRAK2, which is a member of the death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) family. This protein is categorized as a serine/threonine kinase and plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle processes, particularly within the immune system. It is predominantly expressed in mature T-and B-cells and is abundant in lymphoid organs, indicating its significant role in immune function (Picado2020A). The STK17B protein is involved in various cellular interactions and signaling pathways, including those related to cancer progression and immune regulation. Its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with microRNAs, which influence its function in cellular stress responses and disease pathogenesis (Farag2018Death‐associated; Lan2018STK17B).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the STK17B protein, also known as DRAK2, is characterized by its kinase domain, which is crucial for its function as a serine/threonine kinase. The primary structure of STK17B consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with the kinase domain spanning amino acids 25-329 (Picado2020A). The secondary structure includes regions that form alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of kinase domains, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of STK17B involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which includes a unique P-loop conformation. This P-loop is a flexible region within the kinase catalytic domain and plays a significant role in the protein's selectivity and binding affinity for inhibitors. The P-loop can adopt two conformations, folded (A) and extended (B), which are critical for its interaction with inhibitors (Picado2020A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in kinases like STK17B, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. There is no information provided about splice variant isoforms or quaternary structure interactions in the available context.

## Function
STK17B, also known as serine/threonine kinase 17b, is a member of the death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) family, which is part of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated kinases (CAMK) group. It is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. STK17B is predominantly expressed in mature T-and B-cells and is abundant in lymphoid organs, indicating its role in immune function (Picado2020A).

In terms of molecular activity, STK17B is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates target proteins, influencing signal transduction pathways. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, playing a role in cellular stress responses (Farag2018Death‐associated). The kinase is involved in regulating apoptosis, a critical process during spermatogenesis, although its expression does not differ significantly in cases of knobbed acrosome defect in pigs, suggesting a conserved role in apoptosis regulation (Sironen2010Knobbed).

STK17B's role in immune regulation is highlighted by studies showing that its loss can protect against autoimmune challenges, suggesting it reduces the survival of autoreactive T-cells (Picado2020A). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific function of STK17B in healthy human cells remains less well understood.

## Clinical Significance
STK17B, also known as DRAK2, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), STK17B is upregulated, promoting tumor progression and metastasis through the AKT/GSK-3β/Snail signaling pathway, which is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. High STK17B expression, combined with low levels of miR-455-3p, correlates with poor prognosis in HCC patients (Lan2018STK17B).

In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), an epistatic interaction between STK17B and the PAX8 gene has been identified, suggesting a role in cancer susceptibility. This interaction is characterized by an inverse correlation between the expression of PAX8 and STK17B, indicating that these genes may influence PTC risk through complex genetic interactions (Landa2013An).

STK17B is also highlighted as a potential biomarker in osteoarthritis and myelodysplastic syndrome, with differential expression trends observed in these conditions. In myelodysplastic syndrome, STK17B is downregulated, and genetic variation analysis has shown a low frequency of alterations, primarily missense mutations (Xin2023Bioinformatics). These findings underscore the clinical significance of STK17B in various diseases.

## Interactions
STK17B, also known as DRAK2, is a serine/threonine kinase that participates in various cellular interactions, particularly in the context of cancer progression and immune regulation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), STK17B is involved in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through its interaction with the AKT/GSK-3β/Snail signaling pathway. This interaction enhances the expression of mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin and Vimentin while reducing the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, thereby facilitating metastasis (Lan2018STK17B).

STK17B is also regulated by microRNA interactions, specifically with miR-455-3p, which acts as an upstream suppressor. The expression of miR-455-3p is inversely correlated with STK17B levels in HCC, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that influences cancer progression and patient prognosis (Lan2018STK17B).

In the context of thyroid cancer, STK17B interacts with the PAX8 gene, where an inverse correlation between their expressions has been observed. This interaction is significant in the susceptibility to papillary thyroid cancer, highlighting the role of STK17B in genetic predisposition to certain cancers (Landa2013An).
