# SIRT4

## Overview
SIRT4 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial protein sirtuin 4, which is a member of the sirtuin family characterized by its NAD+-dependent deacylase activity. Sirtuin 4 is primarily involved in the regulation of metabolic processes, including insulin secretion and mitochondrial glutamine metabolism, and plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and genomic stability. As a mitochondrial protein, sirtuin 4 functions as an ADP-ribosyltransferase and interacts with various proteins to modulate cellular responses to metabolic and stress signals. The protein's structure, featuring a conserved catalytic core and unique isoform-specific elements, facilitates its role in substrate recognition and regulation. SIRT4 has been implicated in several diseases, notably acting as a tumor suppressor in cancer and influencing metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity (Jeong2013SIRT4; Ahuja2007Regulation; Han2019SIRT4).

## Structure
SIRT4 is a mitochondrial protein that belongs to the sirtuin family, characterized by its NAD+-dependent deacylase activity. The primary structure of SIRT4 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the SIRT4 gene. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a catalytic core domain typical of sirtuins (Pannek2017Crystal).

The tertiary structure of SIRT4 features a conserved catalytic core comprising a Rossmann-fold subdomain and a Zn2+-binding module. The acylated substrate and NAD+ bind to a cleft between these subdomains, with isoform-specific features influencing substrate acyl binding (Pannek2017Crystal). SIRT4 has a unique loop, referred to as the 'Sirt4-loop,' located in the Zn2+-binding module, which is absent in other sirtuin isoforms. This loop affects substrate binding and active site dynamics (Pannek2017Crystal).

SIRT4 functions primarily as a monomer and lacks significant quaternary structure. It may undergo post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation. The protein's structure is adaptable, with specific channels and loops that accommodate various substrate modifications, contributing to its isoform-specific acyl recognition and regulation features (Pannek2017Crystal).

## Function
SIRT4 is a mitochondrial sirtuin protein that plays a significant role in regulating various metabolic processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily localized in the mitochondria and functions as an ADP-ribosyltransferase, influencing cellular energy homeostasis and stress responses (Wang2020Functions; Ahuja2007Regulation). SIRT4 is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion by interacting with proteins such as the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and ATP/ADP translocase (ANT2), negatively regulating insulin release in response to glucose (Ahuja2007Regulation). 

SIRT4 also plays a role in mitochondrial glutamine metabolism, particularly in response to DNA damage. It inhibits glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity, thereby reducing glutamine metabolism, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and suppressing tumorigenesis (Jeong2013SIRT4). Additionally, SIRT4 is involved in regulating microtubule dynamics during mitosis by interacting with microtubule-associated proteins and decreasing acetyl-α-tubulin levels, which affects microtubule stability and cell cycle progression (Bergmann2020Subcellular). These functions highlight SIRT4's role in cellular metabolism, energy regulation, and maintaining genomic integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SIRT4 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and metabolic disorders. In cancer, SIRT4 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting mitochondrial glutamine metabolism, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation. Reduced expression of SIRT4 is observed in several cancers, including breast, lung, colon, and gastric cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumorigenesis (Jeong2013SIRT4; Shi2016Decreased). SIRT4's role in regulating glutamine metabolism and DNA damage response is critical for maintaining genomic stability, and its loss can lead to increased tumor formation (Jeong2013SIRT4).

In metabolic diseases, SIRT4 is linked to conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It regulates insulin secretion and lipid metabolism, and its decreased expression is associated with altered lipid profiles and metabolic parameters in these conditions (Han2019SIRT4). In type 2 diabetes, SIRT4 represses glutamate dehydrogenase activity, potentially offering protection against disease development (Han2019SIRT4). These findings highlight the complex roles of SIRT4 in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SIRT4 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is known to repress insulin secretion by modifying glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) through ADP-ribosylation, which inhibits GDH activity and affects amino acid metabolism in the pancreas, liver, and brain (Han2019SIRT4). SIRT4 also interacts with the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and the ADP/ATP carrier protein ANT2, influencing insulin secretion in response to glucose (Han2019SIRT4).

In the context of cancer, SIRT4 interacts with glutaminase (GLS) to regulate the AKT/GSK3β/CyclinD1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and metabolism in colorectal cancer cells. SIRT4 overexpression decreases GLS levels, thereby suppressing this signaling pathway (Cui2020SIRT4).

SIRT4 also interacts with C-RAF kinase, a component of the MAPK signaling pathway. It binds specifically to the inactive form of C-RAF, phosphorylated at serine 259, and inhibits MAPK signaling by stabilizing the inactive form of C-RAF, preventing its activation (Mehrabipour2024SIRT4; Mehrabipour2023Identification). This interaction involves the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of C-RAF and the C-terminal region of SIRT4 (Mehrabipour2023Identification).
