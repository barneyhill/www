# KDM2A

## Overview
KDM2A is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 2A, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of histone demethylases. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in epigenetic regulation by specifically demethylating dimethylated lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me2), thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Frescas2008KDM2A; Liu2021Histone). The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a JmjC domain essential for its catalytic activity, a CXXC zinc finger domain for DNA binding, and a PHD finger domain for nucleosome recognition (Borgel2016KDM2A; Cheng2014A). KDM2A is involved in various cellular processes, such as transcriptional repression of centromeric satellite repeats and regulation of ribosomal RNA transcription, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Tanaka2010JmjC; Frescas2008KDM2A). Its dysregulation has been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in oncology (Wei2018Epigenetic; Wagner2013KDM2A).

## Structure
KDM2A is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function as a histone demethylase. The protein contains a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is crucial for its demethylase activity, specifically targeting lower methylation states of H3K36 (Cheng2014A). The JmjC domain coordinates metal ions such as Ni2+ or Fe2+, which are essential for its catalytic function (Cheng2014A). 

KDM2A also includes a CXXC zinc finger domain, which facilitates binding to nonmethylated CpG DNA, and a PHD finger domain, which is involved in nucleosome recognition (Borgel2016KDM2A; Cheng2014A). The protein's structure is further defined by a unique insertion loop between the α3 and α4 helices, which is critical for recognizing methylated lysines in the H3K36 sequence (Cheng2014A).

The molecular structure of KDM2A involves a U-shaped channel that accommodates the H3K36me2 peptide, with specific intermolecular contacts stabilizing the interaction (Cheng2014A). The protein undergoes conformational changes upon peptide binding, transitioning from a disordered to an ordered state, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Cheng2014A). 

KDM2A can exist in different splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
KDM2A, also known as lysine demethylase 2A, is a JmjC-domain containing enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It specifically demethylates dimethylated lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me2), which is important for transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling (Frescas2008KDM2A; Liu2021Histone). KDM2A is involved in the transcriptional repression of centromeric satellite repeats, which is essential for maintaining the heterochromatic state and ensuring proper chromosome segregation during mitosis (Frescas2008KDM2A).

In addition to its role in heterochromatin maintenance, KDM2A regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription by binding to the rDNA promoter and reducing H3K36me1/2 marks, particularly under conditions such as starvation (Tanaka2010JmjC). This activity is crucial for controlling ribosome biogenesis and cellular growth (Tanaka2010JmjC). KDM2A also interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), contributing to the stability of HP1 on chromatin and maintaining centromeric integrity (Frescas2008KDM2A). These functions highlight KDM2A's role in genomic stability and its potential impact on preventing genomic instability, which can lead to cancer development (Frescas2008KDM2A).

## Clinical Significance
KDM2A (lysine demethylase 2A) has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in epigenetic regulation. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), KDM2A is frequently overexpressed, promoting tumor growth and invasiveness by enhancing ERK1/2 signaling through the repression of DUSP3 expression. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and may result from gene amplification (Wagner2013KDM2A). In early-stage NSCLC, DNA methylation changes at specific CpG sites in KDM2A correlate with patient survival, suggesting its potential as an epigenetic biomarker (Wei2018Epigenetic).

In breast cancer, KDM2A is often amplified and overexpressed, particularly in the Luminal B subtype. The short isoform of KDM2A, which lacks the JmjC domain, is associated with oncogenic activities and shorter patient survival (Liu2015Integrated). KDM2A expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in breast cancer is linked to tumor growth and poor clinical outcomes, as it promotes fibroblast senescence and cytokine release, enhancing cancer cell proliferation (Chen2020Lysine).

Mutations in the HP1 binding motif of KDM2A, such as those found in intestinal cancer, can impair its interaction with HP1, potentially deregulating its function and contributing to cancer progression (Borgel2016KDM2A).

## Interactions
KDM2A interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) isoforms through a specific LxVxL motif, which binds to the chromo shadow domain (CSD) of HP1. Mutations in this motif, such as V801A/L803A, disrupt the interaction with HP1α, as do mutations in the CSD of HP1α (I165K and W174A) (Borgel2016KDM2A). KDM2A is recruited to H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes by HP1α, independent of DNA binding, and this recruitment is mediated by the LxVxL motif (Borgel2016KDM2A). The interaction with HP1 is crucial for KDM2A's function during early embryonic development, as demonstrated in zebrafish embryos (Borgel2016KDM2A).

KDM2A also interacts with nucleosomes through its JmjC domain, which engages with the H3K36 site, requiring DNA unwrapping for interaction. This interaction is sensitive to the length of nucleosomal DNA, with longer DNA showing higher affinity (Spangler2023Structural). The CxxC domain of KDM2A may bind to CpG dinucleotides in linker DNA, influencing its binding affinity (Spangler2023Structural). KDM2A's interaction with nucleosomes is also affected by specific arginine residues, particularly R13, which are critical for binding to the nucleosome's acidic patch (Spangler2023Structural).
