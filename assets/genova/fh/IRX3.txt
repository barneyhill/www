# IRX3

## Overview
IRX3 is a gene that encodes the iroquois homeobox 3 protein, a transcription factor involved in various developmental and physiological processes. This protein plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the central nervous system and cardiac structures. It is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in regulating gene expression. IRX3 is highly expressed in the brain, where it influences energy homeostasis, and is also involved in metabolic regulation by promoting the browning of white adipose tissue, thereby enhancing energy expenditure and influencing body mass (Smemo2014Obesity-associated). Additionally, IRX3 is essential for nephron development in the kidneys, contributing to the formation of intermediate tubules (Reggiani2007The). The gene's expression is modulated by enhancers within the FTO gene region, linking it to obesity risk (Smemo2014Obesity-associated). IRX3's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in diseases such as leukemia and cardiac arrhythmias, where its aberrant expression or mutations can have profound pathological effects (Koizumi2015Genetic; Rahman2024Focal).

## Function
The IRX3 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various molecular processes and cellular functions. In healthy human cells, IRX3 is involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly influencing the formation of the central nervous system and cardiac development. It is highly expressed in the brain, especially in regions such as the arcuate nucleus and median eminence of the hypothalamus, which are critical for energy homeostasis (Smemo2014Obesity-associated).

IRX3 is also implicated in the regulation of body mass and composition. It affects metabolic processes by promoting the browning of white adipose tissue and activating brown adipose tissue, which enhances energy expenditure. This function is crucial for maintaining energy balance and preventing obesity (Smemo2014Obesity-associated). The gene's expression is influenced by noncoding sequences within the FTO gene, which are associated with obesity risk, indicating a genetic component to its role in metabolism (Smemo2014Obesity-associated).

In addition to its role in metabolism, IRX3 is involved in nephron development, directing the identity of nephron segments in the kidney. It is necessary for the formation of intermediate tubules, which are essential for proper kidney function (Reggiani2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IRX3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of leukemia and cardiac arrhythmias. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), IRX3 is aberrantly expressed, suggesting it may function as an oncogene. This misexpression is observed in a significant proportion of T-ALL cases and is associated with a differentiation block in T-lineage cells, contributing to the accumulation of immature blast cells (Somerville2018Derepression; Rahman2024Focal). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IRX3 is frequently co-expressed with HOX genes, and its high expression is linked to mutations in genes such as NPM1 and FLT3, further contributing to a differentiation block (Somerville2018Derepression).

In the realm of cardiac health, IRX3 mutations have been associated with lethal cardiac arrhythmias, including idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF). Studies have identified specific IRX3 mutations in patients with VF, suggesting these genetic defects may disrupt the His-Purkinje system, leading to arrhythmias and increased risk of sudden cardiac death (Koizumi2015Genetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IRX3 in both hematological malignancies and cardiac conditions.

## Interactions
IRX3 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in various biological processes. In the context of the ventricular conduction system (VCS) in mice, IRX3 forms a transcriptional complex with the transcription factors Nkx2.5 and Tbx5. This complex is essential for the regulation of gene expression related to the development and function of the VCS. The interaction between IRX3 and these transcription factors is critical for the expression of VCS-enriched genes, which are important for the maturation and structural integrity of the VCS (Kim2016Irx3).

IRX3 also interacts with enhancers that regulate its expression from a distance. These enhancers, located within the FTO gene region, target IRX3 and IRX5, influencing gene expression in tissues such as adipose and brain. This interaction is part of a chromatin compaction model where the obesity-associated locus physically interacts with IRX3, impacting metabolic processes (Sobreira2021Extensive).

In the context of cellulose synthesis in Arabidopsis, IRX3 interacts with other CesA proteins, specifically IRX1 and IRX5, forming a protein complex essential for cellulose synthesis. This interaction is necessary for the proper assembly and function of the cellulose synthase complex (Taylor2003Interactions).
