# PTK7

## Overview
PTK7, or protein tyrosine kinase 7, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and cell signaling pathways. The protein encoded by PTK7, also referred to as protein tyrosine kinase 7 (inactive), is characterized by an inactive intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, distinguishing it from other kinases. Despite its lack of catalytic activity, PTK7 plays a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathways, particularly in planar cell polarity (PCP) and non-canonical Wnt signaling, which are essential for cell polarity, movement, and migration (Martinez2015The; Berger2017PTK7). The protein's structure includes seven immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a juxtamembrane region, facilitating its interactions with various proteins and its involvement in complex signaling networks (Golubkov2012Insights). PTK7's functional significance is underscored by its involvement in diseases such as cancer and congenital disorders, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Gärtner2014PTK; Su2021The).

## Structure
Protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) is a receptor protein characterized by a catalytically inactive intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The protein is composed of 1070 amino acids and features a complex structure that includes several distinct regions. The extracellular portion of PTK7 contains seven immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, spanning residues 31 to 684, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Golubkov2012Insights). Following the Ig domains is a stalk region (residues 685-704), a transmembrane domain (residues 705-725), and a juxtamembrane region (residues 726-795) (Golubkov2012Insights). The intracellular domain, although structurally similar to active kinases, lacks catalytic activity.

PTK7 undergoes post-translational modifications, including proteolytic processing by MT1-MMP and ADAM proteinases, which results in the generation of soluble and membrane-associated fragments (Golubkov2012Insights). This proteolysis is crucial for its role in cell motility and metastasis. PTK7 is also a glycoprotein, indicating the presence of glycosylation, which may influence its function and distribution on the cell membrane (Chen2020Organization). The protein's spatial organization on cell membranes is influenced by lipid rafts and the actin cytoskeleton, particularly on the basal membrane (Chen2020Organization).

## Function
PTK7 (protein tyrosine kinase 7) is a transmembrane receptor involved in the Wnt signaling pathways, playing a significant role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. In healthy human cells, PTK7 is primarily active in the cell membrane and is crucial for regulating planar cell polarity (PCP) and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, which are essential for cell polarity, movement, and migration (Martinez2015The; Berger2017PTK7). PTK7 interacts with Wnt ligands and receptors, such as ROR2 and WNT5A, forming complexes that activate downstream signaling cascades like the JNK pathway, which is important for cell motility and wound healing (Martinez2015The).

PTK7's extracellular domain is crucial for its function, facilitating interactions with other proteins and contributing to its role in PCP signaling. This domain is involved in homophilic binding and clustering at cell-cell contact sites, which is important for contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) in neural crest cells, a process that regulates cell migration and invasion (Grund2021Ptk7). PTK7 also modulates canonical Wnt signaling by interacting with components like LRP6, influencing β-catenin activity and transcriptional events necessary for proper cellular and developmental processes (Puppo2010Protein; Berger2017PTK7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTK7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and congenital disorders. In breast cancer, PTK7 is overexpressed, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor growth and metastasis. High PTK7 expression correlates with advanced TNM stages and lymph node metastasis, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in TNBC (Shin2023Knockdown; Cui2021Protein; Gärtner2014PTK).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), a novel germline variant, V354M, in PTK7 has been identified, which enhances PTK7 protein expression and is linked to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This variant affects the Wnt signaling pathway, contributing to CRC pathogenesis (Miao2022Whole-Exome).

PTK7 mutations are also associated with congenital scoliosis (CS) and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Loss-of-function and hypomorphic variants in PTK7 have been found in patients with these conditions, suggesting a role in vertebral development and skeletal abnormalities (Su2021The).

Overall, PTK7's involvement in these diseases highlights its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PTK7 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the WNT/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. It forms a complex with the receptor ROR2, but not with ROR1, through its extracellular region. This interaction is crucial for WNT5A-induced signaling, leading to the phosphorylation of JNK, a downstream effector, and is necessary for cell migration in wound healing assays (Martinez2015The). PTK7 also interacts with the noncanonical WNT ligand WNT5A independently of ROR2, with its extracellular loops 4-7 being essential for optimal binding (Martinez2015The).

In the context of neural crest migration, PTK7 is part of a complex with Frizzled 7 (fz7) and Dishevelled (dsh), which is crucial for the recruitment of dsh to the plasma membrane. Although PTK7 does not directly bind to dsh, it facilitates its recruitment, indicating the involvement of additional molecules like fz7 (Shnitsar2008PTK7). PTK7's interaction with dsh is essential for neural crest cell migration, as demonstrated by the inhibition of migration upon loss of PTK7 function (Shnitsar2008PTK7).

PTK7 also interacts with RACK1, which is necessary for the PTK7-mediated localization of dsh to the plasma membrane, a process crucial for neural tube closure (Wehner2011RACK1).
