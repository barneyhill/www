# NUGGC

## Overview
The NUGGC gene encodes the nuclear GTPase, germinal center associated protein, which is a critical component in maintaining genomic stability within human cells. This protein functions primarily as a GTPase, a category of enzymes that hydrolyze GTP, and is predominantly active in the nucleus. It plays a significant role in inhibiting activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA), thereby reducing somatic hypermutations in B-cells, which is crucial for genomic stability during B-cell maturation in germinal centers (Gupta2020Retesting). The nuclear GTPase encoded by NUGGC is involved in essential cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell division, and intracellular transport, highlighting its importance in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic integrity (Amarnani2024Mitf).

## Structure


## Function
The NUGGC gene, also known as Nuclear GTPase SLIP-GC, plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. Its primary function is to inhibit the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA), which is essential for reducing somatic hypermutations in B-cells. This inhibition is vital for maintaining genome stability, particularly in germinal centers where B-cell maturation occurs (Gupta2020Retesting). NUGGC is active in the nucleus and is involved in cellular processes related to GTP binding and hydrolysis, which are critical for signal transduction, cell division, and intracellular transport. The gene's activity in the nucleus suggests a role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability (Amarnani2024Mitf).

In the context of B-cell biology, NUGGC shares expression patterns with AICDA, indicating its involvement in germinal center processes. It is part of a transcription factor network that influences B-cell homeostasis and germinal center responses (Amarnani2024Mitf). The gene's function in these processes underscores its importance in the immune system, particularly in the regulation of B-cell maturation and function.
