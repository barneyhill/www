# RRBP1

## Overview
RRBP1 (ribosome binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), known as ribosome binding protein 1 or p180. This protein is classified as a type III membrane protein due to its structural features, including a single transmembrane helix and a large cytosolic domain. RRBP1 plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as ribosome binding, mRNA translation, and peroxisomal biogenesis. It facilitates the interaction between ribosomes and the ER, which is essential for local protein synthesis, particularly in axons. Additionally, RRBP1 is involved in intracellular trafficking processes, such as the transport of renin, impacting blood pressure and potassium homeostasis. The gene's expression has been linked to various cancers, where it may serve as a prognostic marker, and its deficiency is associated with cardiovascular conditions (Pan2015Endoplasmic; Chiu2023ER; Bhadra2021Quantitative; Fatima2024Ribosomebinding).

## Structure
RRBP1, also known as p180, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein characterized by a single transmembrane helix near its ER lumenal N-terminus and a large C-terminal domain in the cytosol, classifying it as a type III membrane protein (Bhadra2021Quantitative). The cytosolic domain of RRBP1 includes a lysine-rich region and 54 tandem repeats of a positively charged decapeptide, which may serve as an mRNA binding surface (Bhadra2021Quantitative). These decapeptide repeats, along with coiled-coil (CC) domains, are essential for ribosome binding and targeting, facilitating interactions between the ER and ribosomes (Koppers2022Axonal).

The molecular structure of RRBP1 has been predicted using Alphafold, indicating that the region spanning both the decapeptide repeats and CC domains is crucial for maintaining a structural conformation that allows efficient binding and targeting of mRNAs and ribosomes to the ER (Koppers2022Axonal). RRBP1 exists in multiple isoforms, which can affect its function and localization (Bhadra2021Quantitative). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context (Béthune2019MembraneAssociated).

## Function
Ribosome-binding protein 1 (RRBP1) is a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in maintaining peroxisomal biogenesis, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and function. RRBP1 facilitates the formation of peroxisome-ER contact sites, essential for peroxisomal dynamics and biogenesis, although it is not directly involved in peroxisomal protein import (Fatima2024Ribosomebinding). The absence of RRBP1 leads to a reduction in mature peroxisomes and affects the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, indicating its role in peroxisome maturation (Fatima2024Ribosomebinding).

RRBP1 also regulates intracellular renin trafficking, impacting blood pressure and potassium homeostasis. It is crucial for the proper trafficking of renin from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, and its deficiency results in increased intracellular renin levels and decreased secretion, leading to conditions such as hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and hyperkalemia (Chiu2023ER). Additionally, RRBP1 is involved in local mRNA translation within axons, acting as a ribosome receptor that facilitates interactions between the axonal ER and ribosomes, thereby influencing local protein synthesis (Koppers2022Axonal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RRBP1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), RRBP1 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor disease-specific survival (DSS) and disease-free survival (DFS). This suggests that RRBP1 could serve as a prognostic marker for CRC progression and patient outcomes (Pan2015Endoplasmic). In prostate cancer, RRBP1 is also highly expressed and correlates with clinical-pathological features such as T stage, lymph node metastasis, PSA levels, and Gleason score. High RRBP1 expression is linked to poorer prognosis, indicating its potential as an independent prognostic factor and biomarker for prostate cancer (Li2019&lt; RRBP1; p&gt).

RRBP1 is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and potassium homeostasis. Genetic variants of RRBP1 have been associated with blood pressure regulation, and RRBP1 deficiency can lead to hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and hyperkalemia, conditions that can result in severe cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (Chiu2023ER). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RRBP1 in both cancer progression and cardiovascular health.

## Interactions
RRBP1, also known as P180, is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that plays a significant role in ribosome interactions and local mRNA translation. It acts as a ribosome receptor, facilitating the binding of ribosomes to the ER, which is crucial for local protein synthesis in axons. RRBP1 interacts with ribosomes through two binding sites located in its decapeptide repeats and coiled-coil domains, which are essential for efficient ribosome targeting to the axonal ER (Koppers2022Axonal). Disruption of these interactions impairs local translation due to altered ribosome distribution (Koppers2022Axonal).

RRBP1 is also involved in interactions with microtubules (MTs) through a domain known as MTB-1, which exhibits strong binding and bundling activity for MTs. This interaction suggests a role for RRBP1 in stabilizing MTs and mediating ER-MT interactions in mammalian cells (OgawaGoto2007p180).

In the context of cancer, RRBP1 mRNA stability is enhanced by METTL3-mediated m6A methylation, which promotes its expression and contributes to cancer cell proliferation and migration. This interaction highlights the oncogenic role of RRBP1 in prostate cancer (Feng2024Stabilization).
