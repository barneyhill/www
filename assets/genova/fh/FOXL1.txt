# FOXL1

## Overview
FOXL1 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box L1 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the FOX protein family. This family is characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain known as the forkhead or winged-helix domain, which allows these proteins to regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. The FOXL1 protein plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is particularly significant in developmental processes such as body axis establishment and tissue development across all three germ layers. FOXL1 is also involved in bone remodeling and the regulation of the Wnt/APC/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining cellular architecture and controlling cell proliferation. Mutations in the FOXL1 gene have been linked to several conditions, including otosclerosis and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Abdelfatah2021A; Perreault2005Foxl1; Chen2019FOXL1).

## Structure
The FOXL1 protein is a transcription factor encoded by a single exon and consists of 345 amino acids (Abdelfatah2021A). It features a highly conserved DNA-binding domain typical of forkhead box proteins, which consists of approximately 110 amino acids forming a helix-turn-helix motif (Hawkey-Noble2022Mutation). This domain allows FOXL1 to bind to specific DNA sequences, influencing gene expression.

A pathogenic in-frame deletion of 15 base pairs in the FOXL1 gene removes residues 326-330 (GIPFL) from the C-terminus, which is the most ordered and evolutionary-conserved portion of the protein (Abdelfatah2021A). This deletion disrupts the hydrophobic core, leading to a more randomly coiled structure compared to the wild-type, which maintains a substantial amount of alpha helix. The mutant FOXL1 retains only 48% of the helicity of the wild-type protein, significantly affecting its secondary and tertiary structures (Abdelfatah2021A).

Both wild-type and mutant FOXL1 localize to the nucleus, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation, although the mutant lacks transcriptional activity (Abdelfatah2021A). The study did not provide specific details on the quaternary structure of FOXL1 (Abdelfatah2021A).

## Function
FOXL1 (forkhead box L1) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression related to cell metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is part of the FOX protein family, which is crucial for various developmental processes, including body axis establishment and tissue development from all three germ layers (Abdelfatah2021A). In healthy human cells, FOXL1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate the transcription of target genes (Abdelfatah2021A).

FOXL1 is involved in the regulation of cartilage and osteoclast/osteoblast activity in the otic capsule, suggesting its role in bone remodeling processes (Abdelfatah2021A). It also influences the development of the central nervous system by suppressing the expression of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein, as observed in zebrafish studies (Chen2019FOXL1). This indicates that FOXL1 may have roles in brain development and potentially in brain cancer.

In the gastrointestinal tract, FOXL1 was initially discovered in the mesenchyme, where it plays an important role in gut maintenance (Chen2019FOXL1). It acts as a mesenchymal modifier in tumorigenesis, influencing the Wnt/APC/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular architecture and regulating cell proliferation (Perreault2005Foxl1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FOXL1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A pathogenic deletion in the FOXL1 gene has been identified as the first gene associated with otosclerosis, a condition characterized by abnormal bone growth in the middle ear leading to hearing loss. This deletion results in a loss of transcriptional activity and affects the protein's structure, leading to autosomal dominant otosclerosis (Abdelfatah2021A). The FOXL1 gene is also involved in bone remodeling, and its mutations may contribute to other conditions like cholesteatoma due to its role in the WNT signaling pathway (Abdelfatah2021A).

In the context of cancer, FOXL1 overexpression has been linked to poor outcomes in glioma patients, particularly in high-grade cases. This association suggests that FOXL1 could serve as a prognostic marker for glioma (Chen2019FOXL1). Additionally, the absence of FOXL1 has been shown to increase tumor multiplicity in gastric and colorectal cancers, particularly in the presence of a mutated APC tumor suppressor gene. This indicates that FOXL1 may cooperate with APC in controlling epithelial cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Perreault2005Foxl1; TakanoMaruyama2006Foxl1deficient).
