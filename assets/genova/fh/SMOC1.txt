# SMOC1

## Overview
SMOC1 (SPARC related modular calcium binding 1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the SPARC family, characterized by its modular structure and calcium-binding properties. The SMOC1 protein is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a significant role in cell-matrix interactions and bone mineralization, primarily through its involvement in the regulation of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathways. It contains several distinct domains, including a follistatin-like domain, two thyroglobulin type I domains, and an EF-hand calcium-binding domain, which contribute to its function as a BMP antagonist and its interactions with other extracellular matrix proteins (Rainger2011Loss; Srivastava2007Characterization). SMOC1 is implicated in various developmental processes, particularly in the formation of the eyes and limbs, and its mutations are linked to Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome, a disorder characterized by ocular and skeletal abnormalities (Rainger2011Loss; ÜrelDemir2019Ophthalmoacromelic). Additionally, alterations in SMOC1 expression have been associated with cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for certain malignancies (Aoki2024Downregulation).

## Structure
The SMOC1 protein, encoded by the human SMOC1 gene, is a member of the SPARC family and is characterized by a modular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of SMOC1 features a follistatin-like domain, two thyroglobulin type I (Tg1) domains, and an EF-hand calcium-binding domain, which are evolutionarily conserved (Rainger2011Loss). The protein also contains a unique SMOC1 domain rich in aromatic amino acids, forming a folded domain with a hydrophobic core (Srivastava2007Characterization).

The secondary structure of SMOC1 includes alpha helices, particularly in the extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain, which is involved in heparin and heparan sulfate binding (Klemenčič2013The). The EC domain is characterized by a cluster of positively charged residues that form a large interaction surface, crucial for its binding properties (Klemenčič2013The).

Post-translational modifications of SMOC1 include glycosylation, as indicated by the presence of an N-glycosylation site at Asn-214, suggesting its nature as a glycoprotein (Srivastava2007Characterization). SMOC1 is secreted and localized in the extracellular matrix and basement membrane zones, playing a role in cell-matrix interactions and bone mineralization (Srivastava2007Characterization).

## Function
The SMOC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular and developmental processes. SMOC1 is a basement membrane protein with significant homology to BM-40, also known as SPARC and osteonectin. It is characterized by a domain structure that includes a follistatin-like domain, two thyroglobulin type I domains, and an EF-hand calcium-binding domain (Rainger2011Loss). In healthy human cells, SMOC1 functions as a Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) antagonist, regulating BMP activity, which is essential for normal embryonic development, particularly in the development of the eyes and limbs (Rainger2011Loss).

SMOC1 is involved in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and proliferation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Overexpression of SMOC1 enhances the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, leading to increased cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation, which is crucial for bone formation (Choi2014SMOC1induced). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of developmental processes in the nervous and musculoskeletal systems, influencing cell migration, proliferation, and extracellular matrix production (Choi2014SMOC1induced). SMOC1's role in BMP signaling and its interaction with other matrix proteins highlight its importance in tissue development and repair.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMOC1 gene are associated with Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ocular and skeletal abnormalities. These include a spectrum of ocular findings from mild microphthalmia to true anophthalmia, and limb malformations such as oligodactyly and synostosis of the 4th and 5th metacarpals (Rainger2011Loss; ÜrelDemir2019Ophthalmoacromelic). The syndrome may also present with cleft lip and/or palate, vertebral segmentation defects, and intellectual disability (ÜrelDemir2019Ophthalmoacromelic). SMOC1 mutations identified in OAS include nonsense, frame-shift, and missense mutations, which likely lead to severe or complete loss of protein function (Rainger2011Loss).

In addition to its role in congenital disorders, SMOC1 expression is implicated in cancer progression. In colorectal tumors, SMOC1 is abundantly expressed in normal colonic tissue and non-advanced adenomas but is significantly downregulated in traditional serrated adenomas, advanced adenomas, and early invasive cancers. This downregulation is associated with the malignant progression of these lesions, potentially due to methylation of the SMOC1 gene (Aoki2024Downregulation). The silencing of SMOC1 may serve as a biomarker for diagnosing serrated lesions and predicting colorectal cancer risk (Aoki2024Downregulation).

## Interactions
SMOC1, a secreted modular calcium-binding protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, influencing signaling pathways. In C. elegans, SMOC1 interacts with LON-2/glypican and DBL-1/BMP, forming a tripartite complex that modulates BMP signaling. This interaction is crucial for BMP signaling regulation, as LON-2 and DBL-1 only interact in the presence of SMOC1 (DeGroot2023SMOC1). The EC domain of SMOC1 is responsible for its interaction with LON-2, and overexpression of this domain can enhance BMP signaling (DeGroot2023SMOC1).

SMOC1 also binds to heparin and heparan sulfate, which modulates its cell adhesion properties. The heparin-binding activity is mediated by specific positively charged residues in the EC domain, forming a large interaction surface with a strong positive potential (Klemenčič2013The). This interaction is independent of calcium ions and involves electrostatic forces (Klemenčič2013The).

In humans, SMOC1 functions as a BMP antagonist, capable of antagonizing BMP activity even in the presence of a constitutively active BMP receptor. This antagonism may involve stimulating MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of R-SMAD proteins (Rainger2011Loss). SMOC1's interactions with other proteins, such as fibulin-1 and vitronectin, suggest a role in regulating signal transduction, cell migration, and proliferation (Choi2014SMOC1induced).
