# VEGFA

## Overview
Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) is a gene that encodes a potent signaling protein involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature. The protein product of VEGFA, also known as vascular endothelial growth factor A, is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and functions primarily as a growth factor. It plays a crucial role in both physiological processes, such as wound healing and embryonic development, and pathological conditions, including cancer and ocular diseases (Holmes2005Thevascularendothelialgrowthfactor(VEGF; Ferrara2003The)). VEGFA exerts its effects by binding to receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly VEGFR2, on endothelial cells, initiating signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, migration, and survival (Abhinand2016VEGFAVEGFR2). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that differ in their biological activities and interactions with co-receptors like neuropilins (Sharma2024NRP1; Arcondeguy2013VEGF-A). Due to its pivotal role in angiogenesis, VEGFA is a significant target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth.

## Structure
The VEGFA gene encodes the vascular endothelial growth factor A, a protein crucial for angiogenesis. The primary structure of VEGFA consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the gene, which undergoes alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms with distinct functions. These isoforms are named based on their amino acid length, such as VEGF-A121, VEGF-A165, and VEGF-A189, each differing in their ability to bind to heparin and interact with the extracellular matrix (Arcondeguy2013VEGF-A).

The secondary structure of VEGFA includes anti-parallel β sheets and an α helix, contributing to its stability and function (Harper2008VEGFA). The tertiary structure forms a homodimer, stabilized by disulfide bonds, which is essential for its biological activity (Woolard2009Molecular). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is crucial for receptor binding and signal transduction.

VEGFA undergoes several post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which influence its stability and activity. The protein contains heparin-binding domains encoded by exons 6 and 7, affecting its diffusibility and interaction with cell surfaces (Arcondeguy2013VEGF-A). The alternative splicing of exon 8 results in isoforms with different C-terminal sequences, impacting their angiogenic properties (Woolard2009Molecular).

## Function
VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A) is a critical regulator of angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels from pre-existing ones. In healthy human cells, VEGFA primarily functions by binding to receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly VEGFR-2, on endothelial cells. This interaction triggers a cascade of signaling pathways that promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival, essential for angiogenesis (Kliche2001VEGF; Abhinand2016VEGFAVEGFR2).

VEGFA is involved in various physiological processes, including wound healing, the menstrual cycle, and embryonic development. It acts as a survival factor for endothelial cells by preventing apoptosis through the PI-3 kinase-Akt pathway and inducing anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 and A1 (Kliche2001VEGF; Ferrara2003The). VEGFA also increases vascular permeability and induces vasodilation through endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide, contributing to its role in regulating vascular function (Ferrara2003The).

VEGFA is secreted as a homodimeric protein and is active in the extracellular space, where it influences vascular permeability and endothelial cell function. Its expression is regulated by oxygen tension, with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) playing a central role in its transcriptional regulation under low oxygen conditions (Holmes2005Thevascularendothelialgrowthfactor(VEGF)family:angiogenicfactorsinhealthanddisease page 1 of 3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VEGFA gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving abnormal angiogenesis. In cancer, VEGFA overexpression is associated with tumor growth and metastasis. It is a key factor in solid tumors, where its expression correlates with tumor progression and metastasis by impairing the endothelial barrier and facilitating tumor cell extravasation (Takahashi2005The; Claesson‐Welsh2013VEGFA). VEGFA gene amplification in osteosarcoma is linked to increased protein expression and angiogenesis, resulting in poorer disease-free survival rates. This suggests that VEGFA amplification could serve as a prognostic marker and a target for anti-VEGFA therapies (Yang2011Genetic).

In inflammatory diseases, VEGFA acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, increasing endothelial permeability and contributing to conditions like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma (Takahashi2005The). In ocular diseases, VEGFA is implicated in age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, where its overexpression leads to abnormal blood vessel formation and vision loss (Ferrara2003The; Kurihara2012Targeted). Alterations in VEGFA expression or its interactions can significantly impact disease progression, making it a critical target for therapeutic interventions in these conditions.

## Interactions
VEGFA interacts with several proteins and receptors, playing a crucial role in angiogenesis. It primarily binds to receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, with VEGFR2 being the main mediator of its angiogenic effects (Koch2011Signal; Abhinand2016VEGFAVEGFR2). VEGFA binding to VEGFR2 leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, initiating downstream signaling pathways that regulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival (Abhinand2016VEGFAVEGFR2).

VEGFA also interacts with co-receptors such as neuropilins (NRP1 and NRP2), which enhance its signaling capabilities. NRP1, in particular, forms complexes with VEGFR2, augmenting VEGFA-mediated signaling and endothelial cell sprouting (Peach2018Molecular; Sharma2024NRP1). The interaction with neuropilins is isoform-specific, with certain VEGFA isoforms like VEGFA165 binding to NRP1, while others like VEGFA165b do not (Peach2018Molecular).

VEGFA's interactions are further modulated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which influence its bioavailability and spatial distribution (Peach2018Molecular; Koch2011Signal). These interactions are critical for the regulation of vascular permeability and endothelial cell function, highlighting VEGFA's central role in vascular biology.
