# PSMA5

## Overview
PSMA5 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 5, a critical component of the 20S proteasome, which is part of the larger ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by PSMA5 is categorized as a proteasome subunit and plays a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by regulating the degradation of misfolded, damaged, or unnecessary proteins. Structurally, the PSMA5 protein is part of the alpha ring of the 20S proteasome, contributing to the formation of the proteolytic core complex. This protein is involved in the assembly and function of the proteasome, interacting with other subunits and regulatory particles to facilitate protein degradation processes essential for various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA repair (Elenich1999The; Jung2009The; Livinskaya2014Immunoaffinity).

## Structure
The PSMA5 protein, a component of the 20S proteasome, is involved in nonlysosomal protein degradation. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of 241 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 26,400 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.56 (Elenich1999The). The secondary structure of PSMA5 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact, globular tertiary structure. In terms of quaternary structure, PSMA5 is part of the alpha ring of the 20S proteasome, which is composed of four stacked heptameric rings, with the outer rings made of alpha subunits (Elenich1999The; Han2004Purification).

PSMA5 is expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and can be refolded into a tetrameric form, as indicated by dynamic light scattering and gel filtration chromatography (Han2004Purification). The protein undergoes purification and refolding processes to achieve high purity, which is essential for studying its structure and function (Han2004Purification). The study of PSMA5 provides insights into its structural role in proteasome assembly and its interaction with regulatory complexes (Elenich1999The).

## Function
PSMA5 encodes a subunit of the 20S proteasome, which is a core component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. The 20S proteasome is composed of four stacked heptameric rings, with the outer rings made up of alpha subunits, including PSMA5. These alpha subunits regulate substrate access to the proteolytic chamber, playing a crucial role in the degradation of misfolded, damaged, or unneeded proteins (Jung2009The; Livinskaya2014Immunoaffinity).

The 20S proteasome is involved in both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent protein degradation, influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA repair (Livinskaya2014Immunoaffinity). It is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it maintains protein homeostasis and regulates cellular functions (Jung2009The).

PSMA5, as part of the alpha subunits, is involved in the early stages of proteasome assembly, interacting with proteasome assembling chaperones (PACs) to form the alpha-ring, which is essential for the subsequent incorporation of beta subunits and the formation of a functional proteasome (Jung2009The). The proteasome's activity is crucial for cellular health and longevity, as it degrades oxidized proteins and regulates protein life-span (Jung2009The).

## Clinical Significance
The PSMA5 gene, encoding the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 5, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in protein degradation. In prostate cancer, PSMA5 expression is upregulated, correlating with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. High PSMA5 levels are associated with higher Gleason scores and lymph node metastasis. Silencing PSMA5 in prostate cancer cell lines inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, and increases sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib, suggesting a role in drug resistance (Fu2019PSMA5).

In glioma, PSMA5 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. Its elevated expression correlates with higher tumor grades and shorter overall survival. PSMA5 is involved in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis, interacting with CDK1 and CDK2 proteins. Knockdown of PSMA5 in glioma cells results in reduced proliferation and G2/M cell cycle arrest (Liu2024Unveiling).

Mutations in PSMA5 are also implicated in proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes (PRAAS). A specific nonsense mutation, PSMA5/a5 p.Arg168*, leads to severe clinical phenotypes, including systemic inflammation and rashes. This mutation affects RNA stability and protein production, necessitating specific therapeutic interventions (Papendorf2023Identification).

## Interactions
PSMA5, a component of the 20S proteasome core complex, interacts with other proteasome subunits to form the proteolytic core responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins. It is involved in the assembly of the 26S proteasome by interacting with regulatory particles. PSMA5 interacts with the PSMG1-PSMG2 heterodimer, which promotes the assembly of the 20S proteasome (Singh2014Apigenin). 

PSMA5 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, which can affect its interactions and function. Phosphorylation of PSMA5 can influence protein-protein interactions and the opening of the proteasome gate, potentially altering its proteolytic activities (Moiseeva2013DNA). Ubiquitylation of PSMA5, both in its monomeric form and when incorporated into the 20S proteasome, regulates its interactions with other proteins and its role in proteasome maturation (Moiseeva2013DNA).

In the context of cancer, PSMA5 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK1 and CDK2, which are crucial for cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis. Silencing PSMA5 in glioma cell lines leads to reduced expression of these CDKs, indicating its role in promoting tumor growth by driving the cell cycle (Liu2024Unveiling).
