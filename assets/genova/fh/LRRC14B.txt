# LRRC14B

## Overview
LRRC14B is a gene that encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 14B, which is part of the Leucine-Rich Repeat Containing (LRRC) superfamily. This protein is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues, suggesting its involvement in muscle differentiation or function (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The gene is associated with tissue-specific super-enhancers, which are regions of DNA that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, particularly in skeletal muscle and heart (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). While the precise function of LRRC14B in healthy human cells is not fully understood, it is paralogous to the PRAME-family genes and the broadly expressed LRRC14, which is known to negatively regulate NFκB signaling, hinting at a potential regulatory role for LRRC14B as well (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

## Function
The LRRC14B gene is associated with skeletal muscle and heart-specific super-enhancers, which overlap hypomethylated differentially methylated regions in these tissues, suggesting a role in tissue-specific gene regulation (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). It is part of the Leucine-Rich Repeat Containing (LRRC) superfamily and is preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues, indicating its involvement in muscle differentiation or function (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The gene is located near PLEKHG4B, but the enhancer region is more likely associated with LRRC14B expression, supported by the high transcription levels of a downstream lncRNA gene in skeletal muscle and heart, which shares a similar expression profile with LRRC14B (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

LRRC14B is paralogous to many PRAME-family genes and the broadly expressed LRRC14, which is a negative regulator of NFκB signaling. This suggests that LRRC14B might have a similar regulatory role, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains poorly understood (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The gene's expression is characterized by regions of strong skeletal muscle or skeletal muscle/heart intragenic enhancer chromatin, marked by histone modifications such as H3K27ac, which are associated with active transcription (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).
