# ADRA2B

## Overview
The ADRA2B gene encodes the adrenoceptor alpha 2B, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the sympathetic nervous system by modulating neurotransmitter release and smooth muscle contraction (2; a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)). The ADRA2B protein is characterized by a seven-pass transmembrane structure, typical of GPCRs, and is involved in the inhibition of adenylate cyclase through its interaction with G proteins (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B). This receptor is implicated in various physiological processes, including cardiovascular function and energy metabolism, and is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues (Papilla). Genetic variations in the ADRA2B gene have been linked to emotional memory, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B; KIM2014Association).

## Structure
The ADRA2B protein is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically within the biogenic amine receptors group. It is characterized by a seven-pass transmembrane structure, consisting of seven alpha-helical segments that are separated by alternating intracellular and extracellular loop regions (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B). The transmembrane region is notable for its seven alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, which include proline-induced twists that facilitate structural rearrangements necessary for G protein activation (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B).

The extracellular domains of ADRA2B include transmembrane helices and loops, while the intracellular domains show significant differences compared to other family members, making secondary structure predictions challenging (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B). The binding pocket of ADRA2B, which interacts with ligands such as dexmedetomidine, is formed by 13 amino acids, with specific residues like F412 being crucial for binding a2-selective imidazoles (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B).

The ADRA2B protein is intronless and mediates catecholamine-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase through G proteins (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B). A functional deletion variant of ADRA2B, characterized by the loss of three glutamic acid residues in the third intracellular loop, has been associated with increased emotional memory and neural activity in the amygdala (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B).

## Function
The ADRA2B gene encodes the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, which is primarily involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and modulation of smooth muscle contraction. This receptor is a critical component of the sympathetic nervous system, playing a vital role in the modulation of neurotransmitter release, particularly norepinephrine, and is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes such as cardiovascular function and energy metabolism (5; Papilla). The receptor is primarily located in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, where it modulates neurotransmitter release and affects processes such as vasoconstriction and insulin secretion (5; Papilla).

This variant is thought to increase noradrenaline availability, potentially contributing to mental and eating disorders (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B; Small2001Polymorphic).

Another mutation in the ADRA2B gene, involving an in-frame insertion/deletion that substitutes five amino acids with four new residues, has been associated with autosomal dominant cortical myoclonus and epilepsy (ADCME). This mutation co-segregates with the disease phenotype in affected families and is absent in a large control population, suggesting its pathogenic role (De2014The).

The ADRA2B gene has also been implicated in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. A common polymorphism, the 301-303 insertion/deletion (I/D), is associated with hypertension and coronary arterial disease, highlighting the gene's role in cardiovascular health (KIM2014Association). These genetic variations can affect receptor function, leading to altered physiological responses and disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
The ADRA2B protein, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, interacts with various proteins to mediate its physiological functions. It primarily couples with the Gi family of G proteins, which leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity upon binding with catecholamines such as norepinephrine and epinephrine (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of neurotransmitter release and the modulation of sympathetic nervous system activities.

The ADRA2B receptor also forms interactions with downstream effectors during its activation. Upon activation, it opens a cavity on its cytoplasmic side, facilitating interactions with these effectors (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B). The binding pocket of ADRA2B involves specific interactions, including aromatic and van der Waals interactions, as well as a conserved ionic interaction with D92, which are essential for its selectivity and function (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B).

While the context does not provide specific details on interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond G proteins, it highlights the structural features and conserved motifs that contribute to ADRA2B's ligand-binding affinity and receptor activation (Papageorgiou2023ADRA2B). These interactions are significant for understanding the receptor's role in physiological and potentially pathological processes.
