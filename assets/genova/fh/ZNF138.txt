# ZNF138

## Overview
ZNF138 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 138, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are structural domains that facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger protein 138 is primarily involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. It achieves this by interacting with the KAP1-centered network, which includes various proteins such as HP1a, HP1c, SIRT1, and SMARCAD1, forming a scaffold for heterochromatin-inducing complexes. This interaction is particularly significant during early embryogenesis, where it helps repress transposable elements, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Helleboid2019The).

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF138 is a zinc finger protein that participates in various protein interactions, primarily through its association with the KAP1-centered network. This network is characterized by high-density connectivity involving multiple proteins. ZNF138 is known to interact with KAP1, a core component of the network, which frequently associates with other proteins such as HP1a, HP1c, SIRT1, and SMARCAD1. Specifically, ZNF138 has been identified as a KAP1-interacting protein, with SIRT1 also being associated with this interaction, indicating a KAP1-mediated connection (Helleboid2019The).

The study of the interactome of KRAB zinc finger proteins, including ZNF138, reveals that these proteins play a role in repressing transposable elements during early embryogenesis by recruiting KAP1 and associated effectors. This recruitment forms a scaffold for a heterochromatin-inducing complex, highlighting the role of ZNF138 in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling (Helleboid2019The).

These interactions suggest that ZNF138 is involved in complex regulatory networks that influence gene expression and chromatin structure, contributing to its functional diversification and evolutionary history within the KRAB zinc finger protein family (Helleboid2019The).
