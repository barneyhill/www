# GBP2

## Overview
Guanylate binding protein 2 (GBP2) is a gene that encodes a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, which is part of the larger dynamin superfamily of large GTPases. The protein product of GBP2, also referred to as GBP2, is characterized by its large GTPase domain and is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in immune responses against pathogens. GBP2 is an interferon-induced protein that plays a crucial role in vesicle trafficking, antimicrobial activity, and immune signaling. It is known for its ability to form homodimers or heterodimers, which are essential for its GTPase activity and function. The protein is also involved in interactions with other cellular components, such as Galectin-3 and the autophagy-related LC3 conjugation system, highlighting its role in immune defense mechanisms (Zhang2021When; Roy2022Structural). Additionally, GBP2 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and interactions can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Ren2022GBP2; Wang2022Subtyping).

## Structure
Human guanylate binding protein 2 (GBP2) is a member of the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases. The primary structure of GBP2 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the GBP2 gene, sharing significant amino acid identity with other guanylate binding proteins, ranging from 40-98% with human and mouse GBPs (Roy2022Structural). The secondary structure includes a large GTPase domain (LG domain) at the N-terminus, which contains the GTP binding site and motifs such as the P-loop, Switch I, and Walker B motif (Roy2022Structural). The LG domain is followed by a helical part, and GBP2 also contains a CaaX box at the C-terminus, which facilitates membrane binding through post-translational modifications like geranylgeranylation (Roy2022Structural).

The tertiary structure of GBP2 forms a globular shape, facilitating its GTPase activity. GBP2 can form homodimers or heterodimers, representing its quaternary structure. Dimerization is crucial for its function, as it stimulates GTP hydrolysis, with specific residues and motifs playing key roles in this process (Roy2022Structural). The protein's structure is flexible, particularly in the nucleotide-free and GDP-bound states, allowing for large-scale movements that enhance its activity (Roy2022Structural).

## Function
Guanylate-binding protein 2 (GBP2) is a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, which is involved in immune responses, particularly in defense against pathogens. GBP2 is an interferon-induced GTPase that plays a role in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and antimicrobial activity. It is active in the cytoplasm and can localize to cellular membranes, contributing to pathogen clearance and immune signaling (Zhang2021When).

GBP2 is involved in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by host pattern recognition receptors, leading to the activation of signaling pathways and the production of type I interferons and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs exert direct antiviral and immune-regulatory functions (Zhang2021When). GBP2, along with other GBPs, is expressed in various cells and tissues under physiological conditions and is distributed throughout both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Zhang2021When).

The structure of GBP2 includes a globular N-terminal large GTPase domain and a helical domain, which allows for protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions. Some GBPs, including GBP2, have C-terminal CaaX motifs that can be isoprenylated to provide anchorage to endomembrane organelles (Zhang2021When). GBP2's GTPase activity is critical for its antiviral function, particularly in orchestrating IFNγ-mediated immune responses (Zhang2021When).

## Clinical Significance
Guanylate binding protein 2 (GBP2) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), GBP2 expression is significantly decreased compared to normal tissues, with the lowest levels observed in the CMS2 subtype. High GBP2 expression is associated with increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and better overall survival, suggesting its potential as an immunotherapeutic target in microsatellite stability (MSS) CRC (Wang2022Subtyping). GBP2 also enhances the immune response by promoting STAT1 phosphorylation, which is crucial for effective anti-PD-1 therapy (Wang2022Subtyping).

In breast cancer, GBP2 inhibits mitochondrial fission by interacting with Drp1, reducing cell invasion and metastasis. High GBP2 expression correlates with better prognosis, particularly in rapidly proliferating tumors (Zhang2017Guanylatebinding). In glioma, GBP2 is overexpressed and promotes tumor progression through the KIF22/EGFR signaling pathway. Knockdown of GBP2 results in decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis, indicating its oncogenic role (Ren2022GBP2).

These findings highlight GBP2's role in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target across different cancer types.

## Interactions
GBP2 (guanylate binding protein 2) is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in immune responses. It can physically complex with Galectin-3, a marker for damaged membranes, facilitating the recruitment and oligomerization of GBPs to form effector complexes. These complexes can incorporate multiple GBP family members and serve as platforms for recruiting antimicrobial effectors or directly damaging bacterial membranes (Roy2022Structural).

GBP2 also interacts with the autophagy-related LC3 conjugation system, marking viral replication complexes for disruption, such as those of noroviruses (Roy2022Structural). In the context of antiviral activities, GBP2, along with GBP5, inhibits the replication of various viruses by reducing the maturation and proteolytic activity of furin, which is crucial for viral envelope glycoprotein maturation. This antiviral function is independent of its GTPase activity and relies on its isoprenylation and Golgi apparatus localization (Zhang2021When).

In murine cells, GBP2 interacts with Rab guanine dissociation inhibitor-α, which maintains it in a GDP-bound state, affecting its targeting to pathogen-containing vacuoles (Pilla-Moffett2016Interferon-Inducible). These interactions highlight GBP2's role in immune signaling and pathogen defense.
