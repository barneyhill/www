# POMGNT1

## Overview
POMGNT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme protein O-linked mannose N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (beta 1,2-), a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase. This enzyme is integral to the glycosylation process of α-dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, which is crucial for muscle integrity and cell-matrix interactions. The glycosylation activity of POMGNT1 involves the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to O-mannose on glycoproteins, forming GlcNAc-β1,2-Man linkages, a rare glycan type in mammals (Manya2003Lossoffunction; AkasakaManya2004Structure–function). This process is essential for the proper function of α-dystroglycan, facilitating its role as a transmembrane linker between the extracellular matrix and the intracellular cytoskeleton (Kuwabara2016Carbohydratebinding). Mutations in the POMGNT1 gene are linked to several congenital muscular dystrophies, highlighting its critical role in muscle and neural function (Yoshida2001Muscular; Fu2017Novel).

## Structure
POMGNT1 is a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase composed of four main domains: a cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stem domain, and a catalytic domain (Manya2020FAM3BPANDERLike). The catalytic domain, spanning residues 300–646, features a Rossmann-like fold (N-lobe, residues 300–497) and an open sheet α/β structure (C-lobe, residues 498–646), which are common in nucleotide-binding proteins (Kuwabara2016Carbohydratebinding). This domain is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to O-mannose on glycoproteins (AkasakaManya2004Structure–function).

The stem domain, consisting of residues 92–250, is crucial for carbohydrate-binding, specifically recognizing β-linked GlcNAc moieties (Kuwabara2016Carbohydratebinding). This domain is essential for the protein's function in the membrane-bound form, affecting substrate accessibility and enzymatic activity (AkasakaManya2004Structure–function). Mutations in the stem domain, such as E223K and C269Y, significantly reduce activity, likely due to conformational changes (AkasakaManya2004Structure–function).

POMGNT1's structure is similar to that of rabbit GnT I, with an rmsd value of 1.5 Å for Cα atoms, indicating a conserved sugar-transfer mechanism (Kuwabara2016Carbohydratebinding). The protein's interaction with substrates involves hydrophobic interactions, with specific residues like Leu269 and Leu311 playing key roles (Kuwabara2016Carbohydratebinding).

## Function
The POMGNT1 gene encodes the enzyme protein O-linked mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1, which plays a crucial role in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a key component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex. This enzyme is responsible for transferring N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to O-mannose on glycoproteins, forming GlcNAc-β1,2-Man linkages, a rare type of glycan in mammals (Manya2003Lossoffunction; AkasakaManya2004Structure–function). This glycosylation process occurs in the Golgi apparatus and is essential for the proper function of α-DG, which acts as a transmembrane linker between the extracellular matrix and the intracellular cytoskeleton (Kuwabara2016Carbohydratebinding; Noor2020Glycosyltransferase).

In healthy human cells, POMGNT1 is involved in the formation of core M1 and M2 glycan structures, which are critical for the interaction of α-DG with laminin, a major component of the extracellular matrix (Kuwabara2016Carbohydratebinding). This interaction is vital for muscle integrity and brain development, as it supports the structural stability of muscle tissues and the proper organization of basement membranes (Noor2021Glycosyltransferase). The enzyme's activity is also linked to cell adhesion and migration, processes crucial for normal cellular functions and development (Noor2020Glycosyltransferase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POMGNT1 gene are associated with several congenital muscular dystrophies, including muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2O (LGMD2O). These conditions are characterized by defects in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, leading to muscular dystrophy, brain malformations, and ocular abnormalities (Yoshida2001Muscular; Fu2017Novel). MEB, in particular, is linked to a loss of function in the POMGNT1 protein, resulting in symptoms such as congenital muscular dystrophy, severe congenital myopia, and mental retardation (Manya2003Lossoffunction).

The POMGNT1 gene has also been implicated in non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a condition marked by progressive retinal degeneration. Mutations in POMGNT1 reduce its enzymatic activity, affecting retinal cell function and leading to vision problems (Xu2016Mutations; Patel2023Case).

Alterations in the expression of POMGNT1, such as those caused by promoter mutations, can lead to decreased mRNA and protein levels, contributing to the clinical manifestations of LGMD2O (Raducu2012Promoter). These findings highlight the critical role of POMGNT1 in maintaining proper glycosylation processes essential for muscle and neural function.

## Interactions
POMGNT1 is involved in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, which is crucial for muscle integrity and cell-matrix interactions. POMGNT1 interacts with other proteins in the glycosylation pathway, such as fukutin (FKTN), forming a complex that is essential for postphosphoryl modifications of core M3 glycans. This interaction is necessary for further glycosylation by LARGE, another glycosyltransferase, highlighting the role of POMGNT1 in the maturation of glycan structures on α-DG (Kuwabara2016Carbohydratebinding).

POMGNT1 also affects cell-cell adhesion dynamics through its interaction with N-cadherin (N-Cdh). In POMGNT1-deficient cells, there is an increase in N-Cdh levels, which enhances N-Cdh-mediated cell-cell adhesion. This interaction is linked to changes in N-glycan structures on N-Cdh, which stabilize cell-cell contacts and promote homotypic interactions (Noor2021Glycosyltransferase). The deficiency of POMGNT1 activates signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, which are associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), further influencing cell adhesion and migration (Noor2021Glycosyltransferase). These interactions underscore the importance of POMGNT1 in maintaining proper cellular adhesion and signaling processes.
