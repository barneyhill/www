# RTN4

## Overview
RTN4, commonly referred to as Nogo, is a gene that encodes the reticulon 4 protein, a member of the reticulon family known for its role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane dynamics. The protein is characterized by its reticulon homology domain (RHD), which facilitates the formation of hairpin loops within the lipid bilayer, thereby inducing membrane curvature and contributing to the structural integrity of the ER (Chiurchiù2013The; Rämö2016NOGOARTN4A). RTN4 exists in multiple isoforms, including Nogo-A, Nogo-B, and Nogo-C, each with distinct expression patterns and functional roles, particularly in the central nervous system and non-neuronal tissues (Chiurchiù2013The; Rämö2016NOGOARTN4A). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, such as inhibiting neurite outgrowth and modulating ER morphology, and has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Di2012The; Konno2021Endoplasmic).

## Structure
RTN4, also known as Nogo, is a member of the reticulon family characterized by a conserved reticulon homology domain (RHD). This domain consists of two long hydrophobic regions flanking a hydrophilic loop, known as the Nogo66 loop, which is crucial for its function and localization within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Yang2007The; Chiurchiù2013The). The RHD's structure allows RTN4 to induce membrane curvature by forming hairpin loops within the lipid bilayer, contributing to its retention in the ER membrane (Chiurchiù2013The; Rämö2016NOGOARTN4A).

RTN4 has multiple isoforms, including Nogo-A, Nogo-B, and Nogo-C, which differ in their N-terminal regions. These isoforms are produced through alternative splicing and have distinct expression patterns and functions. Nogo-A is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, while Nogo-B is more common in non-neuronal cells (Chiurchiù2013The; Rämö2016NOGOARTN4A).

Common post-translational modifications of RTN4 include phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and functions (Chiurchiù2013The). The protein's tertiary structure, particularly the two-transmembrane-domain configuration, is critical for its interaction with other proteins, such as BACE1, involved in neurodegenerative disease pathways (Kume2009The).

## Function
RTN4, also known as Nogo, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in maintaining the structure and function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in healthy human cells. RTN4 proteins, including its isoforms NOGO-A/RTN4A and NOGO-B/RTN4B, play a crucial role in shaping the ER by forming hairpin-like structures that contribute to the membrane's curvature, which is essential for cellular physiology (Di2012The). These proteins are involved in forming and maintaining ER tubules, with NOGO-A/RTN4A known for limiting neurite outgrowth and restricting plasticity in the central nervous system (Rämö2016NOGOARTN4A).

RTN4 modulates the ER's tubular network by causing narrowing and dilation of ER tubules, affecting the ER's capacity to deliver luminal solutes, such as calcium ions, across the cell periphery (Konno2021Endoplasmic). This modulation impacts neuronal regeneration by slowing luminal transport, which is crucial for processes like neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration (Konno2021Endoplasmic). RTN4 also enhances the trafficking of cell surface proteins, such as Integrinβ1 and MHC class I/HLA-A, to the cell surface, independently of changes in ER morphology (Mukherjee2019Reticulon).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RTN4 gene, also known as Nogo, have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), RTN4, particularly its isoforms RTN4A and RTN4B, interacts with key enzymes like BACE1, influencing amyloid β production, a hallmark of AD pathology. Overexpression of RTN4A is associated with increased amyloid β secretion, while RTN4B overexpression can reduce amyloid β accumulation and ameliorate cognitive impairment in AD models (Wang2020RTN4B‐mediated; KulczyńskaPrzybik2021The).

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), RTN4A is overexpressed in muscle fibers, contributing to neuromuscular junction impairment and motor neuron degeneration. Deletion of Nogo-A, a form of RTN4, has been shown to reduce muscle denervation and prolong survival in ALS mouse models (KulczyńskaPrzybik2021The). RTN4's role in multiple sclerosis (MS) involves inhibiting axonal and myelin repair, with autoantibodies against RTN4A found in MS patients. Targeting RTN4 signaling may promote axonal growth and repair, offering a potential therapeutic approach (Chiurchiù2013The).

Overall, RTN4's involvement in these diseases highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for promoting neural repair and regeneration (Pradhan2020The).

## Interactions
RTN4, also known as Nogo, is involved in various interactions with other proteins that influence its role in cellular processes. RTN4 interacts with the Nogo receptor (NgR1), along with co-receptors such as p75NTR, LINGO-1, and TAJ/TROY, to inhibit neurite outgrowth by activating the small GTPase RhoA, leading to growth cone collapse (Yang2007The; Chiurchiù2013The). This interaction is significant in the central nervous system, where RTN4 acts as a myelin-associated inhibitor of axonal regeneration (Di2012The).

In the context of prostate cancer, RTN4 is phosphorylated by protein kinases such as FYN and MAPKAPK2, which are important in cancer development. These interactions suggest a role for RTN4 in cell cycle regulation and cellular senescence, as its overexpression in prostate cancer cells leads to cell cycle arrest and increased β-Gal activity, indicating senescence (Zhao2018Cell).

RTN4 also forms dimers or oligomers, particularly in its isoform NOGO-B/RTN4B, which is involved in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum morphology. This isoform interacts with other ER-related proteins, contributing to the formation of ER tubules and affecting cell growth (Rämö2016NOGOARTN4A).
