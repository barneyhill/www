# MAGEB1

## Overview
MAGEB1 is a gene that encodes the protein MAGE family member B1, which is part of the melanoma antigen gene family. This family is known for its involvement in various cancer-related processes, particularly due to its expression in tumor tissues and limited expression in normal tissues. The MAGEB1 protein is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen, which makes it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy due to its restricted expression pattern. The gene's expression is notably altered in several types of cancer, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, multiple myeloma, and melanoma, where it may play roles in tumor progression, immune evasion, and as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Zendman2003Cancertestis‐associated; Misund2022Clonal; Li2020A; Jia2019Prognostic).

## Clinical Significance
MAGEB1, a member of the melanoma antigen gene family, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression. In breast cancer, high mRNA expression levels of MAGEB1 are associated with a better prognosis, suggesting a potential protective role in this context (Jia2019Prognostic). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MAGEB1 is significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, indicating its potential role in tumor development and as a biomarker for diagnosis and treatment (Li2020A). In multiple myeloma, increased expression of MAGEB1 is observed at later disease stages, correlating with elevated proliferation index and mutation load, which may contribute to disease progression and immune evasion (Misund2022Clonal).

MAGEB1 is also expressed in melanoma, where it is found in 22% of lesions, suggesting a link between its expression and melanoma progression (Zendman2003Cancertestis‐associated). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, MAGEB1 is part of a panel of candidate biomarkers for early diagnosis, highlighting its role in immune responses and potential as a tumor-specific antigen (Maimela2024Humoral).
