# EDDM3A

## Overview
EDDM3A is a gene that encodes the epididymal protein 3A, a secretory protein primarily expressed in the human epididymis. This protein plays a significant role in the maturation and function of sperm, contributing to male fertility by facilitating sperm motility and maturation processes (Leir2020An). While the precise molecular mechanisms of EDDM3A in non-cancerous cells remain underexplored, its importance is underscored by its association with idiopathic azoospermia when deleted (Leir2020An). Beyond its reproductive functions, EDDM3A has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in gastric and non-small cell lung cancers, where it is upregulated and contributes to tumor progression through mechanisms involving the stabilization of HIF-1α and modulation of glycolytic pathways (Wu2022EDDM3A). The gene's expression is regulated by miR-618, a microRNA that negatively influences its expression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Wu2022EDDM3A).

## Function
The EDDM3A gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the maturation and function of sperm within the human epididymis. This protein is secreted by the epididymal epithelium into the lumen, where it is involved in processes essential for sperm maturation and motility (Leir2020An). EDDM3A is part of a group of epididymal secretory proteins that contribute to the reproductive process by facilitating sperm maturation and protection (Leir2020An). The deletion of EDDM3A has been linked to idiopathic azoospermia, highlighting its importance in reproductive health (Leir2020An).

In healthy human cells, EDDM3A is primarily active in the epididymis, where it is thought to play a key role in sperm maturation, although the specific molecular mechanisms remain poorly characterized (Leir2020An). The protein's involvement in sperm maturation suggests it may influence sperm motility and fertility, contributing to the overall reproductive capability of males (Leir2020An). Despite its significant role in reproductive health, detailed molecular activities of EDDM3A in non-cancerous cells are not extensively documented in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
The EDDM3A gene, also known as epididymal protein 3A, has been implicated in the progression of certain cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In gastric cancer (GC), EDDM3A expression is significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. This upregulation is associated with poorer overall and recurrence-free survival in patients, suggesting its potential as an independent prognostic factor. EDDM3A promotes cancer progression by enhancing HIF-1α-dependent aerobic glycolysis, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (Wu2022EDDM3A).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EDDM3A is also upregulated, promoting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis. Knockdown experiments in NSCLC cell lines have shown that reducing EDDM3A expression inhibits cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating its role as an oncogene in this type of cancer (Li2020Epididymal).

The upregulation of EDDM3A in these cancers is partly mediated by the downregulation of miR-618, a microRNA that negatively regulates EDDM3A expression. This interaction highlights the gene's involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2022EDDM3A).

## Interactions
The EDDM3A protein, also known as epididymal protein 3A, has been studied for its role in gastric cancer (GC) progression, particularly in relation to its interactions with other proteins. Although initial studies suggested a potential interaction with HIF-1α, a key protein involved in hypoxia and cancer metabolism, co-immunoprecipitation assays did not reveal a significant direct interaction between EDDM3A and HIF-1α (Wu2022EDDM3A). Instead, EDDM3A indirectly influences HIF-1α by enhancing its normoxic stabilization, which subsequently upregulates glycolytic genes such as GLUT1, HK2, PKM2, and LDHA, promoting aerobic glycolysis in GC cells (Wu2022EDDM3A).

The study also highlights that EDDM3A's upregulation is associated with the downregulation of miR-618, a microRNA that negatively regulates EDDM3A expression by targeting its mRNA (Wu2022EDDM3A). This regulatory mechanism suggests that EDDM3A's interactions are more likely to be indirect, involving pathways that modulate protein stability and gene expression rather than direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Wu2022EDDM3A). The exact mechanisms by which EDDM3A enhances HIF-1α stabilization remain to be fully elucidated (Wu2022EDDM3A).
