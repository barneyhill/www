# NUTF2

## Overview
NUTF2, or nuclear transport factor 2, is a gene that encodes a small, homodimeric protein involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport system. The protein, also named NUTF2, is essential for the import of RanGDP into the nucleus, a process critical for maintaining the RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope. This gradient is vital for the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and cell differentiation (mackmull2017landscape; Major2011Expression). NUTF2 interacts with nuclear pore complexes and nucleoporins, facilitating the transport of proteins into the nucleus by acting as a bridge at the nuclear pore complex (Bayliss1999Interaction; Clarkson1996Separate). The gene's expression has been linked to various cancers, where it may serve as a predictive biomarker due to its role in influencing the tumor microenvironment and interacting with cancer-associated pathways (Li2022Aa).

## Structure
NUTF2 (nuclear transport factor 2) is a small, homodimeric protein crucial for the nuclear import of proteins. Its primary structure is composed of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure of NUTF2 includes both beta-sheets and alpha-helices, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of NUTF2 is characterized by a compact, globular form, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules. In terms of quaternary structure, NUTF2 functions as a dimer, which is vital for its role in nuclear transport.

NUTF2 interacts specifically with RanGDP and nuclear pore complexes, facilitating the transport of proteins into the nucleus. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular function and regulation. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, potentially influencing the protein's activity and interactions. These structural features and modifications enable NUTF2 to effectively perform its role in nuclear transport, highlighting its importance in cellular processes.

## Function
NUTF2, or nuclear transport factor 2, plays a critical role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport system by facilitating the import of RanGDP into the nucleus. This process is essential for maintaining the RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope, which is crucial for the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport (mackmull2017landscape; Major2011Expression). NUTF2 interacts extensively with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), particularly with nucleoporins containing FG-repeats, which are key interactors with nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) (mackmull2017landscape).

In the nucleus, NUTF2 recognizes and binds to RanGDP, facilitating its import. Once inside, RanGDP is converted to RanGTP by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1. This conversion is vital for the release of cargo from importin complexes, allowing the transport cycle to continue (Major2011Expression). The recycling of RanGDP by NUTF2 ensures a continuous supply of RanGTP in the nucleus, which is necessary for the proper functioning of the nucleocytoplasmic transport system (Paci2021Cargo).

NUTF2's activity is primarily localized at the nuclear envelope, where it shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, maintaining the essential Ran gradient and supporting various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and cell differentiation (mackmull2017landscape).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NUTF2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In low-grade glioma (LGG), high NUTF2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, while in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), low expression correlates with poor survival outcomes (Li2022Aa). NUTF2 expression is significantly upregulated in 19 cancer types, including breast cancer, where higher expression is linked to more aggressive disease and worse prognosis, particularly in HER2-enriched and basal-like subtypes (Li2022Aa). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), NUTF2 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker (Li2022A).

The gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, affecting immune scores and stromal scores in various cancers (Li2022Aa). NUTF2 is linked to cancer-associated fibroblasts in multiple cancers, indicating a role in fibroblast transformation and activation (Li2022Aa). Genetic alterations such as DNA copy number amplification and methylation may contribute to NUTF2 upregulation, although these alterations occur at low frequencies (Li2022Aa). These findings suggest that NUTF2 plays a significant role in cancer progression by influencing the tumor microenvironment and interacting with specific proteins and pathways.

## Interactions
NUTF2 (nuclear transport factor 2) is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. It specifically binds to the Ras-like GTPase Ran, playing a crucial role in the nuclear import of RanGDP. This interaction is strong and specific, allowing NUTF2 to isolate native Ran from complex mixtures (Ribbeck1998NTF2; Clarkson1996Separate). NUTF2 also interacts with nucleoporins, particularly those containing xFxFG repeats, such as p62 in vertebrates and Nsp1p in yeast. These interactions are essential for the nuclear import process, as they help target NUTF2 to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (Bayliss1999Interaction; Clarkson1996Separate).

The binding sites for Ran and nucleoporins on NUTF2 are distinct, allowing simultaneous binding, which suggests a bridging role for NUTF2 at the NPC (Clarkson1996Separate). Mutations in NUTF2, such as W7A, affect its binding affinity to nucleoporins, highlighting the importance of specific residues like Trp7 in these interactions (Bayliss1999Interaction; Morrison2003Solution). These interactions are crucial for the efficient translocation of cargo proteins through the NPC, underscoring NUTF2's role in nucleocytoplasmic transport (Isgro2007Association).
