# CRYBB3

## Overview
The CRYBB3 gene encodes the βB3-crystallin protein, a member of the βγ-crystallin family, which is integral to the structural integrity and transparency of the eye lens. This protein is characterized by its β-sandwich structure, formed by Greek-key motifs, which is essential for maintaining the lens's refractive properties. βB3-crystallin is highly expressed in lens fiber cells, underscoring its importance in ocular function. Mutations in CRYBB3 have been implicated in various cataract forms, including congenital and age-related cataracts, due to their impact on protein stability and lens transparency (Jiao2016A; Riazuddin2005Mutations).

## Structure
The CRYBB3 gene encodes the βB3-crystallin protein, which is part of the βγ-crystallin family. This protein is crucial for maintaining lens transparency and is characterized by a structure typical of the βγ-crystallin family. The predicted structure of βB3-crystallin includes domains with 8 β-strands folded into two Greek-key motifs, forming a β-sandwich structure. These domains are connected by a linking peptide, which can be either extended or curved, depending on the structural model used (Riazuddin2005Mutations).

A notable mutation in CRYBB3 is the G165R mutation in exon 6, which results in a nonconservative glycine-to-arginine substitution. This mutation is located at the tip of the loop connecting β-strands 1 and 2 of the fourth Greek-key motif. It is predicted to destabilize the motif by opening up the hairpin fold and inserting hydrophobic groups into a polar environment, leading to electrostatic repulsion with nearby residues. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that this mutation causes the initial melting of the secondary structure, converting α-helices and β-strands into extended loops, and expanding the domain structure's volume by almost 8% (Riazuddin2005Mutations).

## Function
The CRYBB3 gene encodes the βB3-crystallin protein, a member of the βγ-crystallin family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the transparency and refractive index of the eye lens. These proteins are essential structural components of the lens, contributing to its stability and function by forming a β-sandwich structure with Greek-key motifs. This structure is vital for the protein's stability and function, ensuring the lens remains clear and capable of focusing light on the retina (Riazuddin2005Mutations).

In healthy human cells, βB3-crystallin is expressed in the lens at significant levels, approximately 39% of GAPDH mRNA levels, indicating its abundance and importance in lens fiber cells (Riazuddin2005Mutations). The high concentration of crystallin proteins, including CRYBB3, is necessary for maintaining lens transparency, which is crucial for the lens's function of focusing light on the retina, essential for clear vision (Jiao2016A). The β-crystallins, including CRYBB3, are the most abundant water-soluble proteins in the human lens, making up 95% of the soluble lens protein (Riazuddin2005Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRYBB3 gene are associated with various forms of cataracts, a condition characterized by clouding of the lens, leading to impaired vision. One significant mutation is the missense variation c.493G>C (p.Gly165Arg), which has been identified in multiple consanguineous families with autosomal recessive congenital cataracts (arCC). This mutation is linked to chromosome 22q and is believed to affect the stability of the βB3-crystallin protein, crucial for lens transparency (Jiao2016A; Riazuddin2005Mutations). The mutation introduces a positively charged arginine in place of a small glycine, potentially causing electrostatic repulsion and structural instability in the protein (Riazuddin2005Mutations).

Another notable mutation is the missense variant c.467G>A/p.Gly156Glu, associated with pediatric cataract and microphthalmia in a family with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This variant is classified as likely pathogenic and is located in a functional domain of the CRYBB3 gene, highly conserved across species (Zin2021Novel).

Alterations in CRYBB3 expression levels have also been linked to age-related cortico-nuclear cataracts (ARC). Studies have shown significant upregulation of CRYBB3 mRNA in patients with ARC, suggesting its involvement in the development of cataracts under chronic stress conditions (Yildiz2023Relationship).
