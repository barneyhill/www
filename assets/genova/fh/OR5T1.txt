# OR5T1

## Overview
The OR5T1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily T member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it functions as a receptor for odorant molecules, playing a critical role in the sense of smell. The OR5T1 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and participates in the signal transduction pathways that lead to olfactory perception (Veilleux2023Human). Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR5T1 has been associated with other physiological processes, such as human development and reproductive biology, due to its involvement in a haplotype block linked to age at menarche (Veilleux2023Human). Additionally, the protein is predicted to undergo N-glycosylation, which may influence its stability and function (Miyagawa2018Frequent). Despite these associations, the full spectrum of OR5T1's functions in human biology remains to be comprehensively understood.

## Function
The OR5T1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. The binding of odorants to OR5T1 triggers neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory sensation, allowing organisms to detect and respond to various environmental cues (Veilleux2023Human).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR5T1 has been implicated in other biological processes. For instance, it is part of a haplotype block associated with age at menarche, suggesting a potential role in human development and reproductive biology (Veilleux2023Human). The gene is also predicted to be N-glycosylated at Asn17, indicating a possible involvement in glycosylation processes, which are critical for protein folding and stability (Miyagawa2018Frequent). However, the specific functions of OR5T1 in healthy cells beyond its olfactory role remain to be fully elucidated.
