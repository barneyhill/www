# RETREG1

## Overview
RETREG1, also known as FAM134B, is a gene that encodes the protein reticulophagy regulator 1, which plays a pivotal role in the selective autophagic degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a process known as reticulophagy. This protein is categorized as a reticulophagy receptor due to its involvement in maintaining ER homeostasis by facilitating the turnover of ER membranes through interactions with autophagy-related proteins. Reticulophagy regulator 1 is characterized by a reticulon homology domain (RHD) that induces membrane curvature, essential for its function in ER-phagy, and a C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif that mediates interactions with the autophagic machinery (Popelka2020Molecular; Mo2020Critical). The gene's expression and function are critical for cellular stress responses and have been implicated in various diseases, including hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IIB, cancer, and viral infections (Islam2018RETREG1; Park2019Hereditary).

## Structure
RETREG1, also known as FAM134B, is a protein involved in the selective degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum through reticulophagy. The protein is composed of 497 amino acids and features a reticulon homology domain (RHD) located at the N-terminus (residues 80-260), which is crucial for its function in membrane curvature induction and ER-phagy (Mo2020Critical). The RHD includes two transmembrane segments (TM1-TM2 and TM3-TM4) that form hairpin structures anchoring the protein into the ER membrane, and two cytoplasmic amphipathic helices (AH L and AH C) that interact with the cytoplasmic leaflet (Popelka2020Molecular; Mo2020Critical).

The RHD is characterized by its ability to induce membrane curvature, forming wedge-shaped structures that enhance membrane deformation (Popelka2020Molecular; Bhaskara2019Curvature). This domain is flanked by intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) at both the N- and C-termini, with the C-terminal IDPR containing the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif necessary for interaction with LC3 (Popelka2020Molecular). The LIR motif, located at the C-terminus (residues 453-458), binds to autophagy modifier proteins of the LC3/GABARAP family (Mo2020Critical).

RETREG1 has two known isoforms: Isoform 1, which contains nine exons, and Isoform 2, which consists of six exons and encodes a 356-amino acid protein lacking the RHD, thus unable to control the size of the ER (Mo2020Critical). The RHD also contains three phosphorylation sites (S149, S151, and S153) that are crucial for FAM134B oligomerization (Mo2020Critical).

## Function
RETREG1, also known as FAM134B, is a critical protein involved in the process of reticulophagy, a selective form of autophagy targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for degradation. This process is essential for maintaining ER homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins, thereby ensuring proper protein folding and degradation processes (Islam2018RETREG1). RETREG1 acts as a receptor for the ER-autophagic machinery, facilitating the continuous turnover of the ER by interacting with autophagy proteins such as LC3B and GABARAPL2 through its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif (Islam2018RETREG1).

In healthy human cells, RETREG1 clusters at the edges of ER cisternae, where it recruits autophagosomal membranes to the ER, leading to the formation of ER-derived vesicles that are degraded upon fusion with lysosomes (Islam2018RETREG1). This protein is also involved in reticulo-mitophagy, a dual organellar turnover mechanism that clears damaged mitochondria and excessive AMFR, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Mo2020Critical). RETREG1's activity is crucial for cellular stress responses and proper cellular function, particularly in neurons and other cell types sensitive to ER stress (Islam2018RETREG1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RETREG1 gene, also known as FAM134B, are linked to several diseases. Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IIB (HSAN IIB) is a notable condition associated with RETREG1 mutations. This rare neuropathy is characterized by progressive sensory deficits and variable autonomic and motor involvement, often resulting in severe complications such as ulcerations and osteomyelitis (Park2019Hereditary; Falcão2019Hereditary). 

In cancer, RETREG1 exhibits dual roles. It acts as a tumor suppressor in colorectal and breast cancers, where its upregulation can inhibit cancer growth. Conversely, it has oncogenic properties in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, contributing to cancer progression (Zhu2021Roles; Islam2018RETREG1). 

RETREG1 is also implicated in viral infections, where its upregulation inhibits viral replication by regulating ER-membrane curvature and degradation, crucial for the assembly and maturation of viruses like Dengue and Zika (Islam2018RETREG1). 

Additionally, alterations in RETREG1 expression are linked to vascular dementia and allergic rhinitis, highlighting its diverse roles in disease pathogenesis (Islam2018RETREG1). These findings underscore the gene's significance in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
RETREG1, also known as FAM134B, is a reticulophagy receptor that interacts with several proteins to facilitate selective autophagy processes. It contains a reticulon-homology domain (RHD) that anchors it in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and interacts with LC3 proteins through a C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is crucial for linking RETREG1 to the autophagy machinery (Popelka2020Molecular; Mookherjee2020RETREG1FAM134B).

RETREG1 also interacts with OPA1, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, to mediate the autophagosomal degradation of mitochondria, a process known as mitophagy. This interaction is essential for the formation of mitophagophores around destabilized mitochondria, facilitating their degradation (Mookherjee2020RETREG1FAM134B). RETREG1's interaction with OPA1 is particularly significant under conditions of high cytosolic calcium, which enhances their colocalization (Mookherjee2020RETREG1FAM134B).

Additionally, RETREG1 interacts with AMFR, an ER E3 ligase, promoting its autophagic degradation. This interaction is part of a dual organellar turnover mechanism involving both the ER and mitochondria (Mookherjee2020RETREG1FAM134B). RETREG1's role in these interactions underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis through selective autophagy.
