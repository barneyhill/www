# TCEAL9

## Overview
TCEAL9, or transcription elongation factor A like 9, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription elongation. The protein, a member of the TCEAL family, functions primarily within the nucleus and is implicated in modulating gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors. This regulatory role is crucial for various cellular processes, including growth and differentiation, and suggests that TCEAL9 may significantly impact cellular function and organismal development. The protein's involvement in transcription regulation positions it as a key player in ensuring the proper expression of genes necessary for these processes. While the specific molecular mechanisms and interactions of TCEAL9 are still under investigation, its expression has been linked to both neurological and oncological conditions, indicating its potential importance in human health and disease (NavasPérez2020Characterization; Aisa2022Comprehensive; Ward2020High).

## Function
TCEAL9, or transcription elongation factor A like 9, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription. This protein is a member of the TCEAL family, which plays a crucial role in transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. TCEAL9 is active in the nucleus, where it may interact with other transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Through these interactions, TCEAL9 influences various cellular processes, including growth and differentiation. The protein's activity in transcription regulation suggests it may have significant impacts on cellular function and organismal development by ensuring the proper expression of genes necessary for these processes. The precise molecular mechanisms by which TCEAL9 exerts its effects on transcription elongation and its specific interactions with other nuclear proteins remain areas of active research.

## Clinical Significance
TCEAL9 has been implicated in various neurological and oncological conditions. In the context of neurological disorders, the Bex/Tceal gene family, which includes TCEAL9, is associated with neurological functions and diseases. Alterations in this gene family have been linked to intellectual disability, craniofacial dysmorphism, and autism. Specifically, a duplication involving TCEAL9, along with BEX3, TCEAL4, and RAB40A, has been reported in a patient with autism, suggesting a potential link between TCEAL9 and autism spectrum disorders (NavasPérez2020Characterization).

In oncology, TCEAL9 expression is significantly upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) compared to normal tissues. High expression levels of TCEAL9 are associated with a better prognosis in overall survival for GBM patients, as indicated by a hazard ratio of 1.913 in multivariate Cox regression analysis. This suggests that TCEAL9 may play a role in the progression and prognosis of GBM, although the specific mechanisms remain to be further explored (Aisa2022Comprehensive). Additionally, TCEAL9 is mentioned as a candidate oncogene for colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability and as a predictive indicator for small cell lung cancers, highlighting its potential involvement in cancer pathogenesis (Ward2020High).
