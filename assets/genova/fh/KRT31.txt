# KRT31

## Overview
KRT31 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 31, a type I hair keratin, which is integral to the structural integrity and function of hair and epithelial cells. As a member of the keratin family, keratin 31 is characterized by its head-rod-tail domain structure, with a central α-helical coiled-coil rod domain that facilitates the formation of keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) through dimerization with type II keratins (Ho2022Update; Chamcheu2011Keratin). These filaments provide mechanical support and resilience to hair fibers, playing a crucial role in hair shaft differentiation and strength (Ramot2011TSH). The expression of KRT31 is regulated by hormonal factors such as thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin, which modulate its role in hair follicle development and cycling (Ramot2010Prolactin—a). KRT31's involvement in the anagen phase of the hair cycle highlights its importance in maintaining healthy hair growth and regeneration (An2022Keratinmediated).

## Structure
Keratin 31 (KRT31) is a type I hair keratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair and epithelial cells. The protein is organized into a head-rod-tail domain structure, typical of keratins, with a central α-helical coiled-coil rod domain. This rod domain is composed of four helical segments (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) interrupted by non-helical linkers, which are essential for the formation of the coiled-coil structure (Chamcheu2011Keratin). The heptad repeats within the rod domain are critical for the coiled-coil formation, facilitating the dimerization process that is fundamental to the protein's function (Ho2022Update).

In terms of quaternary structure, KRT31 forms heterodimers with type II keratins, which align to create tetramers and eventually assemble into keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) (Chamcheu2011Keratin). These filaments provide mechanical support and resilience to cells. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, influencing the protein's function and stability, although specific modifications for KRT31 are not detailed in the provided context. The structural organization and assembly properties of KRT31 are integral to its role in hair and epithelial cell function.

## Function
KRT31, or keratin 31, is a type I hair keratin gene that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and formation of the hair shaft. It is primarily expressed in the hair cortex, where it contributes to the differentiation and strength of the hair shaft (Ramot2011TSH). KRT31 is involved in the condensation of dermal papilla (DP) cells and the formation of hair germ from outer root sheath (ORS) cells, processes essential for hair follicle development and cycling (An2022Keratinmediated).

The expression of KRT31 is regulated by various factors, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin (PRL). TSH downregulates KRT31 expression, potentially affecting hair shaft differentiation (Ramot2011TSH). Conversely, PRL has been shown to downregulate KRT31 expression in the hair cortex, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism that influences keratin expression and hair follicle biology (Ramot2010Prolactin—a).

KRT31's role extends to influencing the hair cycle, particularly the anagen phase, by promoting the formation and size of anagen hair follicles. This function is critical for maintaining healthy hair growth and regeneration (An2022Keratinmediated).

## Interactions
Keratin 31 (KRT31) is a type I hair keratin that plays a significant role in the structural integrity of hair fibers. It interacts with other keratin proteins to form intermediate filaments, which are essential for the mechanical stability and resilience of hair. These interactions involve the heteropolymeric pairing of type I and type II keratin molecules, forming heterodimers that align to create keratin intermediate filaments (Chamcheu2011Keratin).

KRT31 is involved in the condensation of dermal papilla (DP) cells and the formation of hair follicles. This process is influenced by the interaction of keratin with outer root sheath (ORS) cells, which are crucial for hair follicle formation. The study highlights the role of keratin in inducing DP cell condensation and germ formation from ORS cells, which are critical steps in hair growth and regeneration (An2022Keratinmediated).

The interaction between P-cadherin and β-catenin is also noted as important for maintaining the anagen phase of the hair cycle, with keratin-treated ORS cells showing strong expression of β-catenin (An2022Keratinmediated). These interactions underscore the functional role of KRT31 in hair follicle biology and its potential as a therapeutic target for hair loss treatment (An2022Keratinmediated).
