# FLNB

## Overview
The FLNB gene encodes the protein filamin B, a crucial component of the cytoskeleton that plays a significant role in cellular architecture and signaling. Filamin B is a multidomain protein that functions primarily as an actin-binding protein, facilitating the cross-linking of actin filaments and contributing to the mechanical stability and motility of cells. It is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell shape, migration, and signal transduction. The protein's structure, characterized by an N-terminal actin-binding domain and a series of immunoglobulin-like repeats, allows it to act as a scaffold for numerous cellular interactions. Mutations in the FLNB gene are linked to several skeletal disorders, highlighting its importance in skeletal development and maintenance (Ma2020Filamin; Bicknell2006A; S.2020Deciphering).

## Structure
The FLNB (filamin B) protein is a multidomain monomer that plays a critical role in skeletal development. It is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 3p14.3 and consists of 2602 amino acids (Ma2020Filamin; S.2020Deciphering). The primary structure of FLNB includes an N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD) composed of two calponin-homology domains (CH1 and CH2) (Daniel2012Diseaseassociated; S.2020Deciphering). The protein also features a central rod-like domain with 24 immunoglobulin-like repeats, interrupted by two hinge regions: hinge-1 between repeats 15 and 16, and hinge-2 between repeats 23 and 24 (Baudier2018The; S.2020Deciphering).

The tertiary structure of FLNB allows it to act as a scaffold, interacting with various cellular components (S.2020Deciphering). The quaternary structure involves dimerization through a C-terminal domain, which also functions as a mechanosensor (Baudier2018The). FLNB undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, and alternative splicing results in multiple isoforms (Ma2020Filamin). These structural features enable FLNB to perform dual functions: forming a three-dimensional network of actin and acting as a scaffold for receptor activation and signal transduction (Ma2020Filamin).

## Function
Filamin B (FLNB) is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a critical role in cross-linking actin filaments, contributing to cell shape, mechanical stability, and motility. In endothelial cells, FLNB is essential for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced cell motility and angiogenesis. It acts as a scaffolding protein, forming a signaling complex with Rac-1 and Vav-2, which interacts with VEGFR2 and integrin αvβ5 upon VEGF stimulation. This interaction is crucial for endothelial cell migration and the formation of new blood vessels, processes vital for wound healing and the menstrual cycle (del2010Filamin).

FLNB is highly expressed in endothelial cells and is involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is necessary for cell motility. Its depletion leads to increased adhesion to the extracellular matrix and defects in the stabilization of new adhesions, affecting cell migration (del2010Filamin). FLNB also regulates the cycles of Rac-1 activation and inactivation, which are critical for normal endothelial cell function (del2010Filamin).

In addition to its role in endothelial cells, FLNB is involved in stabilizing loose microfilament networks, which is important for cell locomotion and maintaining cell morphology (Feng2004The). It also plays a role in regulating RhoA activation, influencing actin stress fiber formation and cell spreading (Hu2017Opposing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FLNB gene are associated with a range of skeletal disorders, primarily due to missense variants in specific domains of the filamin B protein. These disorders include Larsen syndrome, atelosteogenesis types I and III, and boomerang dysplasia, which are typically autosomal dominant conditions (Bicknell2006A; S.2020Deciphering). Larsen syndrome is characterized by large joint dislocations, craniofacial anomalies, and other skeletal abnormalities. It is caused by heterozygous mutations in the FLNB gene, often involving missense mutations or small in-frame deletions that cluster in the actin-binding domain and filamin repeats 13-17 (Bicknell2006A; Zhang2005Mutations).

Atelosteogenesis types I and III and boomerang dysplasia are more severe conditions, often resulting in underossification of skeletal elements and hypoplastic or absent limb bones. These conditions are linked to mutations in the calponin homology domain 2 and specific filamin repeats of FLNB (Daniel2012Diseaseassociated; Bicknell2005Mutations). Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome, a recessive condition, is characterized by fused vertebrae and joints and is associated with biallelic loss-of-function variants in FLNB (Salian2018Seven). The pathogenic mechanisms of these disorders are not fully understood but may involve gain-of-function effects that alter the protein's actin-binding ability and cellular mechanotransduction (Daniel2012Diseaseassociated; S.2020Deciphering).

## Interactions
Filamin B (FLNB) is a cytoskeletal protein that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of its notable interactions is with histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7), where FLNB acts as a cytoplasmic interacting partner. This interaction is regulated by the monoubiquitination of FLNB at lysine 1147, which is essential for binding HDAC7 and promoting its cytoplasmic retention. The interaction is influenced by protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMK I), which enhance FLNB ubiquitination, thereby preventing HDAC7's nuclear entry by masking its nuclear localization signal (Su2013Monoubiquitination).

FLNB also interacts with HDAC5, another member of the class IIa HDAC family, but does not interact with SMRT or ACTN4. The interaction with HDAC7 affects the transcriptional activity of MEF2-driven reporters, with FLNB overcoming HDAC7-mediated repression (Su2013Monoubiquitination). In endothelial cells, FLNB is crucial for VEGF-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of HDAC7, affecting the expression of target genes like Mmp-10 and Nur77, and modulating vascular permeability (Su2013Monoubiquitination). These interactions highlight FLNB's role in cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation, particularly in the context of VEGF signaling pathways.
