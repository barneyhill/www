# FOXD4L3

## Overview
FOXD4L3 is a gene that encodes the protein forkhead box D4 like 3, which is a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a distinct forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain, which plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in various biological processes, including development, cell differentiation, and proliferation. The FOXD4L3 protein is implicated in the regulation of transcriptional networks that are essential for normal cellular function and development. Mutations in the FOXD4L3 gene have been associated with several types of cancer, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis and highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Tyler2021The; Kanwal2018Characterization).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FOXD4L3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In well-differentiated retroperitoneal liposarcoma (WD-LPS), a recurrent mutation in FOXD4L3 (chr9:70,918,189A>T; c.322A>T; p.Lys108Ter) was identified, resulting in a stop gain mutation. This mutation was found in a significant number of tumor samples, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis through interactions with transcription factors involved in cell differentiation and development (Tyler2021The). The mutation is located just upstream of the Forkhead box domain, indicating possible functional consequences (Tyler2021The).

In familial lung cancer (FLC) within the Chinese population, mutations in FOXD4L3 were observed at higher frequencies in cancer tissues compared to healthy populations. Although the study did not conclusively link these mutations to lung cancer predisposition, it suggested that they could contribute to cancer development (Kanwal2018Characterization). Additionally, FOXD4L3 mutations were identified in chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer (CLPD-NK) cells, although their role as disease drivers remains uncertain (Gasparini2020A). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of FOXD4L3 mutations in various cancers, warranting further investigation into their functional roles.
