# GOLGA3

## Overview
GOLGA3 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A3, also known as golgin-160, which is a coiled-coil protein associated with the Golgi apparatus. Golgin A3 plays a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus by recruiting the dynein motor protein, which is essential for Golgi positioning and integrity. The protein is also involved in apoptosis, where it undergoes caspase-mediated cleavage, leading to Golgi fragmentation. Beyond its structural roles, golgin A3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including BCR signaling and spermatogenesis, and is expressed in airway basal cells and differentiated epithelium, suggesting a role in lung physiology. Mutations in the GOLGA3 gene have been linked to male infertility and have potential implications in acute myeloid leukemia and primary ciliary dyskinesia-like conditions (Bray2002Identification; Shamseldin2020An; Awoniyi2020BCRinduced; He2020The).

## Function
GOLGA3, also known as golgin160, is a coiled-coil protein localized to the cis-Golgi cisternae, playing a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus. It is involved in the recruitment of the dynein motor protein to the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for the proper positioning and integrity of the Golgi ribbons. The absence of golgin160 leads to Golgi positioning defects and the formation of dispersed ministacks, highlighting its importance in Golgi organization (He2020The).

GOLGA3 is also implicated in apoptosis, where it undergoes cleavage by caspases, such as caspase 2, 3, and 7. This cleavage is associated with Golgi fragmentation, a characteristic change during apoptosis. The expression of a caspase-resistant form of golgin160 can attenuate these apoptotic changes, indicating its role in modulating Golgi morphology during cell death (He2020The).

In addition to its role in Golgi structure, GOLGA3 is expressed in airway basal cells and differentiated epithelium, suggesting a role in lung physiology. It is also involved in reproductive biology, as male mice lacking GOLGA3 exhibit infertility due to abnormal sperm tail structure (Shamseldin2020An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GOLGA3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily affecting male reproductive health. A specific nonsense mutation in the Golga3 gene, known as the repro27 allele, results in male-specific infertility in mice due to defects in spermatogenesis. This mutation leads to a premature termination codon in exon 18, causing the absence of GOLGA3 protein expression. Affected mice exhibit testicular atrophy, low sperm concentration and motility, and unsuccessful in vitro fertilization, with defects becoming apparent during late meiosis (Bentson2013New).

In humans, alterations in GOLGA3 expression have been implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High expression levels of GOLGA3, along with other genes, have been used to develop a risk score model to predict overall survival in AML patients, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Lai2021Novel).

Additionally, GOLGA3 has been identified as a novel candidate gene associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)-like presentations, although it is not traditionally recognized as a PCD-related gene. This association suggests a potential role in lung physiology and conditions that overlap with PCD (Shamseldin2020An).

## Interactions
GOLGA3, also known as golgin-160, is a coiled-coil protein associated with the Golgi apparatus and is involved in various protein interactions. It has been shown to recruit the dynein microtubule motor protein to the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for maintaining Golgi positioning and integrity (He2020The). During apoptosis, GOLGA3 is cleaved by caspases, and this cleavage is involved in inducing apoptotic changes in Golgi morphology (He2020The).

GOLGA3 interacts with TRAX, a protein associated with the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum distribution pattern in cells. This interaction was demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid assays and confirmed by in vitro assays, indicating a physical interaction between these proteins (Bray2002Identification). The interaction with TRAX suggests a potential role for GOLGA3 in spermatogenesis, as disruption of Golga3 in mice results in a spermatogenic defect (Bray2002Identification).

In BCR signaling, GOLGA3 is identified as a multifunctional peripheral membrane protein. Upon IgM engagement, GOLGA3 translocates to the proximity of the BCR, highlighting its potential role in BCR signaling (Awoniyi2020BCRinduced). These interactions underscore the diverse functional roles of GOLGA3 in cellular processes.
