# BRD3

## Overview
BRD3 is a gene that encodes the bromodomain-containing protein 3, a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation by recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone tails and transcription factors. The BRD3 protein is characterized by its bromodomains and an extra-terminal (ET) domain, which facilitate interactions with various chromatin remodeling complexes and transcription factors, such as GATA1, thereby influencing gene expression patterns and cellular processes like erythroid maturation (Wai2018The; Lamonica2011Bromodomain). Clinically, BRD3 is significant due to its involvement in certain cancers, notably NUT midline carcinoma, where it forms oncogenic fusions with the NUTM1 gene, contributing to tumorigenesis (Moreno2022NUT). As a result, BRD3 is considered a potential therapeutic target, with ongoing research into BET inhibitors that may disrupt its oncogenic functions (Lamonica2011Bromodomain).

## Structure
The BRD3 protein is a member of the BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal domain) family, characterized by its involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. The protein contains an ET (extra-terminal) domain, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins. The ET domain is composed of three α-helices: α1 (residues 574-586), α2 (residues 590-602), and α3 (residues 624-637), with a long loop separating α2 and α3. This loop is composed of alternating negatively charged and hydrophobic residues, contributing to the formation of a hydrophobic pocket lined by acidic side chains, essential for protein interactions (Aiyer2020A).

The ET domain forms polymorphic structural interfaces with both host and viral proteins, often involving a three-stranded β-sheet formation. This structural feature is key to the molecular recognition mechanism of the ET domain, allowing it to interact with various peptides, including those from the murine leukemia virus integrase and the host NSD3 protein (Aiyer2020A). The ET domain's interaction with peptides results in increased buried surface area, leading to tighter binding, which is significant for its role in recruiting gene-expression regulating proteins (Aiyer2020A).

BRD3's ET domain is highly conserved among BET proteins, indicating its critical role in BET protein function (Wai2018The). The ET domain's interaction mechanism is conserved across chromatin remodelers and transcriptional regulators, involving the formation of an intermolecular two-stranded β-sheet (Wai2018The).

## Function
BRD3 is a member of the BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal domain) family of proteins, which are key regulators of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. It functions primarily by recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone tails and transcription factors, facilitating chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. In healthy human cells, BRD3 is involved in stabilizing the chromatin occupancy of transcription factors such as GATA1, which is crucial for erythroid gene regulation and erythropoiesis (Wai2018The; Lamonica2011Bromodomain).

The BRD3 protein interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes, such as NuRD and BAF, through its ET domain, which binds to specific peptide motifs. This interaction is essential for linking chromatin acetylation to transcriptional outcomes, suggesting a role in genome organization and chromatin boundary function (Wai2018The). BRD3 is also involved in the recruitment of these complexes to transcription factor binding sites, influencing gene expression patterns (Wai2018The).

BRD3's activity is primarily nuclear, where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. It plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and differentiation, and is implicated in the regulation of erythroid maturation by interacting with acetylated GATA1 (Wai2018The; Lamonica2011Bromodomain).

## Clinical Significance
BRD3 is clinically significant due to its involvement in certain aggressive cancers, particularly NUT midline carcinoma (NC). In these cancers, BRD3 forms a fusion with the NUTM1 gene, resulting from chromosomal translocations. This BRD3-NUTM1 fusion is present in approximately 15-30% of NC cases and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease by promoting cellular growth and blocking cell differentiation (Moreno2022NUT). The fusion product recruits factors that lead to chromatin hyper-acetylation and transcriptional activation, which supports cancer cell survival and proliferation (Fujisawa2017Functions).

BRD3, as part of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein family, is involved in activating transcription of oncogenes and upregulating anti-apoptotic genes, contributing to tumor growth and resistance to apoptosis (Moreno2022NUT). The role of BRD3 in these processes highlights its potential as a therapeutic target. Compounds targeting BET proteins, including BRD3, are being explored for their ability to disrupt these oncogenic interactions and may offer new treatment avenues for cancers involving BRD3 alterations (Lamonica2011Bromodomain). The clinical significance of BRD3 is underscored by its contribution to the aggressive nature of cancers like NUT midline carcinoma.

## Interactions
BRD3, a member of the BET family of proteins, is involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein interacts with several chromatin remodeling complexes, including NuRD, SWI/SNF, INO80, TFIID, TFIIH, Mediator, and the PAF complex. Notably, BRD3 binds with chromatin remodeling enzymes such as CHD4 and BRG1, with the interaction involving the ET domain of BRD3 and a disordered region of CHD4 (Wai2018The).

The ET domain of BRD3 recognizes a conserved linear motif, 'PLKI(K/R)L', found in various proteins like CHD4, NSD3, and GLTSCR1, indicating a conserved mode of interaction across different complexes (Wai2018The). This domain forms a groove that accommodates the binding of peptides, facilitating interactions through hydrophobic and electrostatic forces (Wai2018The).

BRD3 also interacts with the transcription factor GATA1, where it binds to acetylated GATA1, promoting its chromatin occupancy at erythroid target genes. This interaction is acetylation-dependent and involves the first bromodomain of BRD3 (Lamonica2011Bromodomain). The protein's interactions with acetylated histones and transcription factors highlight its role as a reader of acetylation marks, influencing gene expression and chromatin dynamics.
