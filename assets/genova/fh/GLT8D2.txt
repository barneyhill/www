# GLT8D2

## Overview
GLT8D2 is a gene that encodes the protein glycosyltransferase 8 domain containing 2, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase enzyme family. This protein is primarily involved in glycosylation processes, a critical post-translational modification that affects protein folding, stability, and cell signaling. Glycosyltransferase 8 domain containing 2 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, particularly through its interaction with apolipoprotein B100 and its regulation of lipid droplet accumulation and triglyceride content (Chen2021High). The protein is also implicated in maintaining extracellular matrix organization, which is essential for tissue structure and function (Chen2021High). Alterations in GLT8D2 expression have been linked to various diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (Huang2021Overexpression; Zhan2015Mechanism).

## Function
The GLT8D2 gene encodes a glycosyltransferase enzyme involved in glycosylation processes, which are crucial for various cellular functions, including protein folding, stability, and cell signaling. This enzyme is typically localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with apolipoprotein B100, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism (Chen2021High). In healthy cells, glycosylation mediated by GLT8D2 is important for maintaining cell-cell adhesion, which is critical for tissue integrity and communication (Chen2021High).

GLT8D2 is implicated in lipid homeostasis by regulating lipid droplet accumulation and triglyceride content in HepG2 cells, potentially through the suppression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein levels (Chen2021High). This regulation suggests a role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where GLT8D2 expression is upregulated (Zhan2015Mechanism). The protein's involvement in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization also indicates a role in maintaining tissue structure and function (Chen2021High).

While GLT8D2's specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its activities in glycosylation and lipid metabolism highlight its importance in cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
GLT8D2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In ovarian cancer, overexpression of GLT8D2 is associated with chemoresistance, particularly to platinum-based chemotherapy such as cisplatin (CDDP). This resistance is mediated through the activation of the FGFR/PI3K signaling axis, which enhances cell survival and proliferation. Inhibition of GLT8D2 has been shown to increase sensitivity to CDDP, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in ovarian cancer (Huang2021Overexpression).

In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), GLT8D2 expression is upregulated, contributing to lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. This is achieved by downregulating microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which is crucial for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and secretion. The increased expression of GLT8D2 leads to higher triglyceride content and lipid droplet accumulation, indicating its role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD (Zhan2016Glycosyltransferases; Zhan2015Mechanism).

GLT8D2 has also been identified as a putative regulator of bone mineral density (BMD). In male Glt8d2 knockout mice, an increase in BMD was observed, suggesting a sex-specific interaction and its potential impact on bone health (AlBarghouthi2021Systems; AlBarghouthi2020Systems).

## Interactions
GLT8D2, a glycosyltransferase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In ovarian cancer, GLT8D2 physically interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. This interaction is crucial for activating the FGFR/PI3K signaling axis, which contributes to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells. The interaction leads to increased phosphorylation of FRS2a, a key step in activating downstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT pathway (Huang2021Overexpression).

The overexpression of GLT8D2 enhances the activity of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, evidenced by increased FOXO luciferase reporter activity and changes in the phosphorylation levels of AKT and GSK3β. This signaling cascade is associated with a higher percentage of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, which can be reversed by FGFR inhibitors (Huang2021Overexpression).

In gastric cancer, GLT8D2 is identified as a glycosyltransferase that may modify substrate proteins through glycosylation, affecting their stability, localization, interaction, and activity. However, specific physical interactions of GLT8D2 with other proteins or nucleic acids in gastric cancer are not detailed (Wang2024GLT8D2).
