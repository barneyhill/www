# DYNC1LI2

## Overview
The DYNC1LI2 gene encodes the dynein cytoplasmic 1 light intermediate chain 2, a protein that is a critical component of the cytoplasmic dynein-1 complex. This complex functions as a motor protein responsible for retrograde transport along microtubules, playing a vital role in intracellular transport and various cellular processes, including mitosis, cell migration, and neuronal function. The protein is characterized by a RAS-like domain at the N-terminus, which is essential for its interaction with the dynein heavy chain, and a predominantly disordered C-terminal region that facilitates binding to various adaptors (Rao2024Structure). DYNC1LI2 is distinct from its paralog LIC1, as they do not coexist in the same dynein-1 complex, leading to unique cellular roles (Rao2024Structure). The structural features and interactions of DYNC1LI2 are crucial for its function in maintaining cellular organization and supporting dynamic processes essential for cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Structure
The DYNC1LI2 gene encodes the dynein cytoplasmic 1 light intermediate chain 2, a component of the cytoplasmic dynein-1 complex. This protein is characterized by a RAS-like domain at the N-terminus, which is crucial for its interaction with the heavy chain of dynein, stabilizing the complex and preventing aggregation (Rao2024Structure). The RAS-like domain can bind GTP, although it has lost its hydrolysis capability (Rao2024Structure). The C-terminal region of DYNC1LI2 is predominantly disordered, featuring interspersed short helices, which are important for binding to various adaptors (Rao2024Structure).

DYNC1LI2 shares 65% sequence identity with its paralog LIC1, but they do not coexist in the same dynein-1 complex, leading to distinct cellular roles (Rao2024Structure). The protein's structure allows it to adopt a crescent shape on the heavy chain tail region, forming a supportive scaffold with the intermediate chain to provide stability to the dynein complex (Rao2024Structure). The protein's interactions and structural features are essential for its function in spindle orientation during mitosis (Rao2024Structure).

## Function
DYNC1LI2 encodes a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, which is a motor protein responsible for retrograde transport along microtubules. This protein plays a crucial role in intracellular transport, facilitating the movement of organelles, vesicles, and proteins within the cell. It is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for several cellular processes, including mitosis, cell migration, and neuronal function. The dynein complex, with DYNC1LI2 as a component, is vital for maintaining cellular organization and function by ensuring the proper distribution of cellular components. This transport mechanism is critical for the proper functioning of neurons, as it supports the movement of neurotransmitters and other essential molecules along axons, contributing to neuronal communication and health. The role of DYNC1LI2 in mitosis involves the proper alignment and separation of chromosomes, which is crucial for cell division and the maintenance of genomic stability. In cell migration, the protein aids in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, allowing cells to move and adapt to their environment. Overall, DYNC1LI2 is integral to the dynamic processes that sustain cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Interactions
DYNC1LI2, a component of the cytoplasmic dynein-1 complex, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is involved in mitotic processes, particularly in the orientation of the mitotic spindle and the removal of spindle-assembly checkpoint components from kinetochores (Rao2024Structure). Although specific interactions of DYNC1LI2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is known to participate in the dynein complex, which includes heavy, intermediate, and light chains, as well as dynactin, a cofactor that enhances dynein's binding to cargo (Rao2024Structure).

DYNC1LI2 does not coexist with its homolog LIC1 in the same dynein-1 complex, indicating distinct roles and interactions for each homolog (Rao2024Structure). While the specific binding partners of DYNC1LI2 are not extensively documented, the general mechanism of LIC interactions with adaptors, such as the use of helix 1 for binding, is relevant to understanding its potential interactions (Celestino2019A). The structural and functional roles of DYNC1LI2 within the dynein complex contribute to its involvement in intracellular transport processes, although further research is needed to elucidate its specific interaction partners.
