# SLC39A12

## Overview
SLC39A12 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 12, commonly referred to as ZIP12, which is a member of the ZIP family of zinc transporters. ZIP12 is characterized as a transmembrane protein with eight transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in the transport of zinc ions across cell membranes. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining zinc homeostasis, particularly in the nervous system, where it is essential for processes such as neurite outgrowth, neuronal differentiation, and microtubule stability (Chowanadisai2014Comparative; Davis2021A). ZIP12 is also implicated in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress suppression, highlighting its importance in cellular health and development (Strong2020Role). The gene's expression and function are conserved across vertebrates, underscoring its evolutionary significance (Chowanadisai2014Comparative).

## Structure
The SLC39A12 gene encodes the zinc transporter protein ZIP12, which is part of the ZIP family of zinc transporters. ZIP12 is characterized by having eight transmembrane domains, with a long extracytosolic N-terminus and a short extracytosolic C-terminus (Kambe2019Zinc; Davis2021A). A notable feature of ZIP12 is the presence of a histidine-rich intracytosolic loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4, which is thought to bind zinc (Kambe2019Zinc). The protein also contains a HEXPHEXGD motif within transmembrane domain 5, believed to be a catalytic zinc-binding site, similar to those found in zinc metallopeptidases (Kambe2019Zinc).

ZIP12 has two splice variants due to the inclusion or exclusion of an in-frame exon, which extends an intracellular loop with a histidine-rich region. This feature is conserved across many vertebrates (Davis2021A). The protein is highly expressed in the nervous system and is involved in processes such as neurite outgrowth and microtubule stability (Chowanadisai2014Comparative). ZIP12's structure and function are crucial for maintaining zinc homeostasis, particularly in the brain (Davis2021A).

## Function
The SLC39A12 gene encodes the zinc transporter protein ZIP12, which plays a crucial role in maintaining zinc homeostasis in cells. ZIP12 is primarily active in the brain, where it is involved in several key molecular processes essential for neuronal development and function. It facilitates the uptake of zinc into the cytosol, which is necessary for neurite outgrowth, neuronal differentiation, and microtubule polymerization and stability (Chowanadisai2014Comparative; Davis2021A). ZIP12 is also involved in the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which is important for mitochondrial function and cellular respiration (Davis2021A).

ZIP12's role extends to mitochondrial health, where it helps suppress oxidative stress by maintaining mitochondrial function. Deficiency in ZIP12 can lead to impaired mitochondrial function, increased superoxide presence, and protein carbonylation, indicating its importance in oxidative stress suppression (Strong2020Role). The protein's activity is not limited to the nervous system; it is also induced by hypoxia in pulmonary vascular cells, suggesting a broader role in zinc homeostasis and cell proliferation under stress conditions (Davis2021A). ZIP12's function is conserved across vertebrates, underscoring its significance in nervous system development and function (Chowanadisai2014Comparative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC39A12 gene, which encodes the zinc transporter ZIP12, have been implicated in several neurological and systemic conditions. In the nervous system, ZIP12 is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, schizophrenia, and autism. Specific polymorphisms, such as rs10764176, and a 73 kb deletion affecting exons 1-12, have been associated with changes in brain MRI intensity and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are critical for neuronal health (Strong2020Role; Davis2021A). In schizophrenia, ZIP12 expression is altered in certain brain regions, particularly in patients with the muscarinic receptor deficit schizophrenia subtype, suggesting a role in the disease's pathology (Davis2021A).

Beyond the nervous system, SLC39A12 mutations are linked to pulmonary hypertension, particularly under hypoxic conditions. A frameshift mutation in ZIP12 in F344 rats confers resistance to hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, indicating its role in pulmonary vascular remodeling (Davis2021A). ZIP12 is also associated with various cancers, including esophageal adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where aberrant expression may contribute to tumorigenesis (Davis2021A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC39A12 in both neurological and systemic diseases, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for conditions involving zinc dysregulation.
