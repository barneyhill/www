# OPCML

## Overview
The OPCML gene encodes the opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like protein, a member of the IgLON family of immunoglobulin domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell adhesion molecules. This protein is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a significant role in cell adhesion and cell-cell recognition, contributing to normal cellular functions and signal transduction pathways. OPCML is characterized by its three immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate its function as a cell adhesion molecule and its interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as AXL and FGFR1, thereby exerting tumor suppressor effects. The protein's ability to form homodimers and heterodimers is crucial for its role in maintaining intercellular adhesion and proper signaling. Disruptions in OPCML expression or function, often due to epigenetic modifications or mutations, are associated with various cancers, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Birtley2019Inactivating; McKie2012The; Cui2008OPCML).

## Structure
The OPCML protein is a member of the IgLON family and is characterized by its three immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, which contribute to its role in cell adhesion. These domains are arranged in a linear fashion and connected by short linkers, forming a homodimer with an inverted V shape. The dimerization is mediated by a D1-D1 interface, stabilized by hydrophobic contacts, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges, with a significant buried surface area and solvation free energy gain (Birtley2019Inactivating). The dimer is anchored into the plasma membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors linked to the D3 domain, with the C-terminal ends approximately 180 Å apart (Birtley2019Inactivating).

The primary structure of OPCML includes several key residues crucial for its function, such as Arg 65, Asp 80, and Thr 114, which are involved in dimer stabilization (Birtley2019Inactivating). Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is important for the protein's stability and function. For instance, the N70H mutation disrupts N-linked glycosylation at Asn 70, leading to protein aggregation and reduced secretion (Birtley2019Inactivating).

The quaternary structure of OPCML is essential for its tumor suppressor functions, as it interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) like AXL and FGFR1. Mutations affecting the dimerization interface can lead to a loss of these interactions, impacting cellular functions such as motility and signaling pathways (Birtley2019Inactivating).

## Function
The OPCML gene encodes a protein that is part of the IgLON family of immunoglobulin domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell adhesion molecules. These proteins are primarily expressed in the brain and play a crucial role in cell adhesion and cell-cell recognition through both homophilic and heterophilic interactions (Cui2008OPCML; Czekierdowski2011OPCML). In healthy human cells, OPCML is involved in maintaining normal cellular functions by forming heterodimeric complexes with other IgLONs, which are essential for signal transduction pathways (Cui2008OPCML). This interaction is vital for maintaining intercellular adhesion and proper signaling, which, when disrupted, can lead to carcinogenesis (Cui2008OPCML).

OPCML is highly expressed in various regions of the brain, such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, and is localized to dendrites, indicating its role as a dendrite-associated cell adhesion molecule (Czekierdowski2011OPCML). It is synthesized in the somata and transported to dendrites, where its subcellular localization can change in an activity-dependent manner, contributing to synaptogenesis and neuronal diversity during development (Czekierdowski2011OPCML). OPCML also negatively regulates receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as HER2, HER4, EphA2, FGFR1, and FGFR3, which are involved in cell signaling pathways that control cell growth and survival (Lian2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The OPCML gene is frequently inactivated in various cancers, including ovarian, breast, and brain tumors, primarily through epigenetic mechanisms such as methylation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). This inactivation is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival rates in patients (McKie2012The; Zhou2014Methylation). In ovarian cancer, OPCML's silencing is linked to the loss of its tumor suppressor functions, which include the downregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) like HER2, FGFR1, and EphA2. This regulation is crucial for inhibiting cancer cell growth and enhancing the efficacy of targeted therapies such as lapatinib and erlotinib (McKie2012The; Zanini2017The).

Mutations in OPCML can also impact its tumor suppressor functions. Specific point mutations, such as R65L, N70H, and P95R, disrupt OPCML's ability to dimerize and interact with RTKs, leading to a loss of function in inhibiting cancer cell migration and invasion (Birtley2019Inactivating; Antony2020Emerging). These mutations can contribute to cancer progression by impairing OPCML's role in cell adhesion and signaling pathways, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Birtley2019Inactivating; Antony2020Emerging).

## Interactions
OPCML interacts with a specific set of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including EPHA2, FGFR1, FGFR3, HER2, and HER4, but not with EGFR or HER3. These interactions occur through the extracellular domains of the RTKs, leading to their sequestration in lipid rafts and subsequent polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This process results in the downregulation of RTK signaling, which is crucial for its tumor suppressor function in epithelial ovarian cancer (McKie2012The).

In cholangiocarcinoma, OPCML interacts with the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, leading to the inactivation of the AXL/STAT3 signaling pathway. This interaction is associated with reduced cell migration and invasion, highlighting OPCML's role in inhibiting cancer progression (KHAMKO2022Combined; KHAMKO2021OPCMLExerts).

OPCML also interacts with EphB2, a member of the Eph receptor family, influencing the EphB2-cofilin signaling pathway. This interaction is significant in the context of neuronal development and cognitive behaviors, as demonstrated in studies involving OPCML-deficient mice (Zhang2019The).
