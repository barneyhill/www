# CFAP126

## Overview
CFAP126 is a gene that encodes the protein cilia and flagella associated protein 126, also known as Flattop. This protein is integral to the establishment of planar cell polarity and is involved in the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway, which is crucial for the structural and functional integrity of pancreatic islets. CFAP126 plays a significant role in ciliogenesis, the formation of cilia, which is essential for cellular movement and signaling. The protein is also a marker of β-cell lineage and maturity, being expressed in human embryonic stem cell-derived spheroids at levels indicative of differentiated β-cells. Its expression and function underscore its importance in cellular differentiation and tissue development (Ellis2017Regenerative; Singh2020Enhanced; Vladar2020Noncanonical).

## Function
CFAP126, also known as Flattop, is a protein encoded by the CFAP126 gene and plays a significant role in the establishment of planar cell polarity, particularly in the context of pancreatic β-cell maturation. It is transcriptionally activated during the development of the islet microenvironment and 3D structure, indicating its association with a mature and nonproliferative state of β-cells. This protein is crucial for the proper functioning of the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway, which is essential for maintaining the structure and function of pancreatic islets (Ellis2017Regenerative).

In healthy human cells, CFAP126 is involved in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is vital for various cellular functions, including movement and signaling. The protein's role in ciliogenesis suggests its involvement in the regulation of cellular asymmetries and polarized behaviors, which are critical for the development and function of different tissues (Vladar2020Noncanonical).

CFAP126 is also expressed in human embryonic stem cell-derived spheroids, where it serves as a marker of β-cell lineage and maturity. This expression is above the levels found in undifferentiated cells, highlighting its role in the differentiation and function of β-cells (Singh2020Enhanced).
