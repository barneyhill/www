# TRAPPC9

## Overview
TRAPPC9 is a gene that encodes the trafficking protein particle complex subunit 9, a crucial component of the transport protein particle II (TRAPPII) complex. This protein is involved in vesicle-mediated transport processes within cells, particularly in the trafficking of cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and in intra-Golgi transport. The TRAPPC9 protein contains an ASPM, SPD-2, Hydin (ASH) domain and multiple tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and centrosome localization (Mbimba2018TRAPPC9:; Schou2014Identification). Functionally, TRAPPC9 is implicated in the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways, which are essential for various cellular processes, including gene activation and neuronal development (Mbimba2018TRAPPC9:; Hussein2019A). Mutations in the TRAPPC9 gene are linked to neurological and developmental disorders, such as intellectual disability and microcephaly, underscoring its significance in brain function and development (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:; Hnoonual2019Novel).

## Structure
TRAPPC9 is a subunit of the TRAPPII complex, which is involved in vesicle trafficking processes. The protein contains an ASPM, SPD-2, Hydin (ASH) domain at the C-terminal, which is associated with centrosome localization and microtubule organization (Mbimba2018TRAPPC9:; Schou2014Identification). The ASH domain is proposed to be a centrosome-targeting module, potentially interacting with microtubules or centrosome-specific Rab GTPases like Rab8 (Schou2014Identification). TRAPPC9 also contains multiple tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are predicted to form α-solenoid structures (Mbimba2018TRAPPC9:; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

The amino-terminal portion of TRAPPC9 (amino acids 117-411) is predicted to be an α-solenoid with TPR domains, while the carboxy portion contains ASH domains (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). These structural features suggest a largely helical structure, consistent with the presence of TPR and ASH domains (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). TRAPPC9 interacts with other TRAPPII subunits, such as TRAPPC2 and TRAPPC10, during complex formation, indicating its role in the quaternary structure of the TRAPPII complex (Mbimba2018TRAPPC9:). Variants in TRAPPC9 are linked to non-syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability (NS-ARID) and postnatal microcephaly, highlighting its importance in brain function (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

## Function
TRAPPC9 is a protein subunit of the transport protein particle II (TRAPPII) complex, which is crucial for vesicle-mediated transport within cells. It plays a significant role in the trafficking of cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, as well as in intra-Golgi and endosome-to-Golgi transport (Mbimba2018TRAPPC9:). TRAPPC9 is involved in the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a critical factor in gene activation associated with multiple pathways, by interacting with and regulating NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase subunit β (IKKβ) activation (Mbimba2018TRAPPC9:; Hussein2019A).

In the early secretory pathway, TRAPPC9 mediates the interaction between p150 Glued and COPII vesicles at the target membrane, specifically the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). This interaction is essential for vesicle movement and tethering at the target membrane, facilitating the proper functioning of vesicle transport and Golgi apparatus maintenance (Zong2012TRAPPC9). TRAPPC9 is predominantly localized in the cis-Golgi and ERGIC, indicating its significant role in these cellular compartments (Zong2012TRAPPC9). It is also expressed at high levels in the developing cortical plate of the human embryonic brain and in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and deep gray matter, highlighting its importance in brain development and function (Mbimba2018TRAPPC9:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAPPC9 gene are associated with a range of neurological and developmental disorders. These include intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delay (DD), and microcephaly. The gene is crucial for NF-κB signaling pathways, which are important for neuronal processes such as differentiation and synaptic plasticity. Impaired NF-κB signaling due to TRAPPC9 mutations can lead to myelination defects in the central nervous system (Yu2024Case; Hnoonual2019Novel).

Clinical phenotypes associated with TRAPPC9 mutations include dysmorphic facial features, brain abnormalities such as a thin corpus callosum and cerebral hypoplasia, and in rare cases, cleft lip (Hnoonual2019Novel). Mutations identified in TRAPPC9 include nonsense mutations, frameshift deletions, and splice site mutations, which have been reported across various ethnic groups (Marangi2012TRAPPC9related; Hnoonual2019Novel).

TRAPPC9 deficiency in animal models has been shown to impair learning and memory, supporting its role in cognitive functions (Yu2024Case). The gene's involvement in vesicle trafficking pathways is crucial for normal cellular function, and its mutations can lead to significant cognitive and developmental impairments (Yu2024Case).

## Interactions
TRAPPC9, a subunit of the TRAPP complex, is involved in various protein interactions critical for cellular processes. It binds strongly to the C-terminal domain of p150Glued, a component of the dynactin complex, which is essential for vesicle transport along microtubules. This interaction is stronger than that of p150Glued with Sec23/Sec24, suggesting a regulatory role in vesicle transport by modulating the interaction between p150Glued and COPII vesicles (Zong2012TRAPPC9). TRAPPC9 competes with Sec23/Sec24 for binding to p150Glued, influencing the dissociation timing of p150Glued from Sec23/Sec24 and affecting vesicle tethering and movement (Zong2012TRAPPC9).

In osteoclasts, TRAPPC9 interacts with L-plastin (LPL), vinculin, and gelsolin, playing a role in actin cytoskeletal reorganization and podosome/actin ring formation. It enhances LPL recruitment to podosomes, facilitating actin ring formation, which is crucial for osteoclast function (Hussein2019A). TRAPPC9 also binds to IKKβ and NIK, implicating it in NF-κB signaling pathways (Hussein2019A). These interactions highlight TRAPPC9's multifaceted role in cellular trafficking and signaling.
