# PPP1R1B

## Overview
The PPP1R1B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 1B, commonly known as DARPP-32. This protein is a key regulatory inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), playing a pivotal role in neuronal signaling pathways, particularly within dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. As an intrinsically unstructured protein, DARPP-32 is highly adaptable, allowing it to interact with various signaling molecules and undergo post-translational modifications that modulate its function. Predominantly expressed in the brain, especially in the striatum, DARPP-32 integrates neurotransmitter signals to regulate neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, impacting learning, memory, and reward-related behaviors (Girault2021DARPP32; Avanes2019Darpp32). Beyond its neurological roles, DARPP-32 and its splice variant, t-DARPP, are implicated in oncogenic signaling pathways, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and drug resistance (Avanes2019Darpp32; Alam2018DARPP32). The multifaceted functions of PPP1R1B underscore its significance in both neurobiology and oncology.

## Structure
The PPP1R1B gene encodes the protein DARPP-32, which is a regulatory inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). DARPP-32 is a 204-residue protein with a significant phosphorylation site at threonine 34 (T34), which is crucial for its function as a PP1 inhibitor when phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) (Avanes2019Darpp32). The protein's secondary structure consists of approximately 12% alpha helices, 29% beta strands, 24% beta turns, and 35% random coils, indicating a complex and flexible structure (Alam2021DARPP32; Avanes2019Darpp32).

DARPP-32 is described as an intrinsically unstructured protein, which contributes to its ability to interact with various signaling molecules (Girault2021DARPP32). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation at multiple sites, including T34 and threonine 75 (T75), which modulate its function and interactions (Girault2021DARPP32; Avanes2019Darpp32).

A notable splice variant of DARPP-32 is t-DARPP, which lacks the first 36 amino acids, including the T34 residue. This variant is overexpressed in various cancers and plays a role in oncogenic signaling pathways (Avanes2019Darpp32; Alam2018DARPP32).

## Function
The PPP1R1B gene encodes the protein DARPP-32, which plays a crucial role in neuronal signaling pathways, particularly in dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. DARPP-32 functions primarily as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) when phosphorylated at threonine 34, modulating the effects of neurotransmitters like dopamine through cAMP production (Girault2021DARPP32; Avanes2019Darpp32). This regulation is essential for controlling phosphorylation cascades that influence neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, impacting learning, memory, and reward-related behaviors (Avanes2019Darpp32).

DARPP-32 is predominantly active in the brain, especially in the striatum, where it integrates signals from neurotransmitters to regulate neuronal activity and response (Girault2021DARPP32). It is involved in modulating the activity of PP1, affecting the phosphorylation landscape of numerous proteins, and is regulated by dopamine and glutamate signaling (Avanes2019Darpp32). The protein's ability to inhibit PP1 when phosphorylated allows it to reinforce the effects of diverse signaling pathways, contributing to neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity (Girault2021DARPP32). This dynamic regulation is crucial for proper neuronal function and response to neurotransmitters (Avanes2019Darpp32).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PPP1R1B gene, which encodes the protein DARPP-32, have been implicated in various cancers and neuropsychiatric disorders. In cancer, overexpression of PPP1R1B is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential. In breast cancer, high levels of DARPP-32 and its truncated form, t-DARPP, correlate with worse outcomes, while in lung adenocarcinoma, a higher ratio of t-DARPP to DARPP-32 is linked to poorer prognosis (Avanes2019Darpp32). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, elevated PPP1R1B expression, regulated by HIF1A, is associated with enhanced metastasis and poor survival, as it promotes p53 degradation through MDM2 stabilization (Tiwari2020Loss).

In neuropsychiatric disorders, genetic variations in PPP1R1B are linked to cognitive functions and schizophrenia. Specific haplotypes affect DARPP-32 mRNA expression and are associated with cognitive performance and frontostriatal processing, potentially influencing schizophrenia risk (MeyerLindenberg2007Genetic). Additionally, the rs1495099 C allele of PPP1R1B is associated with autism spectrum disorders, particularly in males, and is linked to more severe impairments in social interaction and communication (Hettinger2012DRD2). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PPP1R1B in both cancer progression and neuropsychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
PPP1R1B, also known as DARPP-32, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. DARPP-32 interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), where it acts as an inhibitor when phosphorylated at threonine 34 by protein kinase A (PKA). This phosphorylation promotes DARPP-32's binding to PP1, inhibiting its activity (Casamayor2020Controlling; Saidy2021PP1). DARPP-32 also interacts with PKA, where phosphorylation at threonine 75 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) inhibits PKA activity (Saidy2021PP1).

In cancer cells, DARPP-32 and its truncated form, t-DARPP, are involved in the activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, contributing to tumor cell proliferation and drug resistance. t-DARPP lacks the domain for PP1 modulation but retains the ability to influence PKA, enhancing AKT phosphorylation and promoting cell survival (Casamayor2020Controlling; Avanes2019Darpp32). DARPP-32 also forms complexes with other proteins, such as CXCR4, enhancing its stability and promoting cancer cell invasion (Avanes2019Darpp32). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PPP1R1B in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
