# RELN

## Overview
The RELN gene encodes the reelin protein, a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of neuronal migration and positioning during brain development. Reelin is categorized as a signaling protein, primarily secreted by Cajal–Retzius cells in the developing brain, where it orchestrates the proper layering of neurons in the cerebral cortex. The protein functions by binding to specific lipoprotein receptors on neurons, initiating a signaling cascade that involves the phosphorylation of intracellular adaptor proteins, such as Disabled 1 (Dab1), which is crucial for its role in neuronal migration. Beyond its neural functions, reelin is also expressed in non-neural tissues like the liver and kidney, although its roles in these areas remain less understood. Dysregulation of reelin expression or function is associated with various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal brain architecture and function (Sánchez-Sánchez2018RareRELNvariants; Tissir2003Reelin).

## Structure
The RELN gene encodes the Reelin protein, a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein involved in neuronal migration and brain development. The primary structure of Reelin consists of 3,461 amino acids, beginning with a signal peptide of 27 residues, followed by a region similar to F-spondin, and a unique region (Tissir2003Reelin). The protein features eight repeats, each approximately 350 amino acids long, containing an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif at the center, flanked by two subrepeats, A and B (Tissir2003Reelin). The protein terminates with a basic stretch of 33 amino acids (Tissir2003Reelin).

The secondary structure includes EGF-like motifs, which are associated with receptor-ligand interactions (DeSilva1997The). The tertiary structure involves complex folding patterns, while the quaternary structure includes dimerization (D’Arcangelo1997Reelin). Reelin undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked and O-linked glycosylation, which affect its molecular weight, suggesting glycosylation contributes to its estimated size in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (D’Arcangelo1997Reelin; Tissir2003Reelin). Proteolytic cleavage occurs at two main sites, between repeats 2 and 3, and between repeats 6 and 7, which is crucial for its function in receptor binding and signaling (Tissir2003Reelin).

## Function
The RELN gene encodes the Reelin protein, a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein crucial for brain development. Reelin is involved in regulating neuronal migration and positioning, essential processes for the proper formation of brain structures. It is secreted by Cajal–Retzius cells in the cerebral cortex and binds to lipoprotein receptors such as very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor type 2 (ApoER2) on neurons. This binding triggers a signaling cascade that involves the phosphorylation of the Disabled 1 (Dab1) adapter protein, which is critical for Reelin's function in neuronal migration (Tissir2003Reelin).

Reelin's interaction with its receptors influences the cytoskeleton and regulates nucleokinesis, which is crucial for the proper positioning of neurons during brain development (Tissir2003Reelin). The protein's central region is essential for receptor binding and signaling, which affects neuronal migration and positioning (Tissir2003Reelin). Reelin is also expressed in the liver and kidney, although its function in these non-neural tissues is not well explored (Tissir2003Reelin). Dysregulation of Reelin expression is associated with neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal brain function (Tissir2003Reelin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RELN gene, which encodes the reelin protein, are associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Biallelic mutations in RELN can lead to lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LIS-CBLH), characterized by severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, and epilepsy (Hong2000Autosomal; Di2022Monoallelic). Monoallelic variants are linked to a spectrum of conditions, including frontotemporal lissencephaly, epilepsy, autism, and possibly schizophrenia (Di2022Monoallelic). These mutations often result in defective RELN secretion, affecting neuronal migration and cortical development (Riva2021Functional).

Alterations in RELN expression levels are also implicated in several disorders. Reduced reelin protein and mRNA levels have been observed in schizophrenia and autism, potentially due to promoter hypermethylation (Jossin2020Reelin). In Alzheimer's disease, decreased reelin expression is linked to synaptic dysfunction and neuropathology, with reelin modulating NMDARs and AMPARs, contributing to the disease's pathophysiology (Jossin2020Reelin).

RELN mutations can behave as dominant negative forms, affecting the secretion and processing of the reelin protein, which is crucial for proper neuronal migration and cortical development (Riva2021Functional). These mutations can lead to a variety of cortical malformations, including polymicrogyria and pachygyria (Riva2021Functional).

## Interactions
Reelin, encoded by the RELN gene, is an extracellular matrix protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal migration and synapse function. It interacts with the very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (APOER2) on migrating neurons. This interaction initiates Reelin signaling, which is transduced to the intracellular adaptor protein Disabled-1 (DAB1). DAB1 is phosphorylated by SRC-family kinases, such as FYN and SRC, which is essential for neuronal migration and positioning (Sánchez-Sánchez2018RareRELNvariants).

Reelin also interacts with the DISC1 protein, which is involved in neurogenesis and neuronal migration. This interaction is part of a complex network that includes the serine-threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a downstream effector implicated in schizophrenia. Reelin and DISC1 share pathways that influence neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity (Mahoney2024DISC1).

In the context of autism spectrum disorder, rare variants in the RELN gene have been shown to affect Reelin-DAB1 signal transduction. These variants can alter the conformational flexibility and structural dynamics of the Reelin protein, potentially leading to abnormal function (Sánchez-Sánchez2018RareRELNvariants).
