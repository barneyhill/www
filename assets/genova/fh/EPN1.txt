# EPN1

## Overview
EPN1 is a gene that encodes the protein epsin 1, which is a key player in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a fundamental cellular process for internalizing molecules and regulating receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Epsin 1 is characterized by its Epsin N-terminal Homology (ENTH) domain, which facilitates membrane curvature by binding to phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane, thereby promoting vesicle budding (GarciaAlai2018Epsin; Kroppen2020Cooperativity). As an endocytic adaptor protein, epsin 1 interacts with clathrin and adaptor protein complexes, aiding in the assembly of the clathrin coat and the recruitment of cargo (Sigismund2021Endocytosis). Additionally, epsin 1 contains ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that recognize ubiquitinated proteins, playing a crucial role in the sorting of ubiquitinated cargos such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) (Azarnia2019Endocytic). Beyond its endocytic functions, epsin 1 is involved in various signaling pathways, including the Wnt and NF-κB pathways, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer progression (Chang2015Epsin; Song2021Epsins).

## Structure
Epsin 1 (EPN1) is characterized by an Epsin N-terminal Homology (ENTH) domain, which plays a crucial role in its function. The ENTH domain is involved in binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) at the plasma membrane, facilitating membrane curvature essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (GarciaAlai2018Epsin; Kroppen2020Cooperativity). Upon binding to PI(4,5)P2, the ENTH domain undergoes a conformational change where an amphipathic α-helix, known as helix 0, inserts into the membrane, inducing curvature (Kroppen2020Cooperativity).

The ENTH domain can form oligomers, such as hexamers, in the presence of PIP2, which is crucial for its stability and function (GarciaAlai2018Epsin). This oligomerization is enhanced by the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS), which also contributes to membrane deformation (Kroppen2020Cooperativity). The ENTH domain's ability to oligomerize and bind membranes is dependent on specific residues, such as arginine at position 114, which is critical for its function (Kroppen2020Cooperativity).

Epsin 1 also contains motifs for interaction with ubiquitinated cargo, which are located in its C-terminal region. This region is intrinsically disordered and interacts with various components of the endocytic machinery, including clathrin and AP2 (Madhivanan2020MOLECULAR). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications like ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which influence its function.

## Function
Epsin 1 (EPN1) is a protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a critical cellular process for internalizing molecules and regulating receptor-mediated signaling pathways. It is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and plays a significant role in the endocytosis of several key receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), and Notch receptors (Sigismund2021Endocytosis). Epsin 1 contains an Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain that binds to phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane, facilitating membrane curvature and vesicle budding (Azarnia2019Endocytic; Sigismund2021Endocytosis).

Epsin 1 also acts as an endocytic adaptor, interacting with clathrin and adaptor protein complexes to promote clathrin coat assembly and cargo recruitment (Sigismund2021Endocytosis). It has ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that recognize ubiquitinated proteins, aiding in the sorting of ubiquitinated cargos such as EGFR and VEGFR (Azarnia2019Endocytic). In endothelial cells, epsin 1 modulates VEGF signaling, which is crucial for angiogenesis and normal vascular function (Pasula2012Endothelial).

Beyond its role in endocytosis, epsin 1 is involved in stabilizing dishevelled (Dvl2), a key effector in the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Chang2015Epsin). This function highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to extracellular signals.

## Clinical Significance
EPN1 (epsin 1) has been implicated in the progression of certain cancers due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In breast cancer, particularly ER-negative subtypes, high levels of epsin 1 correlate with lower relapse-free survival. Epsin 1 promotes NEMO linear ubiquitination via LUBAC, enhancing NF-κB signaling, which is crucial for cancer progression. Epsin deficiency in breast cancer models leads to weakened NF-κB DNA binding activity and reduced phosphorylation of key components in the NF-κB pathway, resulting in decreased tumor burden and increased apoptotic cell death (Song2021Epsins).

In colon cancer, epsin 1 is upregulated and plays a critical role in stabilizing dishevelled (Dvl2), a key effector in the Wnt signaling pathway. This stabilization prevents Dvl2 degradation, promoting Wnt signaling activation, which is essential for tumor growth. Epsin deficiency in colon cancer models results in impaired Wnt signaling and a tumor-resistant phenotype, suggesting that epsin 1 is crucial for colon cancer progression (Chang2015Epsin). These findings indicate that alterations in EPN1 expression or function can significantly impact cancer development, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
Epsin 1 (EPN1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in endocytosis and signaling pathways. Epsin 1 interacts with ubiquitinated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) through its ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), facilitating the recruitment of EGFR into clathrin-coated pits, which is essential for endocytosis (Kazazic2009Epsin). This interaction is UIM-dependent, as demonstrated by the inability of a UIM mutant to coimmunoprecipitate with EGFR (Kazazic2009Epsin).

Epsin 1 also interacts with components of the Wnt signaling pathway. It binds to the cytoplasmic signaling effector Dvl2 through its ENTH and UIM domains, which is important for maintaining Dvl2 stability and promoting Wnt signaling in colon cancer (Chang2015Epsin).

In the context of breast cancer, epsin 1 interacts with NEMO and the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), promoting NEMO's linear ubiquitination, which is crucial for NF-κB signaling. This interaction involves both the UIM and ENTH domains of epsin 1 and is significant in the progression of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (Song2021Epsins). Epsin 1's role in these interactions highlights its importance in various cellular processes and disease contexts.
