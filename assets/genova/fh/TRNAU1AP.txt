# TRNAU1AP

## Overview
TRNAU1AP is a gene that encodes the protein tRNA selenocysteine 1 associated protein 1, which is involved in critical cellular processes such as splicing regulation and selenoprotein biosynthesis. The protein functions as a splicing factor, promoting exon inclusion by binding to intronic regions, and is essential for maintaining proper gene expression (Schmok2024Largescale). Additionally, it plays a significant role in the synthesis of selenoproteins by interacting with the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in mRNA, which is crucial for the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins (Schoenmakers2016Mutation). TRNAU1AP's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and congenital conditions (Jia2020Potential; Bae2016A).

## Function
TRNAU1AP, also known as tRNA selenocysteine 1 associated protein 1, plays a crucial role in the regulation of alternative splicing in human cells. It functions as a splicing factor, primarily promoting exon inclusion by binding to intronic regions flanking exons. This binding pattern is similar to other known splicing factors, such as RBFOX2 and HNRNPC, and is essential for maintaining proper gene expression (Schmok2024Largescale). TRNAU1AP's involvement in splicing regulation is further supported by its interaction with other splicing-associated proteins, as identified through affinity purification-mass spectrometry (Schmok2024Largescale).

In addition to its role in splicing, TRNAU1AP is implicated in the synthesis of selenoproteins, which are vital for various biological processes, including antioxidant defense and redox regulation. It is part of a multiprotein complex that facilitates the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins by interacting with the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in mRNA (Schoenmakers2016Mutation). This function is crucial for the proper translation of selenoproteins, highlighting TRNAU1AP's importance in cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TRNAU1AP gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. TRNAU1AP is crucial for the synthesis of selenoproteins, which play significant roles in cellular processes. Dysregulation of TRNAU1AP can lead to impaired selenoprotein synthesis, potentially contributing to disorders related to oxidative stress and cardiac conditions. For instance, underexpression of TRNAU1AP in cardiomyocyte-like H9c2 cells has been shown to decrease cell proliferation and increase apoptosis, suggesting a role in myocardial injury, particularly under conditions of selenium deficiency (Li2016Role).

In the context of cancer, increased expression of TRNAU1AP has been observed in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis (Jia2020Potential). Additionally, TRNAU1AP has been involved in a fusion event with RCC1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma, suggesting its involvement in cancer development (Yang2020Novel).

Furthermore, TRNAU1AP has been associated with Hirschsprung disease through loss of heterozygosity analysis, indicating its potential role in this congenital condition (Bae2016A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TRNAU1AP in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
TRNAU1AP, also known as tRNA selenocysteine 1 associated protein 1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in splicing regulation and selenoprotein biosynthesis. It interacts with splicing-associated proteins, as demonstrated by affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis, which revealed its enrichment in interactions with proteins involved in splicing regulation, such as SCAF8 and RTCA (Schmok2024Largescale). TRNAU1AP also forms part of a high-enrichment cluster for splicing-associated proteins, indicating its widespread role in splicing regulation (Schmok2024Largescale).

In the context of selenoprotein biosynthesis, TRNAU1AP interacts with the selenocysteyl-tRNA [Ser] Sec -Sec-specific elongation factor (EFsec) complex, facilitating the interaction between EFsec and SBP2 in vivo (Li2016Role). It is also associated with tRNA [Ser]Sec and interacts with Sepsecs, a protein involved in selenoprotein biosynthesis (Mahdi2015Expression). These interactions suggest that TRNAU1AP plays a facilitating role in the biosynthesis of selenoproteins, although its exact function in this process remains to be fully understood (Mahdi2015Expression).
