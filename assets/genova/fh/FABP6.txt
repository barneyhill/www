# FABP6

## Overview
FABP6 is a gene that encodes the protein fatty acid-binding protein 6 (FABP6), which is a member of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the binding and transport of bile acids and fatty acids within cells, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and homeostasis. FABP6 is predominantly expressed in the ileal epithelial cells of the small intestine, where it facilitates the digestion and absorption of dietary fats. The protein is characterized by a conserved beta-barrel structure that forms a ligand-binding cavity, allowing it to accommodate hydrophobic ligands such as bile acids (Smathers2011The; Storch2008The). Beyond its role in the intestine, FABP6 is also expressed in adipocytes and macrophages, indicating its involvement in broader lipid metabolic processes (Amiri2018Diverse). The gene's expression is regulated by bile acids and other conserved elements in its promoter region, underscoring its importance in lipid metabolism and energy balance (Smathers2011The).

## Structure
The human gene FABP6 encodes the ileal fatty acid-binding protein, which is part of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family. The protein is characterized by a conserved tertiary structure, consisting of a beta-barrel formed by ten antiparallel beta sheets. This structure creates a central, solvent-accessible ligand-binding cavity that accommodates hydrophobic ligands such as bile acids (Smathers2011The; Storch2008The). The beta-barrel is capped by two alpha-helices, which may play a role in regulating ligand binding (Smathers2011The).

FABP6 is involved in the binding and transport of bile acids, and its structure allows for the binding of bulkier hydrophobic groups (Smathers2011The). The protein's ligand-binding pocket is defined by both hydrophobic and polar amino acids, contributing to its binding specificity (Zimmerman2002New). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing.

The gene is located on chromosome 5q23-q35 and is regulated by several conserved elements in its promoter region, including sites for bile acid and sterol regulatory elements (Smathers2011The).

## Function
FABP6, also known as fatty acid-binding protein 6, plays a crucial role in the digestion and absorption of dietary fats in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in ileal epithelial cells of the small intestine, where it functions as an intracellular transporter of bile acids and fatty acids. This protein facilitates the catalysis and metabolism of cholesterol, contributing to lipid homeostasis and energy balance in the body (Amiri2018Diverse; Smathers2011The).

FABP6 is involved in the formation of micelles with luminal lipids, which is essential for efficient fat digestion. It may also be associated with the bile acid transporter found in the brush border of ileal enterocytes, aiding in the uptake and trafficking of bile acids (Amiri2018Diverse; Smathers2011The). The gene expression of FABP6 is up-regulated by bile acids, which are known to influence lipid metabolism and homeostasis (Smathers2011The).

In addition to its role in the ileum, FABP6 is expressed in adipocytes and macrophages, indicating its involvement in broader lipid metabolic processes (Amiri2018Diverse). Its expression is regulated by several conserved elements in its promoter region, including a bile acid response element, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism (Smathers2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FABP6 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly colorectal cancer. FABP6 is significantly overexpressed in colorectal cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, with studies showing a 52.1-fold increase in cancer samples. This overexpression is associated with early-phase carcinogenesis, contributing to dominant proliferation and antiapoptotic activity in cancer cells (Ohmachi2006Fatty). Tumors with high FABP6 expression are often smaller, located in the left colon, and exhibit shallower invasion, suggesting a role in early tumor development (Ohmachi2006Fatty). However, FABP6 expression decreases in metastatic cells, indicating its role may be limited to early cancer stages (Ohmachi2006Fatty).

In gliomas, FABP6 is also overexpressed and contributes to tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis. Knockdown of FABP6 in glioma cells reduces migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. This reduction is linked to decreased expression of invasion-related proteins such as MMP-2 and cathepsin B, and a decrease in VEGF concentration (Pai2021Inhibition). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FABP6 in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
FABP6, also known as ileal bile acid-binding protein (IBABP), is involved in several interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways. In the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), FABP6 is negatively correlated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) and positively correlated with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), suggesting its involvement in these signaling pathways (Wu2019Study). This indicates that FABP6 may play a role in modulating lipid metabolism and cell proliferation through these interactions.

FABP6 is also co-expressed with the nuclear farnesoid X-receptor (FXR) in the small intestine and Caco-2 cells. FXR, in conjunction with RXRα, activates transcription through an inverted repeat BARE in the human FABP6 promoter, highlighting FXR's role in bile acid homeostasis and gene regulation during enterohepatic circulation (ONO2010Initial). This interaction underscores the importance of FABP6 in bile acid transport and cholesterol metabolism.

While FABP6's interactions in colorectal cancer are noted, specific protein or nucleic acid interactions in this context are not detailed in the provided sources (McKillop2019Role; Amiri2018Diverse). Overall, FABP6's interactions are crucial for its role in lipid transport and metabolic regulation.
