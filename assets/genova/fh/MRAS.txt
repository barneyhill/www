# MRAS

## Overview
MRAS, or muscle RAS oncogene homolog, is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein belonging to the RAS family, which plays a pivotal role in intracellular signaling pathways. The MRAS protein is integral to the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, where it forms a complex with SHOC2 and PP1C, known as the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C holophosphatase complex. This complex is crucial for the dephosphorylation of RAF kinases, thereby facilitating cell growth and differentiation (Kwon2022Structure–function; Hauseman2022Structure). MRAS is primarily active at the plasma membrane and is involved in processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), influencing cell migration and invasion (Simanshu2017RAS). Clinically, mutations in the MRAS gene have been associated with Noonan syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by developmental anomalies, and have also been linked to painful temporomandibular disorder (TMD) in males (Smith2018Genomewide; Higgins2019MRAS).

## Structure
The MRAS protein, a small GTPase, plays a crucial role in the MRAS-SHOC2-PP1C phosphatase complex, which is involved in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. The primary structure of MRAS includes specific domains such as the GTP-binding domain, which is essential for its function in signal transduction (Hauseman2022Structure). The secondary structure of MRAS features switch I (SWI) and switch II (SWII) loops, which are critical for its active conformation when bound to GTP analogues (Hauseman2022Structure). These loops facilitate interactions with SHOC2 and PP1Cα, forming a core part of the complex.

In its tertiary structure, MRAS adopts a 'closed' conformation when bound to SHOC2, allowing for additional interactions through electrostatic and hydrophobic forces, as well as a network of coordinated water molecules (Hauseman2022Structure). The quaternary structure involves MRAS forming a ternary complex with SHOC2 and PP1Cα, where SHOC2 acts as a scaffold, bridging MRAS and PP1Cα (Hauseman2022Structure). This complex assembly is dependent on the GTP-bound state of MRAS, which is necessary for stable interactions (Kwon2022Structure–function). The MRAS protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions.

## Function
The MRAS gene encodes a protein that is a member of the RAS family of small GTPases, which are involved in intracellular signaling pathways crucial for cell proliferation and survival. In healthy human cells, MRAS plays a significant role in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for maintaining cell growth and differentiation by regulating the activity of RAF kinases. MRAS, in its GTP-bound active state, forms a complex with SHOC2 and PP1C, known as the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C holophosphatase complex. This complex dephosphorylates RAF at serine 259, a critical step that leads to the partial dissociation of 14-3-3 proteins and enables RAF-RAS binding, thereby initiating MAPK signaling (Kwon2022Structure–function; Hauseman2022Structure).

MRAS is primarily active at the plasma membrane, where it recruits the SHOC2-PP1C complex to facilitate RAF activation. This recruitment is dependent on the GTP-bound state of MRAS, which is necessary for the proper conformation and interaction with other complex members (Kwon2022Structure–function; Simanshu2017RAS). The MRAS protein also plays a role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), influencing cell migration and invasion (Simanshu2017RAS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRAS gene are implicated in Noonan syndrome (NS), a genetic disorder characterized by developmental anomalies such as facial dysmorphisms, short stature, and cardiac defects, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (Motta2019Activating; Higgins2019MRAS). Specific MRAS mutations, such as p.Gly23Val and p.Thr68Ile, lead to enhanced MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, contributing to the pathogenesis of NS and associated cardiac hypertrophy (Motta2019Activating; Young2018SHOC2–MRAS–PP1). These mutations result in a gain-of-function effect, causing hyperactivation of signaling pathways due to impaired GTPase activity and defective nucleotide binding (Motta2019Activating).

The MRAS gene is also involved in the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1 complex, which regulates RAF activity. Mutations like G23V enhance interactions with effectors such as BRAF and CRAF, leading to increased RAF activation, while T68I selectively affects SHOC2 and PP1 interactions, impacting RAF phosphatase function (Young2018SHOC2–MRAS–PP1). These interactions are crucial for the clinical manifestations of NS and other RASopathies (Higgins2019MRAS).

Additionally, MRAS has been linked to painful temporomandibular disorder (TMD) in males, with specific SNPs affecting MRAS expression and contributing to pain susceptibility (Smith2018Genomewide).

## Interactions
MRAS interacts with SHOC2 and PP1C to form a holophosphatase complex that plays a crucial role in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. This complex is involved in the dephosphorylation of RAF at serine 259, which is essential for RAF activation and subsequent MAPK pathway signaling (RodriguezViciana2006A; Hauseman2022Structure). The interaction between MRAS and SHOC2 is highly specific and involves a cooperative assembly that is dependent on MRAS being in its GTP-bound active state (Kwon2022Structure–function; RodriguezViciana2006A).

MRAS binds to SHOC2 through a concave surface formed by SHOC2's leucine-rich repeats, and this interaction is stabilized by both hydrophobic and polar contacts (Kwon2022Structure–function). The MRAS-SHOC2-PP1C complex is essential for the regulation of RAF activity and is implicated in conditions such as Noonan syndrome due to mutations that enhance complex formation (Motta2019Activating; Young2018SHOC2–MRAS–PP1).

MRAS also interacts with other RAS isoforms, but it has a higher affinity for SHOC2, which favors its role in the holophosphatase complex over other RAS proteins (Hauseman2022Structure). This specificity is crucial for the complex's function in modulating RAF and MAPK signaling pathways (Hauseman2022Structure).
