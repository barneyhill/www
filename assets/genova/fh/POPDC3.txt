# POPDC3

## Overview
POPDC3 is a gene that encodes the protein popeye domain containing 3, which is a member of the Popeye domain-containing family of proteins. This family is characterized by its role as a novel class of cAMP effector proteins, integral to cellular signaling pathways. The POPDC3 protein is a transmembrane protein with three transmembrane domains and a conserved Popeye domain that binds cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with high affinity, similar to protein kinase A (PKA) (Brand2017New; Swan2019The). Predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle, POPDC3 is involved in the regulation of heart contractility and conductivity, as well as maintaining cellular integrity through its interactions with other proteins, such as the potassium channel TREK-1 (Schindler2016The). Alterations in POPDC3 expression have been linked to various diseases, including gastric cancer and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, underscoring its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Swan2023Differential; Kim2010Frequent).

## Structure
The POPDC3 protein is a medium-sized transmembrane protein consisting of 291 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 33.8 kDa (Brand2017New). It features a short amino terminus with 27-39 residues and includes one or two N-glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that may influence its electrophoretic mobility and stability (Schindler2016The; Brand2017New). The protein contains three transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic Popeye domain, which is approximately 150 amino acids long and evolutionarily conserved (Brand2017New). The Popeye domain is structurally similar to cAMP binding domains, although it has low sequence similarity, and it binds cAMP with high affinity (Schindler2016The; Brand2017New).

The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of POPDC3 is variable and subject to alternative splicing, with a single phosphorylated residue in response to adrenergic agonists (Brand2017New). The protein can form homodimers stabilized by disulfide bonds, which may be important for its function in maintaining epithelial integrity (Schindler2016The). The interaction of POPDC3 with the potassium channel TREK-1 suggests a role in modulating electrogenic proteins in cardiomyocytes (Schindler2016The).

## Function
POPDC3 encodes a protein that is part of the Popeye domain-containing family, which functions as a novel class of cAMP effector proteins. These proteins are integral membrane proteins with three transmembrane domains and a conserved Popeye domain that binds cAMP with high affinity, similar to protein kinase A (PKA) (Brand2017New; Swan2019The). The binding of cAMP to the Popeye domain is crucial for the protein's function, influencing its interaction with other proteins and potentially affecting local cAMP concentrations and the activity of other cAMP effector proteins (Schindler2016The).

In healthy human cells, POPDC3 is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in the cAMP signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for mediating various cellular responses, particularly in cardiac myocytes, influencing heart contractility, beating frequency, relaxation, excitability, and conductivity (Swan2019The). POPDC3 is also involved in modulating electrogenic proteins in cardiomyocytes, such as the potassium channel TREK-1, which affects membrane trafficking and conductivity (Schindler2016The). The protein's role in vesicular trafficking and its potential impact on membrane localization of ion channels and transporters suggest its involvement in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Schindler2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the POPDC3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and muscular disorders. In gastric cancer, POPDC3 is frequently downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with increased cancer cell migration and invasion. This downregulation is observed in a significant percentage of gastric tumors and is linked to poor patient survival, increased depth of invasion, and metastasis (Kim2010Frequent; Amunjela2016POPDC). The gene's silencing is also noted in gastric intestinal metaplasia, suggesting a role in the progression from precancerous lesions to gastric cancer (GingoldBelfer2021The).

In addition to its role in cancer, mutations in POPDC3 are associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). These mutations display recessive inheritance and are linked to skeletal muscle conditions, reflecting the gene's weak expression in cardiac muscle compared to skeletal muscle (Swan2023Differential). The differential expression of POPDC3 in various tissues contributes to the distinct phenotypes observed in patients with these mutations. The gene's involvement in both tumor suppression and oncogenic processes highlights its complex role in disease pathology (Tucker2021The).

## Interactions
POPDC3, a member of the Popeye domain-containing protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular functions. One notable interaction is with the potassium channel TREK-1. This interaction involves the C-terminus of POPDC3 and results in increased current and membrane localization of TREK-1, suggesting a role in modulating membrane trafficking and conductivity (Schindler2016The). 

POPDC3 also interacts with other members of the POPDC family, such as POPDC1. While POPDC1 can form complexes with both POPDC2 and POPDC3, no direct interaction is detected between POPDC2 and POPDC3 (Swan2023Differential). This suggests a specific interaction pattern within the POPDC protein family, potentially influencing their functional roles in different tissues.

In the context of cancer, POPDC3 has been implicated in interactions that affect cancer cell behavior. The suppression of POPDC3 is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation and migration, indicating its potential role in modulating pathways involved in tumor progression (Amunjela2016POPDC). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of POPDC3 in cellular signaling and structural integrity.
