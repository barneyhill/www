# ACTR3C

## Overview
The ACTR3C gene encodes the actin-related protein 3C, which is a member of the actin-related protein family. These proteins are known for their involvement in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the cytoskeleton and intracellular transport. Actin-related protein 3C, in particular, is implicated in the modulation of actin filament dynamics, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have highlighted the clinical significance of ACTR3C, particularly in the context of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), where its expression levels have been correlated with patient prognosis (Malik2022RRN3P2). This suggests that ACTR3C may serve as a potential biomarker for GBM, offering insights into its role in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Malik2022RRN3P2).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The ACTR3C gene has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain cancer. High expression levels of ACTR3C are correlated with worse survival outcomes in GBM patients, suggesting its potential as a molecular marker for poor prognosis (Malik2022RRN3P2). The study by Malik et al. utilized data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to perform RNA sequence analysis, identifying ACTR3C among other genes with significant prognostic value in GBM (Malik2022RRN3P2). 

While ACTR3C has not been previously associated with survival outcomes in other cancer types, its role in GBM highlights its clinical significance. The research involved survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves, which confirmed the statistical significance of ACTR3C's prognostic value in GBM (Malik2022RRN3P2). The study also explored the interaction of ACTR3C with the immune microenvironment, providing insights into its potential therapeutic value and its role in guiding clinical evaluation of GBM prognosis (Malik2022RRN3P2). However, the context does not mention any specific diseases or conditions other than GBM associated with mutations or expression level changes in the ACTR3C gene.
