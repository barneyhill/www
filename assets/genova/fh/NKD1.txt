# NKD1

## Overview
NKD1 (Naked cuticle homolog 1) is a gene that encodes the NKD inhibitor of WNT signaling pathway 1, a protein that functions as a crucial antagonist in the WNT signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by its role as a negative feedback regulator, interacting with key components such as Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins and β-catenin to modulate cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and migration. NKD1's activity is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and proper embryonic development by ensuring that WNT signaling is tightly regulated. The protein contains a conserved EFX domain necessary for its interaction with Dishevelled proteins, which is vital for its function in antagonizing WNT signaling (Wharton2001Vertebrate; Larraguibel2015Wnt). Alterations in the NKD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where its dysregulation can lead to enhanced WNT signaling and tumor progression, underscoring its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2016NKD1; Zhou2017LowNKD1expression; Guo2009Mutations).

## Structure
NKD1 (Naked cuticle homolog 1) is a protein that plays a role in the WNT signaling pathway as an antagonist. The protein structure of NKD1 includes a conserved N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain, which is known to interact with Dishevelled proteins. The primary structure of NKD1 consists of specific amino acid sequences that are crucial for its function. In terms of secondary structure, NKD1 may contain alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function.

The tertiary structure of NKD1 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules and proteins within the cell. The quaternary structure involves potential interactions with other proteins, which may influence its role in the WNT signaling pathway. Post-translational modifications can affect the function and localization of NKD1, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Additionally, splice variants of NKD1 may exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with varied functions and localizations within the cell. These structural features and modifications are critical for the protein's role in modulating the WNT signaling pathway.

## Function
NKD1 functions as a negative feedback regulator in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, NKD1 is activated by Wnt ligands and interacts with Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins at the plasma membrane within Wnt signalosomes. This interaction is essential for NKD1's role in modulating Wnt signaling by restricting the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, thereby reducing active Wnt signaling (Larraguibel2015Wnt). NKD1's activity is dependent on the presence of Wnt ligands, such as Wnt8, which enhances its interaction with β-catenin and influences its cellular distribution, making it more cytoplasmic and enriched in the perinuclear region (Larraguibel2015Wnt).

The NKD1 protein contains a conserved EFX domain necessary for its interaction with Dishevelled proteins, which is crucial for antagonizing Wnt signaling (Wharton2001Vertebrate). This interaction helps regulate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of signaling components, such as β-catenin, in response to Wnt signals, ensuring that Wnt signaling is kept in check under normal physiological conditions (Larraguibel2015Wnt). Through these mechanisms, NKD1 plays a significant role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and proper embryonic development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NKD1 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), mutations in NKD1 are found in tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and are associated with enhanced Wnt signaling. These mutations lead to the production of truncated NKD1 proteins that fail to effectively inhibit Wnt signaling, resulting in increased β-catenin stabilization and cell proliferation (Guo2009Mutations). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NKD1 expression is downregulated, correlating with larger tumor size and poorer prognosis. NKD1 acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing p53 expression, and its reduced expression is linked to increased cell proliferation (Zhang2016NKD1). 

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), low NKD1 expression is associated with shorter overall survival, particularly in cytogenetically normal AML patients. This suggests that NKD1 expression levels could serve as a prognostic biomarker in AML (Zhou2017LowNKD1expression).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), reduced NKD1 expression is linked to increased invasive potential and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhang2011Downregulation).

## Interactions
NKD1 interacts with several key proteins within the Wnt signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in its regulation. It binds to Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins, particularly Dvl2, at the plasma membrane in Wnt signalosomes. This interaction is essential for NKD1's activation and function as a negative feedback regulator (Larraguibel2015Wnt). NKD1 also interacts with β-catenin, restricting its nuclear accumulation, which is a critical step in modulating Wnt signaling. This interaction is dependent on the myristoylation sequence in NKD1, and Dvl can compete with this interaction (Larraguibel2015Wnt; Van2011Naked1).

NKD1 forms a ternary complex with Dvl2 and Axin1, suggesting its role in antagonizing Wnt signaling by interacting with β-catenin. This interaction is dependent on a high molecular weight aggregate form of NKD1, and mutations in the C-terminal histidine cluster can disrupt this interaction (Bell2023Loss). NKD1's interaction with Axin is facilitated by its conserved C-terminal histidine cluster, which is crucial for the destabilization of Axin during Wnt signaling (Gammons2020Feedback). These interactions highlight NKD1's role in the feedback regulation of Wnt signaling, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation.
