# DUS1L

## Overview
DUS1L is a gene in humans that encodes the protein dihydrouridine synthase 1-like, which is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules. This protein functions as an enzyme, specifically a synthase, that catalyzes the conversion of uridine to dihydrouridine, a modification essential for the proper folding and stability of tRNA. The activity of dihydrouridine synthase 1-like is crucial for maintaining efficient protein synthesis and cellular proliferation, as it influences the translational efficiency and gene expression by modifying specific sites on tRNA, particularly in the D loop (Yu2023Cell). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various clinical outcomes, particularly in cancer, where its expression levels can influence patient survival and response to treatment (Kannan2021Molecular; Zhang2021Gene).

## Function
DUS1L is a human gene encoding a protein involved in the modification of tRNA molecules, specifically catalyzing the conversion of uridine to dihydrouridine. This modification is crucial for the proper folding and stability of tRNA, which in turn affects protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, DUS1L plays a significant role in maintaining cell proliferation and protein translation by modifying specific sites on tRNA, particularly in the D loop. It is suggested that DUS1L modifies positions U16/17 on tRNA, which is essential for efficient protein translation and cell viability (Yu2023Cell).

The activity of DUS1L is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where tRNA processing occurs. The enzyme's function is critical for tRNA stability and folding, impacting translational efficiency and gene expression. In HeLa cells, knockout of DUS1L results in decreased levels of dihydrouridine in RNA, reduced cell proliferation, and decreased global protein translation. This is linked to specific translational defects, such as a significant reduction in translation of TTC (Phe) codons, due to decreased tRNA-Phe-GAA abundance (Yu2023Cell). These findings underscore the importance of DUS1L in maintaining efficient cellular protein translation and overall cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DUS1L gene have been associated with various cancers, indicating its potential clinical significance. In ovarian, gastric, and breast cancers, high expression of DUS1L is linked to improved patient survival, while in melanoma and renal cancer, low expression is advantageous, suggesting a context-dependent role in cancer progression and response to immunotherapy (Kannan2021Molecular). In BRCA1-mutated triple-negative breast cancer, DUS1L is overexpressed due to chromosomal gains in the 17q25.3 region, which is associated with tumor development and progression (Toffoli2014Identification). 

In ovarian cancer, DUS1L has been identified as a significant predictor of overall survival, with low mRNA expression levels correlating with worse outcomes (Zhang2021Gene). The gene's expression is also implicated in maintaining genome stability and DNA damage response, which are critical in cancer cell survival (Toffoli2014Identification).

Additionally, DUS1L is targeted by microRNAs such as hsa-miR-125b-5p and hsa-miR-125a-5p, which may influence its expression and function in cancer (Kannan2021Molecular). These findings suggest that DUS1L could serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
