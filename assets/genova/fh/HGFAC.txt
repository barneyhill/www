# HGFAC

## Overview
HGFAC, or Hepatocyte Growth Factor Activator, is a gene that encodes a serine protease involved in the activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a critical mediator in tissue regeneration and repair. The protein product of HGFAC, also known as HGF activator, is synthesized primarily by hepatocytes and circulates in plasma as an inactive zymogen, proHGFAC. Upon activation by proteases such as thrombin and kallikrein-related peptidases, HGF activator cleaves the precursor form of HGF, proHGF, to generate its active form, thereby facilitating its interaction with the MET receptor. This interaction triggers signaling pathways essential for tissue repair and regeneration. Beyond its role in tissue repair, HGFAC is implicated in metabolic regulation, immune responses, and has clinical significance in various diseases, including Crohn's disease, cardiometabolic disorders, and certain cancers (Fukushima2018Hepatocyte; Nakata2023Genetic; Sargsyan2021HGFAC).

## Function
HGFAC, or Hepatocyte Growth Factor Activator, is a serine protease that plays a critical role in the activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a key factor in tissue regeneration and repair. HGF is secreted as an inactive precursor, proHGF, and requires proteolytic activation to initiate signaling through its receptor, MET. HGFAC circulates in plasma as an inactive zymogen, proHGFAC, and is activated by enzymes such as thrombin and kallikrein-related peptidases KLK-4 and KLK-5. Once activated, HGFAC cleaves proHGF to form active HGF, promoting tissue repair and regeneration (Mukai2008Activation; Fukushima2018Hepatocyte).

HGFAC is primarily synthesized by hepatocytes and is abundant in plasma, with some expression in extrahepatic organs. It also activates macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), which functions through the RON receptor tyrosine kinase, indicating its involvement in immune responses (Fukushima2018Hepatocyte). The HGFAC-HGF system likely evolved alongside coagulation and fibrinolysis systems, highlighting its role in responding to tissue injuries (Fukushima2018Hepatocyte).

In addition to its role in tissue repair, HGFAC is involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis. It is regulated by the carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) and influences hepatic PPARγ expression, which is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance (Sargsyan2021HGFAC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HGFAC gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A specific genetic variant, HGFAC Arg509His (R509H), is identified as a risk factor for Crohn's disease. This variant disrupts a damage-sensing pathway crucial for wound-associated epithelial cell differentiation and tissue repair, leading to delayed intestinal healing (Nakata2023Genetic). 

HGFAC is also associated with cardiometabolic diseases. Variants in the HGFAC locus influence circulating levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which are linked to conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. A missense variant, rs3748034, is associated with increased circulating HGF and triglycerides, contributing to cardiometabolic risk (Sargsyan2021HGFAC).

In the context of cancer, HGFAC is upregulated in lung adenocarcinomas, where it contributes to chemoresistance through the MET/HGF axis. This makes it a potential target for cancer therapy (Ciribilli2017Oncogenomics). Additionally, elevated HGFAC levels are found in multiple myeloma patients, correlating with lytic bone disease (Kristensen2013Hepatocyte).

## Interactions
Hepatocyte Growth Factor Activator (HGFAC) is a serine protease that plays a critical role in the activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) by cleaving its precursor form, proHGF, at a specific site (Arg494-Val495), converting it into the active form necessary for binding to the MET receptor and initiating signaling pathways involved in tissue regeneration and repair (Fukushima2018Hepatocyte). HGFAC is activated from its zymogen form, proHGFAC, by proteases such as thrombin, kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK)-4, and KLK-5 (Fukushima2018Hepatocyte). 

HGFAC also interacts with macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), cleaving it at the Arg483-Val484 bond, which allows MSP to interact with the RON receptor tyrosine kinase (Fukushima2018Hepatocyte). The activity of HGFAC is regulated by endogenous inhibitors such as Protein C Inhibitor (PCI) and HGFAC inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1)/serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type 1 (SPINT1). PCI is a circulating inhibitor that forms a complex with HGFAC, while HAI-1/SPINT1 regulates HGFAC activity in the pericellular microenvironment through reversible complex formation (Fukushima2018Hepatocyte). These interactions highlight the role of HGFAC in linking tissue injury with repair processes.
