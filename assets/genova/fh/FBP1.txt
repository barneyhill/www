# FBP1

## Overview
The FBP1 gene encodes the enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1, a key regulatory enzyme in the gluconeogenesis pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys, where it plays a critical role in maintaining blood glucose levels, especially during periods of fasting (Wattanavanitchakorn2018CCAATenhancer). Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 is an allosteric enzyme regulated by metabolites such as AMP and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, and its activity is modulated by various transcription factors (Wattanavanitchakorn2018CCAATenhancer). Beyond its metabolic functions, FBP1 has been implicated in cancer biology, where it influences processes such as the Warburg effect and interacts with proteins involved in tumor suppression and signaling pathways (Zaman2014FBP1; Xu2022FBP1Altered). Mutations in the FBP1 gene can lead to fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency, a metabolic disorder characterized by hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Lebigot2015Fructose; Bhai2018Clinical).

## Function
The FBP1 gene encodes the enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1, which is crucial for gluconeogenesis, a metabolic pathway that generates glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates. In healthy human cells, particularly in the liver, FBP1 catalyzes the dephosphorylation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, a key step in glucose production. This process is essential for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting (Wattanavanitchakorn2018CCAATenhancer).

FBP1 is primarily active in gluconeogenic tissues such as the liver and kidneys, where it plays a significant role in carbohydrate metabolism. Its activity is regulated allosterically by AMP and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, with the latter being produced when insulin levels are high (Wattanavanitchakorn2018CCAATenhancer). The enzyme's expression is regulated by liver-enriched transcription factors, including CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), which bind to specific sites on the FBP1 promoter (Wattanavanitchakorn2018CCAATenhancer).

FBP1 also plays a role in inhibiting aerobic glycolysis, known as the 'Warburg effect,' which is a characteristic of cancer cells. Its expression is associated with maintaining energy balance and producing important metabolites necessary for normal cellular activities (Xu2022FBP1Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FBP1 gene, which encodes the enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, lead to fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by episodes of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis, often triggered by fasting or infections, particularly in children. The deficiency results from an enzymatic block in gluconeogenesis, impairing glucose formation from non-carbohydrate precursors (Lebigot2015Fructose; Bhai2018Clinical). 

The disorder is associated with various mutations in the FBP1 gene, including missense, nonsense, and deletion mutations. These mutations can lead to decreased enzyme activity and protein expression, often due to protein misfolding and aggregation (Sakuma2023Identification; Ijaz2017Genetic). For instance, Type 2 mutations, such as R158W and G164D, result in decreased protein expression and are associated with increased interaction with molecular chaperones like HSP70 and HSP90, indicating protein misfolding (Sakuma2023Identification).

FBP1 deficiency is often misdiagnosed as other metabolic disorders, making genetic analysis crucial for accurate diagnosis. Management typically involves dietary control to prevent hypoglycemic episodes, with an excellent prognosis if properly managed (Lebigot2015Fructose; Bhai2018Clinical).

## Interactions
FBP1 (fructose-bisphosphatase 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with menin, a tumor suppressor protein, as identified through large-scale immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and FLAG pull-down assays, indicating that FBP1 and menin can bind to the MYC promoter at the FUSE region, a site also bound by the FBP-interacting repressor (FIR) (Zaman2014FBP1).

In ovarian cancer, FBP1 interacts with STAT3, inhibiting its nuclear translocation and reducing its expression levels. This interaction is part of the C-MYC/FBP1/STAT3 signaling axis, which regulates cell proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance. FBP1's binding to STAT3 prevents its nuclear accumulation, thereby inhibiting its gene regulatory functions (Li2021FBP1).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FBP1 interacts with the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7. This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of NICD1, suppressing stem cell-like properties in NSCLC. FBP1's role in this process is independent of its enzymatic activity, highlighting its regulatory function in the Notch signaling pathway (He2024FBP1).
