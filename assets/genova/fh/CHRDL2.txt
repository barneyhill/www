# CHRDL2

## Overview
CHRDL2 is a gene that encodes the protein chordin-like 2, which is a member of the Chordin family and functions as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist. The protein is characterized by its three chordin-like cysteine-rich (CR) domains, which are essential for its role in inhibiting BMP signaling. By binding to BMPs such as BMP-2, -4, -5, -6, and -7, chordin-like 2 prevents these proteins from interacting with their receptors, thereby modulating various developmental processes including cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis (Chang2016Agonists; Itoh2010Secreted). The protein's activity is primarily extracellular, where it plays a significant role in morphogenesis and neural development (Itoh2010Secreted). CHRDL2 has been implicated in several cancers, where its altered expression can influence cancer progression and resistance to therapies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2021CHRDL2; Clarkson2024BMP).

## Structure
CHRDL2 is a secreted protein that functions as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist. It is a member of the Chordin family and is characterized by the presence of three chordin-like cysteine-rich (CR) domains, which are crucial for its function in BMP signaling inhibition (Chang2016Agonists; Itoh2010Secreted). These CR domains are defined by a specific spacing of conserved cysteines, which are important for the protein's structural integrity and its ability to bind BMPs (Chang2016Agonists).

CHRDL2 binds to several BMPs, including BMP-2, -4, -5, -6, and -7, but does not interact with activin A or TGF-beta proteins (Chang2016Agonists). The protein's ability to inhibit BMP signaling is enhanced when it forms a ternary complex with Twisted Gastrulation (Twsg1) and BMP-2 (Chang2016Agonists).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. CHRDL2 is known to have multiple splice variant isoforms, which may result in different functional properties and specificities (Chang2016Agonists). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CHRDL2 is not available in the provided context.

## Function
CHRDL2 (chordin-like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the modulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which is crucial for various developmental processes. The CHRDL2 protein functions as a BMP antagonist by binding directly to BMPs, such as BMP2, BMP4, BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7, thereby preventing them from interacting with their receptors and inhibiting their signaling pathways (Itoh2010Secreted). This regulatory action is essential for maintaining proper BMP signaling, which influences cell differentiation, development, and tissue homeostasis.

CHRDL2 is structurally similar to other members of the Chordin family, such as Chrdl1 and Chordin, and contains three Chordin-like cysteine-rich (CR) domains, which are important for its function as a BMP antagonist (Itoh2010Secreted). The protein is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it modulates BMP activity, playing a significant role in processes like morphogenesis during gastrulation, dorsoventral axis formation, and neural development (Itoh2010Secreted).

In mice, CHRDL2 is expressed in adult mesenchymal progenitor cells, with its expression decreasing during chondrogenic differentiation, suggesting a role in developmental processes such as chondrogenesis (Itoh2010Secreted).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CHRDL2 gene have been implicated in several cancers, including osteosarcoma and colorectal cancer (CRC). In osteosarcoma, CHRDL2 is significantly upregulated, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis through the BMP-9/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This suggests that CHRDL2 acts as an oncogene in osteosarcoma, making it a potential therapeutic target (Chen2021CHRDL2).

In colorectal cancer, CHRDL2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor size, TNM staging, and poor differentiation. It enhances CRC cell proliferation by upregulating Cyclin D1 and downregulating P21, while inhibiting apoptosis by blocking BMP-induced Smad1/5 signaling (Sun2016Overexpression). CHRDL2 also enhances the cancer stem cell phenotype and increases chemotherapy resistance by elevating WNT signaling and DNA damage response pathways (Clarkson2024BMP).

CHRDL2's role as a BMP antagonist is also noted in lung adenocarcinoma, where its overexpression is linked to cancer-promoting processes such as proliferation and metastasis, potentially affecting clinical outcomes through BMP, TGF-β, and WNT/β-catenin signaling pathways (LopezSanchez2024Patientspecific).

## Interactions
CHRDL2, a member of the Chordin family, is known for its role as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist. It interacts specifically with several BMPs, including BMP2, BMP4, BMP5, BMP6, BMP7, and BMP9, inhibiting their activity by preventing them from binding to their receptors (Chen2021CHRDL2; Clarkson2024BMP; Itoh2010Secreted). This interaction is crucial in modulating BMP signaling pathways, which are involved in various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and development.

In osteosarcoma, CHRDL2 binds to BMP9, reducing its expression and interaction with the receptor protein kinase ALK1. This binding affects the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and metastasis (Chen2021CHRDL2). In colorectal cancer, CHRDL2 inhibits BMP-mediated SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, leading to enhanced WNT signaling and increased chemotherapy resistance (Clarkson2024BMP). The overexpression of CHRDL2 in colorectal cancer cells is associated with increased stem-cell markers and altered expression of cancer-related pathways, including epithelial to mesenchymal transition and DNA repair pathways (Clarkson2024BMP). These interactions highlight CHRDL2's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
