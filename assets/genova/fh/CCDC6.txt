# CCDC6

## Overview
The CCDC6 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 6 protein, which is a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a coiled-coil domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions and a nuclear localization signal essential for its nuclear functions. CCDC6 acts as a scaffolding protein, modulating the activity of Protein Phosphatase 4 (PP4c) and playing a significant role in the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway. It is also a substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7, which regulates its stability through ubiquitination. Clinically, alterations in the CCDC6 gene are associated with various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and papillary thyroid carcinoma, where it is involved in gene fusions that contribute to tumorigenesis and affect therapeutic responses (Merolla2012Loss; Cerrato2018The; Morra2015FBXW7).

## Structure
The CCDC6 protein is composed of 475 amino acids and features several distinct structural domains. At the NH2 terminus, it contains a glycine-rich domain, followed by an extensive coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its structural integrity and function (Laxmi2019CCDC6; Cerrato2019NSCLC). The coiled-coil domain, spanning amino acids 53-237 and 253-332, facilitates homodimerization and provides a hydrophobic surface for oligomerization (Laxmi2019CCDC6; Cerrato2019NSCLC). This domain is characterized by alpha helices that supercoil around each other, forming a structure that is strongly amphipathic (Laxmi2019CCDC6).

The COOH terminus of CCDC6 contains a proline-rich domain, and a nuclear localization site (NLS) is located between amino acids 420-426, which is essential for its nuclear functions (Cerrato2019NSCLC). CCDC6 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by serine/threonine kinases, which modulate its stability and intracellular distribution (Cerrato2019NSCLC). These structural features and modifications are critical for CCDC6's role in DNA repair and its function as a tumor suppressor (Laxmi2019CCDC6; Cerrato2019NSCLC).

## Function
The CCDC6 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation in healthy human cells. It is involved in modulating the activity of Protein Phosphatase 4 (PP4c), particularly in the context of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). CCDC6 negatively regulates PP4c phosphatase activity, which affects the phosphorylation status of H2AX at serine 139 (pH2AX S139), a marker of DNA damage. This regulation is essential for maintaining proper DNA damage checkpoints, especially the G2/M checkpoint, and ensuring accurate DNA repair processes (Merolla2012Loss).

CCDC6 functions as a scaffolding protein, interacting with the PP4-R2-R3 complex and influencing the phosphorylation of other DNA repair proteins like RPA2. This scaffolding role is important for its function in chromatin binding and modulating PP4c activity at sites of DNA damage (Merolla2012Loss). The protein is also involved in the ATM-mediated cellular response to DNA damage, contributing to checkpoint recovery and cell cycle re-entry (Merolla2012Loss).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, CCDC6 is implicated in apoptosis and the regulation of cell proliferation, suggesting its importance in maintaining genome stability and preventing tumorigenesis (Merolla2012Loss; Duggimpudi2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCDC6 gene are implicated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), papillary thyroid carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. In NSCLC, CCDC6 mutations such as E227K, S351Y, N394Y, and T462A, along with truncated isoforms, can impair DNA repair processes by affecting the intracellular distribution of the wild-type protein. This leads to resistance to cisplatinum and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Cerrato2019NSCLC). CCDC6 is also involved in gene fusions with RET and ROS1 kinases, which occur in a subset of NSCLC cases and are associated with resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Laxmi2019CCDC6; Cerrato2018The).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma, CCDC6 forms fusion proteins with the RET proto-oncogene, contributing to tumorigenesis in approximately 20% of cases (Laxmi2019CCDC6). The CCDC6-RET fusion is also observed in other cancers, such as colorectal cancer and NSCLC, where it affects therapeutic responses and tumor progression (Cerrato2018The). Low expression levels of CCDC6 are linked to poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for treatment outcomes (Morra2019Analysis; Morra2014New).

## Interactions
The CCDC6 protein is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the CREB1 protein, inhibiting its cAMP-dependent transcriptional activity in a SUMO-dependent manner (Morra2017CCDC6). CCDC6 is also a substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7, which targets it for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, involving specific serine and threonine residues on CCDC6 (JunGang2012FBXW7‐mediated; Morra2015FBXW7). The phosphorylation of CCDC6 by CDK1 and GSK3 is necessary for its recognition by FBXW7 (Morra2015FBXW7).

In response to DNA damage, the phosphorylation of CCDC6 at Thr434 by ATM kinase prevents its interaction with FBXW7, stabilizing the protein (JunGang2012FBXW7‐mediated). CCDC6 also interacts with the catalytic subunit of Protein Phosphatase 4 (PP4c), as confirmed by high-throughput proteomic screening (Morra2017CCDC6). Additionally, the de-ubiquitinase USP7 interacts with CCDC6, stabilizing it by removing ubiquitin, which counteracts the degradation mediated by FBXW7 (Morra2015FBXW7). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving CCDC6, which is critical for its function in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response.
