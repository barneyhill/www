# OAS2

## Overview
The OAS2 gene encodes the enzyme 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2, which is a crucial component of the innate immune response against viral infections. This enzyme belongs to the family of synthetases and is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a molecular pattern associated with viral pathogens. Upon activation, OAS2 catalyzes the conversion of ATP into 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates, which subsequently activate RNase L, an endoribonuclease that degrades viral and cellular RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication (Justesen2000Gene; Schwartz2019RNA). Structurally, OAS2 functions as a homodimer, with each protomer containing both a catalytically inactive and an active domain, essential for its enzymatic activity (Schwartz2019RNA). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and associated with subcellular structures such as the nuclear envelope and rough endoplasmic reticulum (Hovanessian2007The). OAS2's role in antiviral defense and its involvement in various cellular processes underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis and therapy (Koul2020Impact; Kim2018Opposite).

## Structure
The human oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2) protein is a member of the OAS family, characterized by its involvement in the antiviral response. OAS2 is a medium-sized enzyme composed of two OAS1-like domains, designated as DI and DII. While DI is catalytically inactive, DII contains the catalytic aspartic acid residues essential for enzymatic activity, specifically for the coordination of magnesium ions and ATP binding, which are crucial for the formation of 2-5A chains (Koul2020Structural).

OAS2 functions as a dimer, with its dimeric nature being critical for its catalytic function. The protein forms a globular structure in solution, with a central cavity that may facilitate nucleotide and 2-5A entry and exit (Koul2020Structural). The dimerization involves both domains I and II, although the specific contributions of these domains to dimerization are not fully understood (Koul2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for OAS2 activity, as inhibition of glycosylation results in loss of function (Koul2020Structural). The protein's activity is also influenced by specific residues, such as Tyr 421 and Arg 544, which affect substrate binding (Koul2020Structural).

## Function
The OAS2 gene encodes the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 enzyme, which plays a critical role in the innate immune response to viral infections. This enzyme is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common indicator of viral presence, and catalyzes the polymerization of ATP into 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) (Schwartz2019RNA; Koul2020Impact). These oligoadenylates activate RNase L, an endoribonuclease that degrades viral and cellular RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication and halting protein synthesis in infected cells (Justesen2000Gene; Schwartz2019RNA).

OAS2 functions as a homodimer, with each protomer containing a catalytically inactive N-terminal domain and a catalytically active C-terminal domain, both necessary for its activity (Schwartz2019RNA). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is associated with various subcellular fractions, including the nuclear envelope and rough endoplasmic reticulum (Hovanessian2007The). OAS2 requires dsRNA longer than 35 base pairs for activation, and its activity is enhanced by dsRNA with 3' overhangs (Koul2020Impact). This specificity allows OAS2 to effectively sense and respond to viral dsRNA, contributing to the establishment of an antiviral state in healthy human cells (Schwartz2019RNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OAS2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. A specific mutation in the OAS2 gene, identified as I405N, has been linked to lactation failure in mice. This mutation leads to a robust interferon response and increased RNase L activity, which disrupts normal lactation processes by inhibiting prolactin signaling necessary for milk secretion (Oakes2017A). The mutation does not alter the enzymatic activity of OAS2 but affects RNase L activity through alternative regulatory mechanisms, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of mastitis, a condition characterized by lactation failure and milk stasis (Oakes2017A).

In colorectal cancer, OAS2 overexpression is associated with increased autophagy and reduced proliferation and invasion of cancer cells, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role. Higher OAS2 expression correlates with better recurrence-free survival rates in colorectal cancer patients, suggesting its prognostic value (Kim2018Opposite). Additionally, genetic variants in OAS2, such as the SNP rs2239193, have been associated with poor survival outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its potential impact on cancer progression and prognosis (Lu2024Genetic).

## Interactions
OAS2 interacts with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as part of its activation mechanism. The enzyme requires a minimum dsRNA length of approximately 35 base pairs for activation, with increased activity observed as the dsRNA length increases. This interaction is crucial for its function in antiviral defense, as it catalyzes the polymerization of ATP into 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylate chains, which subsequently activate RNase L to degrade viral and cellular RNA (Koul2020Impact; Koul2020Structural).

OAS2 functions as a dimer, and its dimerization is essential for its catalytic activity. The dimeric form involves interactions between domains I and II of one OAS2 protomer with the corresponding domains of another, forming a central cavity suitable for nucleotide entry and exit (Koul2020Structural). The high affinity between OAS2 protomers is supported by a tight dissociation constant of 5.1 nM, indicating strong interactions within the dimer (Koul2020Structural).

OAS2 is sensitive to the presence of 3' single-stranded ends on dsRNA, which can enhance its catalytic activity, although the phosphorylation state of the 5' end does not significantly affect its activation (Koul2020Impact; Koul2020Structural).
