# DLEC1

## Overview
DLEC1, or Deleted in Lung and Esophageal Cancer 1, is a gene located on chromosome 3p22.3 that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, including tumor suppression and ciliogenesis. The DLEC1 protein, categorized as a cilia and flagella-associated protein, plays a significant role in regulating microtubule polymerization and intracellular vesicle trafficking, essential for the formation of cilia and flagella (Okitsu2020Dlec1). It interacts with various proteins, including those involved in intraflagellar transport, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function (Okitsu2020Dlec1). The gene is frequently silenced in several cancers due to promoter CpG methylation, an epigenetic modification that can be reversed, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2012Epigenetic). Additionally, DLEC1 is crucial for spermatogenesis, with its deficiency leading to infertility in mice, underscoring its role in reproductive health (Okitsu2020Dlec1).

## Function
The DLEC1 gene, known as Deleted in Lung and Esophageal Cancer 1, functions as a tumor suppressor and is involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, DLEC1 is broadly expressed and plays a role in regulating cell growth and preventing tumorigenesis by maintaining normal cellular functions (Ying2009DLEC1). It is located on chromosome 3p22.3 and is frequently silenced in various cancers due to promoter CpG methylation, which can be reversed, suggesting its silencing is an epigenetic modification rather than a permanent genetic alteration (Wang2012Epigenetic).

DLEC1 is also implicated in the process of ciliogenesis, particularly in the formation of flagella through the regulation of microtubule polymerization and intracellular vesicle trafficking (Okitsu2020Dlec1). It interacts with proteins related to intraflagellar transport (IFT) and microtubule regulation, suggesting a role in loading cargo proteins onto the IFT machinery, which is essential for cilia and flagella formation (Okitsu2020Dlec1). In the testes, DLEC1 is significantly expressed in germ cells and is crucial for spermatogenesis and male fertility, with its absence leading to impaired sperm development and infertility in mice (Okitsu2020Dlec1). These functions highlight DLEC1's importance in maintaining cellular structure and function.

## Clinical Significance
The DLEC1 gene is recognized as a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently silenced in various cancers due to promoter CpG methylation. In colorectal and gastric cancers, DLEC1 is often downregulated or silenced, with methylation detected in a significant percentage of cancer cell lines and primary tumor samples, but rarely in normal tissues. This silencing can be reversed with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, suggesting a direct role of methylation in its inactivation (Ying2009DLEC1). In uterine leiomyoma, DLEC1 is also hypermethylated, leading to its transcriptional repression. Treatment with DNMT inhibitors has been shown to restore its expression, indicating that epigenetic silencing contributes to the pathogenesis of this condition (Navarro2012GenomeWide).

DLEC1 is implicated in male fertility, as studies in mice have shown that it is essential for spermatogenesis. DLEC1 deficiency results in sperm abnormalities and infertility, suggesting its involvement in microtubule-associated functions (Okitsu2020Dlec1). Additionally, DLEC1 methylation has been associated with PM2.5 exposure, which may serve as a biomarker for cancer risk, highlighting its potential role in environmental health (Chou2020PM2.5). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DLEC1 in cancer and reproductive health.

## Interactions
The DLEC1 protein interacts with several proteins, particularly those associated with cilia and flagella. In studies using HEK293F cells, DLEC1 was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with 67 proteins, including α-tubulin, β-tubulin, and T-complex protein 1 (TCP-1) family proteins. α- and β-Tubulin are the main structural components of axonemes in cilia and flagella, while TCP-1 forms a complex known as the tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex (TRiC) or chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT), which acts as a chaperone for tubulin and actin (Okitsu2020Dlec1). The interaction of DLEC1 with α- and β-tubulin was confirmed by immunoprecipitation-western blotting, although DLEC1 did not efficiently bind to γ-tubulin. DLEC1 also interacted with TRiC subunits and BBSome subunits, suggesting a role in the structural and functional integrity of cilia and flagella (Okitsu2020Dlec1).

DLEC1 is involved in microtubule-associated functions and interacts with various microtubule-/intraflagellar transport (IFT)-associated proteins. These interactions were observed in HEK293F cells, indicating that DLEC1 may regulate IFT and is crucial for sperm head and tail formation in mice (Okitsu2020Dlec1).
