# USP43

## Overview
USP43 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin-specific peptidase 43, which is a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family. This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of protein degradation and gene expression by removing ubiquitin moieties from specific substrates, thereby influencing their stability and function. USP43 is particularly involved in the deubiquitination of histone H2BK120, a modification that is essential for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein is associated with the NuRD complex, a chromatin remodeling complex, and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and migration. USP43 functions as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts, such as breast cancer, by maintaining the balance of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and repressing oncogenic pathways (He2018Imbalance). Its activity and localization are regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its role in transcriptional regulation and interaction with other proteins (He2018Imbalance).

## Function
USP43 is a ubiquitin-specific protease involved in the deubiquitination of histone H2BK120, a process crucial for regulating gene expression through histone modification. This activity is part of its association with the NuRD complex, which coordinates histone deubiquitination and deacetylation, impacting the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion (He2018Imbalance). In healthy cells, USP43 functions as a tumor suppressor by maintaining the balance of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and preventing hyperactivation of oncogenic pathways (He2018Imbalance).

USP43 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with its subcellular localization influenced by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by AKT leads to its sequestration in the cytoplasm, while dephosphorylation allows it to translocate to the nucleus, where it plays a role in transcriptional regulation (He2018Imbalance). The nuclear presence of USP43 is crucial for its role in repressing genes like EGFR, which are involved in cell proliferation and tumor growth (He2018Imbalance). Despite its significant role in cancer suppression, the specific functions of USP43 in healthy human cells remain largely uncharacterized (He2018Imbalance).

## Clinical Significance
USP43 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating protein degradation and cellular processes. In breast cancer, USP43 acts as a tumor suppressor gene, with its mutations or deletions contributing to tumorigenesis. Its reduced nuclear presence in breast carcinomas correlates with high EGFR expression and AKT hyperactivation, markers of aggressive cancer. High nuclear expression of USP43 is associated with better survival rates, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (He2018Imbalance).

In bladder cancer, USP43 stabilizes the c-Myc oncoprotein, promoting glycolysis and metastasis. It forms a positive feedback loop with c-Myc, enhancing its own expression and contributing to cancer progression. Targeting the USP43/c-Myc interaction is considered a potential therapeutic strategy (Li2024USP43).

USP43 is also overexpressed in osteosarcoma, where it regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process involved in cancer metastasis. High expression levels are linked to increased tumor cell migration and metastasis (Lavaud2021Overexpression).

In lung squamous cell carcinoma, USP43 is associated with tumor proliferation and invasion, correlating with poor prognosis. Its knockdown reduces cancer proliferation, highlighting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Zhao2024The).

## Interactions
USP43 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It is physically associated with the NuRD complex, a chromatin remodeling complex, and interacts with components such as Mi-2β, MTA3, HDAC1/2, RbAp46/48, and MBD3. These interactions suggest a role in coordinating histone deubiquitination and deacetylation, particularly affecting H2BK120ub and H3 acetylation levels (He2018Imbalance).

USP43 also interacts with the 14-3-3β/ε heterodimer, which is crucial for its cytoplasmic retention and is regulated by AKT-mediated phosphorylation. This interaction is significant for the regulation of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in breast cancer (He2018Imbalance). In the context of hypoxia, USP43 associates with 14-3-3 proteins to facilitate the nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α, enhancing its transcriptional activity (Pauzaite2024Deubiquitinating).

USP43 also stabilizes the c-Myc protein by deubiquitinating it, preventing its degradation mediated by FBXW7. This interaction forms a positive feedback loop where c-Myc enhances USP43 transcription (Li2024USP43). These interactions highlight USP43's role in various signaling pathways and its potential impact on cancer cell metabolism and metastasis.
