# OR6C3

## Overview
The OR6C3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily C member 3, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Tong2021Ectopic). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR6C3 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as adipose tissue, where it may influence metabolic processes (Giusepponi2018Gene). The gene's expression in various tissues suggests its involvement in broader physiological processes, including potential roles in metabolic regulation and disease states such as obesity and major depressive disorder (Patil2024Ectopic; Eszlari2024Olfactory).

## Function
OR6C3 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR6C3 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Tong2021Ectopic).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR6C3 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as adipose tissue, where it may influence metabolic processes. In human adipose tissue, OR6C3 mRNA expression is higher in visceral adipose tissue compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue. This expression pattern is associated with metabolic parameters, including glucose and lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue function (Giusepponi2018Gene). The gene's expression in adipose tissue suggests a potential role in obesity-related metabolic processes, although the exact molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Giusepponi2018Gene).

The ectopic expression of OR6C3 in various tissues highlights its potential involvement in broader physiological processes beyond olfaction, although its specific molecular functions in these contexts are not yet fully understood (Patil2024Ectopic).

## Clinical Significance
The OR6C3 gene, encoding an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in various conditions through its altered expression or mutations. In the context of major depressive disorder (MDD), OR6C3 is identified as a potential biomarker in a specific subgroup of women characterized by low neuroticism, low body fat, and high education levels. This suggests that olfactory genes, including OR6C3, may contribute to the pathogenesis of depression through mechanisms distinct from traditional risk factors (Eszlari2024Olfactory).

Additionally, OR6C3 has been linked to metabolic processes. It is a human orthologue of the gene Olr984, which is associated with resistance to diet-induced obesity. This connection indicates that changes in OR6C3 expression or mutations could influence metabolic pathways related to obesity and glucose regulation, highlighting its potential role in metabolic syndrome (Patil2024Ectopic).

In cattle, OR6C3 is among the olfactory receptor genes absent in all studied animals, suggesting variability in its presence across species. However, the clinical significance of this absence in cattle is not detailed, and its implications for human health remain unclear (Boschiero2024A).
