# SELENOK

## Overview
The SELENOK gene encodes selenoprotein K, a type III transmembrane protein predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Selenoprotein K is characterized by the presence of a selenocysteine residue, which is integral to its function in cellular processes. As a component of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, selenoprotein K plays a crucial role in the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining ER homeostasis. It also exhibits weak peroxidase activity, contributing to cellular redox balance and protection against oxidative stress. Beyond its molecular functions, selenoprotein K is involved in immune cell activation, particularly in calcium signaling, which is essential for T-cell proliferation and migration. Alterations in SELENOK expression have been linked to various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (Shchedrina2011Selenoprotein; Zhang2021Roles; Liu2014Selenoprotein).

## Structure
Selenoprotein K (SELENOK) is a type III transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It features a single transmembrane domain near the N-terminus, with a short N-terminal sequence extending into the ER lumen and a longer C-terminal sequence in the cytosol (Shchedrina2011Selenoprotein; Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). The C-terminal region is intrinsically disordered and contains a glycine-rich domain, which is flexible and facilitates interactions with various substrates, including misfolded proteins (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”; Cheng2021The).

SELENOK contains a selenocysteine (Sec) residue near the C-terminus, a characteristic feature of this protein family (Shchedrina2011Selenoprotein; Tsuji2021Historical). The protein is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, interacting with components like Derlin-1 and Derlin-2, which are crucial for retrotranslocation processes (Shchedrina2011Selenoprotein). SELENOK also interacts with the palmitoyltransferase DHHC6, which is essential for the palmitoylation and stable expression of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R), a key player in calcium signaling (Tsuji2021Historical; Fredericks2014Stable). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a significant role in maintaining ER homeostasis and cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
Selenoprotein K (SELENOK) is a crucial component in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It interacts with key ERAD components such as Derlin-1, Derlin-2, and the p97 complex, suggesting a role in the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins for proteasomal degradation (Shchedrina2011Selenoprotein). SELENOK is not degraded through the Derlin-dependent ERAD pathway, but its expression increases when the proteasome is inhibited, indicating its involvement in protein dislocation (Shchedrina2011Selenoprotein).

SELENOK also exhibits weak peroxidase activity, which is dependent on the presence of selenocysteine and is facilitated by thioredoxin reductase and glutaredoxin systems. This activity suggests a role in cellular redox homeostasis and the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides, contributing to membrane repair and protection against oxidative stress (Liu2014Selenoprotein).

In addition to its molecular functions, SELENOK is implicated in immune cell function, particularly in promoting effective calcium flux during immune cell activation, which is essential for T-cell proliferation and migration (Liu2014Selenoprotein). Its expression is upregulated under ER stress conditions, highlighting its role in stress response pathways (Shchedrina2011Selenoprotein).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SELENOK gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), decreased expression of SELENOK is associated with pathological changes such as dysregulation of intracellular calcium flux and synaptic receptor distribution. This suggests that SELENOK plays a role in regulating neuroimmunity and neuroinflammation, which are significant factors in AD pathology (Zhang2021Roles).

In the context of cancer, SELENOK expression is crucial for melanoma development, as it facilitates calcium ion flux into cancerous cells. Knockdown of SELENOK in melanoma cells impairs cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, indicating its role in tumor growth and metastasis (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). Additionally, alterations in SELENOK expression are associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Jia2020Potential).

SELENOK is also involved in immune response processes. Its knockdown affects T-lymphocyte proliferation and activation by reducing calcium transport and the expression of CHERP, an ER membrane protein, which impacts immune cell function (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SELENOK in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Selenoprotein K (SELENOK) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). SELENOK interacts with components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, including Derlin-1 and Derlin-2, with a higher affinity for Derlin-1. These interactions suggest a role for SELENOK in ER homeostasis and stress response (Shchedrina2011Selenoprotein). SELENOK also forms complexes with selenoprotein S (SelS) and the cytosolic protein p97, indicating its involvement in multiprotein complexes that regulate ER functions (Shchedrina2011Selenoprotein).

SELENOK is part of a complex with the palmitoyl acyl transferase DHHC6, which is crucial for the palmitoylation and stable expression of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R). This interaction is essential for proper calcium flux and immune cell activation (Fredericks2014Stable). The interaction between SELENOK and DHHC6 is mediated by SH3 domain interactions, highlighting its role in protein palmitoylation (Fredericks2014Stable). SELENOK's involvement in these interactions underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.
