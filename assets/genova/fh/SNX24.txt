# SNX24

## Overview
SNX24 is a gene that encodes the protein sorting nexin 24, which is a member of the sorting nexin family involved in intracellular trafficking processes. Sorting nexin 24 is primarily associated with the biogenesis and cargo delivery of α-granules in megakaryocytes, playing a crucial role in the formation and maturation of these granules by interacting with early endosomes and multivesicular bodies (Lacey2022Sorting). The protein is also implicated in endothelial cell inflammation, with potential regulatory effects on proinflammatory cytokine expression, particularly in the context of Kawasaki disease (Lin2013Sorting). Genetic variations in SNX24 have been linked to clinical conditions such as Kawasaki disease and disorders related to platelet granule biogenesis, highlighting its significance in both vascular and hematological health (Lin2013Sorting; Lacey2022Sorting).

## Function
Sorting nexin 24 (SNX24) is a protein involved in the biogenesis and cargo delivery of α-granules in megakaryocytes, which are precursor cells to platelets. SNX24 plays a critical role in the formation and maturation of α-granules by associating with early endosomes, multivesicular bodies (MVB), and α-granules themselves. It is involved in the trafficking of proteins from early endosomes to mature α-granules, ensuring the proper delivery of granule cargo such as CD62P and von Willebrand factor (VWF) (Lacey2022Sorting).

SNX24 expression is tightly regulated during megakaryocyte differentiation, peaking at the progenitor stage and decreasing as cells mature. This regulation is crucial for the proper formation of α-granules, as SNX24 knockout cells exhibit a reduction in α-granules and an increase in empty vacuoles, a phenotype similar to gray platelet syndrome (Lacey2022Sorting).

In addition to its role in megakaryocytes, SNX24 is implicated in endothelial cell inflammation, potentially regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. This function is particularly relevant in the context of Kawasaki disease, where SNX24 genetic variations are associated with coronary artery aneurysm severity (Lin2013Sorting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SNX24 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In Kawasaki disease (KD), a systemic vasculitis affecting children, genetic variations in SNX24, particularly the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs28891, are associated with the severity of coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) formation. Patients with the CC and CT genotypes of this SNP exhibit a reduced risk of CAA complications compared to those with the TT genotype, suggesting a protective effect (Lin2013Sorting). This SNP is located in an intron of SNX24 and may influence splicing efficiency, mRNA stability, and enhancer activity, potentially affecting SNX24 expression levels and contributing to inflammation in vascular endothelial cells (Lin2013Sorting).

SNX24 is also involved in platelet function, particularly in the biogenesis and cargo delivery of α-granules in megakaryocytes. In FLI1-deficient platelets, SNX24 expression is significantly downregulated, leading to defects in α-granule biogenesis and increased empty vacuoles, similar to gray platelet syndrome. This suggests that SNX24 is crucial for normal platelet formation and function, and its disruption may contribute to disorders related to platelet granule biogenesis and secretion (Lacey2022Sorting).
