# CEACAM3

## Overview
CEACAM3, or carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 3, is a gene that encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein primarily expressed in human granulocytes. This protein is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family and belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Unlike other CEACAM family members, CEACAM3 is specialized for its role in the innate immune response, particularly in the opsonin-independent phagocytosis of certain Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (Pils2008CEACAM3:; Bonsignore2020CEACAM3—A). The protein is characterized by a single immunoglobulin-variable (Ig V)-like domain and a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence, which is crucial for signal transduction and phagocytosis (Buntru2012HemITAM; Bonsignore2020CEACAM3—A). Through its interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins and its role in cytoskeletal remodeling, CEACAM3 facilitates the internalization and elimination of bacteria, highlighting its importance in immune defense mechanisms (Bonsignore2020CEACAM3—A).

## Structure
CEACAM3 is a type 1 transmembrane protein primarily expressed in human granulocytes. It is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family and part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein is characterized by a single immunoglobulin-variable (Ig V)-like domain in its extracellular region, lacking the additional Ig constant (Ig C)-like domains found in other CEACAM family members (Buntru2012HemITAM; Bonsignore2020CEACAM3—A). This structural feature contributes to its unique function in opsonin-independent phagocytosis of bacteria.

The cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence, which includes two critical tyrosine residues, Y230 and Y241. Phosphorylation of these residues is essential for initiating phagocytosis and signal transduction (Buntru2012HemITAM; Bonsignore2020CEACAM3—A). The ITAM-like sequence facilitates interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins, linking receptor engagement to cytoskeletal remodeling and bactericidal activity (Bonsignore2020CEACAM3—A).

CEACAM3 is localized to non-raft, phosphoglycerolipid-rich subdomains of the plasma membrane, a localization determined by its transmembrane domain. This distinct localization is insensitive to cholesterol depletion, differentiating it from other CEACAMs like CEACAM6 (Buntru2012HemITAM).

## Function
CEACAM3, or carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 3, is a receptor primarily expressed on human granulocytes, a type of white blood cell. It plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by facilitating the opsonin-independent phagocytosis of certain human-specific Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (Pils2008CEACAM3:; Bonsignore2020CEACAM3—A). Unlike other members of the CEACAM family, CEACAM3 does not engage in cell-cell adhesion but instead acts as a germline-encoded receptor that targets and helps eliminate specific bacterial pathogens (Pils2008CEACAM3:).

The molecular function of CEACAM3 involves a signal transduction pathway initiated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within its ITAM-like sequence by Src family kinases. This phosphorylation creates docking sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, leading to the recruitment of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Vav, which activates the small G protein Rac. Rac is a master regulator of actin polymerization and NADPH oxidase function, facilitating the uptake and elimination of bacteria (Pils2008CEACAM3:; Bonsignore2020CEACAM3—A). CEACAM3's role in phagocytosis is highly specific to Rac, as interference with Rac or Vav blocks bacterial uptake (Pils2008CEACAM3:). This receptor is integral to the immune response, converting non-professional phagocytes into cells capable of internalizing CEACAM-binding bacteria (Bonsignore2020CEACAM3—A).

## Clinical Significance
CEACAM3 is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and interactions. In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), CEACAM3 expression is significantly increased in colon biopsies from pediatric CD patients and adult UC patients. This upregulation is associated with inflammation, as CEACAM3 expression correlates with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8, suggesting a role in the inflammatory processes of IBD (Saiz-Gonzalo2021Regulation).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), a missense variant of CEACAM3, p.(Y95N), was identified in African American cases. Although this variant was associated with CRC risk, it was predicted to be likely benign, indicating that while CEACAM3 variants may be present in cancer cases, their direct impact on cancer risk remains uncertain (Huskey2022An).

CEACAM3 also plays a role in the immune response against bacterial pathogens. It acts as a receptor for bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, facilitating their phagocytosis. Mutations that impair the phosphorylation of its ITAM-like motif can reduce CEACAM3-dependent bacterial internalization, potentially affecting immune defense mechanisms (Pils2008CEACAM3:).

## Interactions
CEACAM3 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its role in phagocytosis and immune response. The cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence, which is phosphorylated by Src family kinases such as Src, Hck, or Fgr. This phosphorylation allows the ITAM-like sequence to serve as a docking site for SH2 domain-containing proteins, including the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vav, which binds selectively to phosphorylated Tyr-230 of CEACAM3. This interaction links CEACAM3 engagement to the activation of the small G protein Rac, essential for actin polymerization and bacterial uptake (Pils2008CEACAM3:; Schmitter2004Granulocyte).

CEACAM3 also interacts with the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTPRJ, which acts as a negative regulator by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues, thereby constraining CEACAM3-initiated cellular responses (Goob2022Phagocytosis). The adaptor protein Grb14 negatively regulates CEACAM3 by binding to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue Y230, blocking access to other binding partners (Bonsignore2020CEACAM3—A). Additionally, CEACAM3 interacts with calprotectin in a calcium-dependent manner, independent of phosphorylation, suggesting a role in signal transduction (Streichert2001The). These interactions highlight CEACAM3's role in cytoskeletal remodeling and signal transduction necessary for phagocytosis.
