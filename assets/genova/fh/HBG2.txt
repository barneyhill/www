# HBG2

## Overview
The HBG2 gene encodes the hemoglobin subunit gamma 2, a crucial component of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is predominantly expressed during fetal development. This gene is part of the beta-globin gene cluster and plays a significant role in oxygen transport from the mother to the fetus due to the high oxygen affinity of HbF (Chen2008A). The gamma 2 subunit, a globin protein, is integral to the tetrameric structure of HbF, which consists of two alpha and two gamma chains (α2γ2) (Pirastru2014A). The expression of HBG2 is tightly regulated, being active during fetal life and typically silenced after birth as adult hemoglobin (HbA) takes over (Chen2008A). However, certain genetic variations can lead to the persistence of gamma-globin expression in adults, which can ameliorate conditions such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia by increasing HbF levels (Chassanidis2008The). Understanding the regulation and function of HBG2 is essential for developing therapeutic strategies for these hemoglobinopathies.

## Structure
The HBG2 gene encodes the gamma 2 subunit of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is composed of two alpha and two gamma chains. The primary structure of the gamma chain consists of 146 amino acid residues. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are common in globin proteins (Kidd2001Oligomerization). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the gamma chain, which is similar to other beta-type globins, with some deviations in the N-terminal A helix (Kidd2001Oligomerization). 

The quaternary structure of hemoglobin Bart's (γ4), a homotetrameric form of hemoglobin composed entirely of gamma chains, resembles the R state of adult hemoglobin. This structure is characterized by stable γ2 dimer intermediates, which differ from the assembly pathway of β4 homotetramers (Kidd2001Oligomerization). The γ4 homotetramer features enhanced α1β2 interfaces compared to HbA, involving specific interactions between Arg40 and Asp99 side chains (Kidd2001Oligomerization). 

Post-translational modifications of the gamma chain may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. There is no mention of specific domains, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The HBG2 gene encodes the gamma-globin protein, which is a component of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), a tetrameric protein composed of two alpha and two gamma chains (α2γ2) (Pirastru2014A; Chen2008A). During fetal development, HbF is the predominant form of hemoglobin, facilitating efficient oxygen transfer from the mother's bloodstream to the fetus due to its high oxygen affinity (Chen2008A). This high affinity is crucial for fetal growth and development, as it ensures adequate oxygenation of fetal tissues.

In healthy human cells, the expression of the HBG2 gene is typically active during fetal development and is silenced after birth as adult hemoglobin (HbA) becomes the predominant form (Chen2008A). The regulation of HBG2 expression is critical, as increased production of gamma-globin chains can ameliorate the clinical severity of hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia by reducing globin chain imbalance (Chen2008A). The gamma-globin protein is active in red blood cells, where it contributes to the unique properties of fetal hemoglobin, including its role in oxygen transport and its ability to ameliorate certain blood disorders when expressed in higher levels in adults (Chen2008A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HBG2 gene are clinically significant in several hematological conditions. A notable mutation, HBG2:g.-109G>T, is associated with nondeletional hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (nd-HPFH), a condition characterized by elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in adults. This mutation affects a transcription factor binding site, leading to increased transcription of the HBG2 gene and elevated Gγ-globin chain production, which contributes to the HPFH phenotype (Chassanidis2008The).

The HBG2 rs7482144 polymorphism is linked to variations in HbF levels in sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients. Individuals with the TT genotype of this polymorphism exhibit higher HbF levels, which can mitigate the severity of SCA by reducing HbS polymerization, although it does not consistently correlate with milder disease severity (Steinberg2020Fetal; Lakkakula2021The). This polymorphism is also associated with an unfavorable prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), where it correlates with elevated HbF levels (BORRAYOLÓPEZ2024Foetal).

These genetic variations in HBG2 highlight its role in modulating HbF levels, which can influence the clinical outcomes of various hematological disorders.

## Interactions
The HBG2 gene, encoding the gamma-globin subunit of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that regulate its expression. A critical interaction occurs with the GATA-1 transcription factor, which binds to a GATA motif located at nucleotide positions -569 to -566 upstream of the HBG2 gene. This binding is essential for the silencing of the HBG2 promoter in adults. A T-to-G transversion at nucleotide -567 within this motif disrupts GATA-1 binding, leading to increased transcription activity and elevated levels of hemoglobin F (Chen2008A).

The interaction between GATA-1 and the HBG2 promoter has been confirmed through various assays, including electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, which demonstrate the binding of GATA-1 to the GATA motif both in vitro and in vivo (Chen2008A). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of γ-globin gene expression, as it acts as a silencer in adult erythroid cells (Chen2008A). The disruption of this interaction by the T-to-G mutation highlights the importance of the GATA motif in controlling HBG2 expression.
