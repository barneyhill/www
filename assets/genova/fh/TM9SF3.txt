# TM9SF3

## Overview
TM9SF3 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane 9 superfamily member 3, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including those related to cancer progression. TM9SF3 is particularly noted for its role in the context of gastric cancer, where its expression levels are significantly altered. The protein is typically expressed at low levels in normal tissues but is upregulated in certain types of gastric cancer, such as scirrhous-type gastric cancer, which is known for its aggressive nature and poor prognosis (Oo2014Identification). Research has highlighted the potential of TM9SF3 as a prognostic marker and a target for therapeutic intervention, given its involvement in cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Oo2014Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The TM9SF3 gene is clinically significant in the context of gastric cancer (GC), particularly scirrhous-type gastric cancer. Alterations in the expression level of TM9SF3 have been associated with the progression and prognosis of this disease. TM9SF3 is typically expressed at low levels in normal tissues but is upregulated in a significant portion of gastric cancer cases, especially in scirrhous-type GC, which is characterized by rapid proliferation and high metastasis rates (Oo2014Identification). Immunohistochemical analysis has shown that TM9SF3 is more frequently expressed in undifferentiated gastric cancers and is linked to deeper invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stages, correlating with poor prognosis in patients (Oo2014Identification).

Functional assays have demonstrated that TM9SF3 is involved in cancer cell invasion, although it does not appear to affect cell growth directly (Oo2014Identification). Knockdown experiments using siRNA have shown that reducing TM9SF3 expression decreases the invasive capacity of tumor cells, suggesting its role in tumor invasion (Oo2014Identification). These findings indicate that TM9SF3 could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer, making it a novel focus for therapeutic intervention (Oo2014Identification).
