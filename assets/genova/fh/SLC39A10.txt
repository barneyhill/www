# SLC39A10

## Overview
SLC39A10 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 10, commonly referred to as ZIP10. This protein is a transmembrane zinc transporter that plays a pivotal role in maintaining zinc homeostasis within human cells. ZIP10 is integral to various cellular processes, including enzyme function, gene expression, and cell signaling, by facilitating the transport of zinc ions across cell membranes (Landry2019Cloning). It is predominantly active in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences immune function and development (Kim2021Zinc). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are crucial for early B-cell development and macrophage function, highlighting its importance in immune responses and cell survival (Gao2017Metal; Miyai2014Zinc). Additionally, SLC39A10 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in gastric and breast cancers, where its dysregulation affects tumor growth and patient outcomes (Qu2021PanCancer; Ren2023SLC39A10).

## Function
SLC39A10, also known as ZIP10, is a zinc transporter that plays a critical role in maintaining zinc homeostasis in human cells. It is involved in the transport of zinc ions across cell membranes, which is essential for various cellular processes, including enzyme function, gene expression, and cell signaling (Landry2019Cloning). ZIP10 is active in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences immune function and development (Kim2021Zinc).

In the context of immune function, SLC39A10 is crucial for early B-cell development. It maintains zinc homeostasis, which is vital for the survival of early B-cells by preventing apoptosis through the regulation of caspase activity (Miyai2014Zinc). ZIP10 expression is regulated by the JAK-STAT signaling pathways, highlighting its role in B-cell homeostasis (Miyai2014Zinc).

SLC39A10 also plays a significant role in macrophage function. It regulates zinc homeostasis during inflammatory responses, which is essential for macrophage survival. The absence of SLC39A10 leads to reduced intracellular zinc levels, resulting in increased apoptosis through a zinc/p53-dependent mechanism (Gao2017Metal). This function underscores the importance of zinc homeostasis in immune responses and cell survival.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC39A10 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and immune response regulation. In gastric cancer, SLC39A10 is frequently upregulated, correlating with poor patient outcomes. Its overexpression enhances malignant phenotypes by activating the CK2-mediated MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are crucial for tumor growth and invasiveness. SLC39A10 is also a direct target of the oncogene c-Myc, creating a feedback loop that promotes cancer progression. Targeting CK2 or c-Myc may offer therapeutic potential for patients with high SLC39A10 expression in gastric cancer (Ren2023SLC39A10).

In the context of immune response, SLC39A10 plays a critical role in macrophage survival during inflammatory stimuli. Its downregulation in macrophages is associated with increased apoptosis, particularly in M1 macrophages, and reduced cytokine levels, which may influence susceptibility to conditions like sepsis. SLC39A10 deficiency leads to decreased intracellular zinc levels, stabilizing p53 and promoting apoptosis, suggesting a zinc/p53-dependent mechanism in macrophage regulation (Gao2017Metal).

In breast cancer, SLC39A10 expression is upregulated in aggressive cell lines and is associated with increased drug sensitivity, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Qu2021PanCancer).

## Interactions
SLC39A10, a zinc transporter, is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In gastric cancer cells, SLC39A10 overexpression increases intracellular Zn2+ levels, which activate the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. This activation is associated with increased phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, contributing to tumor growth and progression (Ren2023SLC39A10). SLC39A10 also interacts with CK2β, enhancing CK2 holoenzyme activity by stabilizing CK2β protein expression. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of CK2 substrates, which are involved in the activation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways (Ren2023SLC39A10).

In prostate cancer, SLC39A10 is part of a regulatory axis involving lncRNA MCM3AP-AS1 and miR-543-3p. MCM3AP-AS1 binds to miR-543-3p, which can directly interact with SLC39A10. This axis influences cell proliferation and invasion, potentially through the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway (p&gt; LncRNA; Jia2020&lt). These interactions highlight SLC39A10's role in modulating zinc homeostasis and its downstream effects on signaling pathways that contribute to cancer progression.
