# SEMA4F

## Overview
SEMA4F is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 4F, a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in axonal guidance and cell signaling. Semaphorin 4F is a transmembrane protein characterized by a semaphorin domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a transmembrane region, which are essential for its function in cellular communication and guidance (Schultze2001Semaphorin4F). The protein is involved in various biological processes, particularly within the nervous system, where it regulates oligodendrocyte precursor cell migration and differentiation, synaptic organization, and Schwann cell-axon interactions (Parrinello2008NF1; Armendáriz2012Expression). Beyond its neural functions, semaphorin 4F is implicated in cancer biology, notably in prostate cancer and glioma, where it influences tumor progression and neurogenesis (Ding2013Semaphorin; HuangHobbs2023Remote). The diverse roles of semaphorin 4F in both normal physiology and disease contexts underscore its significance as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker.

## Structure
SEMA4F, or semaphorin 4F, is a protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in axonal guidance and cell signaling. The primary structure of SEMA4F includes a semaphorin domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a transmembrane region. These domains are essential for its function in cellular communication and guidance.

The secondary and tertiary structures of SEMA4F are defined by the presence of beta-strands and alpha-helices, which contribute to a compact and stable fold. This structural configuration is typical of proteins involved in signaling pathways, allowing for specific interactions with other cellular components.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in SEMA4F and may influence its stability, localization, and interaction with other molecules. These modifications are critical for the protein's functional diversity and regulation.

SEMA4F also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which result in proteins with distinct functional properties. These isoforms allow SEMA4F to participate in a variety of cellular processes, adapting its function to different cellular contexts and requirements. The diversity in isoforms underscores the protein's versatility and importance in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
Semaphorin 4F (SEMA4F) is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) migration and differentiation. SEMA4F inhibits OPC migration while promoting their differentiation into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes, which is essential for proper neural development and function (Armendáriz2012Expression). In the central nervous system, SEMA4F is expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, including their precursors, and is involved in organizing OPC migration along pathways such as the optic nerve (Armendáriz2012Expression).

SEMA4F also interacts with the synapse-associated protein SAP90/PSD-95 at glutamatergic synapses, suggesting a role in synaptic organization and signaling. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif of SEMA4F, which is crucial for its function in synaptic localization (Schultze2001Semaphorin4F). In the peripheral nervous system, SEMA4F maintains Schwann cell-axon interactions, which are vital for Schwann cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. The downregulation of SEMA4F disrupts these interactions, leading to increased Schwann cell proliferation and potential tumorigenesis, as observed in conditions like neurofibromatosis type 1 (Parrinello2008NF1).

## Clinical Significance
SEMA4F, or semaphorin 4F, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, SEMA4F is overexpressed and associated with aggressive disease phenotypes. It plays a critical role in cancer-induced neurogenesis and perineural invasion, processes that facilitate cancer progression by enhancing cancer cell growth and migration. High SEMA4F expression correlates with increased risk of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for aggressive forms of the disease (Ding2013Semaphorin).

In the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), SEMA4F is involved in Schwann cell-axonal interactions. Loss of SEMA4F disrupts these interactions, leading to increased Schwann cell proliferation, a characteristic of tumorigenesis. This disruption is linked to NF1 loss, which activates the Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway, down-regulating SEMA4F and contributing to neurofibroma formation (Parrinello2008NF1).

SEMA4F also plays a role in glioma infiltration and progression. Overexpression of SEMA4F accelerates glioma infiltration and decreases survival, while its knockdown impairs infiltration and extends survival. This suggests that SEMA4F is a critical regulator of glioma infiltration and tumorigenesis, highlighting its potential clinical significance in glioma treatment strategies (HuangHobbs2023Remote).

## Interactions
Semaphorin 4F (SEMA4F) interacts with the synapse-associated protein SAP90/PSD-95, particularly through its PDZ domains. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif, ETXI, of SEMA4F, which specifically binds to the PDZ2 domain of SAP90/PSD-95. The interaction was confirmed using a yeast two-hybrid system and pulldown assays with glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins. Deletion of the last three amino acids of SEMA4F's cytosolic domain results in the loss of this interaction, underscoring the importance of this motif (schultze2001semaphorin4f).

SEMA4F also plays a role in the translocation of SAP90/PSD-95 from the cytosol to the membrane in heterologous transfected COS cells, indicating a functional interaction that may influence synaptic organization and function (schultze2001semaphorin4f). In the context of cancer, SEMA4F is involved in interactions that regulate neuroepithelial interactions and is linked to cancer-induced neurogenesis and perineural invasion, particularly in prostate cancer (Ding2013Semaphorin). These interactions highlight SEMA4F's role in both neural and cancer-related processes.
