# EIF2S3

## Overview
The EIF2S3 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit gamma (eIF2γ), a critical component of the eIF2 complex involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. This complex is a heterotrimer composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, with eIF2γ playing a pivotal role in binding GTP and the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet) to form the ternary complex necessary for translation initiation (YoungBaird2018MEHMO). The eIF2γ subunit is essential for maintaining the fidelity of start codon selection during translation, ensuring accurate protein synthesis (YoungBaird2018MEHMO). Mutations in EIF2S3 can lead to significant clinical manifestations, including MEHMO syndrome, characterized by intellectual disabilities and other systemic symptoms (English2021A). Additionally, aberrant expression of EIF2S3 has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (chen2022EIF2S3).

## Structure
The EIF2S3 gene encodes the gamma subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis. The eIF2 complex is a heterotrimer composed of three subunits: α, β, and γ, with the γ subunit forming the core and binding GTP (Cardenal2023Binding). The primary structure of EIF2S3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, including a GTP-binding domain crucial for its function (Cardenal2023Binding).

The secondary structure of eIF2γ includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is necessary for its interaction with other subunits in the eIF2 complex. The quaternary structure of eIF2γ is characterized by its interaction with eIF2α and eIF2β to form the functional eIF2 complex (YoungBaird2018MEHMO).

The eIF2γ subunit contains a conserved tRNA-binding pocket, which is critical for the formation of the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA) necessary for translation initiation (YoungBaird2018MEHMO). Mutations in this region, such as I259M, can impair Met-tRNAiMet binding, affecting translation initiation and leading to conditions like MEHMO syndrome (YoungBaird2018MEHMO).

## Function
The EIF2S3 gene encodes the gamma subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), a critical component in the initiation of protein synthesis in healthy human cells. eIF2 is a heterotrimeric complex composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, and it plays a pivotal role in the formation of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) by binding GTP and the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet) (YoungBaird2018MEHMO). This complex is essential for delivering Met-tRNAiMet to the 40S ribosomal subunit, forming a ternary complex (TC) that is crucial for the assembly of the 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) (YoungBaird2018MEHMO).

The eIF2 complex facilitates the binding of Met-tRNAiMet to the ribosome, a critical step in the initiation of translation, ensuring accurate start codon selection and efficient translation initiation (YoungBaird2018MEHMO). The gamma subunit, encoded by EIF2S3, is particularly important for maintaining the fidelity of start codon selection, preventing initiation at non-AUG codons, and ensuring proper regulation of translation initiation (YoungBaird2018MEHMO). This process is vital for normal cellular function and growth, as it ensures the correct synthesis of proteins necessary for various cellular activities (YoungBaird2018MEHMO).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF2S3 gene are associated with MEHMO syndrome, a rare X-linked intellectual disability syndrome. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as mental retardation, epileptic seizures, hypogonadism, hypogenitalism, microcephaly, and obesity. MEHMO syndrome primarily affects males due to its X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. The syndrome has been linked to various mutations in the EIF2S3 gene, including a prevalent four base pair deletion that causes a frameshift and premature stop codon, leading to severe symptoms, often including diabetes (English2021A; Stone2021Monogenic).

Specific missense mutations, such as I259M, S108R, and I222T, have been identified in patients with MEHMO syndrome. These mutations impair the function of the eIF2 complex, affecting translation initiation and leading to impaired cell viability and neuronal differentiation (YoungBaird2018MEHMO). The I259M mutation, for example, disrupts the binding of Met-tRNAiMet to eIF2, which is crucial for protein synthesis initiation (YoungBaird2018MEHMO).

Altered expression of EIF2S3 is also implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer, where it is often upregulated. In these cancers, EIF2S3 expression is associated with tumor progression, prognosis, and immune cell infiltration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (chen2022EIF2S3).

## Interactions
The EIF2S3 gene encodes the gamma (γ) subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex, which is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis. The eIF2 complex is a heterotrimer composed of α, β, and γ subunits, and it plays a critical role in delivering initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet) to the 40S ribosomal subunit (YoungBaird2018MEHMO). EIF2S3 interacts with GTP and Met-tRNAiMet to form the ternary complex (TC), which is crucial for scanning mRNA for the AUG start codon (Gregory2019Impaired).

Mutations in EIF2S3 can disrupt its interactions with other subunits and nucleic acids. For instance, the I259M mutation in eIF2γ impairs the binding of Met-tRNAiMet, affecting the formation of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAiMet complex and leading to defects in translation initiation (YoungBaird2018MEHMO). This mutation is located in the Met-tRNAiMet-binding pocket, suggesting it may alter the physical interaction between Met-tRNAiMet and the eIF2 complex (YoungBaird2018MEHMO).

The eIF2γ subunit also interacts with eIF2β, and mutations such as I222T can disrupt this interaction, impairing the formation of the eIF2 complex and affecting translation initiation (Borck2012eIF2γ). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of the eIF2 complex, and disruptions can lead to various phenotypes, including intellectual disabilities associated with MEHMO syndrome (English2021A).
