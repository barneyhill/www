# TMEM129

## Overview
TMEM129 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 129, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining protein homeostasis by tagging misfolded proteins for degradation. The protein is characterized by its C4C4-type RING finger domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity. TMEM129 is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and interacts with various components of the ERAD complex, including Derlin-1, Derlin-2, and p97, to facilitate the dislocation and degradation of misfolded proteins. Beyond its fundamental role in cellular homeostasis, TMEM129 has been implicated in clinical contexts such as cancer prognosis and genetic syndromes, highlighting its potential significance in human health and disease (Lee2019Somatic; van2014A).

## Structure
TMEM129 is a transmembrane protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. The protein is composed of 362 amino acids and is predicted to have three transmembrane domains, which anchor it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (van2014A). A key structural feature of TMEM129 is its unconventional C4C4-type RING finger domain, which is essential for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This domain is characterized by four zinc-coordinating cysteine pairs and is conserved among TMEM129 orthologs (van2014A). The RING domain is critical for the ubiquitination process, as its removal results in a loss of ligase activity and a dominant-negative phenotype that rescues HLA class I from US11-mediated dislocation (van2014A).

TMEM129 is part of a complex that includes other ERAD components such as Derlin-1, Derlin-2, VIMP, and p97, indicating its integral role in the ER-resident dislocation complex (van2014A). The protein's interaction with these components suggests a quaternary structure involving multiple protein-protein interactions within the ERAD pathway. TMEM129's function is not affected by the addition of tags, indicating that its structural integrity is maintained in various experimental conditions (van2014A).

## Function
TMEM129 is a transmembrane protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This protein is involved in tagging misfolded proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing cellular stress due to protein accumulation (van2014A). TMEM129 is characterized by a C4C4 RING domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (van2014A).

In healthy human cells, TMEM129 is part of the ER-resident dislocation complexes, where it collaborates with other proteins such as Derlin-1, Derlin-2, and p97 to mediate the dislocation and degradation of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol (van2014A). This process is crucial for the quality control of proteins and the alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, contributing to cellular homeostasis (van2014A).

TMEM129's activity is not limited to viral contexts, as it also functions independently of viral proteins like US11, indicating a broader role in physiological ERAD processes (van2014A). Its involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and integrity.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM129 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to cancer and genetic syndromes. In the context of breast cancer, high expression levels of TMEM129 have been associated with better overall survival rates. A study found that patients with elevated TMEM129 expression had a significantly improved survival rate at 150 months, suggesting a potential protective role in breast cancer prognosis (Lee2019Somatic).

In genetic disorders, TMEM129 is included in a 393 kb duplication on chromosome 4p16.3, which has been associated with a novel microduplication syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by psychomotor and language delays, musculoskeletal anomalies, and craniofacial features. However, the specific contribution of TMEM129 to these clinical features remains unclear, as the roles of other genes in the region, such as FAM53A, TACC3, and FGFR3, are more prominently highlighted (Palumbo2015Report).

The clinical significance of TMEM129 mutations or alterations in its interactions is not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in disease mechanisms and potential as a biomarker for certain conditions.

## Interactions
TMEM129 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It is involved in the dislocation and degradation of proteins, particularly in the context of US11-mediated HLA class I downregulation. TMEM129 interacts with several proteins within the ERAD complex, including Derlin-1, Derlin-2, VIMP, p97, and HRD1, indicating its integral role in the dislocation process (van2014A). 

TMEM129 also associates with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2J2, which is essential for the ubiquitination process necessary for HLA class I degradation (van2014A). The interactions with these proteins are maintained even when the RING domain of TMEM129 is removed, although this removal results in a dominant-negative phenotype that affects its function (van2014A). 

In addition to its role in ERAD, TMEM129 has been identified as an effector gene associated with osteoarthritis (OA) genetic risk. It interacts with genomic regions marked by specific CpGs, potentially influencing its expression and role in OA (Brumwell2022Identification).
