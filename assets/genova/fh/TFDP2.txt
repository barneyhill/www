# TFDP2

## Overview
TFDP2 is a gene that encodes the transcription factor Dp-2, a protein integral to the regulation of the cell cycle. As a transcription factor, Dp-2 forms heterodimers with E2F transcription factors, which are pivotal in controlling the transcription of genes necessary for DNA replication and cell cycle progression, particularly during the G1 to S phase transition. The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it enhances the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of E2F proteins, thereby influencing cellular proliferation and differentiation (Zhu2021The). Beyond its role in normal cellular processes, TFDP2 is implicated in pathological conditions, such as viral infections and cancer, where its expression is often dysregulated. For instance, during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection, TFDP2 is upregulated, facilitating viral replication by promoting cell cycle progression (Zhu2021The). Additionally, alterations in TFDP2 expression and function have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Dlamini2021Genetic; Wang2022Comprehensive).

## Function
TFDP2, or transcription factor Dp-2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle by forming heterodimers with E2F transcription factors. These heterodimers are essential for the transcription of genes involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression, particularly during the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. TFDP2 is active in the nucleus, where it enhances the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of E2F proteins, thereby influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Zhu2021The).

In the context of viral infections, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), TFDP2 is upregulated, which facilitates viral proliferation by promoting the expression of cyclin A, a gene that controls S phase progression. This upregulation accelerates the cell cycle, creating a favorable environment for viral replication (Zhu2021The). The interaction of TFDP2 with E2F transcription factors is not only crucial for normal cell cycle regulation but also highlights its potential role in pathological conditions where cell cycle control is disrupted (Zhu2021The). TFDP2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by abnormal cell proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the TFDP2 gene, including changes in expression levels and mutations, have been implicated in various cancers. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly in HPV16-positive tumors from non-smokers, TFDP2 expression is upregulated. This upregulation is associated with the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 to the S phase, although the precise role of TFDP2 isoforms in HNSCC remains unclear (Dlamini2021Genetic). In other cancers, TFDP2 expression is linked to drug resistance, particularly to Trametinib and CI-1040, suggesting a role in mediating chemotherapeutic resistance (Wang2022Comprehensive). 

TFDP2 is also involved in the DREAM complex, which regulates cell cycle and apoptosis pathways. Alterations in TFDP2, including mutations and methylation changes, are associated with poor survival outcomes in cancers such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ) (Wang2022Comprehensive). In the context of viral infections, TFDP2 expression is upregulated during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection, facilitating viral proliferation by affecting the cell cycle (Zhu2021The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TFDP2 in cancer progression and viral pathogenesis.

## Interactions
TFDP2 (transcription factor Dp-2) is known to interact with E2F transcription factors to form heterodimers, which are essential for regulating the cell cycle and DNA synthesis. These E2F/DP heterodimers enhance DNA binding affinity and transcriptional activity, playing a crucial role in cell cycle progression, DNA repair, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (Zhu2021The). 

In the context of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection, TFDP2 expression is upregulated, and it interacts with the C/EBPb transcription factor. The C/EBPb response element is critical for the activation of the TFDP2 promoter by PRRSV and its N protein. This interaction leads to increased phosphorylation of C/EBPb, which induces TFDP2 production, subsequently affecting the cell cycle by up-regulating cyclin A, a target gene of the E2F/DP complex (Zhu2021The).

In chickens, TFDP2 is targeted by the microRNA gga-miR-103-3p, which binds to the mRNA of TFDP2, affecting its protein expression levels. This interaction is significant in the context of Marek's disease, where gga-miR-103-3p modulates TFDP2 at the protein level, influencing cell migration (Han2016Chicken).
