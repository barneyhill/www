# GOLGB1

## Overview
GOLGB1 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin B1, also known as giantin, which is a large coiled-coil transmembrane protein associated with the Golgi apparatus. Golgin B1 is a member of the golgin family, characterized by their role in vesicle tethering and transport within the Golgi complex. The protein is anchored to the Golgi membrane or COPI vesicles through its transmembrane domain at the C-terminus and interacts with other proteins such as p115 and GM130 via its p115-binding domain at the N-terminus. This structural configuration facilitates its involvement in the early steps of O-glycosylation and the targeting of specific glycosyltransferases to the Golgi, which is crucial for proper protein glycosylation and tissue morphogenesis (Lan2016Golgb1). Mutations in GOLGB1 have been linked to various developmental disorders and diseases, underscoring its significance in cellular and physiological processes (Flanagan2013Genetic; Liu2022Pedigreebased).

## Function
The GOLGB1 gene encodes a large transmembrane protein known as Golgb1 or giantin, which is associated with the Golgi apparatus, a central organelle in the secretory pathway. Golgb1 is part of the golgin family, characterized by coiled-coil proteins that facilitate vesicle tethering at the Golgi apparatus. It is unique among golgins due to its transmembrane domain at the C-terminus, anchoring it to the Golgi membrane or COPI vesicles, and a p115-binding domain at the N-terminus, suggesting a role in vesicle tethering to the Golgi membranes in conjunction with p115 and GM130 (Lan2016Golgb1).

Golgb1 is crucial for protein glycosylation, particularly in the O-glycosylation pathway, by mediating the Golgi-targeting of certain glycosyltransferases. Knockdown studies have shown that GOLGB1 is essential for targeting C2GnT-M and C2GnT-L synthases to the Golgi membrane (Lan2016Golgb1). Although not required for maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi, Golgb1 is essential for proper glycosylation of glycoproteins, as evidenced by increased binding of specific lectins in Golgb1 mutant embryos (Lan2016Golgb1). This protein plays a critical role in tissue morphogenesis, including palatal shelf elevation, and is involved in the accumulation of hyaluronic acid in tissues, which affects palatal development (Lan2016Golgb1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GOLGB1 gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders and diseases. In mammalian development, GOLGB1 is crucial for palatal shelf elevation, and mutations can lead to cleft palate. This is due to defects in protein glycosylation and reduced hyaluronic acid accumulation in the palatal mesenchyme, which are essential for proper tissue morphogenesis (Lan2016Golgb1). 

In the context of psychiatric disorders, GOLGB1 has been identified as a potential risk gene for bipolar disorder (BD). Studies have found frameshift and missense mutations in GOLGB1 in families with BD, suggesting a link between these mutations and the disorder. Behavioral studies in mice with reduced Golgb1 expression showed abnormalities similar to BD, indicating that GOLGB1 dysregulation may contribute to BD phenotypes through pathways involving PSD93 and PI3K/Akt signaling (Liu2022Pedigreebased).

GOLGB1 mutations have also been associated with osteochondrodysplasia in rats and a ciliopathy-like phenotype in zebrafish, highlighting its role in extracellular matrix component transport and intracellular membrane trafficking (Liu2021The). In sickle cell anemia, a specific GOLGB1 mutation has been linked to stroke protection, suggesting a protective role against cerebrovascular disease (Flanagan2013Genetic).

## Interactions
GOLGB1, also known as golgin B1, is a large coiled-coil protein associated with the Golgi apparatus, playing a crucial role in maintaining its structure and function. It is involved in vesicle tethering and transport, interacting with various proteins to facilitate these processes. GOLGB1 has a transmembrane domain at the C-terminus, anchoring it to the Golgi membrane or COPI vesicles, and a p115-binding domain at the N-terminus. This structure suggests its role in vesicle tethering to the Golgi membranes in conjunction with p115 and GM130, another p115-interacting golgin (Lan2016Golgb1).

GOLGB1 is also implicated in the targeting of specific glycosyltransferases to the Golgi, particularly in the O-glycosylation pathway. It is used by C2GnT-M and C2GnT-L synthases to target the Golgi membrane, while C1GalT1 and ST3Gal1 synthases use GOLGB1 and GM130-GRASP65 as alternative docking sites (Lan2016Golgb1). Additionally, GOLGB1 interacts with the transcytosis-associated protein p115, encoded by the Uso1 gene, which is involved in tethering ER-derived vesicles to the Golgi (Lan2016Golgb1). These interactions highlight GOLGB1's role in the early steps of O-glycosylation and its importance in mammalian organogenesis.
