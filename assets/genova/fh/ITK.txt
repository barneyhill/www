# ITK

## Overview
The ITK gene encodes the IL2 inducible T cell kinase, a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which plays a pivotal role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. This kinase is integral to the development, activation, and differentiation of T cells, influencing immune responses and cytokine production. Structurally, ITK is characterized by a domain architecture that includes a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, a Tec Homology (TH) domain, Src Homology 3 (SH3) and 2 (SH2) domains, and a C-terminal kinase domain, which collectively facilitate its recruitment to the plasma membrane and interaction with key signaling proteins (Andreotti2010TCell; Boyken2024Molecular). ITK's activity is crucial for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the RAS/MAPK pathway, and it also possesses kinase-independent functions that contribute to T cell activation (Dombroski2005KinaseIndependent; Huang2017ITK). Mutations or dysregulation of ITK are associated with various immunological disorders and malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance in immune system function and disease (Ghosh2014Interleukin2Inducible; Lechner2020Role).

## Structure
The IL2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK) is a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, characterized by a specific domain architecture. ITK contains an N-terminal Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, a Tec Homology (TH) domain, a Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain, a Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain (Boyken2024Molecular). The PH domain is involved in binding phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) at the plasma membrane, which is crucial for ITK's catalytic activity (Boyken2024Molecular). The SH2 domain of ITK has been structurally analyzed, revealing a classical SH2-domain fold and a domain-swapped dimeric arrangement in crystal structures, although it behaves as a monomer in solution (Joseph2012Structure).

The PH domain of ITK is noted for its poor solubility and expression, which has been improved through specific mutations such as C96E and T110I (Boyken2024Molecular). These mutations enhance the solubility and expression of the PH domain without affecting its phosphoinositide binding (Boyken2024Molecular). ITK is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is essential for its activation and function in T-cell signaling (Boyken2024Molecular). Alternative splicing of the ITK gene can result in different isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Boyken2024Molecular).

## Function
The IL2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK) is a crucial component in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, playing a significant role in T cell development, activation, and differentiation. ITK is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it influences immune responses and cytokine production. Upon TCR stimulation, ITK is recruited to the plasma membrane via its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and interacts with the SLP-76/LAT adapter complex through its Src homology (SH3 and SH2) domains. This interaction is essential for the activation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLCγ1), leading to calcium flux, ERK activation, and subsequent transcription and cytokine release (Andreotti2010TCell).

ITK also plays a role in the differentiation of type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells by regulating the expression of the transcription factor IRF4, which is crucial for Tr1 cell development and function. ITK signaling through the RAS/MAPK pathway is indispensable for this process, and constitutively active RAS signaling can rescue IL-10 and IRF4 induction in ITK-deficient cells (Huang2017ITK).

Additionally, ITK has kinase-independent functions, such as regulating actin polymerization and stabilizing protein interactions within the TCR signaling complex, which are crucial for T cell activation and function (Dombroski2005KinaseIndependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITK gene are associated with a range of immunological disorders and malignancies. ITK deficiency can lead to severe immune dysregulation, characterized by conditions such as hypogammaglobulinemia, global lymphopenia, and a significant reduction in CD4+ T cells, particularly naive CD45RA+CD4+ T cells (Ghosh2014Interleukin2Inducible). This deficiency predisposes individuals to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, due to impaired T and NKT cell responses (Youssefian2019Inherited; Ghosh2018Interleukin2Inducible).

Alterations in ITK expression are linked to various inflammatory and oncogenic processes. In inflammatory diseases, ITK is involved in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis, where its inhibition can reduce inflammation and disease severity (Lechner2020Role). In oncogenesis, ITK mutations are associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly in the context of EBV infections, leading to immune dysregulation and increased susceptibility to viral infections (Lechner2020Role).

ITK is also implicated in angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), where its aberrant activation is linked to poor clinical outcomes. A SYK-ITK fusion protein in AITL drives oncogenesis by activating TCR-proximal proteins, and patients with phosphorylated ITK have lower response rates to therapy (Lechner2020Role).

## Interactions
ITK (IL2 inducible T cell kinase) is a member of the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases and plays a crucial role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. ITK interacts with several proteins, forming complexes essential for T cell activation. One of the primary interactions is with the adaptor protein SLP-76, which is critical for ITK's activation and function. The SH2 domain of ITK binds directly to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on SLP-76, facilitating the recruitment and activation of downstream signaling molecules like phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) (Bogin2007SLP76; Qi2007Keeping).

ITK also interacts with the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and forms a complex with SLP-76 and LAT, which is crucial for TCR signaling (Su1999Interaction). The interaction between ITK and PLC-γ1 is regulated by TCR/CD3 engagement and is enhanced by costimulatory molecules such as CD28 (PerezVillar1999Regulated). ITK's SH3 domain associates with the proline-rich region of SLP-76, while its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) at the cell membrane, further facilitating its role in T cell signaling (Andreotti2010TCell; Qi2007Keeping). These interactions are essential for maintaining ITK in an active conformation and ensuring proper T cell function.
