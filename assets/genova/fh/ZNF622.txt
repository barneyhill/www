# ZNF622

## Overview
ZNF622 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 622, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2 zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in DNA binding, although ZNF622 itself does not directly bind to viral DNA under experimental conditions (Mun2019Cellular). The protein, also known as zinc finger-like protein 9 (ZPR9), is a phosphoprotein, indicating it undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Mun2019Cellular). ZNF622 plays a significant role in cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and ribosomal biogenesis, and is involved in apoptotic signaling pathways through interactions with proteins like MPK38, B-MYB, and ASK1 (Mun2019Cellular). In the context of human adenovirus infection, ZNF622 forms a trimeric complex with the viral pVII protein and the cellular histone chaperone nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), which is crucial for regulating viral DNA packaging and limiting viral growth (Mun2019Cellular). The protein's dual localization in the cytoplasm and nucleus underscores its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to viral infections.

## Structure
ZNF622 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are putative DNA-binding modules. These motifs are typical of zinc finger proteins and contribute to the protein's ability to interact with other molecules, although specific binding to viral DNA was not detected under the experimental conditions (Mun2019Cellular). The protein is also known as zinc finger-like protein 9 (ZPR9) and is a phosphoprotein, indicating that it undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Mun2019Cellular).

ZNF622 interacts with various proteins, including the viral pVII protein and the cellular histone chaperone protein nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), forming a trimeric complex in infected cells (Mun2019Cellular). This interaction is crucial for its function in hindering viral growth by limiting the binding of pVII to viral DNA (Mun2019Cellular). The C-terminal part of ZNF622 is involved in binding to pVII, as demonstrated by experiments with deletion mutants (Mun2019Cellular). The protein is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with its localization potentially influenced by its molecular structure and interactions (Mun2019Cellular).

## Function
ZNF622, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several molecular processes within healthy human cells. It contains C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are putative DNA-binding modules, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Mun2019Cellular). ZNF622 is a phosphoprotein that resides in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating its involvement in various cellular functions (Mun2019Cellular). In the nucleus, ZNF622 interacts with proteins such as MPK38, B-MYB, and ASK1, participating in redox-dependent interactions and signaling pathways that can lead to apoptotic cell death (Mun2019Cellular).

ZNF622 is also associated with ribosomal biogenesis, potentially playing a role in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Mun2019Cellular). This involvement in ribosomal biogenesis suggests a broader role in protein synthesis and cellular growth. Although the specific functions of ZNF622 in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its interactions and localization imply significant roles in transcriptional regulation and cellular homeostasis. The protein's ability to interact with various cellular proteins and its presence in key cellular compartments underscore its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions.

## Interactions
ZNF622 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in the context of human adenovirus (HAdV) infection. It forms a trimeric complex with the viral pVII protein and the cellular histone chaperone nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1). This interaction is crucial for regulating the binding of pVII to viral DNA, which is a key step in virus DNA packaging and immune signaling regulation (Mun2019Cellular). The interaction between ZNF622 and pVII is partially mediated by nucleic acids, as demonstrated by the reduction of this interaction upon treatment with BenzonaseÂ® endonuclease (Mun2019Cellular).

ZNF622 does not directly bind to viral DNA but interacts with pVII, suggesting a complex mechanism where ZNF622 acts as a scaffold, potentially sequestering pVII and NPM1 to cellular DNA. This interaction limits pVII's binding to viral DNA, thereby hindering the accumulation of infectious virus progeny (Mun2019Cellular). The absence of ZNF622 enhances pVII binding to viral DNA, leading to increased formation of infectious virions (Mun2019Cellular). The interaction with NPM1 is specific, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and is reduced in certain ZNF622 mutants, indicating that specific regions of ZNF622 are crucial for its function (Mun2019Cellular).
