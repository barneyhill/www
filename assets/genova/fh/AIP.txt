# AIP

## Overview
The AIP gene encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein, a molecular co-chaperone that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. This protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as chaperones and components of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. AIP is involved in maintaining the stability and function of these protein complexes, influencing cellular responses to environmental toxins and regulating hormone secretion in pituitary cells (Morgan2012Structure; Leontiou2008The). Clinically, mutations in the AIP gene are associated with familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA), predisposing individuals to the development of aggressive pituitary tumors (Beckers2013Familial). These mutations highlight the gene's significance in tumorigenesis and underscore the importance of genetic screening for early detection and management in affected families (Beckers2013Familial).

## Structure
The AIP (aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein) gene encodes a protein consisting of 330 amino acids with a molecular weight of 37 kDa. The protein features an N-terminal immunophilin-like domain and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain (Morgan2012Structure). The TPR domain is composed of three sets of a degenerate consensus sequence of 34 amino acids, typically arranged in tandem repeats. These repeats form an antiparallel amphipathic structure with two alpha-helices and a final C-terminal α-7 helix (Ca-7h) (Morgan2012Structure). 

The TPR domain of AIP is structurally similar to those found in other proteins such as HOP, CHIP, and FKBP52, and is involved in binding with chaperones like HSP90 and TOMM20 (Morgan2012Structure). The interaction with these chaperones involves the terminal five amino acids of the chaperones, with the TPR domain cleft accommodating the peptide fragments (Morgan2012Structure). 

Mutations in the AIP gene, particularly those affecting the C-terminal α-7 helix, can disrupt client-protein binding, predisposing individuals to pituitary adenomas (Morgan2012Structure). The extreme C-terminus of AIP is crucial for binding client proteins like AhR and PDE4A5, with conserved charged and hydrophobic residues forming a helical structure essential for these interactions (Morgan2012Structure).

## Function
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, which is involved in cellular responses to environmental toxins like dioxin. AIP acts as a molecular co-chaperone, crucial for the functional maturation of AhR by protecting it from ubiquitination and prolonging its half-life, thereby retaining AhR in the cytoplasm to prevent it from acting as a transcription factor (Nakata2009G‐protein; Leontiou2008The). AIP contains tetratricopeptide repeat motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, which are essential for its role in modulating AhR function (Leontiou2008The).

In normal pituitary cells, AIP is associated with growth hormone (GH) and prolactin secretory vesicles, suggesting a role in hormone secretion regulation (Leontiou2008The). AIP is expressed in somatotroph and lactotroph cells, where it is found in the cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in specific pituitary cell functions (Leontiou2008The). Additionally, AIP interacts with proteins in the cAMP signaling pathway, influencing cAMP levels and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor by maintaining low cAMP levels, which is crucial for regulating hormone production and cellular proliferation (Formosa2013Aip).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AIP gene are significantly associated with the development of pituitary adenomas, particularly in the context of familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA). These mutations are linked to an increased risk of developing hormone-secreting tumors, such as somatotropinomas, prolactinomas, and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. AIP mutations are found in approximately 20% of FIPA families and are more prevalent in young patients, often diagnosed before the age of 30 (Beckers2013Familial).

Patients with AIP mutations tend to develop larger and more aggressive tumors, which are often resistant to conventional treatments like somatostatin analogs. These tumors frequently require multiple surgical interventions and may show poor responses to medical therapies (Beckers2013Familial). The presence of AIP mutations is also associated with conditions such as gigantism and acromegaly, particularly in cases diagnosed at a young age (Karaca2015Prevalence; Caimari2016Novel).

The incomplete penetrance of AIP mutations suggests that not all carriers will develop pituitary adenomas, and the clinical course can vary significantly among individuals (HernándezRamírez2015Landscape). Genetic screening is recommended for early detection and management in at-risk populations (Beckers2013Familial).

## Interactions
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) is involved in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. AIP interacts with the chaperone protein Hsp90 through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a common feature among TPR-containing proteins. This interaction involves the MEEVD motif at the C-terminal end of Hsp90, and an unusual interaction also occurs between Hsp90 and the PPIase domain of AIP (Linnert2013The). AIP forms a heterotetrameric complex with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and Hsp90, which translocates to the nucleus upon ligand binding, leading to the transcription of target genes (Linnert2013The).

AIP also interacts with components of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, specifically the regulatory subunit R1α and the catalytic subunit Cα. These interactions are independent of chaperone proteins like Hsp90 and HSC70 and persist even when the PKA pathway is activated (SchernthanerReiter2018Interaction). AIP's interaction with these subunits is crucial for maintaining the stability of the PKA complex and regulating its activity (SchernthanerReiter2018Interaction).

Additionally, AIP interacts with mitochondrial preproteins and the mitochondrial import receptor Tom20, forming a ternary complex that facilitates mitochondrial import (Yano2003AIP). These interactions highlight AIP's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and protein regulation.
