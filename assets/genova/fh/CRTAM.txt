# CRTAM

## Overview
CRTAM, or cytotoxic and regulatory T cell molecule, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized as a transmembrane receptor. The CRTAM protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation and function of T cells. It is primarily expressed on activated CD8+ T cells and certain CD4+ T cells, where it is involved in processes such as T cell retention, activation, and polarity. The protein interacts with its ligand, Nectin-like 2 (Necl-2), facilitating critical immune responses, including cytokine production and T cell proliferation. CRTAM's involvement in immune signaling and its interactions with other proteins underscore its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential implications in various immune-related diseases (Rubinstein2013Functional; Takeuchi2009CRTAM; Yeh2008Regulation).

## Structure
The CRTAM protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its distinct structural features. It contains one Ig-like variable domain (Ig-V) and one constant Ig-like domain (Ig-C), along with a stalk, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail that includes a PDZ binding motif (VázquezMartínez2020Short). The Ig-V domain of CRTAM forms an antiparallel dimer, which is the only stable assembly in solution, involving 17 residues from each domain and stabilized by a network of four hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Rubinstein2013Functional). The dimerization mode is similar to that of nectin-like proteins, with a dissociation constant of approximately 10 mM, indicating a monomer-dimer equilibrium (Rubinstein2013Functional).

The CRTAM ectodomain shares less than 30% sequence identity with nectin/nectin-like family members, but its N-terminal Ig-V domain shares about 35% sequence identity with nectin-like proteins (Rubinstein2013Functional). The protein is not glycosylated, although potential glycosylation sites exist at N21, N45, and N85, with N45 being near the dimer interface (Rubinstein2013Functional). The structural analysis of CRTAM supports its classification within the nectin-like subfamily, highlighting its role in immune signaling (Rubinstein2013Functional).

## Function
CRTAM (cytotoxic and regulatory T cell molecule) is a protein involved in the regulation of T cell functions, particularly in the context of immune responses. It is predominantly expressed on activated CD8+ T cells and a subset of CD4+ T cells following TCR activation (Kennedy2000A; Yeh2008Regulation). CRTAM plays a crucial role in the retention and activation of CD8+ T cells within lymph nodes by interacting with its ligand Necl2, which is expressed on CD8+ dendritic cells. This interaction is essential for the development of effector cells and the retention of T cells in the lymph nodes, which is critical for effective immune responses (Takeuchi2009CRTAM).

CRTAM is also involved in maintaining T cell polarity and regulating cytokine production, particularly IFNg and IL22, through its interaction with the Scrib protein. This interaction is crucial for the polarization of T cells during the late phase of activation, influencing cellular proliferation and cytokine production (Yeh2008Regulation). CRTAM's role in T cell polarity and cytokine regulation highlights its importance in modulating immune responses and maintaining proper T cell function (Yeh2008Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CRTAM gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, CRTAM is associated with the induction of intestinal colitis. CRTAM+ CD4+ T cells are crucial for the efficient induction of inflammation in the colon, producing high levels of cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-17, which are key in colitis pathogenesis (Takeuchi2015CRTAM). 

In Crohn's disease, CRTAM has been identified as a novel hub gene associated with non-response to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) therapy. Alterations in CRTAM expression or mutations may contribute to therapy resistance, highlighting its role in the disease's pathology and treatment outcomes (Gorenjak2024SingleCell).

CRTAM also plays a role in asthma exacerbations, particularly in interaction with vitamin D levels. A specific nonsynonymous SNP, rs2272094, in the CRTAM gene has been linked to an increased risk of asthma exacerbations when vitamin D levels are low, suggesting a gene-environment interaction that influences asthma severity (Du2012Genomewide). 

These findings underscore the clinical significance of CRTAM in various immune-mediated conditions, where its expression and genetic variants can impact disease progression and treatment responses.

## Interactions
CRTAM (cytotoxic and regulatory T cell molecule) is involved in several protein-protein interactions, primarily with Nectin-like 2 (Necl-2). This interaction is characterized by a 'double-hole lock/double-lever key' mechanism, where specific residues on CRTAM form hydrophobic pockets that interact with Necl-2 residues. Mutagenesis analysis has shown that altering key residues on CRTAM significantly decreases its binding affinity to Necl-2, highlighting the importance of these interactions (Zhang2013Competition).

CRTAM can also mediate homotypic interactions, forming trans-type interactions at cell borders, as demonstrated in MDCK cells. It is capable of establishing both homotypic and heterotypic interactions, with Necl-2 serving as a known heterotypic partner (Garay2010CRTAM:). The interaction between CRTAM and Necl-2 is competitive, as Necl-2 binding prevents CRTAM homodimerization by occupying its homodimer interface (Zhang2013Competition).

In the context of immune responses, CRTAM's interaction with Necl-2 on tumor cells can induce cell death in activated Vg9Vd2 T cells, although it does not affect their cytotoxic activity or IFN-g production (Dessarthe2013CRTAM). This interaction is significant in tumor recognition and immune response, suggesting potential therapeutic implications (Dessarthe2013CRTAM).
