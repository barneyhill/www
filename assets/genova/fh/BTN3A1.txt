# BTN3A1

## Overview
BTN3A1 is a gene that encodes the protein butyrophilin subfamily 3 member A1, which is a type-I transmembrane protein involved in immune regulation. This protein is a member of the butyrophilin family and plays a pivotal role in the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, a subset of γδ T cells that are crucial for immune responses against infections and tumors. The protein structure includes an extracellular region with immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region containing a B30.2 domain, which is essential for binding phosphoantigens (pAgs) and facilitating T cell activation (Gu2017Phosphoantigeninduced; Karunakaran2023A). BTN3A1 can form homo- or heteromers with other BTN3A family members, such as BTN3A2 and BTN3A3, which is critical for its function in immune surveillance (Karunakaran2023A). The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, influencing prognosis and treatment responses in various cancers (Yang2022BTN3A1; Liang2021Comprehensive).

## Structure
BTN3A1 is a type-I membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. It consists of an extracellular region with two immunoglobulin-like domains: an N-terminal IgV-like domain and a membrane-proximal IgC-like domain, which are structurally homologous to the B7 superfamily of proteins (Gu2017Phosphoantigeninduced; Karunakaran2023A). The protein also includes a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region containing a juxtamembrane (JM) region and a B30.2 domain, which is responsible for binding phosphoantigens (pAgs) (Karunakaran2023A).

The B30.2 domain features a highly conserved, positively charged pocket formed by six amino acids, which undergoes conformational changes upon pAg binding (Karunakaran2023A). This domain is critical for the protein's function as a 'conformational sensor' that distinguishes between antigenic and non-antigenic small molecules (Salim2017BTN3A1).

BTN3A1 can form homo- or heteromers with other BTN3A family members, such as BTN3A2 and BTN3A3, which is essential for its function (Karunakaran2023A). The protein exists as V-shaped homodimers in solution, a conformation crucial for T cell activation (Palakodeti2012The). BTN3A1 is known to have splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and localization.

## Function
BTN3A1 is a crucial component in the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, a subset of γδ T cells involved in immune responses to infections and tumors. The protein encoded by BTN3A1 is part of the butyrophilin family and contains an intracellular B30.2 domain, which is essential for binding phosphoantigens (pAgs) such as (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate. This binding is necessary for the stimulation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, as it induces a conformational change in BTN3A1, leading to its redistribution in the cell membrane and recruitment of other molecules necessary for T cell receptor engagement (Sandstrom2014The; Rhodes2015Activation).

BTN3A1 interacts with the cytoskeletal adaptor protein periplakin, which is critical for transmitting activation signals to γδ T cells. This interaction occurs through a di-leucine motif in the BTN3A1 cytoplasmic tail, which is absent in other BTN3A isoforms (Rhodes2015Activation). BTN3A1 can also form heteromeric complexes with BTN3A2, which are important for the optimal activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells (Vantourout2018Heteromeric). The protein is primarily active in the cell membrane and plays a significant role in immune surveillance and response, particularly through the activation of γδ T cells (Rhodes2015Activation).

## Clinical Significance
BTN3A1 (butyrophilin subfamily 3 member A1) has significant clinical implications in various cancers due to its role in immune regulation. Alterations in BTN3A1 expression are associated with different prognostic outcomes depending on the cancer type. High BTN3A1 expression is linked to better prognosis in cancers such as breast, ovarian, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancer, as well as bladder urothelial carcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (Liang2021Comprehensive). Conversely, high BTN3A1 expression indicates poor prognosis in testicular germ cell tumors, brain lower grade glioma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), cervical cancer, and glioblastoma (Yang2022BTN3A1; Kone2024High; Liu2024BTN3A1).

In ESCC, BTN3A1 overexpression promotes tumor progression and radiation resistance by regulating autophagy, specifically through the ULK1 pathway (Yang2022BTN3A1). In cervical cancer, BTN3A1 contributes to Vγ9Vδ2 T cell exhaustion, impacting immune response and patient survival (Liu2024BTN3A1). BTN3A1 mutations, particularly in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, suggest a potential tumor suppressor role, as these mutations are distributed throughout the gene (Liang2021Comprehensive). BTN3A1's expression is also correlated with immune checkpoint expression, indicating its involvement in modulating the immune microenvironment (Liang2021Comprehensive).

## Interactions
BTN3A1 interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in immune regulation. It forms heteromers with BTN3A2 and BTN3A3, which are essential for optimal phosphoantigen (PAg)-induced activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. These interactions are facilitated by the juxtamembrane (JM) regions, which influence the stability and formation of BTN3A dimers. The KKK motif in BTN3A1, located at positions 283-285, destabilizes homodimers due to electrostatic repulsion, while heterodimers with BTN3A2 or BTN3A3 are stabilized by favorable salt-bridge interactions (Karunakaran2023A).

BTN3A1's B30.2 domain binds to PAgs, which is crucial for T cell activation. This binding induces interactions with BTN2A1, promoting T cell receptor (TCR) recruitment and activation. The interaction between BTN3A1 and BTN2A1 is enhanced by PAg binding, which acts as a ligand for the BTN2A1 intracellular domain (Karunakaran2023A).

BTN3A1 also interacts with specific antibodies, such as the 20.1 and 103.2 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), which bind to its V domain and affect its dimerization state, potentially modulating its activity in T cell activation (Palakodeti2012The).
