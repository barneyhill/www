# UNC119

## Overview
The UNC119 gene encodes the unc-119 lipid binding chaperone, a protein that plays a crucial role in cellular processes by facilitating the trafficking of myristoylated proteins. This protein is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich fold, which forms a hydrophobic pocket essential for its function as a lipid-binding chaperone (Jaiswal2016Novel; Constantine2012Uncoordinated). UNC119 is particularly significant in ciliary trafficking, where it ensures the proper localization of proteins necessary for ciliary function, especially in photoreceptor cells (Jean2017Coordinating; Wright2011An). It interacts with small GTPases, such as ARL3, and is involved in synaptic functions and immune cell signaling (Jean2017Coordinating; Constantine2012Uncoordinated). Mutations in the UNC119 gene have been linked to hereditary retinal diseases, including cone-rod dystrophy and macular dystrophy, underscoring its clinical significance (Zenteno2022Clinicalgenetic; HUANG2013Screening).

## Structure
The UNC119 protein, encoded by the UNC119 gene, is characterized by a conserved structure across metazoan species. Its primary structure consists of 240 amino acids in humans, with a gene structure comprising five exons (Higashide1999Characterization; Constantine2012Uncoordinated). The secondary structure includes an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich fold, which is crucial for its function as a lipid-binding chaperone (Jaiswal2016Novel; Constantine2012Uncoordinated). This fold forms a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates lipid moieties such as lauroyl and myristoyl side chains, facilitating the trafficking of myristoylated proteins (Constantine2012Uncoordinated).

The tertiary structure of UNC119 is highly complementary to its ligands, with the hydrophobic pocket lined by residues like phenylalanine and tyrosine, which interact with lipid-modified proteins through Van der Waals forces (Constantine2012Uncoordinated). The entrance to this pocket is located between specific beta strands, distinguishing it from similar proteins (Constantine2012Uncoordinated).

UNC119 proteins may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and have splice variant isoforms that can influence their function and localization. The protein is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the retina, where it localizes to photoreceptor synapses (Higashide1999Characterization).

## Function
The UNC119 gene encodes a protein that functions as a lipid-binding chaperone, primarily involved in the trafficking of myristoylated proteins within cells. In healthy human cells, UNC119 plays a critical role in ciliary trafficking, particularly in photoreceptor cells, where it is essential for the proper localization of transducin subunits to the ciliary membrane. This process is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of cilia, which are vital for cellular signaling and sensory perception (Jean2017Coordinating; Wright2011An).

UNC119 interacts with small GTPases such as ARL3, acting as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) to stabilize the GTP-bound form of ARL3. This interaction facilitates the transport of myristoylated proteins across the ciliary transition zone, a process known as lipidated intraflagellar transport (LIFT) (Jean2017Coordinating; Wright2011An). The protein also plays a role in vesicular trafficking by maintaining RAB11 in its active form, which is essential for the transport of vesicles to the ciliary membrane (Jean2017Coordinating).

Beyond ciliary functions, UNC119 is involved in synaptic functions in the retina and immune cell signaling, where it interacts with Src-type kinases to enhance cell survival and regulate neurotransmitter release (Jean2017Coordinating; Constantine2012Uncoordinated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UNC119 gene have been implicated in several hereditary retinal diseases, most notably cone-rod dystrophy and macular dystrophy. Cone-rod dystrophy is characterized by the degeneration of cone and rod photoreceptor cells, leading to symptoms such as reduced visual acuity, photophobia, and defective color vision. Specific mutations in UNC119, such as p.Asp87Asn and p.Glu201Ter, have been associated with this condition, which is often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (Zenteno2022Clinicalgenetic; HUANG2013Screening). 

UNC119 mutations are also linked to macular dystrophy, a condition that results in progressive central vision loss due to macular degeneration. The c.601G > T (p.Glu201Ter) mutation in UNC119 has been identified in patients with this condition, highlighting its pathogenic role (Zenteno2022Clinicalgenetic). 

In addition to retinal diseases, UNC119 is involved in immune system function. Alterations in its expression or interactions can affect the trafficking and activation of Src-type kinases, potentially leading to immune dysfunction (Jean2017Coordinating). Despite its involvement in these pathways, the rarity of identified patients with UNC119 mutations suggests possible compensatory mechanisms by its paralogues or its role in specific cell types (Jean2017Coordinating).

## Interactions
UNC119, also known as unc-119 lipid binding chaperone, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role as a myristoyl-binding protein. It interacts with myristoylated proteins such as nephrocystin-3 (NPHP3), facilitating their localization to the primary cilium. This interaction is dependent on the myristoylation of NPHP3, as mutations in the myristoylated glycine disrupt binding (Wright2011An). UNC119 also interacts with the small GTPase ARL3, which regulates the release of myristoylated cargo from UNC119, a process crucial for ciliary targeting (Wright2011An).

UNC119 binds to the transducin alpha subunit (Gαt), a component of the phototransduction cascade in photoreceptor cells. This interaction is dependent on the myristoylation of Gαt and involves the dissociation of Gαt from the Gβ1γ1 complex, suggesting a role in G-protein signaling (Cheguru2014The; Gopalakrishna2011Interaction). UNC119 also interacts with KRAS, a member of the RAS family, in a nucleotide-dependent manner, influencing the RASSF6-MDM2-p53 axis, which is significant in cancer biology (Shimizu2020The). These interactions highlight UNC119's role in protein trafficking and signal transduction.
