# MDFIC

## Overview
The MDFIC gene encodes the MyoD family inhibitor domain-containing protein, which is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in modulating transcriptional responses. This protein is characterized by its cysteine-rich C-terminal domain and a significant degree of intrinsic disorder, which facilitates its interactions with other proteins, such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and members of the RELT family. MDFIC plays a crucial role in influencing GR's phosphorylation and transcriptional activity, thereby affecting tissue-specific responses to glucocorticoids and the regulation of genes associated with inflammation and immune responses (Oakley2017Crosstalk; Cusick2020RELT). Additionally, MDFIC is implicated in cancer biology, acting as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer while being overexpressed in other tumor types, such as brain, gastric, and pancreatic cancers (Sui2020Opposite). Its clinical significance is further highlighted by its involvement in central conducting lymphatic anomaly and its potential impact on immune function (Weidner2024Case).

## Structure
The MDFIC protein, encoded by the MyoD family inhibitor domain containing gene, features a unique cysteine-rich C-terminal domain that is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Oakley2017Crosstalk). This domain is shared with its family member MDFI and is essential for binding to GR, influencing GR's phosphorylation and transcriptional activity (Oakley2017Crosstalk). MDFIC is predominantly cytosolic when expressed alone, but can co-localize with RELT family members at the plasma membrane, indicating potential structural flexibility (Cusick2020RELT).

MDFIC is characterized by a significant degree of intrinsic disorder, with approximately 60.2% of its residues predicted to be disordered. This intrinsic disorder is important for its multifunctional roles, facilitating protein-protein interactions and involvement in signaling and regulatory functions (Cusick2020RELT). The protein contains multiple phosphorylation and acetylation sites, which are concentrated within its intrinsically disordered regions, suggesting that these regions may undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding, crucial for its functional roles (Cusick2020RELT). MDFIC also exists in different isoforms, such as p32 and p40, which may contribute to its structural and functional diversity (Cusick2020RELT).

## Function
The MDFIC gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in modulating transcriptional responses, particularly in the context of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling. MDFIC interacts with GR in the cytoplasm, influencing the receptor's phosphorylation status and altering its transcriptional activity. This interaction is crucial for generating tissue-specific responses to glucocorticoids, affecting the regulation of genes associated with inflammation and immune responses (Oakley2017Crosstalk). MDFIC is involved in a negative feedback loop where glucocorticoids repress its expression, highlighting its role in modulating the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids (Oakley2017Crosstalk).

MDFIC is expressed in a tissue- and cell-type specific manner, with high levels in immune cells such as NK cells and monocytes, and lower levels in B-cells (Oakley2017Crosstalk). It is predominantly cytosolic but can co-localize with other proteins at the plasma membrane, suggesting a role in cellular localization and interaction with other proteins (Cusick2020RELT). The protein's interaction with the RELT family of proteins and its specific binding to GR indicate its involvement in signal-dependent processes, potentially requiring specific ligands or signaling molecules present in hematopoietic cells (Cusick2020RELT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MDFIC gene have been implicated in various diseases. In colorectal cancer, MDFIC acts as a tumor suppressor. It is generally downregulated in colorectal tumors, and its overexpression has been shown to inhibit tumor growth by upregulating the tumor suppressor gene HIC1, which is often silenced in this cancer type (Sui2020Opposite). Conversely, MDFIC is overexpressed in brain, gastric, and pancreatic tumors, suggesting it may promote tumorigenesis in these tissues (Sui2020Opposite).

A case report highlighted a mutation in the MDFIC gene associated with central conducting lymphatic anomaly (CCLA), which led to severe group A Streptococcus sepsis in a 13-year-old patient. This mutation is thought to affect immune function, contributing to the severity of the sepsis (Weidner2024Case).

MDFIC also interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), influencing tissue-specific responses to glucocorticoids. This interaction affects GR phosphorylation and transcriptional activity, impacting the regulation of genes associated with inflammation. Alterations in MDFIC expression can modulate glucocorticoid efficacy and side effects, suggesting clinical significance in immune suppression and inflammation management (Oakley2017Crosstalk).

## Interactions
MDFIC, or MyoD family inhibitor domain-containing protein, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. MDFIC interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the cytoplasm, forming a complex that dissociates upon glucocorticoid treatment. This interaction affects the phosphorylation status of GR, particularly at serine residues S203 and S211, which in turn influences GR's transcriptional activity and the regulation of glucocorticoid-responsive genes (Oakley2017Crosstalk). MDFIC also interacts with members of the RELT family, including RELT, RELL1, and RELL2, primarily at the plasma membrane. These interactions are confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and are suggested to play a role in hematopoietic cells and B-cell lymphomas (Cusick2020RELT).

In the context of cancer, MDFIC is downregulated in colorectal tumors and interacts with Jumonji C domain-containing 1A (JMJD1A), a histone demethylase involved in colorectal cancer. This interaction is part of a regulatory axis involving the HIC1 tumor suppressor gene, which is stimulated by JMJD1A and MDFIC, contributing to the growth-suppressive effects in colorectal cancer cells (Sui2020Opposite).
