# SREBF1

## Overview
SREBF1, or sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1, is a gene that encodes a key transcription factor involved in lipid metabolism. The protein product of SREBF1 is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of genes responsible for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and undergoes proteolytic cleavage to become active. This active form translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to sterol regulatory elements in the promoters of target genes, thereby modulating their expression. SREBF1 exists in two main isoforms, SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, which differ in their transcriptional activation potential and regulatory roles. The gene's activity is tightly regulated by cellular sterol levels, ensuring lipid homeostasis and preventing metabolic disorders (Wang1994SREBP-1; Eberlé2004SREBP; Hagen2010An).

## Structure
The SREBF1 gene encodes the sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1, which is involved in lipid homeostasis. The protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor of approximately 1150 amino acids, bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (Eberlé2004SREBP). The precursor is organized into three domains: an NH2-terminal domain of about 480 amino acids containing the transactivation domain, a region rich in serine and proline, and the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) region for DNA binding and dimerization; two hydrophobic transmembrane segments interrupted by a short loop projecting into the ER lumen; and a COOH-terminal segment regulatory domain of about 590 amino acids (Eberlé2004SREBP).

SREBF1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, which affect its stability and activity. Ubiquitination leads to degradation, while acetylation enhances stability (Hagen2010An). The protein is cleaved in the Golgi apparatus to release the mature form, which then enters the nucleus to activate transcription of lipogenic enzymes (Su2023Regulation).

SREBF1 produces two isoforms, SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, through alternative transcription start sites. These isoforms differ in their first exon, with exon 1a and exon 1c being specific to SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, respectively (Eberlé2004SREBP). SREBP-1a has a longer NH2-terminal transactivation domain, making it a more potent transcriptional activator than SREBP-1c (Eberlé2004SREBP).

## Function
SREBF1, also known as sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1, plays a crucial role in lipid homeostasis by regulating the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. It exists in two main isoforms, SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, which are produced from a single gene. SREBP-1a is a potent activator of both lipogenic and cholesterogenic gene expression, while SREBP-1c primarily regulates genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis (Shimano2017SREBP-regulated; Eberlé2004SREBP).

In healthy human cells, SREBF1 is synthesized as an inactive precursor bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Upon activation, it undergoes a two-step proteolytic cleavage process that releases its active domain, which translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, SREBF1 binds to sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoters of target genes, stimulating their transcription (Wang1994SREBP-1; Hagen2010An).

SREBF1 is involved in the regulation of cholesterol uptake and biosynthesis, as well as fatty acid metabolism. It activates the transcription of genes such as the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and HMG CoA synthase, which are essential for cholesterol homeostasis (Wang1994SREBP-1; Yokoyama1993SREBP-1). The activity of SREBF1 is modulated by sterol levels, with low sterol conditions promoting its activation and high sterol levels inhibiting its processing and nuclear entry (Wang1994SREBP-1). This regulation helps maintain cholesterol balance in cells and prevents metabolic disorders (Brown1997The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SREBF1 gene, which encodes the sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1, are associated with several genetic disorders. One such condition is autosomal-dominant IFAP syndrome, characterized by ichthyosis follicularis, atrichia, and photophobia. This syndrome results from mutations that impair the cleavage of SREBP1, preventing its activation and nuclear translocation, which reduces the expression of target genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. This disruption contributes to the clinical features of IFAP syndrome, including skin and hair abnormalities (Wang2020Mutations).

Hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia (HMD) is another disorder linked to SREBF1 mutations, specifically at the p.Arg557 mutational hotspot. This condition is characterized by chronic mucoepithelial lesions affecting hair, skin, and mucosae. The mutations affect a highly conserved amino acid crucial for the maturation of the SREBP1 protein, leading to the clinical manifestations of HMD (Chacon‐Camacho2020Exome; MoricePicard2020Hereditary).

Alterations in SREBF1 expression are also implicated in metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, due to its role in lipid homeostasis (Ferré2007SREBP-1c; Laudes2004Genetic).

## Interactions
SREBF1, or sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate lipid metabolism and cancer pathways. In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), SREBF1 forms a co-regulatory feedback loop with transcription factors TP63 and KLF5. This interaction is crucial for activating cancer-promoting pathways, such as the ErbB and mTOR pathways, and involves SREBF1 binding to approximately 500 genome loci specific to SCC cells (Li2021Interplay).

SREBF1 also interacts with phosphorylated ΔNp63α (p-ΔNp63α) in SCC-11 cells, forming protein complexes that are implicated in transcriptional regulation and chemoresistance, particularly in response to cisplatin treatment. These complexes include NF-YA proteins and are crucial for the transcriptional control of metabolic genes (Huang2012PhosphoΔNp63αSREBF1).

In the context of lipid metabolism, SREBF1 is regulated by mTORC1-mediated signaling. In zebrafish models, the deletion of SREBF1 leads to reduced lipid deposition, highlighting its role in lipid synthesis and deposition pathways. mTORC1, along with other kinases such as Cdk2 and Pkc, is critical in regulating SREBF1 through kinase-mediated phosphorylation (Sun2021A).
