# DNA2

## Overview
DNA2 is a gene that encodes the DNA replication helicase/nuclease 2 protein, a multifunctional enzyme involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and maintenance of genomic stability. The protein is characterized by its helicase and nuclease domains, which enable it to unwind DNA and cleave nucleic acids, respectively. DNA2 plays a pivotal role in the maturation of Okazaki fragments during DNA replication and is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. It also contributes to telomere maintenance and mitochondrial DNA integrity. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as replication protein A (RPA) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), facilitate its function in DNA metabolism. Mutations in the DNA2 gene have been associated with various human diseases, including cancer, mitochondrial disorders, and microcephalic primordial dwarfism, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Zheng2019Multiple; Pawłowska2017DNA2—An; Tarnauskaitė2019Biallelic).

## Structure
The DNA2 protein is a multifunctional enzyme with distinct nuclease and helicase domains. The nuclease domain features a PD-(D/E)XK motif and is structurally similar to nucleases like bacteriophage λ exonuclease and E. coli RecB, with a core α/β fold and an iron-sulfur cluster that supports a loop crossing over the catalytic channel, forming a tunnel for DNA threading (Mariotti2020The; Zhou2015Dna2). The helicase domain belongs to the SF1B family and is similar to RNA/DNA helicases of the Upf1 subfamily, comprising a stalk, β-barrel, and helicase 1A and 2A domains (Zhou2015Dna2). This domain translocates in the 5' to 3' direction and interacts with single-stranded DNA through phosphodiester and base groups (Zhou2015Dna2).

The protein's structure is cylindrical, with a central tunnel that accommodates single-stranded DNA, preventing double-stranded DNA from entering (Zhou2015Dna2). The helicase and nuclease domains are positioned such that the 5' end of the DNA is at the helicase domain and the 3' end at the nuclease domain (Zhou2015Dna2). The presence of an iron-sulfur cluster is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the DNA binding tunnel (Mariotti2020The). DNA2 may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing.

## Function
The DNA2 gene encodes a protein with both helicase and nuclease activities, playing a crucial role in DNA replication and repair processes in healthy human cells. DNA2 is involved in the maturation of Okazaki fragments during DNA replication, working alongside flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) to ensure proper lagging-strand synthesis (Pawłowska2017DNA2—An). It also plays a significant role in the response to replication stress by facilitating the restart of stalled replication forks, often in cooperation with Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase (WRN) and Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) (Zheng2019Multiple; Hudson2021DNA2).

In the nucleus, DNA2 is essential for DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination, where it resects DNA ends to produce single-stranded DNA overhangs necessary for repair (Zheng2019Multiple; Pawłowska2017DNA2—An). DNA2 also contributes to telomere maintenance by resolving G-quadruplex structures that can impede replication (Zheng2019Multiple).

In mitochondria, DNA2 is involved in long-patch base excision repair and the removal of RNA primers during mitochondrial DNA replication, working with DNA polymerase gamma to maintain mitochondrial DNA integrity (Zheng2008Human). Overall, DNA2 is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing replication stress, contributing to cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DNA2 gene are associated with a variety of human diseases. DNA2 mutations have been linked to several types of cancer, including uterine, stomach, bladder, and melanoma, where they often manifest as missense mutations in the nuclease and helicase domains. A recurrent frame-shift mutation, S779fs*6, is noted in stomach and uterine carcinomas (Zheng2019Multiple). DNA2 is considered a tumor suppressor, and its dysfunction can lead to genome instability, promoting cancer development (Zheng2019Multiple).

In addition to cancer, DNA2 mutations are implicated in mitochondrial disorders. Specific mutations such as R284H, K313E, and V723L are associated with mitochondrial myopathy, characterized by muscle dysfunction and multiple mtDNA deletions (Ronchi2013Mutations). DNA2 mutations also contribute to mitochondrial DNA maintenance defects, leading to conditions like mtDNA depletion syndrome (Sun2022DNA2).

DNA2 is also linked to microcephalic primordial dwarfism (MPD), a condition marked by reduced brain and body size. Biallelic variants in DNA2, including intronic and missense mutations, impair DNA2 transcript splicing and affect the ATP-dependent helicase domain, establishing DNA2 as an MPD disease gene (Tarnauskaitė2019Biallelic). These findings underscore the diverse clinical implications of DNA2 mutations and expression alterations.

## Interactions
The DNA2 protein is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA metabolism and repair. In yeast, DNA2 interacts with replication protein A (RPA) and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) to process long flaps during Okazaki fragment maturation. RPA recruits DNA2 to long RNA-DNA flaps, stimulates its nuclease activity, and coordinates its actions with FEN1 (Zheng2019Multiple; Zhou2015Dna2). In humans, DNA2 interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to process and restart stalled or collapsed replication forks (Zheng2019Multiple).

DNA2 also interacts with BRCA1, CtIP, and RecQ helicases during double-strand break (DSB) repair, enhancing its nuclease activity (Zheng2019Multiple). The 9-1-1 protein complex facilitates DNA2's function in resecting DSB ends, and DNA2 interacts with FANCD2, suggesting a role in the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway (Zheng2019Multiple). At telomeres, DNA2 interacts with TRF1 and TRF2, which is important for its localization and function in telomere end resection (Zheng2019Multiple).

In mitochondria, DNA2 interacts with mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (Pol γ) to enhance mtDNA replication and repair (Zheng2019Multiple). DNA2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including acetylation by p300 and phosphorylation by Cds1 and Cdk1, which are crucial for its function in replication fork processing and DSB end resection (Zheng2019Multiple).
