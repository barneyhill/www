# FLNA

## Overview
The FLNA gene encodes filamin A, a crucial actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in the structural organization of the cytoskeleton. Filamin A is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and is involved in crosslinking actin filaments into orthogonal networks, which are essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and stability. The protein serves as a molecular scaffold, interacting with a variety of proteins, including membrane receptors and signaling molecules, to coordinate cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and migration. Mutations in the FLNA gene are associated with several disorders, including periventricular nodular heterotopia and various skeletal dysplasias, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease (Feng2004The; Oda2015Exon; Stossel2001Filamins).

## Structure
Filamin A (FLNA) is a large actin-binding protein encoded by the FLNA gene located on chromosome Xq28. The protein is composed of 2647 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 280 kDa (Zhou2021The; Savoy2013The). The primary structure of FLNA includes an actin-binding domain (ABD) at the N-terminal, followed by 24 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like repeat domains, each about 96 amino acids long (Yue2013Complex; Savoy2013The).

The secondary structure of FLNA is characterized by β-sheets forming Ig-like domains, which contribute to its rod-like structure. These domains are organized into two major rod regions, Rod1 (repeats 1-15) and Rod2 (repeats 16-23), with a C-terminal domain (repeat 24) responsible for dimerization (Yue2013Complex; Nakamura2011The).

In terms of tertiary structure, FLNA folds into a V-shaped configuration, allowing it to cross-link actin filaments into orthogonal networks (Yue2013Complex). The quaternary structure involves dimerization through the 24th repeat, forming a Y-shaped structure that facilitates actin cross-linking and cellular structural support (Nakamura2011The; Savoy2013The).

FLNA undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can affect its resistance to proteolytic cleavage by calpain (Zhou2021The). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, differing by the deletion of 24 nucleotides coding for amino acids 1649-1656 (Savoy2013The).

## Function
Filamin A (FLNA) is a crucial actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton in healthy human cells. It crosslinks actin filaments into a dynamic three-dimensional network, which is essential for cell motility, shape transformation, and stability (Feng2004The; Stossel2001Filamins). FLNA acts as a molecular scaffold, interacting with over 30 different proteins, including membrane receptors and signaling molecules, thereby coordinating various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and migration (Feng2004The; Zhou2021The).

FLNA is involved in the formation of orthogonal actin networks at the leading edge of motile cells, contributing to cell movement and stability (Stossel2001Filamins). It also plays a role in intracellular signal transduction by interacting with receptors like somatostatin receptor 2 and dopamine receptors, influencing pathways that affect cell morphology and migration (Zhou2021The). Additionally, FLNA is essential for proper neuronal migration during brain development, particularly in the cerebral cortex, by regulating filamentous actin dynamics and interacting with membrane receptors necessary for cell adhesion (Feng2004The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FLNA gene are associated with a wide range of disorders due to its role in cytoskeletal organization. One of the primary conditions linked to FLNA mutations is periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH), an X-linked dominant disorder characterized by nodules of neurons along the lateral ventricles, often leading to seizures (Oda2015Exon; Valentin2021Filamin). In females, these mutations can also cause cardiovascular complications, thrombocytopenia, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-like symptoms, including joint hypermobility and skin hyperextensibility (Oda2015Exon). In males, FLNA mutations are often lethal, but rare survivors may experience severe cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications (Oda2015Exon).

FLNA mutations are also linked to skeletal dysplasia and otopalatodigital spectrum disorders, including Melnick-Needles syndrome and frontometaphyseal dysplasia (Sasaki2018A; Cannaerts2018FLNA). Additionally, these mutations can lead to lung diseases, such as childhood interstitial lung disease and emphysema, characterized by pulmonary vascular attenuation and hyperinflation (Valentin2021Filamin; Sasaki2018A). Cardiovascular anomalies, such as aortic aneurysms and valvular disease, are also prevalent among individuals with FLNA mutations (Billon2021Cardiovascular; Reinstein2012Vascular).

## Interactions
Filamin A (FLNA) is a versatile actin-binding protein that participates in numerous protein interactions, playing a critical role in cellular processes such as DNA repair, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization. FLNA interacts with BRCA1, a key protein in the DNA damage response pathway, facilitating efficient DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). This interaction is mediated by a conserved motif in BRCA1, and FLNA is essential for the formation of BRCA1 and Rad51 foci, which are crucial for DNA repair (Velkova2010Identification).

FLNA also interacts with components of the DNA-PK complex, including DNA-PKcs and Ku86, stabilizing their interaction and supporting NHEJ repair (Velkova2010Identification). In the nucleolus, FLNA suppresses ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene transcription by interacting with the RNA polymerase I machinery, including actin, TIF-IA, and RPA40, thereby regulating rRNA expression and cell proliferation (Deng2012Cytoskeletal).

FLNA's interaction with BRCA2 is crucial for the recruitment of RAD51 to DNA damage sites, enhancing HR repair efficiency (Yue2009The). Additionally, FLNA interacts with meckelin, a protein involved in ciliogenesis, highlighting its role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton and facilitating basal body positioning (Adams2011A).
