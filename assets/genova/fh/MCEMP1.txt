# MCEMP1

## Overview
MCEMP1 (mast cell expressed membrane protein 1) is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in mast cells, with significant expression in the lungs. The protein encoded by MCEMP1 functions as an adaptor molecule for the KIT receptor, playing a crucial role in mast cell proliferation and immune response regulation. It contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which is essential for its involvement in signal transduction pathways, including the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways. These pathways are vital for the expression of cytokines and chemokines, thereby promoting inflammatory responses. MCEMP1's interaction with the KIT receptor and other adaptor proteins facilitates stem cell factor (SCF)-mediated signaling, which is critical for mast cell growth and survival. The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stroke, asthma, and sepsis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Raman2016Peripheral; Choi2023Lungspecific).

## Function
MCEMP1 (mast cell expressed membrane protein 1) is a type II transmembrane protein primarily expressed in mast cells, particularly in the lungs. It functions as an adaptor for the KIT receptor, facilitating stem cell factor (SCF)-mediated mast cell proliferation. This interaction enhances KIT autophosphorylation and activation, which are crucial for mast cell growth and survival (Choi2023Lungspecific). MCEMP1 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that is essential for its role in signal transduction. Upon phosphorylation, MCEMP1 interacts with adaptor proteins such as Grb2 and SOS1/2, forming a signalosome that activates downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways. This activation leads to the expression of various cytokines and chemokines in mast cells, promoting inflammatory responses (Choi2023Lungspecific).

MCEMP1 also plays a role in amplifying KIT activity and downstream signal transduction in an ITAM-dependent manner, potentially functioning as an oligomer to enhance its signaling activity (Choi2023Lungspecific). In healthy human cells, MCEMP1's role is likely related to its function in mast cell proliferation and immune response regulation, particularly in the lungs (Choi2023Lungspecific).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MCEMP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), increased MCEMP1 expression is associated with poor outcomes. The gene is upregulated by TGFβ and plays a role in monocyte chemotaxis, adhesion, and migration, potentially contributing to the transition of monocytes to alveolar macrophages during pulmonary fibrosis development (Perrot2023MastCell).

In the context of stroke, elevated MCEMP1 expression in peripheral blood has been linked to increased disability and mortality. It serves as a potential biomarker for stroke prognosis, with higher expression levels correlating with worse outcomes (Raman2016Peripheral).

MCEMP1 also plays a significant role in lung inflammation and asthma. It functions as an adaptor for the KIT receptor, promoting mast cell proliferation. MCEMP1 deficiency in mice leads to reduced airway inflammation and improved lung function in asthma models, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of asthma and its potential as a therapeutic target (Choi2023Lungspecific).

In sepsis, MCEMP1 is part of a regulatory network involving lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-125, influencing immune responses and potentially serving as a target for treatment (Chen2019Silence).

## Interactions
MCEMP1 interacts with the KIT receptor, functioning as an adaptor to promote stem cell factor (SCF)-mediated mast cell proliferation. This interaction is significant for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including MEK, JNK, and ERK phosphorylation. The intracellular domain of KIT, particularly the JM-KD1 region, is critical for MCEMP1 binding, and this interaction occurs independently of KIT's kinase activity (Choi2023Lungspecific). MCEMP1 also interacts with adaptor proteins such as Grb2 and SOS1/2, forming a signalosome that activates the NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) within MCEMP1 (Choi2023Lungspecific).

MCEMP1 functions as an oligomer, potentially amplifying its signaling activity, and its ectopic expression increases KIT phosphorylation, enhancing SCF-mediated signaling (Choi2023Lungspecific). The protein's role as an adaptor in KIT receptor signaling is crucial for mast cell proliferation, as evidenced by the downregulation of genes and disrupted signaling pathways in MCEMP1-deficient cells (Choi2023Lungspecific). These interactions highlight MCEMP1's significant role in mast cell signaling and its potential impact on inflammatory responses.
