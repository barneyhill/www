# LSM12

## Overview
LSM12 is a gene that encodes the LSM12 homolog protein, which functions as a receptor for nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), playing a pivotal role in calcium mobilization from acidic organelles. The LSM12 protein is characterized by an N-terminal Lsm domain and a putative C-terminal anticodon-binding domain, which are essential for its function as a high-affinity NAADP receptor and its interaction with two-pore channels (TPCs) (Zhang2021Lsm12). This interaction is crucial for NAADP-induced calcium signaling, highlighting LSM12's role as a regulatory protein in this pathway (Zhang2021Lsm12). Beyond its role in calcium signaling, LSM12 is involved in maintaining nucleocytoplasmic transport by sustaining the RAN gradient, which is vital for cellular homeostasis and has implications in neurodegenerative diseases (Lee2020LSM12EPAC1). Additionally, LSM12 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcomes (ZHUANG2022LSM12; Zhuang2022Identification).

## Structure
The LSM12 protein is characterized by an N-terminal Lsm domain and a putative C-terminal anticodon-binding (AD) domain. The Lsm domain is crucial for its function as an NAADP receptor, mediating both NAADP binding and association with two-pore channels (TPCs) (Zhang2021Lsm12). This domain is predicted to form a highly conserved tertiary structure known as the Lsm fold, consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, which allows the protein to oligomerize into a ring structure capable of binding oligonucleotides such as adenine or uracil (Zhang2020Lsm12; Zhang2021Lsm12). 

The Lsm12 protein's interaction with NAADP and TPCs is essential for calcium mobilization from acidic organelles, highlighting its role as a regulatory protein in NAADP signaling pathways (Zhang2020Lsm12; Zhang2021Lsm12). The Lsm domain's interaction with NAADP and TPC2 occurs at different regions, indicating a complex binding mechanism (Zhang2020Lsm12). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it functions as a high-affinity NAADP receptor, essential for NAADP-evoked TPC activation and calcium release (Zhang2021Lsm12). However, specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The LSM12 gene encodes a protein that functions as a receptor for nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and plays a crucial role in calcium mobilization from acidic organelles. LSM12 is essential for NAADP-evoked calcium release, acting as a regulatory protein for two-pore channels (TPCs) involved in this process. In the absence of LSM12, NAADP-induced calcium signaling is abolished, highlighting its critical role in this pathway (Zhang2021Lsm12). The protein directly binds to NAADP with high affinity, facilitating the association of NAADP with TPC2, which is necessary for the activation of TPCs and subsequent calcium release (Zhang2021Lsm12).

LSM12 also plays a role in maintaining nucleocytoplasmic transport by sustaining the RAN gradient, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis. It posttranscriptionally up-regulates EPAC1, ensuring the correct distribution of RAN between the nucleus and cytoplasm. This function is vital for the transport of proteins and RNA across the nuclear envelope, and its disruption can lead to neurodegenerative processes (Lee2020LSM12EPAC1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LSM12 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In CRC, LSM12 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with the activation of the WNT/CTNNB1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for CRC cell proliferation and migration. Knockdown of LSM12 in CRC cell lines results in reduced cell growth, colony formation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in CRC pathology (ZHUANG2022LSM12). 

In HCC, LSM12 is overexpressed and associated with poor clinical outcomes, such as higher TNM stage and advanced histologic grade. It is linked to immune suppression, as higher expression correlates with lower infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells and increased expression of immune checkpoints like PD-L1, leading to therapeutic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapies (Zhuang2022Identification).

LSM12 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It plays a role in maintaining the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient, crucial for nucleocytoplasmic transport. Mutations or depletion of LSM12 can exacerbate neurodegenerative phenotypes by disrupting this gradient, highlighting its potential role in ALS and FTD pathologies (Lee2020LSM12EPAC1).

## Interactions
LSM12 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with ATXN2, a protein implicated in stress granule (SG) formation. LSM12 depletion leads to decreased ATXN2 levels, and overexpression of ATXN2 can partially rescue SG formation defects in LSM12-depleted cells, suggesting a stabilizing interaction between LSM12 and ATXN2 (Lee2020LSM12EPAC1).

LSM12 also plays a role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) pathway by interacting with components of the RAN-importin β1 complex. It promotes the association of RAN and importin β1 with the RANBP2-RANGAP1 complex at the nuclear pore complex, which is essential for maintaining the RAN gradient and NCT (Lee2020LSM12EPAC1).

In the context of calcium signaling, LSM12 acts as a receptor for nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and interacts with two-pore channels (TPCs), particularly TPC2. This interaction is crucial for NAADP-induced calcium mobilization from acidic organelles, highlighting LSM12's role as a regulatory protein in calcium signaling (Zhang2021Lsm12).

LSM12 is also implicated in colorectal cancer progression through its interaction with CTNNB1, a key component of the WNT signaling pathway. This interaction stabilizes the CTNNB1/LEF/TCF complex, thereby activating WNT signaling (ZHUANG2022LSM12).
