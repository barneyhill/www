# YPEL3

## Overview
YPEL3, or yippee like 3, is a gene that encodes a small, unstable apoptotic protein involved in critical cellular processes such as apoptosis and senescence. The YPEL3 protein is part of a conserved family of proteins across eukaryotic species, suggesting a fundamental role in cellular function (Hosono2004Identification). It is categorized as a zinc-finger protein-like structure, which may be involved in gene expression regulation. YPEL3 is a p53-regulated gene that plays a significant role in tumor suppression by inducing cellular senescence, a state where cells permanently cease to divide, thereby preventing the proliferation of damaged cells (Kelley2010YPEL3). The gene's expression is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, due to its role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis (Singh2020Exploring; Kim2020Frameshift).

## Structure
The YPEL3 protein is part of a highly conserved gene family across eukaryotic species, suggesting a conserved function. The primary structure of YPEL3 includes a consensus sequence shared with other YPEL family proteins, indicating a potential zinc-finger protein-like structure, which may be related to its function in gene expression regulation (Hosono2004Identification). The secondary structure analysis of YPEL3 reveals alterations in structural elements such as Turn, Coil, and Pi-helix, with the Pi-helix being absent in mutant proteins, potentially affecting protein function (Singh2020Exploring).

Post-translational modifications, including methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, are predicted to occur at specific residues, which may influence the protein's stability and function (Singh2020Exploring). The YPEL3 gene has two functional transcript variants, encoding proteins of different lengths, which may result in distinct isoforms with specific roles in cellular processes (Singh2020Exploring).

The tertiary structure of YPEL3 is not explicitly detailed, but the protein is described as a small unstable apoptotic protein (SUAP) that can induce apoptosis and is degraded by proteosomes (Singh2020Exploring). The quaternary structure is not mentioned in the available context.

## Function
The YPEL3 gene, also known as yippee like 3, is a p53-regulated gene that plays a crucial role in inducing cellular senescence, a state where cells permanently cease to divide. This process is a key mechanism in tumor suppression and is activated in response to cellular damage, such as DNA damage or oncogene activation, which requires a functional p53 signaling pathway (Kelley2010YPEL3). YPEL3 is expressed in response to DNA damage, leading to the recruitment of p53 to a DNA response element near the YPEL3 promoter, enhancing its transcription (Kelley2010YPEL3).

In healthy human cells, YPEL3 contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability by inducing senescence, thereby preventing the proliferation of damaged cells and acting as a tumor suppressor (Kelley2010YPEL3). The gene's expression results in decreased cell viability and increased cellular senescence, as evidenced by the induction of senescence markers such as increased acidic beta-galactosidase activity and the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) (Kelley2010YPEL3). YPEL3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it is involved in pathways that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis (Singh2020Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the YPEL3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. A frameshift mutation in YPEL3 has been associated with a rare human disorder characterized by peripheral neurological conditions such as hypotonia and areflexia. This mutation leads to a loss of function, weakening synaptic connections through presynaptic mechanisms, which may contribute to these neurological symptoms (Kim2020Frameshift).

In cancer, YPEL3 is recognized as a growth-suppressive protein that induces cellular senescence. Its expression is downregulated in several types of tumors, including colon, lung, and ovarian cancers, which may provide a growth advantage to these tumors (Kelley2010YPEL3; Tuttle2011SenescenceAssociated). In colon cancer, this downregulation is not due to DNA methylation but may involve histone acetylation (Tuttle2011SenescenceAssociated). In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) types, YPEL3 is repressed by estrogen, and its expression is induced by tamoxifen, suggesting a role in hormonal therapy (Tuttle2011Novel).

YPEL3 also affects the progression and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Zhang2016YPEL3). These findings highlight the clinical significance of YPEL3 in both neurological disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
YPEL3 interacts with several proteins and pathways, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It physically interacts with DOK7, a protein involved in neuromuscular junction formation, and co-expresses with 19 other genes, indicating its involvement in complex cellular networks (Singh2020Exploring). YPEL3 is also highly interactive with WDR26, with a combined interaction score of 0.716, suggesting a strong functional relationship (Singh2020Exploring).

In the context of cancer, YPEL3 is a p53-regulated gene that induces cellular senescence, functioning downstream of p53 signaling. It is involved in the p53 pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Kelley2010YPEL3). YPEL3's interaction with the p53 pathway highlights its role in tumor suppression and cellular senescence.

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells, YPEL3 modulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It affects β-catenin localization by reducing its nuclear presence and increasing cytoplasmic levels, thereby inhibiting β-catenin nuclear translocation. This interaction suggests that YPEL3 acts as a negative regulator of NPC metastasis through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Zhang2016YPEL3).
