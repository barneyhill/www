# SIX2

## Overview
SIX2 is a gene that encodes the SIX homeobox 2 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the Six family of homeodomain proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation and differentiation of the kidney and craniofacial structures. The SIX2 protein is characterized by its Six domain (SD) and Six-type homeodomain (HD), which facilitate specific DNA binding and interactions with other proteins, such as Eya proteins (Kawakami2000Six). Functionally, SIX2 is crucial for maintaining the self-renewal and multipotency of nephron progenitors, balancing their renewal with differentiation signals (Park2012Six2). It also contributes to the maturation of pancreatic β-cells and the proliferation of mesenchymal cells in craniofacial development (Okello2017Six2; VelazcoCruz2020SIX2). Dysregulation of SIX2 is associated with developmental disorders, including renal hypodysplasia and craniofacial abnormalities, underscoring its importance in normal organogenesis (Fogelgren2008Misexpression; Xu2022Six1).

## Structure
The SIX2 protein is characterized by two main domains: the Six domain (SD) and the Six-type homeodomain (HD), which are essential for specific DNA binding and interactions with Eya proteins (Kawakami2000Six). The HD is unique as it lacks two highly conserved amino acid residues typical of most homeodomains, potentially affecting its DNA binding properties (Kawakami2000Six). SIX2 consists of 291 amino acids and includes a conserved N-terminal and an acidic C-terminal structure (Wan2019Six2). The SD and HD of SIX2 are necessary for specific DNA binding to the ARE, a transcription regulatory element of the Na,K-ATPase a1 subunit gene (Atp1a1) (Kawakami2000Six).

The molecular structure of SIX2, like other Six proteins, includes these conserved domains, but specific binding characteristics may differ due to variations in the HD (Kawakami2000Six). The C-terminal domain of SIX2 is implied to play a role in its specific functions, although detailed structural information is not provided (Xu2022Six1). SIX2 is involved in regulating genes important for nephron differentiation, such as Fgf8, Pax8, and Wnt4 (Xu2022Six1).

## Function
The SIX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in kidney and craniofacial development. In the developing kidney, SIX2 is essential for maintaining the self-renewing, multipotent state of nephron progenitors. It balances self-renewal with Wnt signaling-directed commitment to regulate nephrogenesis. In the absence of SIX2, nephron progenitors prematurely undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition, leading to rapid depletion of these progenitors (Park2012Six2). SIX2 also plays a role in the differentiation and functional maturation of human pancreatic β-cells derived from stem cells. It is crucial for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, affecting both the dynamic phases of insulin release and the total insulin output. SIX2 operates alongside other transcription factors like PDX1, NKX6-1, NKX2-2, and NEUROD1, suggesting a complex regulatory network (VelazcoCruz2020SIX2). In the context of craniofacial development, SIX2 regulates the proliferation of mesenchymal cells in the developing palate, promoting cell proliferation and survival during embryogenesis (Okello2017Six2). These functions highlight the importance of SIX2 in maintaining progenitor cell populations and ensuring proper organ development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SIX2 gene are associated with several developmental disorders. SIX2 mutations are linked to renal hypodysplasia, a condition characterized by reduced kidney size and maldevelopment of renal tissue (Xu2022Six1). In Br mutant mice, misexpression of SIX2 is associated with frontonasal dysplasia (FND) and renal hypoplasia (RH), conditions that result from deficiencies in mesenchymal condensation. This misexpression leads to craniofacial deformations such as ocular hypertelorism, broad nasal root, and cleft nose and lip, as well as abnormally small kidneys (Fogelgren2008Misexpression).

In humans, a heterozygous deletion of the SIX2 gene has been identified as the cause of bilateral conductive hearing loss with ptosis. This deletion results in congenital ossicle malformation, including fusions of the malleus and incus, and myogenic dysgenesis of the levator muscle, leading to ptosis (Guan2016SIX2). The study of a Chinese family revealed that SIX2 haploinsufficiency contributes to these conditions, highlighting its role in craniofacial and auditory development (Guan2016SIX2). These findings underscore the critical role of SIX2 in normal craniofacial and renal development, with its dysregulation leading to significant congenital abnormalities.

## Interactions
SIX2 is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. In gastric cancer cells, SIX2 enhances stemness by directly binding to the promoter of the PFN2 gene, which is involved in actin dynamics and tumor progression. This interaction is part of a feedback loop where PFN2 stabilizes SIX2 mRNA by recruiting the RNA-binding protein YBX-1, activating the MAPK/JNK signaling pathway (Guo2024The).

In the context of nephron progenitors, SIX2 interacts with b-catenin and forms complexes with Tcf4B, a member of the Lef/Tcf family, which are primary binding partners for b-catenin. This interaction is crucial for regulating nephron progenitor self-renewal and differentiation (Park2012Six2). SIX2 also interacts with Hox proteins, such as HoxA11, and Eya1, a factor that modulates SIX2 activity, both of which are involved in nephron progenitor maintenance (Park2012Six2).

In renal cell carcinoma, SIX2 enhances stemness by binding to the SRR2 enhancer region of the Sox2 gene, promoting its transcriptional activity. This interaction is confirmed through ChIP-qPCR, demonstrating the enrichment of the SRR2 region in DNA pulled down by anti-SIX2 antibodies (Cheng2019Transcription).
