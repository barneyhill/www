# NDUFAF6

## Overview
NDUFAF6 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 6, which plays a critical role in the assembly of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is categorized as a peripheral membrane protein and is located on the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane. It is essential for the biogenesis and stability of complex I, a key component in cellular respiration and energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. NDUFAF6 is part of the squalene and phytoene synthase family, although it lacks the enzymatic activity typical of these enzymes due to the absence of necessary active site residues (Lemire2017Evolution; Elurbe2016The). Mutations in the NDUFAF6 gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome and other complex I deficiencies, highlighting its clinical significance (Kim2022NDUFAF6Related; BaideMairena2019Mutations).

## Structure
The NDUFAF6 protein, encoded by the NDUFAF6 gene, is involved in the assembly of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It has multiple isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, including Isoform 1 (v_1), a 38-kDa protein with a mitochondrial targeting sequence, Isoform 2 (v_2), which lacks this sequence, and Isoform 3 (v_3), which is truncated (Hartmannová2016Acadian). The mutation in the NDUFAF6 gene can lead to the production of truncated protein isoforms due to the creation of a novel splice acceptor site, resulting in alternative splicing and exonization of an intronic fragment (Hartmannová2016Acadian).

NDUFAF6 contains a squalene/phytoene synthase domain, suggesting potential enzymatic activity, although the active site residues necessary for this activity are absent, indicating that it may not perform enzymatic functions (Elurbe2016The). The protein's structure is affected by mutations that lead to complex splicing patterns and the production of various isoforms with different structural characteristics (Hartmannová2016Acadian). The absence of NDUFAF6 in mitochondria due to mutations results in defects in mitochondrial respiration and complex I biogenesis (Hartmannová2016Acadian).

## Function
NDUFAF6 is a crucial assembly factor for NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, also known as complex I, which is a key component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In healthy human cells, NDUFAF6 is involved in the biogenesis of complex I by facilitating the assembly of newly synthesized complex I from individual subunits and cofactors. This process is essential for maintaining the proper levels and activity of complex I, as the absence of NDUFAF6 leads to defective complex I assembly and rapid proteolysis of the ND1 subunit (Lemire2017Evolution).

NDUFAF6 is a peripheral membrane protein located on the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it ensures the stability and function of complex I, which is vital for energy production and metabolic pathways involving redox reactions with NADH (Lemire2017Evolution). The protein is part of the family of squalene and phytoene synthases, although it has evolved differences from these canonical enzymes (Lemire2017Evolution).

In the context of cellular respiration, NDUFAF6 specifically participates in the early stages of complex I assembly, which is crucial for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (BaideMairena2019Mutations). The presence of NDUFAF6 is necessary for the stability and activity of complex I, and its absence or mutation can lead to complex I deficiencies and associated diseases (Lemire2017Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFAF6 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, primarily due to its role in the assembly of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. One of the most significant conditions linked to NDUFAF6 mutations is Leigh syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative disorder. This syndrome is characterized by symptoms such as neurodevelopmental delay, regression, and various neurological impairments, including dystonia, tremor, and epilepsy. Neuroimaging often reveals symmetric necrotizing lesions in the basal ganglia and other brain regions (Kim2022NDUFAF6Related; Bianciardi2016Exome).

NDUFAF6 mutations can also lead to isolated bilateral striatal necrosis and progressive dystonia in childhood. These conditions are marked by neurological regression and basal ganglia dysfunction, with MRI findings showing lesions in the putamen and caudate nuclei (BaideMairena2019Mutations).

Additionally, a non-coding mutation in NDUFAF6 has been identified as a cause of the Acadian variant of Fanconi syndrome, which involves renal Fanconi syndrome, chronic kidney failure, and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. This mutation affects the splicing and intracellular distribution of NDUFAF6 isoforms, leading to complex I deficiency (Hartmannová2016Acadian).

## Interactions
NDUFAF6 is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and interacts with various proteins to facilitate this process. It has been shown to interact with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), as demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies, suggesting a role in sustaining mitochondrial functions and preventing myopathic and neurodegenerative phenotypes (Hartmannová2016Acadian). The loss of NDUFAF6 isoforms can lead to partial complex I deficiency and structural mitochondrial defects, affecting tissues with high energy demands (Hartmannová2016Acadian).

In breast cancer, NDUFAF6 is implicated in immune-related pathways and interacts with the NRF2 pathway. Increased expression of NDUFAF6 inhibits NRF2 accumulation, while inhibiting NDUFAF6 enhances NRF2 expression. This interaction affects the expression of PD-L1, a protein involved in immune checkpoint regulation, suggesting that NDUFAF6 may promote PD-L1 expression by inhibiting NRF2 (Jiang2024Impact). The study also highlights a negative correlation between NDUFAF6 and several anti-tumor immune cells and immune checkpoint genes, indicating its role in breast cancer immunotherapy by influencing immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression (Jiang2024Impact).
