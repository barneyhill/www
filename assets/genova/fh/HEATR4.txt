# HEATR4

## Overview
HEATR4, or HEAT repeat containing 4, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of HEAT repeats, which are tandemly repeated sequences often involved in intracellular transport processes. The HEATR4 protein is implicated in various cellular functions, although its specific roles remain to be fully elucidated. It is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in protein-protein interactions facilitated by its HEAT repeat domains. Research has highlighted the gene's potential involvement in several diseases, including polycythemia vera and primary open-angle glaucoma, through genetic variations and copy number variants (Pershad2024Variance; Lo2021Genomewide). Despite these associations, the detailed mechanisms by which HEATR4 influences these conditions are not yet fully understood, necessitating further investigation into its biological and clinical significance.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The HEATR4 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its genetic variations and interactions. In the context of polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative neoplasm, the rs35417585 variant near the HEATR4 gene interacts with the JAK2 variant rs59384377. This interaction affects platelet count and PV risk, with rs35417585 being associated with a reduced risk of PV among individuals carrying the JAK2 46/1 haplotype. This suggests a protective role against PV, potentially influenced by JAK2 V617F clonal hematopoiesis (Pershad2024Variance).

In primary open-angle glaucoma, HEATR4 is identified as one of the genes with significant copy number variant regions (CNVRs), indicating a potential role in the disease's genetic landscape. However, specific clinical implications of HEATR4 in glaucoma are not detailed (Lo2021Genomewide).

HEATR4 has also been noted in the context of Graves' disease, where it is mentioned as a gene with copy number loss in patients. The clinical significance of this finding in relation to Graves' disease remains unclear (Song2017Copy). Overall, while HEATR4 is associated with various conditions, its precise clinical significance requires further investigation.
