# DEFB126

## Overview
DEFB126 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 126, a member of the beta-defensin family known for its role in the male reproductive system. This glycosylated protein is primarily involved in enhancing sperm function and fertility by contributing to the sperm glycocalyx, a protective glycan layer on the sperm surface. Defensin beta 126 is characterized by its high degree of glycosylation, which imparts a negative charge crucial for sperm motility and interaction with cervical mucus. The protein's structure includes conserved cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds, essential for its stability and function. DEFB126 is vital for sperm maturation, capacitation, and protection from immunorecognition in the female reproductive tract. Mutations in this gene can lead to male infertility due to impaired sperm motility and morphology (Aram2019Betadefensin126; Tollner2008Macaque; Xin2016Lectin).

## Structure
DEFB126 is a protein characterized by a conserved β-defensin core and a C-terminal glycosylated peptide tail. The protein is highly glycosylated, with 17 to 20 potential O-glycosylation sites, particularly at the carboxyl terminus, which contributes significantly to its molecular weight and function (Xin2016Lectin). The glycosylation, especially the presence of sialic acid residues, imparts a high negative charge to the protein, which is crucial for its role in sperm motility and penetration of cervical mucus (Tollner2008Macaque).

The primary structure of DEFB126 includes six highly conserved cysteine residues that form three disulfide bonds, essential for maintaining the protein's stability and function (Aram2019Betadefensin126). The secondary structure typically involves an N-terminal alpha helical domain connected by disulfide bonds to a beta sheet, although specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of DEFB126 are not provided in the available context (hall2007characterization). The protein's glycosylation and disulfide bonds are critical post-translational modifications that influence its stability and function in the reproductive tract (Aram2019Betadefensin126; Xin2016Lectin).

## Function
The DEFB126 gene encodes a glycosylated polypeptide that plays a crucial role in the male reproductive system. This protein is adsorbed onto the sperm surface during epididymal maturation, contributing significantly to the sperm glycocalyx, a protective glycan layer that is essential for sperm function (Xin2016Lectin). DEFB126 is involved in several key processes that enhance sperm viability and fertility. It protects sperm from immunorecognition in the female reproductive tract, facilitates penetration through cervical mucus, and promotes attachment to oviductal epithelial cells (Santiago2024Bisphenol; Xin2016Lectin).

The protein's glycosylation, particularly its sialylation, is important for maintaining the negative charge on the sperm surface, which aids in the interaction with cervical mucus and enhances sperm motility (Xin2016Lectin). DEFB126 is also associated with sperm maturation and capacitation, processes critical for successful fertilization (Aram2019Betadefensin126). Mutations in DEFB126 can lead to reduced sperm motility and abnormal morphology, contributing to male infertility (Aram2019Betadefensin126). The presence of DEFB126 is positively correlated with normal sperm morphology and motility, indicating its essential role in male fertility (Aram2019Betadefensin126).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DEFB126 gene have been linked to various reproductive challenges, particularly male infertility. In humans, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DEFB126 are associated with infertility due to changes in sperm surface glycans, which affect sperm motility and the ability to penetrate cervical mucus (Solanki2022Analysis). The DEFB126 protein plays a crucial role in facilitating sperm penetration through cervical mucus by maintaining a high negative charge on the sperm surface, which is essential for interaction with mucin molecules in the mucus. Alterations in DEFB126, such as its removal during sperm capacitation, can significantly impede sperm movement through cervical mucus, highlighting its importance in fertility (Tollner2008Macaque).

In buffalo, the DEFB126 ortholog, BuBD-126, is implicated in sperm function and male fertility, with its expression being notably high in the distal segments of the male reproductive tract. This suggests a role in sperm survival and fertilization processes, although specific diseases or conditions directly associated with DEFB126 mutations in buffalo are not detailed (Batra2019Unusual). The gene's involvement in immune responses and its expression in both reproductive and non-reproductive tissues further indicate its broader functional significance (Batra2019Unusual).
