# KDR

## Overview
The KDR gene encodes the kinase insert domain receptor, also known as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), which is a critical receptor tyrosine kinase involved in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. This receptor is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells, where it mediates the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by promoting cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and survival. The KDR protein is characterized by its complex structure, including seven immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region and large insert sequences in its intracellular kinase domains, which facilitate its function as a transmembrane receptor (Waltenberger1994Different). Upon binding with VEGF, KDR undergoes autophosphorylation, triggering a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways essential for vascular development and maintenance (Yang2001Vascular; Kroll1997The). The gene's significance extends to various clinical contexts, including its role in cancer progression and congenital heart diseases, where mutations and alterations in KDR can have profound pathological implications (Glubb2011Novel; ŠkorićMilosavljević2021Rare).

## Structure
The KDR protein, also known as VEGFR-2, is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in angiogenesis. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes large insert sequences in its intracellular kinase domains (Waltenberger1994Different). The secondary structure of KDR includes seven immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular NH2-terminal region, which are crucial for its function in binding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Waltenberger1994Different).

The tertiary structure of KDR is characterized by its three-dimensional conformation, which allows for specific interactions with ligands such as VEGF. Upon ligand binding, KDR undergoes autophosphorylation, a common post-translational modification that activates its kinase activity (Waltenberger1994Different). This phosphorylation is more efficient in KDR compared to other receptors like Flt1, leading to significant changes in cell morphology and other cellular responses (Waltenberger1994Different).

In terms of quaternary structure, KDR functions as a dimer upon ligand binding, which is essential for its signal transduction capabilities (Waltenberger1994Different). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by potential splice variants, which may alter its functional properties.

## Function
The KDR gene encodes the kinase insert domain-containing receptor, also known as VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), which is a receptor tyrosine kinase crucial for angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. KDR is primarily active in endothelial cells, where it mediates the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by promoting endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Upon binding with VEGF, KDR undergoes autophosphorylation, activating multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation and DNA synthesis (Yang2001Vascular; Kroll1997The).

KDR plays a significant role in endothelial tube formation, a critical process in angiogenesis, by mediating cell migration, vacuolization, cell-cell junction formation, and cell elongation. This process is crucial for forming new blood vessels and maintaining vascular health (Yang2001Vascular). KDR also influences cell adhesion mechanisms through the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, and the assembly of vinculin in focal adhesion plaques, which are important for cell migration (Kanno2000Roles).

Gene knockout experiments have demonstrated that a null mutation in the VEGFR-2 gene results in the failure of vasculogenesis, leading to embryonic lethality, highlighting the essential role of KDR in vascular development (Yang2001Vascular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KDR gene, which encodes the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specific KDR variants such as Q472H are associated with increased microvessel density (MVD) and enhanced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, potentially affecting cancer prognosis and the efficacy of VEGFR-2 inhibitors (Glubb2011Novel). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), KDR is upregulated and acts as an oncogene, with anti-KDR agents being used in clinical therapy (Zhang2020Potential).

In primary mammary angiosarcomas (PMAS), KDR mutations are frequent, with the p.T771R hotspot mutation being particularly common. These mutations suggest a distinct pathogenesis for PMAS compared to other angiosarcomas (Beca2020Primary). In the context of congenital heart defects, rare KDR variants have been linked to Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Variants such as KDR-p.(Gly345Trp) and KDR-p.(Gly537Arg) result in decreased VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, contributing to the pathogenesis of TOF (ŠkorićMilosavljević2021Rare). These findings underscore the importance of KDR in both cancer progression and congenital heart disease.

## Interactions
KDR, also known as VEGFR-2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in angiogenesis and endothelial cell signaling. KDR interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which leads to its autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways. This interaction is crucial for mediating cellular responses such as mitogenicity, chemotaxis, and changes in cell morphology (Waltenberger1994Different).

KDR also forms complexes with other proteins, including members of the Src family, such as Fyn and Yes, which are involved in signal transduction. These interactions are ligand-dependent and contribute to the phosphorylation events that occur upon VEGF stimulation (Waltenberger1994Different). However, KDR does not appear to associate with PI3-K, a common signal transduction molecule for other receptor tyrosine kinases (Waltenberger1994Different).

In addition to its interactions with proteins, KDR's activity is modulated by transcription factors. The homeobox protein Hex interacts with GATA transcription factors to inhibit KDR-mediated VEGF signaling. Hex binds to GATA-2, preventing its activation of the KDR promoter, thereby reducing KDR expression and attenuating VEGF signaling (Minami2004Interaction).
