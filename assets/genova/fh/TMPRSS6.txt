# TMPRSS6

## Overview
TMPRSS6, or transmembrane serine protease 6, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane serine protease known as matriptase-2. This protease is primarily expressed in hepatocytes and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of iron homeostasis. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a serine protease domain, essential for its enzymatic activity (Escalante2021Structural; Ramsay2008The). TMPRSS6 functions by modulating the expression of hepcidin, a key hormone in iron metabolism, through its interactions with components of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor complex (Ganz2023TMPRSS6). Mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene are linked to iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), highlighting its clinical significance in disorders of iron metabolism (Finberg2008Mutations).

## Structure
TMPRSS6, also known as Matriptase-2, is a type II transmembrane serine protease characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of TMPRSS6 includes a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a serine protease domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Escalante2021Structural; Ramsay2008The). The protein features a short cytoplasmic amino terminal tail, a membrane-spanning region, and a stem region containing CUB and LDLR domains (Ramsay2008The). 

The serine protease domain of TMPRSS6 contains a conserved catalytic triad composed of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine, which is essential for its function (Escalante2021Structural). This domain also includes an SWG motif for substrate binding, and it cleaves after arginine residues but not lysine, distinguishing it from other similar proteases (Ramsay2008The).

TMPRSS6 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may influence its stability and function (Ramsay2008The). The gene encoding TMPRSS6 can produce multiple mRNA splice variants, resulting in different protein isoforms that may vary in their functional roles and localization (Ramsay2008The). These structural features and modifications are critical for the protein's role in iron homeostasis and its interaction with other proteins.

## Function
TMPRSS6, also known as matriptase-2, is a type II transmembrane serine protease primarily expressed in hepatocytes. It plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of hepcidin, a hormone that controls iron absorption and distribution in the body. TMPRSS6 functions as a negative regulator of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor complex, which is involved in hepcidin transcription. It interacts with hemojuvelin (HJV) and other components of the BMP receptor complex, acting as both an allosteric inhibitor and a protease that degrades these components. This interaction decreases SMAD1/5/8 signaling, leading to the suppression of hepcidin transcription, thereby facilitating iron absorption and release from stores (Ganz2023TMPRSS6; Mao2019The).

In healthy human cells, TMPRSS6 is synthesized as a zymogen and undergoes autocleavage for activation. It consists of a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular domain, which includes a stem region and a catalytic domain. The cytoplasmic domain acts as an intracellular iron sensor, while the transmembrane domain is crucial for activation at the plasma membrane (Mao2019The). TMPRSS6's proteolytic activity is essential for its function in suppressing hepcidin expression, allowing for adequate iron uptake from dietary sources (Du2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene are primarily associated with iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. IRIDA is characterized by microcytic, hypochromic anemia that is unresponsive to oral iron therapy but may partially respond to parenteral iron administration (Finberg2008Mutations; Pellegrino2012Two). The condition is linked to inappropriate hepcidin levels, which disrupt normal iron absorption and utilization (De2014Functional; De2010Novel).

Various mutations in TMPRSS6, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations, have been identified. These mutations often affect the serine protease domain of the protein, which is crucial for its function in regulating hepcidin expression (De2014Functional; De2010Novel). Specific mutations, such as W590R, have been noted for their prevalence in certain populations, suggesting a possible founder effect (De2014Functional).

In addition to mutations, polymorphisms in TMPRSS6, such as V736A, have been associated with variations in iron and hematologic parameters, potentially contributing to iron deficiency anemia that is partially responsive to oral iron therapy (Poggiali2015The). These genetic variations may influence the severity and expression of anemia symptoms (Hoving2022IRIDA).

## Interactions
TMPRSS6, also known as matriptase-2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in iron homeostasis. One of its primary interactions is with hemojuvelin (HJV), a co-receptor in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. TMPRSS6 cleaves HJV, which reduces its ability to activate hepcidin transcription, thereby influencing iron absorption and distribution (Béliveau2019Discovery).

TMPRSS6 also interacts with the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is involved in iron regulation. The protease can cleave and shed TfR1 from the cell surface, suggesting a role in modulating iron uptake (Dion2022Functionally).

In the context of cardiac function, TMPRSS6 interacts with the KCNE1 protein, a subunit of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 potassium channel complex. TMPRSS6 cleaves KCNE1, affecting the function of the channel complex and potentially leading to arrhythmias, particularly in iron overload conditions. This interaction modulates cardiac ion channel activity, impacting the electrical activity of pacemaker cells and cardiomyocytes (Peischard2024TMPRSS6).

These interactions highlight TMPRSS6's multifaceted role in both iron metabolism and cardiac function, with implications for diseases related to iron overload and arrhythmias.
