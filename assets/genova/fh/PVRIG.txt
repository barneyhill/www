# PVRIG

## Overview
PVRIG, or poliovirus receptor-related immunoglobulin domain-containing gene, encodes a protein that functions as an immune checkpoint receptor. This receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through its inhibitory effects on CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The PVRIG protein is a member of the nectin and nectin-like family and is characterized by its interaction with the ligand PVRL2 (CD112), which modulates immune cell activity and contributes to immune homeostasis. The protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) that facilitates its role in immune inhibition. PVRIG's unique interaction with PVRL2 distinguishes it from other immune checkpoint pathways, such as those involving TIGIT and CD96, and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy (Murter2019Mouse; Whelan2019PVRIG).

## Structure


## Function
PVRIG (PVR related immunoglobulin domain containing) is a protein that functions as an immune checkpoint receptor, primarily involved in modulating the activity of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. It is a member of the nectin and nectin-like family of proteins and interacts with its ligand, PVRL2, to exert its inhibitory effects on immune cells (Murter2019Mouse; Whelan2019PVRIG). This interaction is a distinct inhibitory signaling node, separate from the TIGIT-PVR pathway, and plays a significant role in immune modulation, particularly in the context of tumor-driven immune evasion (Whelan2019PVRIG).

PVRIG is expressed on the surface of CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells, and its expression is inducible upon activation of these cells (Murter2019Mouse). The protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its intracellular domain, which triggers inhibitory signals that modulate immune responses (Birnbaum2023PVRIG). By binding to PVRL2, PVRIG can suppress the cytotoxic function and cytokine production of CD8+ T cells, thereby contributing to immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity (Whelan2019PVRIG). This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining balanced immune responses and preventing excessive immune activation.

## Clinical Significance
PVRIG plays a significant role in cancer immunology as an immune checkpoint pathway, primarily expressed on T and NK cells. Alterations in PVRIG expression or its interactions can contribute to immune evasion by tumors. PVRIG binds with high affinity to PVRL2, an interaction that is immunosuppressive and correlates with T cell exhaustion markers such as PD-1 and TIGIT in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Murakami2024The). Blocking PVRIG has been shown to suppress tumor growth and enhance the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrating NK cells in mouse models, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Murakami2024The).

In cancer therapy, PVRIG is considered a promising target for combination therapies. The blockade of PVRIG, along with TIGIT and PD-1 inhibitors, has been shown to enhance the effector functions of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and NK cells, suggesting a synergistic effect in overcoming tumor immune evasion (Hansen2021COM902; Chiang2022TIGITCD226PVR). PVRIG's role in immune suppression is further highlighted by its competition with TIGIT and CD226 for binding to CD112, which can modulate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (Chiang2022TIGITCD226PVR).

## Interactions
PVRIG is an immune checkpoint receptor that primarily interacts with the ligand PVRL2 (CD112), forming an inhibitory signaling pathway that affects immune cell activity. This interaction is significant in modulating the function of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, contributing to immune regulation and potentially leading to the functional exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (Whelan2019PVRIG; Xue2024Characterization). PVRIG competes with DNAM-1 (CD226) for binding to PVRL2, and its blockade can enhance the cytotoxicity of T cells and NK cells against tumor cells (Xue2024Characterization). 

The interaction between PVRIG and PVRL2 is distinct from other pathways involving TIGIT and CD96, which also interact with ligands like CD155 (PVR) and PVRL2. PVRIG has a higher affinity for PVRL2 compared to TIGIT, indicating a unique and non-redundant role in immune inhibition (Whelan2019PVRIG). Blocking the PVRIG-PVRL2 interaction can reduce the inhibitory effects of PVRIG and enhance the activating effects of CD226, thereby restoring immune cell function and promoting antitumor immunity (Li2021Blockade).
