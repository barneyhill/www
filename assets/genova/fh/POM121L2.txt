# POM121L2

## Overview
POM121L2 is a gene that encodes the protein POM121 transmembrane nucleoporin like 2, which is a component of the nuclear pore complex. This protein is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, a critical process for the movement of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. As a transmembrane nucleoporin, POM121L2 plays a vital role in the assembly and function of the nuclear pore complex, influencing various cellular processes. The gene's expression and regulation have been linked to several clinical conditions, including airway hyperresponsiveness and cancer susceptibility, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Colombo2020Identification; Shang2013Epigenetic).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
POM121L2 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in nuclear pore complex assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Alterations in the expression of POM121L2 have been associated with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) induced by house dust mite exposure. In this context, POM121L2 is up-regulated and hypomethylated, suggesting its involvement in airway smooth muscle cell function and potentially contributing to asthma pathogenesis (Shang2013Epigenetic).

Genetic polymorphisms in POM121L2, such as the rs41269255 variant, have been linked to nausea and vomiting in opioid-treated cancer patients, indicating a potential role in modulating these side effects (Colombo2020Identification). This variant has also been associated with colorectal cancer in European populations, suggesting a possible involvement in cancer susceptibility (Jeon2023Comparing).

Additionally, POM121L2 has been identified in studies exploring genetic associations with schizophrenia, where it was found to be significantly associated with antibody responses to herpesviruses, highlighting its potential role in immune function and psychiatric disorders (martinez2019robust). These findings underscore the need for further research to elucidate the clinical implications of POM121L2 in various diseases.
