# CDCA8

## Overview
CDCA8, or cell division cycle associated 8, is a gene that encodes the protein Borealin, a critical component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). This complex is essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis, playing a pivotal role in stabilizing the mitotic spindle and ensuring accurate cytokinesis. Borealin, categorized as a regulatory protein, interacts with other CPC components such as Aurora B kinase, INCENP, and Survivin, forming a structure crucial for the complex's stability and function. The protein's dynamic localization throughout the cell cycle underscores its importance in cell division and embryonic development. Additionally, CDCA8 is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to certain therapies, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Bonner2020The; Wan2022Overexpression; Zhang2020CDCA8).

## Structure
CDCA8, also known as Borealin, is a protein that plays a critical role in the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), essential for chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis. The protein structure includes several distinct regions: an N-terminal region, a central disordered loop, and a C-terminal dimerization domain. The N-terminal region is involved in interactions with other CPC components such as Survivin and INCENP, and it also contributes to nucleosome affinity (Bonner2020The). The central loop interacts with nucleosomal DNA, with specific amino acid residues (110-188) being crucial for this interaction (Abad2019Borealin–nucleosome).

The C-terminal domain of Borealin forms a symmetric homo-dimer, which is vital for CPC dimerization and recruitment to chromosomes (Bonner2020The). This dimerization domain interacts specifically with the N-terminus of Sgo1, mediated by residues Asp 234 and Glu 235 (Bonner2020The). Borealin is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by CDK1 and MPS1, which regulate its localization and function during cell division (Zhang2020CDCA8). While the context does not provide detailed information on the primary, secondary, or tertiary structures, these domains and modifications highlight the protein's functional complexity.

## Function
The CDCA8 gene encodes Borealin, a crucial component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which is essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis. Borealin plays a significant role in stabilizing the bipolar mitotic spindle and correcting kinetochore-spindle misattachments, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and cytokinesis during cell division (Dai2015Transcriptional; Zhang2020CDCA8). In mitotic cells, Borealin is dynamically localized throughout the cell cycle, moving from pericentromeric heterochromatin in interphase to the central spindle microtubules during the metaphase-anaphase transition, and finally to the midbody during telophase and cytokinesis (Zhang2020CDCA8).

CDCA8 is also involved in meiotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during human oocyte meiosis. Its expression increases significantly at the MII stage of oocyte maturation, indicating its role in preparing oocytes for fertilization and mitosis. Depletion of CDCA8 leads to spindle formation defects, chromosome abnormalities, and prolonged polar body extrusion time, highlighting its importance in maintaining chromosomal integrity (Zhang2020CDCA8).

In addition to its role in cell division, CDCA8 is highly expressed in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells and early mouse embryos, suggesting its involvement in early embryonic development and the maintenance of pluripotency (Dai2015Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
CDCA8 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In prostate cancer, CDCA8 is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced cancer stages. Its high expression is linked to increased cell proliferation and migration, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Wan2022Overexpression). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, CDCA8 is upregulated and associated with shorter progression-free and overall survival. It is involved in cell cycle activation and immune pathway inactivation, impacting prognosis through immunoregulation (Jiang2022Cell).

In breast cancer, CDCA8 is upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant cell lines, contributing to resistance by promoting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis. Knockdown of CDCA8 increases sensitivity to tamoxifen, suggesting its role in drug resistance (Yu2019Cell). CDCA8 is also overexpressed in endometrial cancer, correlating with aggressive disease features, though it is not an independent prognostic factor (Unknownauthors2021Expressionandclinicalrelevanceofcelldivisioncycleassociated8(CDCA8)geneinendometrialcancerpatients page 1).

In bladder cancer, high CDCA8 expression is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with P53 and RB1 mutations. Its inhibition reduces cancer cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Gao2020Knockdown). CDCA8's role in these cancers highlights its significance in cancer progression and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CDCA8, also known as Borealin, is a key component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which includes Aurora B kinase, INCENP, and Survivin. This complex is essential for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis during cell division. Borealin interacts with Survivin and INCENP through its N-terminal domain, forming a triple helix-like structure that is crucial for the stability and function of the CPC (Bonner2020The; Gu2023Overexpression).

Borealin's C-terminal domain forms a symmetric homo-dimer, which is important for CPC dimerization and its recruitment to chromosomes. This domain specifically interacts with the N-terminus of Sgo1, a protein involved in spindle assembly, with a moderate affinity (Bonner2020The). The interaction between Borealin and Sgo1 is crucial for the recruitment of the CPC to chromosomes, promoting proper spindle assembly (Bonner2020The). Borealin can also bind to the PP2A phosphatase complex, which can simultaneously bind to Sgo1, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for Aurora B activity (Bonner2020The).

Borealin interacts with chromatin by binding to DNA and the acidic patch between histones H2A and H2B on the nucleosome core. However, this interaction alone is insufficient for CPC recruitment, which also requires histone phosphorylation by mitotic kinases like Haspin and Bub1 (Bonner2020The).
