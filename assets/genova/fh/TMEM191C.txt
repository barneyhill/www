# TMEM191C

## Overview
TMEM191C is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 191C, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is notably expressed in the granular cell layer of the olfactory bulb, implicating its potential role in olfactory processes (LachénMontes2020Smelling). Research suggests that TMEM191C may interact with neuropathological substrates, including amyloid precursor protein, Tau protein, and alpha-synuclein, which are linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (LachénMontes2020Smelling). Additionally, TMEM191C has been observed to be differentially expressed in response to certain chemical exposures, indicating its involvement in pathways related to axonal guidance signaling and ubiquitination (Oh2010Gene). Despite these findings, the specific biological functions and interactions of TMEM191C remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further investigation into its role in cellular signaling and response mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TMEM191C has been identified as a protein highly expressed in the granular cell layer of the olfactory bulb, suggesting its involvement in olfactory processes (LachénMontes2020Smelling). The study of the dark proteome in human olfactory areas indicates that TMEM191C may interact with neuropathological substrates such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), Tau protein, and alpha-synuclein, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (LachénMontes2020Smelling).

In a different context, TMEM191C was observed to be differentially expressed in TM4 mouse Sertoli cells following exposure to 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB). This study highlighted the gene's involvement in pathways related to axonal guidance signaling and ubiquitination, although specific protein interactions were not detailed (Oh2010Gene).

While TMEM191C's specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature, its expression patterns and potential involvement in significant biological pathways suggest it may play a role in cellular signaling and response mechanisms. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise interactions and functions of TMEM191C in various biological contexts.
