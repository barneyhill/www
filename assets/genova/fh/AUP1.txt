# AUP1

## Overview
AUP1 (Ancient Ubiquitous Protein 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in lipid metabolism and protein quality control within cells. The protein, known as AUP1 lipid droplet regulating VLDL assembly factor, is characterized by its monotopic membrane topology and is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs) (Spandl2011Ancient; Stevanovic2013Monotopic). It plays a critical role in the assembly and secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles by interacting with apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB100) and facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation (Zhang2017AUP1). AUP1 also recruits ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to LDs, aiding in the degradation of misfolded proteins and maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Zhang2017AUP1). The protein's involvement in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and its interactions with various proteins underscore its significance in cellular lipid and protein balance (Smith2021A; Frachon2024AUP1). Additionally, alterations in AUP1 expression have been linked to cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2024AUP1; Chang2023Ancient).

## Structure
AUP1 is a highly conserved protein composed of 410 amino acids, featuring several distinct domains that contribute to its function and localization. The protein includes a long hydrophobic stretch, an acyltransferase domain with three conserved motifs, a CUE domain, and a G2BR domain (Spandl2011Ancient). The CUE domain is involved in binding ubiquitin, promoting intramolecular mono-ubiquitination, while the G2BR domain binds to the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2G2, playing a crucial role in ubiquitination processes (Spandl2011Ancient; Smith2021A).

AUP1 is characterized by a monotopic membrane topology, with both the N and C termini facing the cytoplasm, suggesting a hairpin-like insertion into membranes (Spandl2011Ancient; Stevanovic2013Monotopic). The N-terminal region, including the hydrophobic sequence, is essential for its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs) (Stevanovic2013Monotopic). The presence of a proline-valine-glycine (PVG) motif within the hydrophobic domain is critical for maintaining this monotopic topology and LD localization (Stevanovic2013Monotopic).

Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation may influence AUP1's function and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context.

## Function
AUP1 (Ancient Ubiquitous Protein 1) is a crucial protein involved in lipid metabolism and protein quality control within human cells. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and on the surface of lipid droplets (LDs), where it plays a significant role in the assembly and secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. AUP1 interacts directly with apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB100), a key component of VLDL, influencing its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is enhanced under conditions of proteasomal inhibition, suggesting a role in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Zhang2017AUP1).

AUP1 also recruits ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to the surface of LDs, facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins and maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Zhang2017AUP1). In the context of NKCC2 cotransporter regulation, AUP1 promotes polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, highlighting its role in protein homeostasis and cellular signaling (Frachon2024AUP1).

Through these molecular activities, AUP1 influences lipid mobilization, intracellular lipid storage, and the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism, contributing to the maintenance of cellular lipid and protein balance (Zhang2017AUP1; Murthy2016A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AUP1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including glioma and cervical cancer. In glioma, AUP1 is identified as a prognostic biomarker, with increased expression correlating with higher tumor grades and poorer prognosis. It is associated with TP53 mutations and inflamed microenvironments, influencing tumor proliferation and genomic instability (Chang2023Ancient). AUP1 expression is linked to cell proliferation pathways and immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Chang2023Ancient).

In cervical cancer, AUP1 is significantly upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It is transcriptionally activated by KDM5B, promoting malignant behaviors such as increased proliferation and migration. AUP1 also plays a role in lipid metabolism reprogramming, which is crucial for cancer progression. Interference with AUP1 expression in cervical cancer cells inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2024AUP1).

These findings suggest that AUP1's involvement in lipid metabolism and its interactions with specific signaling pathways contribute to its role in cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in these malignancies.

## Interactions
AUP1 (Ancient Ubiquitous Protein 1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. AUP1 interacts with the integrin αIIbβ3 complex in platelets, forming a constitutive complex with Syk and Src proteins. This interaction is important for maintaining integrin αIIbβ3 in an inactive state, with AUP1 acting as an adaptor protein that recruits Syk to the integrin cytoplasmic tails (Kato2009Ancient).

In the context of ER-associated degradation (ERAD), AUP1 interacts with the E2 enzyme UBE2G2 through its UBE2G2 Binding Region (G2BR). This interaction is essential for the degradation of various substrates, highlighting AUP1's role in the ERAD pathway. The binding involves salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions, which are crucial for the stability and function of the AUP1-UBE2G2 complex (Smith2021A).

AUP1 also plays a role in the degradation of the NKCC2 cotransporter by promoting its polyubiquitination and interaction with the ERAD machinery, including the Hrd1-SEL1L ubiquitin ligase complex and the ER lectin OS9. This interaction facilitates the degradation of NKCC2, affecting its stability and maturation (Frachon2024AUP1).
