# C11orf87

## Overview
C11orf87, also known as neuronal integral membrane protein 1 (NEURIM1), is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein product of C11orf87 is categorized as an integral membrane protein, suggesting its role in cellular signaling and interaction networks. It has been implicated in several biological contexts, including its interaction with microRNAs in tuberculosis-infected macrophages and its association with piRNAs in Alzheimer's disease, indicating a potential regulatory function involving nucleic acids (Qiu2017Transcriptomewide; Niu2020Suppression). Additionally, C11orf87 has been identified as a potential biomarker in gastrointestinal cancers due to its methylation status, which correlates with tumor grade and patient survival (Tran2021Methylomic). The gene is also differentially expressed in schizophrenia, suggesting its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders (Etemadikhah2020Transcriptome).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
C11orf87 has been identified as a potential biomarker in various diseases, particularly in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. In gastric cancer, higher methylation levels of C11orf87 are associated with higher tumor grades and better overall survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker. The methylation status of C11orf87 can distinguish gastric cancer from non-cancerous conditions with a sensitivity of 72.6% and specificity of 87.5%, which increases to 98.4% when combined with external datasets (Tran2021Methylomic). This gene's hypermethylation is also observed in other GI cancers, indicating its broader potential as a biomarker for these cancers (Tran2021Methylomic).

In the context of schizophrenia, C11orf87 is differentially expressed in fibroblasts from patients, suggesting its involvement in the disorder's pathophysiology. It is one of the genes identified in genome-wide association studies linked to schizophrenia, highlighting its potential role in neuropsychiatric conditions (Etemadikhah2020Transcriptome).

C11orf87 is also implicated in tuberculosis, where its interaction with miR-147b affects the viability of infected macrophages. Suppression of miR-147b enhances cell viability, while knockdown of C11orf87 reduces it, indicating a potential therapeutic target in TB treatment (Niu2020Suppression).

## Interactions
C11orf87, also known as neuronal integral membrane protein 1 (NEURIM1), is involved in various cellular interactions. In the context of tuberculosis-infected macrophages, C11orf87 interacts with miR-147b. This interaction was confirmed through a luciferase reporter assay, which demonstrated that miR-147b can directly bind to the wild type of C11orf87, but not to its mutant form. The suppression of miR-147b was shown to increase the viability of H37Rv-infected THP-1 cells, while knockdown of C11orf87 decreased cell viability, indicating a functional interaction between miR-147b and C11orf87 (Niu2020Suppression).

C11orf87 is also mentioned in the context of protein-protein interactions. It has been identified to have binary interactions with C1orf112, as part of a broader study on the subinteractomes of various ORF proteins. This study identified numerous unique protein-protein interactions, suggesting that C11orf87 may participate in complex interaction networks (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

In Alzheimer's disease research, C11orf87 is associated with piRNAs, specifically DQ597974, which is expressed at higher levels in Alzheimer's cases. This suggests a potential regulatory role involving nucleic acids (Qiu2017Transcriptomewide).
