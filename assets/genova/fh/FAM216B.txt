# FAM216B

## Overview
FAM216B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 216 member B. This protein is involved in various biological processes, although its precise functions are not fully elucidated. It has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including its significant upregulation in atrial fibrillation, suggesting a role in cardiovascular pathophysiology (Fan2020Identification). Additionally, FAM216B is involved in pathways related to immune responses and the renin-angiotensin system, which may contribute to inflammatory processes (Fan2020Identification). The gene's expression is also modulated in lung tissues, where it is downregulated in ex vivo lung perfusion samples and upregulated during the maturation of the respiratory epithelium in mice, indicating a potential role in respiratory cell differentiation (Stauber2017Identification; Baciu2020Transcriptomic). Furthermore, FAM216B has been associated with viral gene clustering, particularly with the bat MERS-like virus, suggesting possible interactions that could influence viral infections (Maldonado2021Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
FAM216B has been implicated in several conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In the context of atrial fibrillation (AF), FAM216B is significantly upregulated, with a log fold change of 1.397223, suggesting its potential involvement in the pathophysiology of AF. The gene is enriched in pathways related to the intestinal immune network for IgA production, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and the renin-angiotensin system, which may contribute to AF's inflammatory processes (Fan2020Identification).

In lung transplant studies, FAM216B is downregulated in ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) samples, although the clinical significance of this finding is not fully detailed (Baciu2020Transcriptomic). Additionally, FAM216B has been identified as upregulated during the maturation of the respiratory epithelium in mice, indicating a possible role in the differentiation of motile ciliated cells, although its exact function remains unknown (Stauber2017Identification).

FAM216B has also been associated with viral gene clustering, particularly with the bat MERS-like virus, suggesting potential interactions that could influence viral infections, though the clinical implications of this association are not specified (Maldonado2021Molecular).
