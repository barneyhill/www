# SERPINA4

## Overview
SERPINA4 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family A member 4, commonly known as kallistatin. Kallistatin is a member of the serpin superfamily, which is characterized by its function as a serine protease inhibitor (Law2006Anoverviewoftheserpinsuperfamily). This protein plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including blood pressure and vascular homeostasis, by inhibiting tissue kallikrein and reducing bradykinin production (Nallagangula2017Cirrhosis). Kallistatin exhibits antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antioxidative properties, making it significant in the prevention of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetic retinopathy (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative). The protein is primarily expressed in the liver and functions as an extracellular protein, with its activity influenced by post-translational modifications like glycosylation (Nallagangula2017Cirrhosis). Despite its well-characterized interactions, the complexity of its protease-inhibitor relationships continues to be a subject of research (Fortelny2017ProteaseInhibitor).

## Structure
SERPINA4, also known as kallistatin, is a member of the serpin superfamily, characterized by its role as a serine protease inhibitor. The primary structure of SERPINA4 consists of a single polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are typical features of serpins (Nallagangula2017Cirrhosis). The tertiary structure of SERPINA4 forms a conserved serpin fold, essential for its inhibitory function. This protein is an acidic glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 58 kD and an isoelectric pH range of 4.6 to 5.2, indicating its glycosylated nature (Nallagangula2017Cirrhosis). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common in SERPINA4, contributing to its stability and function. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its activity and interactions. SERPINA4 is expressed primarily in the liver and is involved in various physiological processes, including antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antioxidative activities (Nallagangula2017Cirrhosis). The absence of quaternary structure information suggests that SERPINA4 functions as a monomer.

## Function
SERPINA4 encodes kallistatin, a serine protease inhibitor that plays a significant role in regulating various physiological processes in healthy human cells. Kallistatin is primarily known for its ability to inhibit tissue kallikrein, which in turn reduces the production of bradykinin, a peptide responsible for vasodilation. This inhibition contributes to the regulation of blood pressure and vascular homeostasis (Nallagangula2017Cirrhosis; Law2006Anoverviewoftheserpinsuperfamily).

Kallistatin is an extracellular protein that exhibits antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antioxidative properties. These functions are crucial in preventing diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis. In the cardiovascular system, kallistatin helps mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation, particularly following cardiac injury, and its reduced levels are associated with adverse outcomes in coronary artery disease (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative).

In the context of eye health, kallistatin is involved in maintaining retinal health by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby reducing retinal angiogenesis, which is particularly relevant in conditions like diabetic retinopathy (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative). Overall, kallistatin's diverse roles in cellular and organismal processes underscore its importance in maintaining physiological balance and preventing disease.

## Clinical Significance
SERPINA4, also known as kallistatin, is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In eye diseases, a decrease in SERPINA4 expression is associated with diabetic retinopathy, highlighting its role in maintaining retinal health by potentially inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and reducing retinal angiogenesis (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative). In cardiovascular diseases, reduced levels of SERPINA4 are linked to poorer outcomes in coronary artery disease patients, as it may help inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation following cardiac injury (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative). 

In renal pathologies, SERPINA4 gene transfer into the kidneys of db/db obese mice has been shown to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis, while also attenuating tubular damage and fibrosis, suggesting its protective role in kidney health (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative). Despite high expression of kallistatin in the liver, studies have not identified new targets among serum proteases, indicating the complexity of predicting protease-inhibitor interactions and the challenges in identifying novel interactions with well-studied proteins like kallistatin (Fortelny2017ProteaseInhibitor). Overall, SERPINA4's involvement in these conditions underscores its clinical significance in regulating angiogenesis and inflammation.

## Interactions
SERPINA4, also known as kallistatin, is a serine protease inhibitor that primarily interacts with tissue kallikrein, inhibiting its activity. This interaction is significant in regulating blood pressure and inflammation (Nallagangula2017Cirrhosis). In the context of eye diseases, SERPINA4 is proposed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby attenuating retinal angiogenesis through interaction with VEGF receptors. This suggests a regulatory role in ocular neovascularization (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative).

In cardiovascular diseases, SERPINA4 is noted for its ability to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation following cardiac injury. Its reduced levels in coronary artery disease patients are associated with poorer outcomes, and its depletion exacerbates aortic injury by promoting senescence, oxidative stress, and inflammation. There is also a suggestion of SERPINA4's involvement in the VEGF pathway in cardiovascular contexts, although this requires further investigation (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative).

Despite efforts to predict novel protease-inhibitor interactions involving SERPINA4, no new targets were identified among the proteases tested, such as factor XI, factor XII, and plasma kallikrein (Fortelny2017ProteaseInhibitor). This highlights the complexity of protein-protein interactions and the challenges in predicting novel interactions.
