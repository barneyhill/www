# IMMP2L

## Overview
The IMMP2L gene encodes the inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase subunit 2, a crucial component of the mitochondrial intermembrane space protease complex. This protein is involved in the processing and maturation of mitochondrial proteins, playing a significant role in cellular metabolism and apoptosis regulation. As a mitochondrial peptidase, IMMP2L is essential for the activation of proteins such as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and apoptosis-inducing factor, which are vital for maintaining metabolic balance and initiating programmed cell death under stress conditions (Yuan2018Switching). The gene's function is critical for mitochondrial integrity and cellular homeostasis, and its mutations have been linked to various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Gimelli2014Interstitial; Bertelsen2014Intragenic).

## Function
The human gene IMMP2L encodes a mitochondrial intermembrane peptidase that plays a crucial role in processing mitochondrial proteins, such as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD2) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Yuan2018Switching). In healthy cells, IMMP2L is involved in the pre-sequence cleavage that activates GPD2, which is essential for maintaining metabolic fitness. This activation enables a redox reaction that produces glycerol 3-phosphate, a phospholipid precursor necessary for cell membrane synthesis and regulation of phospholipid-binding kinase pathways (Yuan2018Switching). The IMMP2L-GPD2 axis is crucial for maintaining the metabolic activity of healthy cells (Yuan2018Switching).

IMMP2L also processes AIF into its pro-apoptotic form, which is important for initiating cell death in response to oxidative stress, thereby maintaining cell and tissue homeostasis (Yuan2018Switching). Under oxidative stress, IMMP2L facilitates the conversion of mature AIF (mAIF) to its truncated pro-apoptotic form (tAIF), leading to cell death (Yuan2018Switching). This dual role of IMMP2L in healthy cells involves maintaining mitochondrial functionality and regulating the balance between cell survival and apoptosis, contributing to tissue homeostasis and the aging process (Yuan2018Switching).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IMMP2L gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Intragenic deletions in IMMP2L are associated with Tourette syndrome (TS), with a higher prevalence of these deletions in TS patients compared to the general population (Bertelsen2014Intragenic). These deletions may act as genetic risk factors in TS pathogenesis, although they are not fully penetrant, as they are also found in unaffected individuals (Bertelsen2014Intragenic). The gene has also been linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), suggesting a shared genetic factor among these conditions (Gimelli2014Interstitial).

IMMP2L deletions can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to the development of these disorders. The gene's involvement in mitochondrial processes means that its disruption can result in increased superoxide production and activation of cell death pathways, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioral disorders (Baldan2018Genomic). Studies have also shown that IMMP2L deletions can affect the expression of nearby genes, possibly due to changes in chromatin conformation, which may further contribute to the observed phenotypes (Vasilyev2021Differential).

## Interactions
IMMP2L, a mitochondrial inner membrane peptidase, is involved in a variety of protein interactions within the mitochondrial intermembrane space. It is known to form a dimeric protease complex with IMMP1L, sharing 89 interactors, which suggests both overlapping and unique interactomes for these proteases (Botham2019Global). IMMP2L has been identified to have 243 high-confidence interactors, making it one of the proteases with the most interactions in the study conducted by Botham et al. (Botham2019Global). The interactomes of IMS proteases, including IMMP2L, are enriched in mitochondrial membrane proteins, with 168 interactors annotated as components of the mitochondrial membrane (Botham2019Global).

The study utilized proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to map these interactions, which was validated by FLAG immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP-MS), confirming 24 interactions (Botham2019Global). This comprehensive dataset provides insights into the roles of IMS proteases in mitochondrial function, highlighting the importance of IMMP2L in mitochondrial protein maturation and dynamics. The interactions identified for IMMP2L suggest its significant role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function through its involvement in processing proteins targeted to the mitochondria.
