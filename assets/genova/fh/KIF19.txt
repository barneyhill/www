# KIF19

## Overview
KIF19 is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 19, which is part of the kinesin superfamily of motor proteins. These proteins are integral to intracellular transport and are known for their role in microtubule dynamics. Kinesin family member 19, specifically, is categorized as a kinesin motor protein and is involved in the regulation of microtubule length, particularly within ciliated cells. This protein exhibits both stabilizing and depolymerizing activities on microtubules, which are essential for maintaining the proper function and length of cilia, thereby influencing cellular signaling and motility (Eisenberg2020The; Locke2017Structural). The gene's expression and function are critical for cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation is implicated in various clinical conditions, including ciliopathies and cancer (Niwa2012KIF19A; Eisenberg2020The).

## Function
KIF19 is a kinesin motor protein that plays a significant role in regulating microtubule dynamics, particularly in ciliated cells. It localizes to the nucleus and peripheral microtubules, with a concentration gradient along microtubules, accumulating at their plus-ends. This localization is characteristic of kinesin-8 family members and relies on the kinesin's C-terminal tail and motor domain (Eisenberg2020The). KIF19 exhibits both microtubule-stabilizing and depolymerizing properties, a dual function that is crucial for maintaining proper microtubule length in cilia without disrupting the array. This balance is essential for cilia function, impacting cell signaling and motility (Eisenberg2020The; Locke2017Structural).

In healthy cells, KIF19's role in controlling cilia length is vital for proper cellular function, as cilia are involved in various signaling pathways and cellular processes. The protein's activity in the cytoplasm, particularly in ciliated cells, contributes to processes like cell division and signaling pathways (Locke2017Structural). While the specific function of KIF19 in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed, its involvement in microtubule dynamics and cilia regulation suggests a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the KIF19 gene have significant clinical implications. KIF19 is involved in regulating ciliary length, and its dysfunction can lead to ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in cilia function. In particular, KIF19A, a member of the kinesin superfamily, is crucial for maintaining the optimal length of motile cilia. KIF19A knockout mice exhibit phenotypes such as hydrocephalus and female infertility due to abnormally elongated cilia that fail to generate adequate fluid flow (Niwa2012KIF19A). The elongation of cilia in these mice is linked to improper fluid flow generation, affecting the brain, trachea, and oviduct (Niwa2012KIF19A).

In the context of cancer, KIF19 expression is associated with cancer cell invasion and metastasis. High KIF19 expression correlates with decreased overall survival probability in several cancers, and its expression is higher in metastases compared to primary tumors in colorectal and breast cancer (Eisenberg2020The). KIF19 promotes cancer cell invasion by altering microtubule dynamics, suppressing cell adhesion, and affecting focal adhesion and adherens junction dynamics (Eisenberg2020The).
