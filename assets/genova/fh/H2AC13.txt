# H2AC13

## Overview
H2AC13 is a gene that encodes the protein H2A clustered histone 13, which is a variant of the histone H2A family. Histones are essential components of chromatin, playing a critical role in the structural organization of DNA within the nucleus and influencing gene expression by modulating chromatin accessibility. The H2A clustered histone 13 protein is involved in the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, thereby contributing to the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genomic stability. This gene is located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, which is significant for its potential involvement in immune response and various neuropsychiatric disorders (Gedik2023Identifying). Additionally, alterations in the expression of H2AC13 have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Malatesta2024Differential; Xing2023Immune).

## Clinical Significance
H2AC13 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cervical cancer, H2AC13 is identified as one of the differentially expressed necroptosis-related genes (DENRGs) with potential clinical significance in predicting patient prognosis. It is abundantly expressed in the low-risk group, suggesting it may act as an oncogene in cervical cancer (Xing2023Immune). 

In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, H2AC13 is associated with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder. It is located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, which is known for its involvement in immune response, indicating a potential role in these disorders (Gedik2023Identifying).

H2AC13 is also downregulated in human fibroblasts exposed to ionizing radiation and simulated microgravity, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of the cell cycle and DNA integrity checkpoint processes. This downregulation may affect processes like apoptosis and DNA repair, although the specific clinical implications are not fully detailed (Malatesta2024Differential). 

In breast cancer, H2AC13 is downregulated in olaparib-treated triple-negative breast cancer cells, indicating a potential role in the disease's metabolic pathways, though further research is needed to understand its specific impact (Hekmatshoar2024The).
