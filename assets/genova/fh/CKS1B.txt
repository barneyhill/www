# CKS1B

## Overview
CKS1B, or CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 1B, is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in cell cycle control. The protein product of CKS1B is a key player in the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK1 and CDK2, and is crucial for the transition from the G1 to S phase and progression through mitosis. As a regulatory protein, CKS1B is integral to the degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1, facilitating cell cycle progression and proliferation. Beyond its role in cell cycle regulation, CKS1B is implicated in maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity and is involved in various signaling pathways that influence cell growth and survival. The gene's overexpression is associated with several cancers, including multiple myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is linked to poor prognosis and aggressive disease characteristics (Hoellein2012Cks1; Radulovic2010CKS; Huang2009CKS1B).

## Structure


## Function
CKS1B (CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 1B) is a regulatory protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK1 and CDK2. It is essential for the transition from the G1 to S phase and for progression through mitosis. CKS1B is involved in the degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 by binding to the SCF Skp2 ubiquitin ligase complex, which facilitates the entry of cells into the S phase (Hoellein2012Cks1; Radulovic2010CKS). This function is unique to CKS1B, as CKS2 cannot substitute for it (Radulovic2010CKS).

CKS1B also has roles independent of p27 Kip1 suppression, particularly in the regulation of the G1-S transition and mitotic progression. It is involved in Cdk activation and acts as a targeting protein for Cdks, with its loss resulting in mitotic defects (Hoellein2012Cks1). CKS1B is primarily active in the nucleus, where it helps regulate DNA replication and cell division, ensuring proper cell proliferation and growth (Hoellein2012Cks1). Additionally, CKS1B is implicated in maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity by interacting with mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB), linking cell cycle proteins to mitochondrial function (Radulovic2010CKS).

## Clinical Significance
The CKS1B gene is implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers, with its overexpression often linked to poor prognosis and aggressive disease characteristics. In multiple myeloma, CKS1B amplification at chromosome band 1q21 is associated with reduced levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1, leading to increased cell proliferation and poor survival outcomes (Zhan2007CKS1B; Shaughnessy2005Amplification). This overexpression is common in aggressive forms of the disease and is linked to disease progression and relapse (Zhan2007CKS1B).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CKS1B overexpression serves as an independent prognostic factor for worse overall survival and local recurrence-free survival. It is associated with advanced cancer stages and multiple tumors, indicating its role in tumor progression (Huang2009CKS1B). The gene's overexpression is also linked to drug resistance in cancers such as lung cancer, where it contributes to chemical resistance and tumor progression through interactions with proteins like Heat Shock Protein 90 (Shi2020CKS1B).

CKS1B's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in the degradation of p27 Kip1, facilitating cell cycle progression and contributing to oncogenesis in various cancers, including breast and liver cancers (Reid2016A). These findings suggest that CKS1B is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancers characterized by its overexpression.

## Interactions
CKS1B interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK1 and CDK2, playing a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. It is an essential component of the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing complex) ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1. CKS1B specifically binds to the SCF/SKP2 complex, which includes SKP1, Cullin1, F-box proteins, and the ubiquitin ligase E3-SKP2, facilitating the ubiquitination process (Shi2020CKS1B).

CKS1B also interacts with SKP2 to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of p27 Kip1, a process that is crucial for cell cycle progression. Overexpression of CKS1B or SKP2 leads to increased turnover of p27 Kip1, enhancing cell proliferation (moin2023unravelling). In multiple myeloma, CKS1B regulates cell growth and survival through mechanisms that are both dependent and independent of SKP2 and p27 Kip1 (Zhan2007CKS1B).

CKS1B is also involved in activating the STAT3 and MEK/ERK pathways through SKP2- and p27 Kip1-independent pathways, indicating its role in cell proliferation and survival beyond its interaction with these proteins (Shi2020CKS1B).
