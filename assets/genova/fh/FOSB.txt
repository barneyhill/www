# FOSB

## Overview
FOSB is a gene that encodes the FosB proto-oncogene, a subunit of the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex. The FosB protein is categorized as a transcription factor and is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which facilitates dimerization and DNA binding. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in response to various stimuli, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. FosB is particularly significant in the nervous system, where it impacts synaptic plasticity and neuronal activity. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. Additionally, FOSB has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Wisdom1993ProtoOncogene; Kuroda2009FosB; Zhang2024Twopolarized).

## Structure
The FOSB gene encodes a protein that is part of the Fos family of transcription factors, which are integral to the AP-1 complex. The FosB protein features a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for its ability to dimerize and bind DNA. This domain includes a basic region (amino acids 142 to 182) and a leucine zipper (amino acids 183 to 211), both essential for forming heterodimers with c-Jun and facilitating DNA binding (Wisdom1993ProtoOncogene). The leucine zipper motif is particularly important for the protein's function in cellular transformation and transcriptional activation (Wisdom1993ProtoOncogene).

FosB undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, including a truncated form known as AFosB. This variant lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain, which is necessary for full transforming activity, but retains the DNA-binding domain, allowing it to form heterodimers with Jun proteins (Nakabeppu1991A). The presence of serine or threonine residues in the N-terminal region suggests potential phosphorylation sites, which may influence the protein's regulatory control (Wisdom1993ProtoOncogene). These structural features and modifications are critical for FosB's role in gene regulation and cellular transformation.

## Function
The FOSB gene encodes a protein that is a component of the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to various stimuli. In healthy human cells, FOSB is involved in several key cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate transcription, influencing the expression of genes involved in these processes (Zerial1989The).

FOSB is particularly significant in the nervous system, where it affects synaptic plasticity and neuronal activity. It is implicated in the regulation of intracellular feedback signaling and astroglial function, which are essential for maintaining neuronal health and function (Kuroda2009FosB). The protein's activity in neurons and its interaction with other transcription factors, such as those from the Jun family, enable it to form various trans-acting complexes that regulate a wide array of target genes. This regulation is crucial for cell cycle progression and other biological events, potentially influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Zerial1989The).

Overall, FOSB's role in healthy cells is to ensure proper cellular responses to environmental changes, maintaining cellular homeostasis and contributing to the organism's overall physiological balance.

## Clinical Significance
The FOSB gene plays a significant role in various diseases and conditions due to its involvement in transcriptional regulation. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FOSB exhibits dual roles depending on the status of the TP53 gene. In NSCLC with a TP53-null genetic background, FOSB promotes malignant progression by regulating oncogenic signaling pathways through its transcriptional target PREX1. Conversely, in NSCLC with wild-type TP53, FOSB acts as a tumor suppressor by activating IGFBP5, which enhances sensitivity to cisplatin and stabilizes p53, thereby inhibiting tumor growth (Zhang2024Twopolarized). 

FOSB also influences drug resistance in NSCLC with the TP53-R248Q mutation by affecting the expression of AKR1C3 and ALDH3A1, contributing to chemotherapy resistance (Zhang2024Twopolarized). In the context of neurological conditions, increased FosB expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is associated with cognitive impairment in patients with childhood epilepsies, temporal lobe epilepsy, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. This suggests a broader relevance of FosB in cognitive dysfunction across different neurological conditions (Fu2024Hippocampal). These findings highlight the complex role of FOSB in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
FOSB, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, participates in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in gene regulation. FOSB forms heterodimers with MafG, a small Maf protein, particularly under conditions of extracellular acidification. This interaction enhances the DNA binding activity of the MafG-FOSB heterodimer to the AP-1 consensus sequence, TGACTCA, facilitating transcriptional regulation in response to changes in extracellular pH (Shimokawa2005Extracellular).

FOSB also interacts with Jun proteins, forming part of the AP-1 complex. This interaction is mediated through a basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) motif, which is essential for binding to DNA at AP-1 sites (Skinner1997Transcriptional). The interaction with Jun proteins allows FOSB to regulate gene expression in response to various stimuli (Aronheim1997Isolation).

Additionally, FOSB can heterodimerize with c-Jun, as demonstrated in studies that identified its role in forming complexes with other AP-1 components. These interactions are significant for the transcriptional activation and repression of target genes (Aronheim1997Isolation). The phosphorylation of FOSB, particularly at its C-terminal activation domain, is crucial for its transcriptional activity, indicating that post-translational modifications also play a role in its interactions and function (Skinner1997Transcriptional).
