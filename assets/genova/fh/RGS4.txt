# RGS4

## Overview
RGS4, or Regulator of G protein signaling 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the R4 subfamily of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The RGS4 protein plays a pivotal role in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by accelerating the deactivation of Gα subunits through enhanced GTP hydrolysis. This regulatory function is crucial for controlling the intensity and duration of GPCR-mediated signal transduction, impacting various physiological processes such as neurotransmission and cardiovascular function. The protein is characterized by a conserved RGS domain, which is essential for its interaction with Gα subunits and its GAP activity. RGS4 is highly expressed in the brain and has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including schizophrenia, asthma, and chronic alcoholism, due to its regulatory influence on signaling pathways (Wong2020RGS4; AbramowNewerly2006RGS; Bansal2007R4).

## Structure
RGS4, or Regulator of G protein signaling 4, is a protein characterized by a conserved RGS domain known as the 'RGS box', which spans residues 58 to 178. This domain is crucial for its function in stabilizing the transition state for GTP hydrolysis (Tesmer1997Structure). The protein's secondary structure includes nine α-helices, forming two subdomains: a terminal subdomain and a bundle subdomain. The bundle subdomain consists of helices α4, α5, α6, and α7, which create a right-handed, antiparallel four-helix bundle (Tesmer1997Structure).

The tertiary structure of RGS4 involves significant conformational changes upon binding to Gα subunits, which are essential for its role in the GTPase cycle. These changes include a reorganization of the N-terminal and C-terminal helices, with a notable kink between residues K116-Y119 (Moy2000NMR). The binding pocket for Gα is larger and more accessible in the free RGS4 structure, indicating an 'open' conformation that shifts to a 'closed' conformation upon binding (Moy2000NMR).

RGS4 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation at Ser52, which enhances its GAP activity and affects its cellular localization (Bansal2007R4). Palmitoylation at cysteine residues 2 and 12 in the N-terminus also plays a role in membrane localization and function (Dissanayake2010Defining).

## Function
RGS4 (Regulator of G protein signaling 4) is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that plays a crucial role in modulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. It accelerates the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP on Gα subunits, thereby terminating the signal transduction initiated by GPCRs. This activity is essential for regulating the strength and duration of physiological responses mediated by G proteins (Srinivasa1998Mechanism).

RGS4 is involved in various cellular processes, including neurotransmission and cardiovascular regulation. It is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex, where it regulates signaling pathways transduced by receptors such as dopamine, metabotropic glutamate, and muscarinic receptors (Ding2007Full). RGS4 also interacts with potassium and calcium channels, influencing intracellular calcium signaling through phospholipase inhibition (Ding2007Full).

In human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), RGS4 is implicated in the differentiation processes of adipogenesis and osteogenesis. It acts as a positive regulator in adipogenic differentiation, facilitating the upregulation of adipogenic markers like PPARγ and C/EBPα, which are crucial for adipogenic commitment and maturation (Madrigal2017Expression). Conversely, RGS4 serves as a negative regulator during osteogenesis, inhibiting the differentiation of hMSCs into osteoblasts (Madrigal2017Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The RGS4 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in modulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. In asthma, RGS4 expression is elevated in the airway epithelium of individuals with the condition, correlating with disease severity and respiratory dysfunction. This increased expression is associated with enhanced bronchial responsiveness and may serve as a biomarker for asthma severity. RGS4's role in asthma is further highlighted by its involvement in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), where it contributes to bronchospasm by inhibiting PGE2 biosynthesis (Wong2020RGS4).

In schizophrenia, RGS4 has been identified as a susceptibility gene. Variants in RGS4 are associated with the disorder, particularly in certain populations, suggesting a genetic component to its pathophysiology. Studies have found significant associations between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the RGS4 locus and schizophrenia, indicating that genetic variations in RGS4 may contribute to the disorder's susceptibility (Morris2003Confirming; Chen2004Regulator; Ding2016Expression).

RGS4 is also linked to chronic alcoholism, where its expression is altered in the brains of affected individuals. Specific SNPs in RGS4 may be associated with alcoholism, potentially offering protective effects against the condition (Ho2010Association).

## Interactions
RGS4 interacts with various G protein α subunits, particularly those in the Gi subfamily, acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) to accelerate GTP hydrolysis and terminate signaling. It interacts strongly with Giα3, weakly with Giα2, and not at all with Gqα (Berman1996GAIP). RGS4 also forms complexes with Gαi2 and the M2 muscarinic receptor, facilitating its recruitment to the plasma membrane (Roy2003Recruitment). 

RGS4 can inhibit signaling pathways by forming ternary complexes with protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) and Gα subunits, particularly Gαq, thereby inhibiting downstream events such as ERK phosphorylation and calcium mobilization (Kim2020Regulators). It also interacts with phospholipase C-β (PLCβ) and Gαq, inhibiting PLCβ activity by promoting GTPase activity of Gαq (AbramowNewerly2006RGS).

RGS4's interaction with Gαi1 involves stabilizing the transition state for GTP hydrolysis, enhancing GTPase activity without directly catalyzing the reaction (Tesmer1997Structure). The small molecule CCG-4986 selectively inhibits RGS4 by covalently modifying a cysteine residue, disrupting its interaction with Gαi1 (Kimple2007The).
