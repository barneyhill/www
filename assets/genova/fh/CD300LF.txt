# CD300LF

## Overview
The CD300LF gene encodes the CD300 molecule-like family member f, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the CD300 family of receptors. This protein is predominantly expressed on myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and plays a critical role in modulating immune responses. The CD300LF protein is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are essential for transmitting inhibitory signals. Additionally, it can transmit activating signals through other motifs, contributing to its complex role in immune regulation. CD300LF is involved in the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells, as well as in the modulation of proinflammatory responses, making it a potential therapeutic target for immune-related disorders (Clark2009The; Gasiorowski2013CD300; Vitallé2020The).

## Structure
The CD300LF protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the CD300 family, characterized by a single immunoglobulin (Ig)V-like extracellular domain. This domain is linked to the transmembrane region by a membrane-proximal segment rich in prolines, serines, and threonines, which may contribute to its structural stability and function (Clark2009The). The extracellular IgV-like domain is involved in binding interactions, including those with lipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine, facilitated by specific binding pockets (Gasiorowski2013CD300).

The primary structure of CD300LF includes residues 19-131, with an N-terminal methionine added for protein synthesis (Nelson2018Structural). The protein's tertiary structure involves a cleft in the IgV domain that accommodates lipid ligands, with metal ion coordination playing a role in binding (Nelson2018Structural). The quaternary structure of CD300LF, when interacting with murine norovirus, involves the formation of trimers composed of receptors from different P domain dimers, as observed in cryo-EM models (Nelson2018Structural).

Post-translational modifications of CD300LF may include glycosylation, although specific sites and effects are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's ability to form homo- and heterodimers adds complexity to its signaling pathways (Vitallé2018CD300).

## Function
CD300LF, also known as CD300f, is a receptor expressed on myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, and plays a significant role in modulating immune responses. It is a type I transmembrane protein with an immunoglobulin-like extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are involved in transmitting inhibitory signals. CD300LF can also transmit activating signals through PI3K-binding motifs and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) (Vitallé2018CD300; Vitallé2020The).

CD300LF is involved in the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells by binding to phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of these cells. This interaction facilitates the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis (Gasiorowski2013CD300; Vitallé2020The). The receptor is also implicated in regulating proinflammatory responses, as it can inhibit the expression of inflammatory mediators in dendritic cells through pathways involving MyD88 and TRIF (Gasiorowski2013CD300). CD300LF's ability to modulate immune responses makes it a potential therapeutic target for conditions involving immune dysregulation (Clark2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD300LF gene, which encodes the CD300f immunoreceptor, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2034310, in the CD300f gene is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). The T allele of this SNP is linked to protection against MDD, particularly in women, suggesting a gender-specific influence on susceptibility to the disorder (Lago2020CD300f). CD300f deficiency in mice models has been shown to result in depressive-like behaviors, especially in females, indicating its role in mood regulation and potential involvement in psychiatric conditions (Lago2020CD300f).

In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), CD300f has been reported to have a neuroprotective role. Its deficiency in a murine model of MS led to increased nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhanced demyelination, and worsened clinical scores, suggesting that CD300f acts as a negative regulator of myeloid effector cells in autoimmune demyelination (MartínezBarriocanal2017Effect). CD300f is also involved in the response to traumatic brain injury (TBI), where its absence results in reduced phagocytic activity in microglia and increased neurological deficits, highlighting its role in neuroprotection and recovery (NegroDemontel2024CD300f).

## Interactions
CD300LF is a receptor that plays a crucial role in the interaction with murine norovirus (MNoV). It specifically binds to the viral capsid protein VP1, engaging the P2 subdomain of the P domain. This interaction is characterized by the involvement of the CC′ and CDR3 loops of CD300LF, which protrude into a cleft between the AB and DE loops of the P2 subdomain (Graziano2020CD300lf; Nelson2018Structural). The binding affinity of CD300LF for the MNoV P domain is relatively low, with a dissociation constant (K D) of approximately 219 μM, but is enhanced by the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium (Nelson2018Structural).

CD300LF also interacts with bile acids, which act as cofactors to enhance MNoV binding and infection. Glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) bind to specific pockets on the P domain, distinct from the CD300LF-P domain interface, suggesting an allosteric effect (Nelson2018Structural). The interaction with bile acids and divalent cations suggests that CD300LF's role in MNoV infection is modulated by these small molecules, which may influence the virus's tropism for specific cell types (Nelson2018Structural).
