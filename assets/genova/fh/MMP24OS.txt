# MMP24OS

## Overview
The MMP24OS gene encodes a protein known as MMP24 opposite strand, which is involved in various cellular processes. This gene is located on the opposite strand of the MMP24 gene, which encodes a matrix metalloproteinase involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components. The MMP24OS protein is categorized as a non-coding RNA, which suggests it may play a regulatory role in gene expression rather than encoding a functional protein. Its precise biological functions and mechanisms of action remain under investigation, but it is thought to be involved in the regulation of gene expression and may have implications in various physiological and pathological processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
