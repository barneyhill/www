# ZNF675

## Overview
ZNF675 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 675, a member of the KRAB zinc finger (KZNF) protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression during early embryonic development. Specifically, zinc finger protein 675 is involved in human zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and is expressed in the paternal genome at the 8-cell stage of embryogenesis (Yuan2023Human). It is crucial for repressing transposable elements, such as endogenous retroviruses and L1 elements, during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, thereby ensuring genomic stability and proper zygotic genome activation (Yuan2023Human). Additionally, ZNF675 has been implicated in the establishment of novel gene regulatory networks, particularly in the human brain, where it regulates gene expression in a region-specific manner (Farmiloe2020Widespread).

## Function
ZNF675 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in human zygotic genome activation (ZGA). It is specifically expressed in the paternal genome at the 8-cell stage of human embryonic development, highlighting its importance in early embryogenesis (Yuan2023Human). ZNF675 is involved in repressing transposable elements, such as endogenous retroviruses and L1 elements, during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. This repression is essential for the degradation of maternal RNA and the proper activation of the zygotic genome, maintaining genomic stability during early development (Yuan2023Human).

ZNF675 is a member of the KRAB zinc finger (KZNF) gene family, which has evolved to recognize and repress transposable elements in mammalian genomes. These proteins have been repurposed for other regulatory roles, including binding to gene promoters independent of transposable elements and regulating gene expression in the human brain in a region-specific manner (Farmiloe2020Widespread). ZNF675, like other KZNFs, is involved in establishing novel gene regulatory networks, particularly in the context of brain development (Farmiloe2020Widespread).
