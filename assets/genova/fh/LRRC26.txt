# LRRC26

## Overview
The LRRC26 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing 26 protein, which serves as an auxiliary γ1 subunit of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels. This protein is categorized as a type I membrane protein, characterized by its single-pass transmembrane segment and extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. The LRRC26 protein plays a crucial role in modulating the voltage-dependent activation of BK channels, allowing them to function effectively at more negative membrane potentials and lower calcium concentrations. This modulation is particularly significant in non-excitatory cells, such as secretory epithelia and bronchial smooth muscle cells, where it influences processes like fluid secretion and muscle tone regulation (Kallure2023Highresolution; Noda2020Roles). Additionally, LRRC26 is involved in various physiological and pathological contexts, including its role as a tumor suppressor in triple-negative breast cancer and its potential therapeutic implications in cystic fibrosis and colon cancer (Kim2020Losartan; Zhou2022Constructing; Miyagawa2018Frequent).

## Structure
The LRRC26 protein is a type I membrane protein characterized by a single-pass transmembrane segment and an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. This domain is composed of leucine-rich repeats flanked by cysteine-rich capping structures at the N- and C-terminal regions, known as LRR-NT and LRR-CT, respectively (Zhang2014Regulation; Unknownauthors2015Handbook). The LRR domain forms a horseshoe-shaped structure with a curved parallel β-sheet and small helices or turns, stabilized by inward-pointing leucine residues (Zhang2014Regulation). 

The protein contains a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide for targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Unknownauthors2015Handbook). LRRC26 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, which are crucial for its structure and stability. Human LRRC26 contains four pairs of conserved cysteines predicted to form disulfide bonds in the ER, enhancing solubility and protecting from proteolysis (Unknownauthors2015Handbook). 

LRRC26 exists in two isoforms: isoform 1 (L-CAPC), predominantly expressed in the prostate and salivary gland, and isoform 2 (S-CAPC), which is expressed only in cancer cell lines (Unknownauthors2015Handbook). The protein interacts with Slo1 channels, forming a complex that influences channel gating (Kallure2023Highresolution).

## Function
The LRRC26 gene encodes a protein that functions as an auxiliary γ1 subunit of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels. These channels are crucial for regulating membrane potential and calcium signaling in various cell types. LRRC26 significantly influences the voltage-dependent activation of BK channels, allowing them to open at more negative membrane potentials, even in low calcium conditions. This modulation is particularly important in non-excitatory cells, such as secretory epithelia and bronchial smooth muscle cells, where it helps maintain resting membrane potential and modulate muscle tone (Kallure2023Highresolution; Noda2020Roles).

In salivary glands and airway epithelial cells, LRRC26 shifts the voltage necessary for BK channel activation, reducing the calcium requirement for channel opening. This enables BK channels to respond to physiological voltage and calcium levels, facilitating processes like fluid secretion and mucociliary function (Almassy2011The; Manzanares2014IFNγmediated). The presence of LRRC26 also alters the pharmacological sensitivity of BK channels, affecting their response to specific activators such as mallotoxin (Almassy2011The; Manzanares2014IFNγmediated). Overall, LRRC26 plays a critical role in modulating BK channel activity, impacting various physiological functions in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC26 gene is clinically significant in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where its expression is frequently downregulated due to epigenetic alterations, specifically promoter hypermethylation. This downregulation is associated with the malignant progression of TNBC, as LRRC26 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Its reduced expression correlates with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to the aggressiveness of TNBC (Miyagawa2018Frequent). The study suggests that targeting the epigenetic modifications of LRRC26 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for TNBC (Miyagawa2018Frequent).

In cystic fibrosis (CF), LRRC26 is involved in the regulation of BK channel function in airway cells. Reduced expression of LRRC26, associated with neutrophilic inflammation, leads to decreased BK channel activity, impacting airway function. The drug losartan has been shown to partially restore LRRC26 expression and BK channel function, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in CF (Kim2020Losartan).

In colon cancer, LRRC26 has been identified as a prognostic marker. Higher expression levels of LRRC26 are associated with a better prognosis, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and patient outcomes (Zhou2022Constructing).

## Interactions
LRRC26, also known as the γ1 subunit, interacts with the Slo1 channel, a large conductance, voltage, and calcium-regulated potassium channel. This interaction is crucial for modulating the voltage-gating properties of Slo1. The LRRC26 subunit forms a complex with Slo1, stabilizing its quaternary assembly. The extracellular domains of LRRC26 form a ring around the Slo1 channel, which is composed of Leucine Rich Repeat Domains (LRRDs). These domains do not directly contact the Slo1 channel except for the LRRM-CT, which interacts with the extracellular N-terminus of Slo1 (Kallure2023Highresolution).

The transmembrane helix of LRRC26 interacts closely with the voltage-sensing domain of Slo1, particularly around residues 269-273, fitting into a groove formed by the S0 and S3 helices of Slo1. This interaction is essential for the voltage-dependent activation of Slo1, with specific residues like F160 and D186 being critical for this process (Kallure2023Highresolution).

LRRC26 also interacts with BKα and BKβ1 subunits in bronchial smooth muscle cells, modulating BK channel activity. This interaction shifts the activation voltage of BK channels towards more hyperpolarized values, even without an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Noda2020Roles).
