# BRME1

## Overview
BRME1, or Break Repair Meiotic recombinase recruitment factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for meiotic recombination, a process essential for the accurate segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. The protein, also referred to as BRME1, is characterized by its intrinsically disordered structure and high content of acidic residues, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins involved in DNA repair. Notably, BRME1 forms a complex with MEILB2 and BRCA2, playing a pivotal role in the recruitment of recombinases RAD51 and DMC1 to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiosis (Zhang2020The; Le2021Guardians). This interaction is critical for maintaining genomic stability and fertility, as evidenced by the infertility observed in Brme1 knockout mice due to defects in DSB repair and homolog synapsis (Takemoto2020A; FelipeMedina2020A). Additionally, BRME1's expression is noted in germ cells, particularly in the testis and embryonic ovary, and its function is conserved across species (Takemoto2020A). The protein's involvement in meiotic recombination and its potential implications in fertility and cancer highlight its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (FelipeMedina2020A; Zhang2020The).

## Structure
BRME1, also known as Break Repair Meiotic recombinase recruitment factor 1, is a protein involved in meiotic recombination. It consists of 600 amino acids and is characterized by a high content of acidic residues, making it intrinsically disordered and lacking recognizable functional domains (FelipeMedina2020A). Despite its disordered nature, BRME1 interacts with MEILB2, forming a 2:2 stoichiometry complex that stabilizes MEILB2 and prevents its self-association (Zhang2020The). The interaction domain of BRME1 with MEILB2 is located at its C-terminal fragment, spanning residues 475-600 (FelipeMedina2020A).

The MEILB2-BRME1 complex forms a V-shaped DNA clamp upon binding with BRCA2, facilitating the loading of recombinases onto resected DNA ends (Gurusaran2024MEILB2BRME1). The complex includes a parallel four-helical assembly, with a hydrophobic core formed by conserved BRME1 amino acids V548, L555, and I562, which are crucial for interaction with MEILB2 (Gurusaran2024MEILB2BRME1). The N-terminal β-cap of the complex binds to DNA, and mutations in this region can significantly reduce DNA binding (Gurusaran2024MEILB2BRME1). The structure of BRME1 alone, including its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available sources.

## Function
BRME1 (break repair meiotic recombinase recruitment factor 1) is a protein that plays a critical role in meiotic recombination, a process essential for the accurate segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. It forms a complex with BRCA2 and MEILB2, which is crucial for the recruitment of recombinases RAD51 and DMC1 to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiosis (Zhang2020The; Le2021Guardians). BRME1 stabilizes MEILB2 by binding to its α-helical N-terminus, preventing self-association and facilitating the formation of the BRCA2-MEILB2-BRME1 ternary complex (Zhang2020The; Le2021Guardians).

In healthy cells, BRME1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with single-stranded DNA-binding proteins and recombinases to ensure proper DNA repair and homologous recombination (Takemoto2020A; FelipeMedina2020A). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining genomic stability and fertility, as evidenced by the infertility observed in Brme1 knockout mice due to defects in DSB repair and homolog synapsis (Takemoto2020A; FelipeMedina2020A). BRME1's function is conserved across species, with its expression noted in germ cells, particularly in the testis and embryonic ovary (Takemoto2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the BRME1 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly related to fertility and cancer. In the context of fertility, BRME1 is crucial for meiotic recombination, and its disruption can lead to significant reproductive issues. In Brme1 knockout mice, males exhibit infertility due to meiotic arrest and synapsis defects, while females, although fertile, have a reduced follicle pool, indicating potential fertility challenges (FelipeMedina2020A; Zhang2020The). The interaction between BRME1 and HSF2BP is essential for protein stability, and mutations such as the HSF2BP-S167L variant can lead to primary ovarian insufficiency by affecting meiotic recombination (FelipeMedina2020A).

In cancer, BRME1 is upregulated in various human cancer tissues, suggesting an oncogenic role. This is likely due to its ability to disrupt the mitotic homologous recombination (HR) pathway, which is crucial for DNA repair. Overexpression of BRME1 impairs RAD51 foci formation, a marker of HR activation, potentially contributing to genomic instability and cancer development (Zhang2020The). The aberrant expression of BRME1 in cancer cell lines suggests it may play a role in the development of sporadic cancers by affecting the HR pathway (Zhang2020The).

## Interactions
BRME1, also known as break repair meiotic recombinase recruitment factor 1, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for meiotic recombination. It forms a ternary complex with MEILB2 and BRCA2, which is essential for meiotic DNA double-strand break repair, homologous synapsis, and crossover formation (Zhang2020The). The interaction between BRME1 and MEILB2 is mediated by the α1 region of MEILB2, and BRME1 stabilizes MEILB2 by preventing its self-association (Zhang2020The). BRME1 also interacts with the SPATA22-MEIOB complex and RAD51, but not DMC1, indicating specific protein interactions during meiosis (Zhang2020The).

BRME1 is part of a larger complex that includes HSF2BP, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51, and RPA, with HSF2BP being a primary interactor (FelipeMedina2020A). The MEILB2-BRME1 complex can form a V-shaped DNA clamp upon binding with BRCA2, facilitating the recruitment of recombinases to double-strand breaks (Gurusaran2024MEILB2BRME1). This complex binds to DNA, forming large-scale protein-DNA structures, and its DNA binding capability is crucial for its function in meiotic recombination (Gurusaran2024MEILB2BRME1). The presence of BRME1 is essential for the proper localization and stabilization of MEILB2 and HSF2BP on chromatin during meiosis (Takemoto2020A).
