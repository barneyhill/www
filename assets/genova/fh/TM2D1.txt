# TM2D1

## Overview
TM2D1 is a gene that encodes the protein TM2 domain containing 1, which is characterized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including its involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Notch signaling pathways. TM2 domain containing 1 functions as a beta-amyloid binding protein, interacting with Aβ peptides, which are associated with AD pathogenesis. The protein's role as a potential mediator of Aβ toxicity highlights its significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Salazar2021TM2D). Additionally, TM2D1 is part of a gene family that includes TM2D2 and TM2D3, which are involved in Notch signaling and neuronal function, suggesting a broader role in cellular communication and regulation (Salazar2021TM2D). The gene has also been identified as a protective factor in differentiated thyroid cancer, with its expression inversely correlated with cancer progression, indicating its potential role in tumor suppression (Zhang2024Genomewidea; Zhang2024Genomewide).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TM2D1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in programmed cell death and interactions with various cellular pathways. In differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), TM2D1 is identified as a protective gene, with higher expression levels associated with a reduced risk of cancer development. Its expression decreases with increasing T stage in thyroid cancer, suggesting an inhibitory role in cancer progression (Zhang2024Genomewidea; Zhang2024Genomewide). TM2D1 is also involved in apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, and its expression is notably lower in elderly patients with thyroid cancer compared to younger patients, indicating a potential protective effect against DTC (Zhang2024Genomewidea).

In the context of neurodegenerative disorders, TM2D1 has been studied for its potential role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been identified as a beta-amyloid binding protein, interacting with Aβ peptides associated with AD. Overexpression of TM2D1 in human neuroblastoma cells increased sensitivity to Aβ-induced cell death, suggesting a role in mediating Aβ-toxicity, although the significance of this interaction remains unclear (Salazar2021TM2D). These findings highlight TM2D1's involvement in both cancer and neurodegenerative disease pathways.

## Interactions
TM2D1, also known as bisc in Drosophila, is involved in several interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Notch signaling pathways. TM2D1 has been identified as a beta-amyloid binding protein (BBP) through yeast-two hybrid screens, indicating its potential involvement in AD pathogenesis. It interacts with Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides, requiring its extracellular domain and part of the first transmembrane domain for binding. This interaction suggests that TM2D1 may function as a transmembrane receptor mediating Aβ toxicity, although it is not coupled to G proteins (Salazar2021TM2D).

In Drosophila, TM2D1 is part of a gene family that includes TM2D2 and TM2D3, which are involved in Notch signaling and neuronal function. High-throughput proteomics experiments have shown physical interactions between TM2D1-TM2D3 and TM2D2-TM2D3, suggesting the formation of a protein complex. These interactions imply that TM2D proteins may work together in regulating Notch signaling and other cellular processes (Salazar2021TM2D). Despite these findings, specific interactions of TM2D1 with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature.
