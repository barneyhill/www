# SNRPD2

## Overview
SNRPD2 is a gene that encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein D2 polypeptide, a core component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). These snRNPs are integral to the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNA, a critical step in mRNA maturation and gene expression regulation. The SNRPD2 protein is characterized by its involvement in RNA splicing, where it interacts with other snRNP proteins to form a functional spliceosome complex. This protein is predominantly active in the nucleus and plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring accurate mRNA processing. Additionally, SNRPD2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including alternative polyadenylation and interactions with ubiquitin ligases, which highlight its diverse functional roles in RNA processing and potential involvement in disease mechanisms (Koedoot2021Splicing; Hu2022U1; BullonesBolaños2022SNRPD2).

## Structure
SNRPD2 is a component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which play a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. The primary structure of SNRPD2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function. In terms of secondary structure, SNRPD2 includes both alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure of SNRPD2 involves the three-dimensional folding of these secondary elements, allowing it to interact effectively with other molecules and perform its role in the spliceosome.

The quaternary structure of SNRPD2 is characterized by its assembly with other snRNP proteins, forming a complex that is essential for the splicing process. This assembly is critical for the proper functioning of the spliceosome, as it facilitates the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNA. Common post-translational modifications of SNRPD2 include methylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the spliceosome. These modifications are important for regulating the protein's function and ensuring accurate splicing. The structural features and modifications of SNRPD2 underscore its importance in the regulation of gene expression through mRNA processing.

## Function
SNRPD2 is a core component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing. This protein plays a critical role in the assembly and function of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for removing introns from pre-mRNA, thereby facilitating mRNA maturation and gene expression regulation. SNRPD2 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the precise processing of pre-mRNA into mature mRNA, a crucial step in gene expression (Koedoot2021Splicing).

In healthy human cells, SNRPD2 is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing, which is vital for the proper expression of genes and the production of functional proteins. The protein's activity in the nucleus ensures that introns are accurately excised from pre-mRNA, allowing for the correct assembly of exons into mature mRNA transcripts. This process is fundamental to maintaining cellular functions and organismal development, as it influences the diversity and functionality of proteins produced within the cell (Koedoot2021Splicing).

The role of SNRPD2 in RNA splicing highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting normal cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation (Koedoot2021Splicing).

## Clinical Significance
SNRPD2 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SNRPD2 is overexpressed and associated with poor overall survival. Its high expression correlates with TP53 mutations, tumor grades, and cancer stages, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Liu2022SNRPD1EFG). The gene's expression is significantly higher in LUAD tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues, and it is altered in 3% of LUAD patients, indicating a role in disease progression (Liu2022SNRPD1EFG).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SNRPD2 is part of a complex that regulates cell proliferation and mitosis. Its knockdown leads to cell cycle arrest and increased cell death, highlighting its critical role in cancer cell survival (Koedoot2021Splicing). SNRPD2 interacts with the mitotic protein SUN2 and is involved in the regulation of sororin intron retention, which affects sister chromatid cohesion and cell division (Koedoot2021Splicing). These findings suggest that targeting SNRPD2 and its associated pathways could be a therapeutic strategy in TNBC.

## Interactions
SNRPD2, a component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), is involved in several protein interactions crucial for RNA processing. It interacts with other proteins in the spliceosome, such as SNRPB, SNRPE, and SNRPF, forming part of the core snRNP complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing (Pánek2023The).

SNRPD2 has been shown to interact with 3' end processing factors, including CPSF6, CSTF1, PABPC1, and PABPN1. These interactions suggest a role for SNRPD2 in alternative polyadenylation (APA) regulation, as it colocalizes with these factors in the nucleus of HEK293T cells (Hu2022U1). This interaction is significant in the context of U1 snRNP proteins promoting proximal APA sites (Hu2022U1).

Additionally, SNRPD2 is a substrate for the ubiquitin ligase activity of the Salmonella type III secretion effector SlrP. This interaction involves the ubiquitination of SNRPD2 at lysine residues 85 and 92, although this modification does not lead to its degradation, indicating a non-proteolytic role for ubiquitination (BullonesBolaños2022SNRPD2). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of SNRPD2 in RNA processing and its potential manipulation by pathogens.
