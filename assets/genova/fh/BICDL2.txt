# BICDL2

## Overview
BICDL2 is a gene that encodes the protein BICD family like cargo adaptor 2, which is involved in intracellular transport processes. This protein is part of the BICD family of cargo adaptor proteins, which play a crucial role in the dynein-dynactin motor complex, facilitating the movement of various cellular components along microtubules. BICD family like cargo adaptor 2 is essential for the proper distribution of organelles and vesicles within the cell, contributing to cellular organization and function. The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest due to their involvement in cellular transport mechanisms and potential implications in various diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
