# SYNPO2L

## Overview
The SYNPO2L gene encodes the synaptopodin 2-like protein, a cytoskeletal protein primarily associated with cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein due to its role in the structural organization of muscle tissue. Synaptopodin 2-like is localized to the Z-disc of muscle fibers, where it interacts with α-actinin-2, playing a crucial role in the organization and function of sarcomeres, the contractile units of muscle cells. The gene is expressed in two isoforms, CHAPa and CHAPb, which are differentially expressed in adult and embryonic cardiac tissues, respectively. The SYNPO2L gene is significant for maintaining cardiac muscle integrity and function, and its mutations have been linked to atrial fibrillation, highlighting its clinical importance in cardiac health (Clausen2021LossofFunction).

## Function
The SYNPO2L gene encodes the Cytoskeletal Heart-enriched Actin-associated Protein (CHAP), which is crucial for the structural organization and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. This protein is localized to the Z-disc of muscle tissue, where it interacts with α-actinin-2, a key protein in myofibril organization. SYNPO2L plays a significant role in the structural development and function of sarcomeres, the fundamental contractile units of muscle cells, by acting as a structural component and potentially participating in cellular signaling processes (Clausen2021LossofFunction).

In healthy human cells, SYNPO2L is involved in maintaining the integrity and function of cardiac muscle tissue. It is expressed in two isoforms: CHAPa, which is predominantly found in adult cardiac tissue, and CHAPb, which is primarily present in embryonic cardiac tissue. The protein's role in sarcomere organization is essential for proper cardiac contractility, as evidenced by studies in zebrafish models where loss of SYNPO2L function resulted in disorganized sarcomeres and reduced cardiac contractility (Clausen2021LossofFunction). This suggests that SYNPO2L is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cardiac muscle, contributing to overall heart health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SYNPO2L gene have been linked to atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia. Loss-of-function variants in SYNPO2L, such as the splice site variant rs766868752, are associated with an increased risk of AF. This variant, identified in the FinnGen study, is predominantly found in individuals of Finnish descent and is associated with a significant increase in the odds of developing AF (Clausen2021LossofFunction). The SYNPO2L gene product is involved in the structural development and function of sarcomeres, and its decreased expression is linked to disorganized sarcomeres and reduced cardiac contractility, as demonstrated in zebrafish models (Clausen2021LossofFunction).

The SYNPO2L gene is also implicated in the regulation of gene expression in atrial tissue, with genetic variants affecting its expression levels. The rs60212594 SNP at the SYNPO2L locus is associated with a minor but significant change in expression, further supporting its role in AF pathogenesis (Clausen2021LossofFunction; Roberts2018Noncoding). These findings suggest that SYNPO2L mutations and expression alterations contribute to the structural integrity of cardiomyocytes and the development of AF.
