# HSD17B3

## Overview
The HSD17B3 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 3, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which plays a pivotal role in steroid metabolism. This enzyme is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of testosterone by catalyzing the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone, a critical process for male sexual development and differentiation (Planinic2024Dynamics; Margiotti2002Association). Hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 3 is predominantly expressed in the testes, specifically in Leydig cells in adults and Sertoli cells during fetal development (Planinic2024Dynamics). The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper development of male sexual characteristics, and its dysfunction can lead to disorders such as male pseudohermaphroditism (Planinic2024Dynamics). The gene's mutations are linked to 17β-HSD3 deficiency, a disorder of sex development, highlighting its clinical significance (Ben2013A; George2010The).

## Structure
The HSD17B3 gene encodes the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3, which is involved in the biosynthesis of testosterone. The primary structure of this enzyme consists of 310 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 34,513 daltons (Ning2017Development). The enzyme is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family and is characterized by a Rossmann fold, a common motif for binding NADP(H) cofactors (Tsachaki2019Subcellular; Ning2017Development). This fold is composed of seven parallel β-sheets with α-helices wrapped around them, forming the core structure of the enzyme (Gao2021Molecular).

The enzyme is bound to the endoplasmic reticulum through its N-terminal transmembrane domain, which complicates crystallization and structural studies (Ning2017Development). The quaternary structure of 17β-HSD3 is not well-defined due to the absence of a crystal structure, but it is known to be a membrane-bound protein (Ning2017Development). The enzyme's subcellular localization and membrane topology are crucial for its function, with its presence in the endoplasmic reticulum being significant for its role in testosterone biosynthesis (Tsachaki2019Subcellular). The lack of a crystal structure limits detailed understanding of its quaternary structure and inhibitor interactions (Ning2017Development).

## Function
The HSD17B3 gene encodes the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of testosterone, a key androgen hormone. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone, a process essential for the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics (Planinic2024Dynamics; Margiotti2002Association). In healthy human cells, HSD17B3 is primarily active in the testes, where it is expressed in Leydig cells in adults and in Sertoli cells during fetal development, particularly in the second trimester (Planinic2024Dynamics). 

The enzyme's activity is integral to normal male sexual development, providing most of the testosterone in men, which is further metabolized to dihydrotestosterone in the prostate gland. This conversion is vital for activating transcription of genes with androgen-responsive elements, promoting DNA synthesis and cell replication in the prostate (Margiotti2002Association). The proper functioning of HSD17B3 is essential for male sexual differentiation, and disturbances in its activity can lead to disorders such as male pseudohermaphroditism, characterized by ambiguous genitalia and infertility due to insufficient testosterone production (Planinic2024Dynamics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSD17B3 gene lead to 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (17β-HSD3) deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of sex development (DSD) that affects individuals with a 46,XY karyotype. This condition is characterized by a failure to adequately convert androstenedione to testosterone, resulting in undervirilization of male external genitalia. Affected individuals may present with a range of phenotypes, from female external genitalia to ambiguous genitalia or male genitalia with micropenis and hypospadias (Ben2013A; Manyas2021Early; George2010The).

The clinical presentation can vary significantly, with some individuals experiencing virilization at puberty due to increased androstenedione levels, which may be converted to testosterone by other enzymes (Gonçalves2022Disorder; George2010The). Diagnosis is often challenging and may be confused with other conditions such as androgen insensitivity syndrome or 5α-reductase deficiency due to overlapping symptoms (Gonçalves2022Disorder; George2010The).

Over 70 different mutations in the HSD17B3 gene have been identified, including missense mutations, splice junction abnormalities, and small deletions (Ben2013A; Gonçalves2022Disorder). Notable mutations include p.Arg80Gln, prevalent in the Arab population in the Gaza Strip, and p.Ala203Val and p.Glu215Asp, which are pathogenic (Gonçalves2022Disorder; George2010The). Molecular genetic testing is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of the condition (Gonçalves2022Disorder; George2010The).

## Interactions
HSD17B3, a key enzyme in steroid metabolism, is involved in forming a complex with other proteins that play a significant role in androgenic signaling, particularly in the context of prostate cancer. It forms a complex with HSD17B2, SHBG, and SRD5A1, which is crucial for testosterone metabolism and therapy response in prostate cancer patients. Molecular docking studies suggest that the HSD17B2/HSD17B3 complex interacts with the SRD5A1/SHBG complex to form a macro-complex. This macro-complex is implicated in driving the androgenic and recurrent phenotype observed in prostate cancer patients (Bamodu2021Differential).

The expression of HSD17B3, along with other proteins in this complex, is associated with drug resistance and cancer progression. This suggests that targeting these interactions could be a potential therapeutic strategy for managing prostate cancer. The study highlights the importance of these protein interactions in influencing the disease's progression and response to treatment (Bamodu2021Differential). However, specific details about the physical interactions of HSD17B3 with nucleic acids or other proteins outside this context are not provided in the available literature.
