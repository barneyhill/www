# ELF5

## Overview
ELF5, or E74 like ETS transcription factor 5, is a gene that encodes a member of the ETS transcription factor family, which is characterized by a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. This domain is essential for recognizing specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression. The ELF5 protein plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including the regulation of trophoblast stem cells in the placenta and epithelial cell function in the respiratory system. It is involved in maintaining the separation between embryonic and trophoblast lineages and is crucial for lung function, particularly in the production of surfactants by alveolar type II cells. ELF5 is also implicated in cancer biology, acting as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts, such as renal cell carcinoma, while influencing tumor progression and endocrine resistance in breast cancer. The gene's expression and function are modulated by epigenetic mechanisms and post-translational modifications, highlighting its complex regulatory role in cellular processes (Piggin2016ELF5; Pietzner2022ELF5; Hemberger2010ELF5enforced).

## Structure
The ELF5 protein is a member of the ETS transcription factor family, characterized by an ETS DNA-binding domain that recognizes a core GGAA/T motif (Piggin2016ELF5). This domain is crucial for its function in binding to specific DNA sequences. The full-length ELF5 protein also contains an N-terminal Pointed (PNT) domain, which is similar to the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain and is known for its strong transactivation activity (Piggin2016ELF5). 

ELF5 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative transcription or splicing, which increases the diversity of its protein structure and function. There are four main isoforms identified in the RefSeq database, with an additional isoform described by the GENCODE Consortium. Isoforms 1 and 2 are full-length, differing by ten N-terminal amino acids due to alternative promoter usage. Isoforms 3 and 4 result from splicing events that remove certain exons, leading to proteins lacking the PNT domain but retaining the ETS domain. Isoform 5 is a variant of isoform 2 with an extended exon 4, potentially lacking the ETS domain (Piggin2016ELF5). The expression of these isoforms is tissue-specific, with isoform 2 being predominant in several tissues like the breast, bladder, and lung (Piggin2016ELF5). 

The ELF5 protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not fully described in the context provided.

## Function
ELF5 (E74 like ETS transcription factor 5) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of trophoblast stem (TS) cells in the human placenta. It is part of a network of transcription factors, including CDX2 and EOMES, that are essential for the development and maintenance of these cells. ELF5 is expressed throughout gestation, with higher expression in early gestation trophoblast samples, and its activity is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation (Hemberger2010ELF5enforced).

In the placenta, ELF5 is predominantly expressed in the nuclei of villous cytotrophoblast cells, contributing to the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer. It is involved in maintaining the separation between embryonic and trophoblast lineages, being hypomethylated and expressed in trophoblasts but hypermethylated and largely silent in embryonic lineage cells (Hemberger2010ELF5enforced).

ELF5 is also expressed in epithelial cells of the respiratory system, including secretory and alveolar type II (AT2) cells, which are crucial for maintaining lung function. These cells produce surfactants that reduce surface tension and prevent alveolar collapse, and ELF5's expression suggests a role in the repair and regeneration processes of the respiratory epithelium (Pietzner2022ELF5).

## Clinical Significance
ELF5 (E74 like ETS transcription factor 5) plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions influencing tumor progression and metastasis. In breast cancer, ELF5 expression is altered in a subtype-specific manner. It is significantly downregulated in luminal A, luminal B, and HER2 subtypes, while there is a trend for increased expression in the basal subtype (Piggin2016ELF5). High ELF5 expression in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) is associated with worse outcomes, whereas its downregulation in luminal subtypes is linked to cancer progression (Luk2018ELF3). ELF5 also influences estrogen sensitivity by repressing estrogen receptor expression, contributing to endocrine resistance in ER-positive breast cancer (Piggin2020ELF5).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), ELF5 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation associated with advanced cancer stages and poorer prognosis. Overexpression of ELF5 in RCC cell lines inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2023ELF5). ELF5 also functions as an angiogenesis inhibitor in RCC by negatively correlating with VEGFA expression (Li2023ELF5).

In other cancers, such as prostate and bladder cancer, ELF5 generally acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression often reduced due to promoter methylation (Luk2018ELF3).

## Interactions
ELF5, a transcription factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as breast cancer progression and trophoblast stem cell (TSC) maintenance. In breast cancer, ELF5 is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300 and deacetylated by SIRT6. This post-translational modification enhances ELF5's ability to suppress cancer proliferation by inhibiting the transcription of the CCND1 gene (Li2021Acetylation). ELF5 also interacts with DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which modulates estrogen receptor (ER) transcriptional activity, suggesting a role in endocrine resistance (Piggin2020ELF5).

In TSCs, ELF5 forms multimeric transcription factor complexes with Eomes and Tfap2c, which are crucial for maintaining self-renewal and differentiation. These interactions are sensitive to the stoichiometry of the involved proteins, with ELF5's precise levels determining the balance between self-renewal and differentiation (Latos2015Elf5centered). ELF5 also interacts with other proteins such as Grhl2 and Bptf, and is part of both activating and repressive chromatin complexes, indicating its dual role in gene regulation (Latos2015Elf5centered). These interactions highlight ELF5's central role in regulating gene expression through complex networks of protein and nucleic acid interactions.
