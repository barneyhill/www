# FGF18

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) is a gene that encodes the protein fibroblast growth factor 18, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of skeletal development, including chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, by interacting with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) such as FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 (Liu2002Coordination; Ohbayashi2002FGF18). FGF18 plays a crucial role in bone and cartilage development by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic mesenchymal cells and osteoblasts, while also regulating chondrocyte activity (Liu2002Coordination; Ohbayashi2002FGF18). Beyond its developmental functions, FGF18 is implicated in various cancers, where it influences tumor growth, angiogenesis, and cell survival through multiple signaling pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhou2023The).

## Function
FGF18 (fibroblast growth factor 18) is a critical regulator of skeletal development, particularly in the processes of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. It is expressed in osteogenic mesenchymal cells and differentiating osteoblasts, where it plays a vital role in promoting cell proliferation and differentiation during bone development (Ohbayashi2002FGF18). FGF18 is necessary for the normal progression of osteoblast differentiation, as evidenced by its role in maintaining the proliferative ability of osteogenic mesenchymal cells and facilitating their terminal differentiation into osteoblasts (Ohbayashi2002FGF18).

In chondrogenesis, FGF18 negatively regulates the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes, acting through fibroblast growth factor receptors such as FGFR3. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the balance of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, ensuring proper long bone growth and development (Liu2002Coordination; Ohbayashi2002FGF18). FGF18 is also involved in the coordination of these processes by signaling through multiple FGFRs, including FGFR1 and FGFR2, in different bone regions (Liu2002Coordination).

FGF18's role extends to cartilage maintenance and repair, as it has been shown to have an anabolic effect on cartilage, promoting increased cartilage deposition and formation (Beenken2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FGF18 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), FGF18 expression is significantly increased, correlating with poor clinical prognosis and promoting cell proliferation and angiogenesis through pathways like MAPK and PI3K/AKT (Zhou2023The). In ovarian cancer, FGF18 is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression, influencing angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration through pathways such as NF-κB and PAX8-FGF18 (Wei2013FGF18; Zhou2023The). 

In breast cancer, FGF18 serves as a diagnostic marker, with increased expression linked to disease progression and enhanced cell proliferation via Akt-GSK3b-mediated β-catenin signaling (Zhou2023The). In lung cancer, FGF18 is upregulated in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells, promoting proliferation and migration through the ERK and p38 pathways (Zhou2023The). 

FGF18 also plays a role in gastric cancer, where its high expression is associated with longer survival in certain cases, and it is involved in pathways like SMAD2/3 and ERK-MAPK (Zhou2023The). In hepatocellular carcinoma, FGF18 enhances cell survival and angiogenesis, interacting with non-coding RNAs and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Zhou2023The). 

In endometrial cancer, FGF18 is upregulated and promotes cell proliferation and invasion through the AKT and ERK pathways (Zhou2023The). Conversely, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, FGF18 is downregulated, and its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation, suggesting a protective role (Zhou2023The).

## Interactions
FGF18 interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4, to activate various signaling pathways. These interactions are crucial for its role in cancer progression and other biological processes. FGF18 binding to FGFRs induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, activating the tyrosine kinase domain and initiating downstream signaling cascades (Zhou2023The). In colorectal cancer, FGF18 interacts with FGFR3-IIIc, enhancing cell viability and reversing apoptosis in cancer cells (Zhou2023The). In lung cancer, FGF18 promotes cell proliferation and migration through the FGFR1 pathway, with FGFR1 Fc fusion protein inhibiting cancer cell growth (Zhou2023The).

FGF18 also interacts with non-coding RNAs, such as H19 and miR-139, in hepatocellular carcinoma, promoting tumorigenic potential (Zhou2023The). It is regulated by the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway, where it enhances angiogenesis through the FGFR3 pathway and phosphorylation of AKT/ERK proteins (Zhou2023The). In ovarian cancer, FGF18 influences the tumor microenvironment by regulating tumor-associated macrophages and promoting angiogenesis through the NF-kB pathway (Zhou2023The). These interactions highlight FGF18's role in modulating various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
