# NECAB3

## Overview
NECAB3, or N-terminal EF-hand calcium binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes a calcium-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the Golgi apparatus. The protein is categorized as a calcium-binding protein and is implicated in the regulation of protein transport and modification processes during the cell cycle. NECAB3 is expressed in multiple tissues, with a notable abundance in the brain, suggesting its involvement in neuronal functions and synaptic activities (Sugita2002NECABs:). The protein interacts with several cellular partners, including Mint3, and plays a role in the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in cancer cells, indicating its significance in cancer progression (Nakaoka2016NECAB3). Additionally, NECAB3 is part of signaling pathways that influence cancer cell migration and invasion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Tian2023NECAB3).

## Function
NECAB3, also known as NIP1 or XB51, is a calcium-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the Golgi apparatus. It is a potential substrate of the protein kinase Nek2, which phosphorylates NECAB3, suggesting a role in Golgi-related functions such as protein transport or modification processes during the cell cycle (Yoo2004NIP1XB51NECAB3). NECAB3 is localized in the Golgi and possibly the endoplasmic reticulum, as indicated by immunostaining experiments (Yoo2004NIP1XB51NECAB3).

NECAB3 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, with a higher abundance in the brain, indicating its involvement in neuronal functions (Sugita2002NECABs:). It is part of a family of neuronal calcium-binding proteins that play roles in synaptic function and neurotransmitter release, influencing neuronal communication and plasticity, which are crucial for cognitive functions (Sugita2002NECABs:). The protein's interaction with Nek2 and its phosphorylation suggest it may have specific roles in the regulation of exocytosis and Golgi inheritance during mitosis (Yoo2004NIP1XB51NECAB3).

## Clinical Significance
NECAB3 (N-terminal EF-hand calcium binding protein 3) has been implicated in the progression of various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NECAB3 is a direct target of miR-4319, and its expression is enhanced in tumor-associated macrophages. The GNAS-AS1/miR-4319/NECAB3 axis plays a crucial role in promoting NSCLC progression by regulating macrophage polarization and enhancing tumor cell migration and invasion. Downregulation of NECAB3 in NSCLC cells results in suppressed tumorigenicity, highlighting its role in cancer development (Li2019GNASAS1miR4319NECAB3).

In liver cancer, NECAB3 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Altering NECAB3 expression in liver cancer cell lines affects their migrative and invasive abilities. Specifically, downregulation of NECAB3 reduces these abilities, while overexpression enhances them. The HIF-1α/RIT1 signaling pathway is identified as a key mediator of NECAB3's effects on liver cancer progression. In vivo studies using xenograft models have shown that downregulation of NECAB3 significantly suppresses tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in liver cancer (Tian2023NECAB3). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NECAB3 in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
NECAB3 (N-terminal EF-hand calcium binding protein 3) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes. NECAB3 interacts with Mint3, forming a ternary complex with Mint3 and factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1), which is essential for the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) during normoxia in cancer cells. This interaction occurs at the Golgi apparatus, where NECAB3 co-localizes with Mint3 and MT1-MMP, indicating its involvement in the MT1-MMP/Mint3 axis that activates HIF-1 (Nakaoka2016NECAB3). NECAB3 binds to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of Mint3, and this interaction is facilitated by a specific fragment of NECAB3 (amino acids 181-190), independent of its EF-hand or monooxygenase domains (Nakaoka2016NECAB3).

In liver cancer, NECAB3 is implicated in the HIF-1α/RIT1 signaling pathway, where its expression modulates cancer cell migration and invasion. Downregulation of NECAB3 leads to reduced expression of HIF-1α and RIT1, highlighting its role in promoting liver cancer progression (Tian2023NECAB3). In non-small cell lung cancer, NECAB3 is part of the GNAS-AS1/miR-4319/NECAB3 axis, where it is targeted by miR-4319, affecting macrophage polarization and cancer cell progression (Li2019GNASAS1miR4319NECAB3).
