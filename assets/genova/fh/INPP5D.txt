# INPP5D

## Overview
The INPP5D gene encodes the inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase D protein, commonly known as SHIP1, which is a crucial component of the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase family. SHIP1 is a membrane-associated phosphatase that plays a significant role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways, particularly in immune cells. It functions primarily as a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, thereby influencing cell survival, metabolism, and immune responses (Chou2023INPP5DSHIP1; Chou2023INPP5D). The protein is characterized by its domain structure, which includes an SH2 domain, a central 5-phosphatase domain, and a proline-rich C-terminal region, facilitating interactions with various signaling proteins (Hakim2012Inositol; Rohrschneider2000Structure). SHIP1's regulatory functions are particularly relevant in the context of neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, where it modulates microglial activity and cytokine production (Chou2023INPP5DSHIP1; Terzioglu2023Microglial).

## Structure
The INPP5D gene encodes the SHIP1 protein, a member of the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase family. SHIP1 is characterized by a domain structure that includes an N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, a central 5-phosphatase domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich region (Hakim2012Inositol; Rohrschneider2000Structure). The SH2 domain is crucial for interactions with intracellular signaling proteins, while the central 5-phosphatase domain is responsible for the enzymatic activity of removing phosphate groups from the 5' position of inositol phosphates (Rohrschneider2000Structure). The C-terminal region contains NPXY motifs, which interact with proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding domains upon phosphorylation, and PxxP motifs, which serve as binding sites for proteins with SH3 domains (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide).

SHIP1 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including SHIP1α, SHIP1β, SHIP1δ, and s-SHIP1. These isoforms can vary in their domain composition and functional roles, with some lacking the SH2 domain (Hakim2012Inositol; Rohrschneider2000Structure). The full-length SHIP1 protein consists of 1190 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 145 kDa (Chou2023INPP5D; Rohrschneider2000Structure). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which is important for its interactions and regulatory functions (Rohrschneider2000Structure).

## Function
The INPP5D gene encodes the SHIP1 protein, a 145 kDa membrane-associated phosphatase that plays a critical role in regulating intracellular signaling pathways in healthy human cells. SHIP1 acts as a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by hydrolyzing the 5' phosphate of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)P3 to generate phosphatidylinositol (3,4)P2, thereby reducing levels of phosphorylated Akt. This activity influences cell metabolism, survival signaling, and immune responses (Chou2023INPP5DSHIP1; Chou2023INPP5D).

In microglial cells, SHIP1 functions as a scaffolding protein, interacting with DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) to prevent PI3K association with triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). This interaction is crucial for modulating microglial phagocytic activity and maintaining immune homeostasis (Chou2023INPP5DSHIP1; Zajac2023Expression). SHIP1 also influences the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through interactions with Dectin-1/CLEC7A, further impacting immune responses (Chou2023INPP5D).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, SHIP1's regulatory role in inflammasome activation is significant, as it modulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ß and IL-18, thereby influencing neuroinflammation and microglial function (Chou2023INPP5DSHIP1; Terzioglu2023Microglial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the INPP5D gene, which encodes the SHIP1 protein, have been associated with several diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the INPP5D locus, such as rs35349669, which are linked to an increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) (Olufunmilayo2023INPP5DSHIP1:; Zajac2023Expression). The INPP5D gene is primarily expressed in microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, and plays a crucial role in regulating inflammatory responses. Alterations in INPP5D expression can lead to dysregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, contributing to AD pathology by promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18 (Chou2023INPP5D; Terzioglu2023Microglial).

In Alzheimer's disease, INPP5D expression is often elevated in microglia associated with amyloid-beta plaques, which are a hallmark of the disease. This increased expression is correlated with amyloid plaque density and may exacerbate disease pathology by affecting microglial functions such as phagocytosis and plaque compaction (Chou2023INPP5D; Zajac2023Expression). The gene's role in immune reactivity and phagocytic activity underscores its importance in neurodegenerative and inflammatory conditions (Chou2023INPP5D).

## Interactions
The INPP5D gene encodes the SHIP1 protein, which is involved in various protein interactions that regulate immune cell signaling. SHIP1 interacts with ITAM-containing receptors such as FcγRIIa, binding directly to its ITAM with an affinity comparable to ITIM-containing receptors like FcγRIIb. This interaction is crucial for negatively regulating Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis (Nakamura2002The). SHIP1 also binds to DAP12, particularly when the ITAM is phosphorylated, inhibiting TREM2 and DAP12 signaling pathways in preosteoclasts. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of signaling molecules like Syk and PLC-γ2, which are involved in cellular activation and differentiation (Peng2010TREM2).

In microglia, SHIP1 modulates function and activation through interactions with proteins containing ITIM or ITAM motifs, phosphotyrosine-binding domains, and SH3-binding domains. It inhibits TREM2 signaling by binding to the ITAM of DAP12, preventing PI3K-mediated signaling (Terzioglu2023Microglial). SHIP1 also interacts with Dectin-1/CLEC7A, influencing macrophage phagocytic activity and ROS production (Chou2023INPP5DSHIP1). These interactions highlight SHIP1's role in regulating immune responses and inflammation, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease.
