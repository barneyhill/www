# CLEC9A

## Overview
CLEC9A is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain containing 9A (CLEC9A) protein, a type II transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on BDCA3+ dendritic cells and certain monocytes. This receptor is characterized by its C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), which plays a crucial role in the immune system by recognizing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as filamentous actin (F-actin) on necrotic cells. CLEC9A facilitates the cross-presentation of antigens from these damaged cells to T-cells, thereby enhancing immune surveillance and response. The receptor's cytoplasmic domain contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation-like motif, which recruits Syk kinase to induce proinflammatory cytokine production, highlighting its function as an activation receptor. Despite its structural similarity to phagocytic receptors, CLEC9A is involved in endocytosis rather than phagocytosis. Its interactions with proteins such as RNF41 and ER-associated proteins are critical for its role in antigen processing and presentation (Tullett2020RNF41; Caminschi2008The; Huysamen2008CLEC9A; Zhang2012The).

## Structure
The CLEC9A protein is a type II transmembrane receptor with a single C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) in its extracellular region. The human CLEC9A protein consists of 241 amino acids and features a cytoplasmic tail and a transmembrane region containing YXXL residues, which serve as a potential signaling motif (Caminschi2008The). The CTLD of CLEC9A displays the canonical fold typical of C-type lectin domains and includes four conserved cysteine residues that form two disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Zhang2012The). 

The protein can form disulfide-linked homodimers on the cell surface, likely mediated by cysteine residues in the N-terminal stalk regions of the ectodomain, which is a key aspect of its quaternary structure (Zhang2012The). The CTLD also contains two conserved tryptophan residues (W131, W227) crucial for binding to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Zhang2012The). Although the CTLD structure reveals a coordinated Ca2+ ion, it plays a structural role rather than being directly involved in ligand interaction (Zhang2012The). The protein's structure includes potential N-glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications (Caminschi2008The).

## Function
CLEC9A is a C-type lectin-like receptor primarily expressed on BDCA3+ dendritic cells and a subset of monocytes in human peripheral blood. It plays a significant role in the immune system by recognizing and binding to filamentous actin (F-actin) exposed on damaged or necrotic cells. This binding is crucial for the immune system's ability to detect and respond to cellular damage, facilitating the cross-presentation of antigens from necrotic cells to T-cells, thereby enhancing immune surveillance and response (Zhang2012The; van2015BDCA3+CLEC9A+).

CLEC9A contains a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation-like motif that recruits Syk kinase, enabling it to induce proinflammatory cytokine production, suggesting its function as an activation receptor (Huysamen2008CLEC9A). Despite its structural similarity to other receptors that mediate phagocytosis, CLEC9A does not mediate phagocytosis but is involved in endocytosis, as it is rapidly internalized following antibody cross-linking (Huysamen2008CLEC9A).

The receptor's ability to bind to actin and spectrin complexes in damaged cells highlights its role in recognizing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which is essential for initiating immune responses and potentially modulating immune responses in autoimmune diseases (Zhang2012The).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC9A, a gene encoding a receptor primarily expressed on dendritic cells, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In atherosclerosis, CLEC9A expression is associated with pro-atherogenic effects. The receptor DNGR1, encoded by CLEC9A, promotes the development of atherosclerosis by down-regulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10, leading to increased inflammatory cell content within arterial plaques. Mice deficient in DNGR1 showed reduced atherosclerotic plaque size and decreased macrophage and T cell infiltration, suggesting that CLEC9A plays a significant role in the progression of atherosclerosis through inflammatory pathways (Haddad2017The).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CLEC9A expression is significantly downregulated compared to normal tissues. This downregulation correlates with poorer overall survival rates in LUAD patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. CLEC9A is involved in pathways related to immune response and cell adhesion, and its expression levels affect immune cell infiltration in tumors. Alterations in CLEC9A expression are linked to changes in tumor immune microenvironment, impacting the regulation of immune checkpoints and potentially influencing cancer progression (Miao2021Downregulated).

## Interactions
CLEC9A, a C-type lectin receptor, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in the immune response. It specifically binds to filamentous actin (F-actin) and spectrin-actin complexes, which are exposed on damaged cells. This interaction is facilitated by the C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of CLEC9A, which recognizes actin filaments associated with actin-binding domains (ABDs) of cytoskeletal proteins like spectrin and a-actinin (Zhang2012The).

CLEC9A also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF41, which regulates its degradation through ubiquitination. This interaction is specific to CLEC9A and does not involve the tryptophan residues required for its binding to F-actin, indicating distinct binding sites for RNF41 and F-actin. RNF41-mediated ubiquitination of CLEC9A occurs at several sites within its ectodomain, influencing its stability and function in antigen cross-presentation (Tullett2020RNF41).

In dendritic cells, CLEC9A interacts with ER-associated proteins such as Erlin2, Calreticulin, and Calnexin. These interactions are modulated by RNF41 and are important for the processing and presentation of antigens from dead cells (Tullett2020RNF41).
