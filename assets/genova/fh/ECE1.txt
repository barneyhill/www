# ECE1

## Overview
The ECE1 gene encodes endothelin-converting enzyme 1, a zinc metalloprotease that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of endothelins, which are potent vasoconstrictive peptides. This enzyme is categorized as a type II integral membrane protein and is involved in the conversion of inactive precursor peptides, known as big endothelins, into their active forms, such as endothelin-1 and endothelin-3. These active endothelins are crucial for regulating vascular tone and blood pressure, thereby influencing cardiovascular function (Johnson1999Hydrolysis; Kohan2011Regulation). ECE1 is expressed in various tissues, including the cardiovascular system, and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which allows for diverse functional roles in different cellular contexts (Valdenaire1999A). Beyond its role in vascular biology, ECE1 is also implicated in neural processes and has been associated with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Hirschsprung disease, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Hofstra1999A; Eckman2001Degradation).

## Structure
Endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE1) is a zinc metalloprotease involved in the conversion of big endothelin to active endothelin. The primary structure of ECE1 consists of a polypeptide chain with 758 to 770 amino acids, depending on the isoform (SCHWEIZER1997Human). The enzyme is characterized by a type II integral membrane protein structure, featuring a single transmembrane domain that separates a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail from a large C-terminal domain containing the active site (Valdenaire1999A). This active site includes the HEXXH motif typical of metallopeptidases, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Valdenaire1999A).

ECE1 forms homodimers through a sulfide bridge between Cys-428 of each subunit, indicating a quaternary structure (Tapia2019Endothelinconverting). The enzyme exists in four isoforms—ECE-1a, ECE-1b, ECE-1c, and ECE-1d—resulting from alternative splicing and the use of different promoters (Valdenaire1999A). These isoforms differ in their N-terminal sequences and subcellular localization, with ECE-1a and ECE-1c primarily located at the plasma membrane, while ECE-1b is intracellular (SCHWEIZER1997Human; Valdenaire1999A). Common post-translational modifications of ECE1 include glycosylation, which may influence its stability and activity.

## Function
Endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE-1) is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that plays a crucial role in the conversion of precursor peptides, known as big endothelins, into active endothelin hormones, particularly endothelin-1 (ET-1) and endothelin-3 (ET-3). These active endothelins are potent vasoconstrictive peptides that regulate vascular tone, contributing to blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular function (Johnson1999Hydrolysis; Kohan2011Regulation). ECE-1 is a type II integral membrane protein with a large C-terminal domain containing the enzymatic active site, and it is expressed in various tissues, including the aorta, lung, ovary, and testis, as well as in endothelial cells (Johnson1999Hydrolysis; Valdenaire1999A).

ECE-1 exists in multiple isoforms, such as ECE-1a, ECE-1b, ECE-1c, and ECE-1d, which differ in their N-terminal sequences and subcellular localization. These isoforms are generated from the same gene through the use of different promoters, allowing for diverse functional roles in cellular processes (Valdenaire1999A). ECE-1a is primarily found on the plasma membrane, while ECE-1b is intracellular, and ECE-1c is moderately expressed at the cell surface (Valdenaire1999A). The enzyme's activity is highly dependent on substrate conformation, preferring to cleave substrates at the amino side of hydrophobic residues (Johnson1999Hydrolysis). ECE-1 also plays a role in the degradation of amyloid β peptides, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its involvement in neural processes (Eckman2001Degradation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ECE1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of enteric ganglia in the bowel, has been linked to mutations in ECE1. A specific loss-of-function mutation, resulting in a cysteine for arginine substitution at position 742, has been identified in patients with HSCR, cardiac defects, and autonomic dysfunction (Hofstra1999A). Additionally, the SNP rs169884 in the ECE1 gene is significantly associated with the L-HSCR subtype in Southern Chinese children (Lan2022Susceptibility).

Altered ECE1 expression is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Variants in the ECE1 gene, particularly in the promoter region, may affect cognitive ability in old age and contribute to increased AD risk through tissue-specific regulation (Hamilton2012The). In the context of cancer, ECE1 is associated with the tetraspanin Tspan8, influencing tumor cell motility, survival, and angiogenesis. This interaction enhances the conversion of bigET1 to ET1, playing a role in cancer progression (Zhu2023The).

In kidney fibrosis, ECE1 upregulation is linked to tubular injury and myofibroblast expansion, while its deletion in mice reduces fibrosis by modulating inflammatory responses (Arfian2020Endothelin).

## Interactions
Endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE-1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in receptor trafficking and signaling. ECE-1 interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and β-arrestins, playing a significant role in the postendocytic sorting of these proteins. It is particularly involved in the degradation of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in endosomes, which facilitates the dissociation of CGRP and β-arrestins from the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), promoting their recycling and resensitization (Padilla2007Endothelinconverting).

ECE-1 also interacts with the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) and β-arrestins in the context of substance P (SP)-induced signaling. This interaction is crucial for the degradation of SP in endosomes, which disrupts the NK1R-β-arrestin complex, allowing NK1R to recycle and resensitize at the plasma membrane (Roosterman2007Endothelinconverting; Jensen2014Endothelinconverting). ECE-1's role in degrading neuropeptides like SP and CGRP in endosomes is essential for the regulation of receptor recycling and signaling resensitization (Roosterman2007Endothelinconverting). These interactions highlight ECE-1's involvement in modulating inflammatory signaling and receptor trafficking through its enzymatic activity in endosomal compartments.
