# WDR31

## Overview
WDR31 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 31 protein, which is a member of the WD40-repeat protein family. This protein family is characterized by its involvement in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. The WD repeat domain 31 protein plays a critical role in ciliary function, particularly in the regulation of intraflagellar transport (IFT) and the recruitment of the BBSome complex to cilia. It is enriched in the cilium of mammalian cells, indicating its significant role in maintaining ciliary integrity and function. Although WDR31 does not possess a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, it functions redundantly with GAPs such as ELMOD and RP2, contributing to the regulation of cilia morphology and IFT processes. The protein's involvement in these pathways suggests its potential role in molecular pathways regulated by GTPases, despite its distant sequence resemblance to a nucleoside-triphosphatase (NTPase) domain (Cevik2023WDR31; Lucaciu2023Unveiling).

## Function
WDR31 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in ciliary function, particularly in the regulation of intraflagellar transport (IFT) and the recruitment of the BBSome complex to cilia. This protein is part of the WD40-repeat protein family, which is known for its role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle regulation (Cevik2023WDR31; Lucaciu2023Unveiling). In mammalian cells, WDR31 is enriched in the cilium, indicating its involvement in ciliary functions (Cevik2023WDR31).

WDR31, along with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) such as ELMOD and RP2, plays a crucial role in regulating cilia morphology and IFT processes. It is involved in the trafficking of kinesin-IFT-BBSome complexes, which are essential for proper cilia function and structure (Cevik2023WDR31). Although WDR31 does not possess a GAP domain, it may have a distant sequence resemblance to a nucleoside-triphosphatase (NTPase) domain, suggesting a potential role in molecular pathways regulated by GTPases (Cevik2023WDR31).

In human cell models, WDR31 localizes to the primary cilium, suggesting its role in recruiting the BBSome to the cilium, which is crucial for maintaining ciliary integrity and function (Cevik2023WDR31).

## Clinical Significance
WDR31 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in ciliary function and gene expression regulation. Although direct associations with specific diseases are not fully established, alterations in WDR31 expression have been linked to endometrial carcinoma. In this context, significant differences in survival rates have been observed between patients with high and low expression levels of WDR31, suggesting its potential role in the prognosis of endometrial cancer (Li2022Molecular).

In Crohn's disease, WDR31 has been identified as a candidate gene for susceptibility, particularly in Japanese patients. It may be associated with more severe phenotypes of the disease, possibly due to its involvement in autophagy-related processes that affect intestinal barrier function and inflammation control (Lucaciu2023Unveiling).

WDR31 is also involved in ciliary function, and its mutations can lead to defects in intraflagellar transport (IFT) and BBSome trafficking, which are crucial for cilia biogenesis and morphology. These defects are often associated with ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction, although specific diseases linked to WDR31 mutations are not directly mentioned (Cevik2023WDR31).

## Interactions
WDR31 is involved in regulating intraflagellar transport (IFT) and ciliary protein recruitment, functioning redundantly with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) such as ELMOD and RP2. These proteins are crucial for the effective entry and exit of IFT components in cilia. In the absence of WDR31, ELMD-1, and RPI-2, there is an accumulation of the OSM-3/KIF17 kinesin motor at ciliary tips, indicating a disruption in IFT. This suggests that WDR31, along with ELMD-1 and RPI-2, plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the ciliary gate and regulating the transport and localization of IFT and BBSome components within cilia (Cevik2023WDR31).

WDR31 is also necessary for the recruitment of BBS-7, a component of the BBSome, to the cilia. The absence of WDR31 leads to defects in the BBSome, affecting the stability of the IFT complex. This is demonstrated by the accumulation of IFT-B components and altered staining of IFT-A components in the cilia of mutants (Cevik2023WDR31). These interactions highlight the role of WDR31 in ciliary function and its potential interactions with other proteins involved in ciliary transport processes (Cevik2023WDR31).
