# SERPINB2

## Overview
SERPINB2 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family B member 2, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2). This protein is a member of the serpin superfamily, which is characterized by its role as a serine protease inhibitor. SERPINB2 is primarily involved in inhibiting the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and, to a lesser extent, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), playing a crucial role in modulating proteolytic processes within the cell (Schroder2011The). The protein is predominantly localized intracellularly, where it participates in various cellular functions, including the regulation of proteostasis and cellular stress responses. It is implicated in neuroprotection, bone metabolism, and cancer biology, highlighting its multifaceted role in health and disease (Lee2015SerpinB2; Hang2021Knockdown). Alterations in SERPINB2 expression have been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Brauze2021SERPINB2—its; Bae2016Downregulation).

## Structure
SERPINB2, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2), is a member of the serpin superfamily and is characterized by its ability to inhibit serine proteases, particularly the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and, to a lesser extent, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (Schroder2011The). The protein exists in two forms: a non-glycosylated 47 kDa protein and a glycosylated form ranging from 58 to 70 kDa, both of which are secreted and active as inhibitors (Schroder2011The). 

The molecular structure of SERPINB2 includes a reactive center loop (RCL) that is crucial for its inhibitory function. This loop contains a P1 Arginine and a P1' Threonine residue, which are essential for the formation of a covalent complex with target proteases, acting as a suicide substrate (Schroder2011The). The protein also features a large and unique loop between helices C and D, although the CD-loop is not essential for its function in targeting or inhibiting uPA (Cochran2009The).

SERPINB2 lacks a classical secretory signal peptide and is primarily localized intracellularly, found in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Schroder2011The). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which affects its molecular weight and secretion efficiency (Schroder2011The). The absence of the CD-loop does not compromise its inhibitory activity, making the ΔCD-loop variant a potential candidate for therapeutic applications (Cochran2009The).

## Function
SERPINB2, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2), is a serine protease inhibitor primarily localized in the cytoplasm, suggesting an intracellular function. It is involved in modulating proteostasis by binding to misfolded proteins and promoting the formation of cytoprotective inclusions, which helps sequester toxic protein aggregates. This function is particularly relevant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, where SERPINB2 has been shown to protect cells from toxicity induced by misfolded proteins such as huntingtin and amyloid-beta, potentially by inhibiting their aggregation (Lee2015SerpinB2).

SERPINB2 also interacts with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy pathways, playing a role in protein degradation and cellular stress responses. It binds non-covalently with ubiquitin and is associated with proteasome subunits, indicating its involvement in protein degradation pathways. Dysregulation of SERPINB2 affects UPS activity and autophagy, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Lee2015SerpinB2).

In bone metabolism, SERPINB2 negatively regulates osteogenic differentiation in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Knockdown of SERPINB2 enhances osteogenesis, suggesting its potential as a target for bone fracture healing (Hang2021Knockdown).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SERPINB2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), down-regulation of SERPINB2 is associated with resistance to the cancer drug gefitinib. This down-regulation enhances the formation of invadopodia-like structures, which are linked to increased invasiveness and metastasis, suggesting a role in poor prognosis and drug resistance (Bae2016Downregulation). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), SERPINB2 expression in the stromal compartment is linked to reduced metastasis and prolonged survival. Its deletion or reduced expression is associated with increased tumor growth and invasion due to enhanced urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) activity, which promotes extracellular matrix remodeling (Harris2017SerpinB2).

In inflammatory diseases, SERPINB2 expression is upregulated in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and asthma, where it may modulate immune responses and influence disease severity (Schroder2011The; Brauze2021SERPINB2—its). The gene's expression is also linked to immune response modulation, with altered expression affecting Th1 and Th2 responses in various conditions (Schroder2011The). These findings highlight the potential of SERPINB2 as a biomarker and therapeutic target in both cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
SERPINB2, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2), is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It binds specifically to stress-induced misfolded proteins, such as DTT-stressed BSA, and inhibits their aggregation, demonstrating a chaperone-like activity similar to αB-crystallin (Lee2015SerpinB2). SERPINB2 also interacts with the proteasome subunit PSMβ1 and has been identified in screening assays for novel ubiquitin (Ub) binding proteins, indicating a potential interaction with Ub. This interaction is non-covalent and has been confirmed in cells (Lee2015SerpinB2).

In the context of neuroprotection, SERPINB2 is highly expressed in microglial conglomerations with Alzheimer's senile plaques and inhibits amyloid-β fibril formation, which is relevant to its role in neurodegenerative diseases (Lee2015SerpinB2). It also interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), protecting it from calpain-mediated cleavage, which enhances tumor cell survival by stabilizing Rb and maintaining its repression of proapoptotic gene transcription (Tonnetti2008SerpinB2). These interactions highlight SERPINB2's multifaceted role in modulating proteostasis and cellular stress responses.
