# ZNF83

## Overview
ZNF83 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 83, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. Zinc finger protein 83 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in cellular processes such as differentiation and development by modulating the transcription of target genes (Zhao2021A). In addition to its fundamental roles in normal cellular function, ZNF83 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer, where it influences key signaling pathways and gene expression profiles (Zhao2021A; Xu2021EpigenomeWide). The gene's regulation and interaction with microRNAs, such as miR-181a, further underscore its significance in both health and disease contexts (Huang2010MicroRNA-181a).

## Function
ZNF83, a member of the zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcription factor in healthy human cells. It is characterized by zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding, allowing it to regulate gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences. This regulatory role is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, as ZNF83 modulates the transcription of target genes (Zhao2021A). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell, thereby impacting cellular function and organismal development (Zhao2021A).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF83 is implicated in the regulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway through its derived circular RNA, circZNF83. This circular RNA acts as a molecular sponge for miR-324-5p, a microRNA involved in the negative regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16). By modulating this axis, ZNF83 influences cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and other cellular behaviors, highlighting its potential role in cancer biology (Zhao2021A). However, in healthy cells, the precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes of ZNF83's function remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF83 has been implicated in several diseases, primarily through its altered expression and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF83 is significantly upregulated, suggesting a role in the progression of this cancer. The circular RNA form of ZNF83 (circZNF83) is involved in the regulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation. The curcumin analog GL63 has been shown to inhibit HCC progression by downregulating circZNF83, thereby affecting the circZNF83/miR-324-5p/CDK16 axis (Zhao2021A).

In prostate cancer, ZNF83 is associated with differentially methylated regions, which are linked to aggressive disease phenotypes. This suggests that the methylation status of ZNF83 could be a biomarker for prostate cancer aggressiveness (Xu2021EpigenomeWide).

Additionally, ZNF83 is targeted by microRNA-181a, which downregulates its expression by binding to its coding regions. This interaction is significant in the context of gene expression regulation in cancer cells, as miR-181a modulates the expression of multiple zinc finger proteins, including ZNF83 (Huang2010MicroRNA-181a).
