# NDRG4

## Overview
NDRG4, or N-myc downstream-regulated gene 4, is a gene that encodes the NDRG family member 4 protein, which is part of the NDRG family of proteins. This protein is characterized by an α/β hydrolase fold, although it does not possess a specific hydrolytic catalytic site, distinguishing it from typical hydrolytic enzymes (Qu2008ndrg4; Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily). NDRG4 is primarily expressed in the brain and heart, suggesting its involvement in critical physiological processes within these tissues (Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily). Functionally, NDRG4 is implicated in cell migration, extracellular matrix interactions, and the regulation of apoptosis through its interactions with proteins such as p53 and Bves (Benesh2013Bves; Wen2019NDRG4). Clinically, alterations in NDRG4 expression have been associated with various cancers, including gliomas and breast cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic marker due to its role in tumor progression and metastasis (Li2012Downregulation; Jandrey2019NDRG4).

## Structure
The NDRG4 protein is a member of the NDRG family and is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 339 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 38.4 kDa (Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily). It contains an α/β hydrolase fold, a common structural motif among NDRG proteins, which spans about 220 amino acids (Qu2008ndrg4; Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily). This fold is typical in various hydrolytic enzymes, although no specific hydrolytic catalytic site has been identified in NDRG4 (Qu2008ndrg4).

NDRG4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, with one phosphorylation site and seventeen acetylation sites identified (Zhu2017NDRG4). The protein is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with three identified mRNA isoforms: NDRG-4B, NDRG-4Bvar, and NDRG-4H, which may result from tissue-specific promoter use (Yang2013NDRG3). These isoforms contribute to the protein's functional diversity and are differentially expressed during development (Nakada2002Molecular). NDRG4 is primarily located in the cytoplasm and is expressed in the brain and heart, suggesting distinct roles in these tissues (Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily).

## Function
NDRG4 is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of cell migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. In epicardial cells, NDRG4, in conjunction with Bves, regulates directional cell migration by facilitating the recycling and resecretion of fibronectin, a key ECM component. This process is essential for maintaining directional persistence in cell movement, as NDRG4 mediates the plasma membrane fusion of endosomal compartments, which is crucial for fibronectin recycling (Benesh2013Bves).

NDRG4 also plays a role in the trafficking of cell surface proteins, impacting cell motility and adhesion. It is involved in the docking of VAMP3-labeled vesicles at the cell surface, necessary for the delivery of plasma membrane-bound and secreted cargoes (Benesh2013Bves). This interaction is specific to cell directionality rather than migration rate or distance, indicating a specialized role in cellular behavior (Benesh2013Bves).

In addition to its role in cell migration, NDRG4 is expressed in the brain and heart, suggesting specific functions in these tissues. It is particularly expressed in the ventricles and interventricular septum of the heart, indicating a role in cardiac function (Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily).

## Clinical Significance
NDRG4 (NDRG family member 4) has been implicated in various cancers, particularly gliomas and breast cancer, due to alterations in its expression levels. In gliomas, NDRG4 expression is significantly reduced compared to nonneoplastic brain tissues, with lower expression levels correlating with higher tumor grades and poorer patient outcomes. This downregulation is associated with lower Karnofsky performance scores, increased intratumor necrosis, and reduced overall survival, making NDRG4 a potential prognostic marker for glioma patients (Li2012Downregulation).

In breast cancer, NDRG4 is subject to epigenetic silencing through promoter hypermethylation, which is linked to metastatic progression. This hypermethylation is associated with negative prognostic factors such as larger tumor size, p53 overexpression, and lymph node metastasis, resulting in a lower 5-year distant metastases-free survival rate. The silencing of NDRG4 affects integrin signaling, promoting cell migration and metastasis, particularly towards vitronectin in lymph nodes (Jandrey2019NDRG4).

In glioblastoma, studies have shown conflicting results regarding NDRG4 expression. Some research indicates that NDRG4 is downregulated and acts as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting cell proliferation (Ding2012NDRG4). However, other studies suggest that NDRG4 is necessary for cell cycle progression and survival, with its knockdown leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Schilling2009NDRG4). These discrepancies highlight the complex role of NDRG4 in cancer biology.

## Interactions
NDRG4 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It has a direct interaction with the p53 protein, which is crucial in regulating apoptosis. NDRG4 overexpression inhibits p53 expression and activity, thereby blocking p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis signaling. This interaction is part of a feedback mechanism where p53 can also inhibit NDRG4 expression in response to ischemia/reperfusion injury (Wen2019NDRG4).

NDRG4 also interacts with the blood vessel epicardial substance (Bves) protein in mammalian epicardial cells. This interaction is essential for regulating directional cell migration and extracellular matrix deposition. Bves and NDRG4 colocalize in epicardial cells and cardiac myocytes, and their interaction is necessary for the recycling of fibronectin through the autocrine extracellular matrix pathway. Disruption of this interaction leads to randomized and accelerated cell migration (Benesh2013Bves).

In breast cancer cells, NDRG4 influences integrin-mediated adhesion and migration. NDRG4 knockdown affects β1-integrin clustering, leading to changes in cell motility and adhesion. This suggests that NDRG4 plays a role in integrin signaling pathways, impacting the metastatic behavior of cancer cells (Jandrey2019NDRG4).
