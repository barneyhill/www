# LBR

## Overview
The LBR gene encodes the Lamin B Receptor, a polytopic transmembrane protein located in the inner nuclear membrane. This protein plays a pivotal role in nuclear architecture by anchoring heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery and interacting with B-type lamins, thereby maintaining nuclear envelope stability (Ye1994Primary; Nikolakaki2017Lamin). In addition to its structural functions, LBR exhibits sterol reductase activity, contributing to cholesterol biosynthesis, which underscores its dual role in both nuclear structure and lipid metabolism (Worman2007“Laminopathies”:). Mutations in the LBR gene are implicated in various clinical conditions, including Pelger-Huët anomaly and Greenberg dysplasia, highlighting its significance in both cellular function and human health (Tsai2016The; Young2021Deletion).

## Structure
The Lamin B Receptor (LBR) is an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, characterized by a complex structure that includes a hydrophilic nucleoplasmic N-terminal domain and a hydrophobic domain with eight transmembrane segments (Ye1994Primary; Schuler1994Characterization). The N-terminal domain is responsible for interactions with chromatin and lamins, playing a crucial role in tethering heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery (Nikolakaki2017Lamin). This domain contains a region rich in serine and arginine, which includes consensus sites for phosphorylation by kinases such as SRPK1 and Akt, affecting its structure and localization (Ye1994Primary; Nikolakaki2017Lamin).

The hydrophobic domain of LBR exhibits sterol reductase activity, essential for cholesterol synthesis, and shares homology with other sterol reductases like TM7SF2 (Nikolakaki2017Lamin). LBR's structure allows it to function as a polytopic protein, with its transmembrane segments contributing to its role in sterol metabolism and nuclear architecture (Nikolakaki2017Lamin). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, influence LBR's interactions and oligomerization state, impacting chromatin organization and gene expression (Nikolakaki2017Lamin). The protein's evolutionary significance is highlighted by its dual role as a sterol metabolism enzyme and a structural component of the nuclear envelope (Nikolakaki2017Lamin).

## Function
The Lamin B Receptor (LBR) is an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, playing a crucial role in maintaining nuclear architecture and chromatin organization. In healthy human cells, LBR binds to B-type lamins and chromatin proteins, facilitating the attachment of the nuclear lamina to the inner nuclear membrane, which is essential for nuclear envelope stability and heterochromatin anchoring (Ye1994Primary; Worman2005Components). The amino-terminal domain of LBR interacts with lamin B and DNA, suggesting its involvement in chromatin organization and nuclear envelope integrity (Ye1994Primary).

LBR also exhibits sterol reductase activity, which is important for cholesterol synthesis, indicating a bi-functional role in both nuclear structure maintenance and lipid metabolism (Worman2007“Laminopathies”:; Worman2005Components). During cell division, LBR is involved in the reassembly of the nuclear envelope, where it binds to chromatin and facilitates the enclosure of nuclear material by endoplasmic reticulum membranes enriched in LBR (Ellenberg1997Nuclear). The protein's phosphorylation state influences its binding to lamin B, which is a key regulatory mechanism for lamina-nuclear membrane interactions (Appelbaum1990In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LBR gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting skeletal development and blood cell morphology. Pelger-Huët anomaly (PHA) is a benign condition characterized by hypolobulated neutrophil nuclei and hyposegmented granulocytes. It is a rare dominant disorder with a frequency between 0.01 and 0.1% of the population, though higher in some regions. PHA has been linked to severe blood disorders like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Young2021Deletion; Nikolakaki2017Lamin). 

Greenberg dysplasia is another condition linked to LBR mutations, characterized by severe skeletal abnormalities and is embryonic lethal (Tsai2016The; Young2021Deletion). Mutations in the LBR gene can also lead to non-lethal skeletal dysplasias, such as LBR-related regressive spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (LBR-R-SMD), which features skeletal abnormalities that may regress with age (Turgut2021Antenatal).

Alterations in LBR expression can impact cholesterol metabolism, as the protein is essential for cholesterol synthesis. Mutations affecting the sterol reductase domain of LBR can lead to a loss of function, disrupting cholesterol synthesis and causing metabolic instability (Shen2023Prenatal; Tsai2016The). These mutations can result in a spectrum of phenotypes, from mild to severe, depending on the specific genetic alteration (Thompson2019Lamin).

## Interactions
The Lamin B Receptor (LBR) is a multifunctional protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in nuclear envelope organization and chromatin dynamics. LBR binds to B-type lamins, specifically lamin B, which is essential for its function as a lamin B receptor (Ye1994Primary; Simos1992The). It also interacts with chromatin through its N-terminal domain, which binds to DNA and chromatin-associated proteins such as heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and histones H3/H4 (MattoutDrubezki2003Dynamic; Takano2002The). The RS region of LBR is particularly important for its interaction with chromatin DNA, while the NM region binds to chromatin proteins (Takano2002The).

LBR's interaction with HP1 is mediated through the chromo shadow domain of HP1, which is necessary for HP1's self-association and the formation of a quaternary complex with core histones, supporting chromatin organization (MattoutDrubezki2003Dynamic). Phosphorylation of LBR, particularly in the RS region, regulates its binding to chromatin, with phosphorylation enhancing or inhibiting this interaction depending on the cell cycle phase (Takano2002The; Nikolakaki2017Lamin). Additionally, LBR interacts with the chromatin-associated protein HA95 and can bind to dsDNA, further highlighting its role in chromatin anchoring and nuclear structure maintenance (MattoutDrubezki2003Dynamic).
