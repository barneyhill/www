# CCDC87

## Overview
The CCDC87 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 87 protein, which is a member of the coiled-coil domain-containing protein family. These proteins are characterized by their structural motif, the coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and is involved in various cellular processes. The CCDC87 protein is implicated in cellular signaling pathways and may play a role in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Research into CCDC87 is ongoing, with studies exploring its potential involvement in disease mechanisms and its utility as a biomarker for certain pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
