# FILIP1L

## Overview
FILIP1L is a gene that encodes the protein filamin A interacting protein 1-like, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein-protein interactions and DNA repair. The protein is characterized by several structural motifs, such as leucine zipper motifs and a coiled-coil region, which facilitate its role in cellular stability and interactions (Kwon2021FILIP1L; Kwon2008Functional). Notably, FILIP1L contains a conserved SbcC domain with ATPase activity, contributing to DNA repair mechanisms, and a Herpes_BLLF1 domain linked to antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities (Kwon2008Functional). The protein's interaction with prefoldin 1 (PFDN1) is crucial for maintaining centrosome function and preventing cytokinesis defects, which are implicated in cancer progression (Kwon2021FILIP1L). FILIP1L's downregulation is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Burton2011Downregulation; Kwon2021FILIP1L).

## Structure
The FILIP1L protein is composed of 893 amino acids and features several structural motifs and domains that contribute to its function. It includes two leucine zipper motifs located at residues 83-111 and 218-253, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (Kwon2021FILIP1L; Kwon2008Functional). The NH2 terminal half of the protein contains a coiled-coil region spanning residues 3-542, which is involved in structural stability and protein interactions (Kwon2008Functional). Within this region, a prefoldin domain is located at residues 465-535, which is involved in protein folding processes (Kwon2008Functional).

The protein also contains a conserved SbcC domain in its NH2 terminal half, which functions as an ATPase involved in DNA repair (Kwon2008Functional). In the COOH terminal half, there is a Herpes_BLLF1 domain associated with the Herpes virus major outer envelope glycoprotein (Kwon2008Functional). The COOH terminal region is significant for the protein's antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities, as demonstrated by the enhanced potency of the COOH terminal truncation mutant FILIP1LDC103 in inhibiting cell proliferation and migration (Kwon2008Functional). The structural components of FILIP1L, particularly these domains, play a crucial role in its function as a potential candidate for cancer therapy.

## Clinical Significance
The FILIP1L gene is clinically significant due to its role in various cancers, where its downregulation is often associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. In ovarian cancer, FILIP1L expression is significantly lower in invasive serous carcinomas compared to noninvasive serous borderline tumors. This downregulation is linked to DNA methylation of the FILIP1L promoter, which correlates with an invasive phenotype, suggesting that FILIP1L could serve as a biomarker for invasive potential and a target for therapy (Burton2011Downregulation).

In colorectal cancer, particularly mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma (MAC), FILIP1L loss is associated with cytokinesis defects and aneuploidy, contributing to the aggressive nature of these tumors. The interaction between FILIP1L and the chaperone protein PFDN1 is crucial, as FILIP1L stimulates the proteasomal degradation of PFDN1. Loss of FILIP1L leads to increased PFDN1 levels, resulting in cytokinesis defects and increased mucin secretion, characteristic of MAC (Kwon2021FILIP1L).

FILIP1L downregulation is also observed in other cancers, such as breast, colon, lung, and pancreatic cancers, where it is associated with increased invasion and metastasis, often due to promoter hypermethylation (Kwon2013DownRegulation; kwon2014filamin). These findings highlight the potential of targeting FILIP1L expression and its interactions as a therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
FILIP1L interacts with the protein prefoldin 1 (PFDN1), a molecular chaperone involved in the folding of cytoskeletal components such as actin and tubulins. This interaction was initially identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells. FILIP1L and PFDN1 colocalize at centrosomes during all phases of mitosis, suggesting a role in cytokinesis and cell division (Kwon2021FILIP1L). FILIP1L regulates PFDN1 levels at the centrosomes in a proteasome-dependent manner, enhancing the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PFDN1. This interaction requires the leucine zipper domain of FILIP1L (Kwon2021FILIP1L).

In colon cancer cells, FILIP1L knockdown leads to increased mucin secretion mediated by PFDN1. Overexpression of PFDN1 mimics the effects of FILIP1L knockdown, indicating a functional interaction between these proteins. The knockdown of PFDN1 in FILIP1L-deficient cells reduces mucin secretion, further supporting the role of PFDN1 as a mediator of this phenotype (Kwon2021FILIP1L). FILIP1L's interaction with PFDN1 is crucial for maintaining normal centrosome function and preventing cytokinesis defects, which are associated with aneuploidy and cancer progression (Kwon2021FILIP1L).
