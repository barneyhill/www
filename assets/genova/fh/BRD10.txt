# BRD10

## Overview
BRD10 is a gene that encodes the protein bromodomain containing 10, which is part of the bromodomain family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their ability to recognize acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling. Bromodomain containing 10 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and possibly influencing cell cycle progression and differentiation. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of BRD10 remain an active area of research, with ongoing studies aiming to elucidate its role in normal physiology and potential implications in disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
