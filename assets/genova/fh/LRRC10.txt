# LRRC10

## Overview
The LRRC10 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 10 protein, which is predominantly expressed in cardiac tissue. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for cardiac function. LRRC10 is a cardiac-specific protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and contractility of cardiomyocytes. It is involved in critical processes such as calcium cycling and excitation-contraction coupling, essential for proper cardiac muscle function. The protein's interaction with components of the cardiac cytoskeleton, such as α-actinin and actin, underscores its role in stabilizing the sarcomere and responding to mechanical stress. Mutations in the LRRC10 gene have been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac health (Brody2012Ablation; Brody2016The; Woon2018Pediatric).

## Structure
The LRRC10 protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. It contains seven LRRs, each consisting of sequences rich in leucine and other aliphatic amino acids, forming a solenoid-shaped structure that is ideal for mediating interactions with other proteins (Brody2012Ablation; Brody2016The). The LRRs in LRRC10 follow a specific consensus sequence: LxxLxLxxNxL xxLPxxIxxLxx, which is similar to LRR motifs found in other proteins and suggests a 3_10-helix structure (Matsushima2019Leucine).

LRRC10 is approximately 32 kDa in size and lacks other known functional domains beyond its LRRs, indicating that its molecular functions are primarily based on these protein interaction motifs (Brody2016The). The protein exhibits a striated expression pattern in adult cardiomyocytes, colocalizing with Z-line markers such as cardiac α-actinin, suggesting its role in cardiac muscle structure (Kim2007Dynamic). The protein's localization to the dyad region in cardiomyocytes, where it interacts with actin and α-actinin, further supports its involvement in cardiac function (Brody2016The). The specific molecular structure of LRRC10, including details on post-translational modifications or splice variants, is not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The LRRC10 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in cardiac function, particularly in maintaining the structural integrity and contractility of cardiac muscle cells. LRRC10 is primarily expressed in cardiomyocytes and is localized to the dyad region, where it interacts with actin and α-actinin at the Z-disc, as well as with T-tubule components. This localization is crucial for calcium cycling, excitation-contraction coupling, and calcium-sensitive hypertrophic signaling, as well as for sensing and responding to mechanical stress (Brody2016The).

LRRC10 functions as an auxiliary subunit of cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels, influencing their gating properties and modulating calcium currents, which are essential for cardiac muscle contraction. The wild-type LRRC10 enhances calcium currents through these channels, while certain mutations, such as I195T, can reduce these currents, potentially leading to dilated cardiomyopathy (Woon2018Pediatric).

In healthy cells, LRRC10 is involved in stabilizing the sarcomere from mechanical stress, acting as a biomechanical link between the Z-disc and the sarcolemma or cytoskeletal proteins. This role is critical for maintaining proper cardiac function and responding to mechanical stress or other stimuli (Brody2012Ablation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LRRC10 gene are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition characterized by the enlargement and weakening of the heart's ventricles, leading to impaired cardiac function. In particular, two mutations, p.L41V and p.L163I, have been identified in patients with idiopathic DCM. These mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with complete penetrance and are absent in control populations, suggesting a direct link to the disease (Brody2016The; QU2015Prevalence). 

LRRC10 is crucial for maintaining cardiac contractile function, especially under mechanical stress. Its deletion in mice results in prenatal systolic dysfunction and the development of DCM in postnatal life, indicating its essential role in cardiac health (Brody2012Ablation). The absence of LRRC10 leads to significant transcriptional changes in pathways related to the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion, which are critical for cardiac structure and function (Brody2012Ablation). 

Additionally, LRRC10 interacts with L-type calcium channels, and mutations can impair this interaction, leading to reduced calcium currents and contributing to cardiac dysfunction (Woon2018Pediatric). These findings underscore the gene's importance in cardiac pathophysiology and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
LRRC10 (leucine-rich repeat containing 10) is a cardiac-specific protein that participates in several critical interactions within cardiomyocytes. It interacts with α-actinin and α-actin, proteins essential for cardiomyocyte function, at the Z-disc. α-actinin crosslinks actin thin filaments of adjacent sarcomeres, while α-actin is a costameric actin isoform localizing to the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton at the Z-disc periphery (Brody2012Ablation; Brody2016The). Immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed these interactions, and immunostaining has shown colocalization of LRRC10 with these proteins in adult cardiomyocytes (Brody2012Ablation).

LRRC10 also functions as an auxiliary subunit of cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels, specifically interacting with the Ca v 1.2 subunit. This interaction modulates the biophysical properties of these channels, influencing calcium currents crucial for cardiac function. The I195T variant of LRRC10, associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, alters these interactions, reducing calcium currents and potentially contributing to disease pathology (Woon2018Pediatric). These interactions highlight LRRC10's role in both structural and signaling pathways within the heart, underscoring its importance in maintaining cardiac function and its potential involvement in cardiac diseases.
