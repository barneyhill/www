# CDHR3

## Overview
The CDHR3 gene encodes the cadherin-related family member 3 protein, which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the cadherin superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed on the apical surfaces of ciliated epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, where it plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion and signaling. The structure of CDHR3 includes six extracellular domains that are essential for its function, particularly in mediating interactions with rhinovirus C, a common cause of respiratory infections. The gene's expression is notably higher in immature and differentiating airway epithelial cells, indicating its involvement in cellular development and differentiation. Variations in the CDHR3 gene, such as the single nucleotide polymorphism rs6967330, have been associated with increased susceptibility to asthma exacerbations and other respiratory conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Watters2018CDHR3; Lutter2019Cadherinrelated; Basnet2019CDHR3).

## Structure
The CDHR3 protein is a member of the cadherin superfamily, characterized by its transmembrane calcium-dependent adhesion properties. It is primarily expressed in airway tissues, particularly on the apical surfaces of ciliated epithelial cells (Watters2018CDHR3). The protein structure includes six extracellular (EC) domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail. Each extracellular domain is approximately 110 amino acids long and typically forms a 7-stranded, antiparallel 'Greek key' motif, which is a common fold in cadherins (Watters2018CDHR3). These domains are linked by calcium ions, essential for maintaining the protein's rigidity and orientation (Watters2018CDHR3).

The EC1-3 domains are particularly important for interactions with rhinovirus C, with EC1 being critical for virus binding (Watters2018CDHR3). The protein's structure is similar to classical cadherins, with a rod-like arrangement of EC domains dependent on calcium binding (Watters2018CDHR3). CDHR3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at sites such as N186, N384, and N624 (Watters2018CDHR3). A notable single nucleotide polymorphism at position 529 results in either a tyrosine (Y529) or cysteine (C529) variant, affecting the protein's stability and surface expression (Watters2018CDHR3).

## Function
The CDHR3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the cadherin superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion processes. In healthy human cells, CDHR3 is primarily expressed on the apical surfaces of ciliated epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. It plays a significant role in the differentiation and polarization of these cells, contributing to the formation of motile cilia, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the airway epithelium (Lutter2019Cadherinrelated; Watters2018CDHR3).

CDHR3's function is closely linked to its ability to mediate cell surface interactions. The protein's extracellular domains, particularly EC1, are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling. These domains are calcium-dependent, which is essential for maintaining the protein's conformation and function (Watters2018CDHR3). CDHR3 may form dimers or oligomers on cell surfaces, which could enhance its role in cell-cell interactions (Watters2018CDHR3).

The gene's expression is higher in immature and differentiating airway epithelial cells, suggesting a role in early cellular development and differentiation (Lutter2019Cadherinrelated). CDHR3 is also involved in cellular signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation and tissue morphogenesis, contributing to the maintenance of epithelial barrier function (Watters2018CDHR3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDHR3 gene, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6967330, have been linked to several respiratory conditions. This SNP results in a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at position 529, which enhances the cell-surface expression of CDHR3 and increases susceptibility to rhinovirus C (RV-C) infections. These infections are associated with severe asthma exacerbations, particularly in young children (Lutter2019Cadherinrelated; Watters2018CDHR3; Basnet2019CDHR3).

The rs6967330-A allele is associated with higher CDHR3 expression levels, leading to increased RV-C binding and replication in airway epithelial cells. This heightened interaction contributes to the risk of asthma hospitalizations and severe wheezing illnesses in children (Watters2018CDHR3; Basnet2019CDHR3). The CDHR3 gene has also been implicated in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), with the rs6967330 allele increasing the odds of CRS in adults, independent of asthma (Chang2017Association).

In Chinese children, the rs6967330 SNP is linked to asthma and wheezing, with significant associations found in both preschool and school-age cohorts. This SNP, along with other CDHR3 variants, may serve as genetic biomarkers for predicting early-life wheezing and asthma susceptibility (Leung2019Cadherin‐related).

## Interactions
CDHR3, a cadherin-related protein, is primarily known for its interaction with rhinovirus C (RV-C), serving as a receptor that facilitates viral entry and infection. The extracellular domains EC1-3 of CDHR3 are crucial for this interaction, with the EC1 domain being particularly important for virus binding. Mutations within these domains, such as W76A, can enhance virus binding, while others like K43A and R166A reduce it (Watters2018CDHR3). The interaction is calcium-dependent, as calcium ions are necessary for maintaining the proper conformation of CDHR3 for effective virus binding (Watters2018CDHR3).

CDHR3 is also involved in the differentiation of ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and is highly expressed in these cells, which are targets for RV-C binding (Lutter2019Cadherinrelated; Basnet2019CDHR3). The protein's expression is linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs6967330, which affects its surface density and is associated with increased susceptibility to asthma exacerbations (Watters2018CDHR3; Basnet2019CDHR3). CDHR3's role in eosinophil activation has also been studied, where it enhances eosinophil adhesion and activation, potentially contributing to asthma exacerbations during RV infections (Nakagome2020Cadherin‐related).
