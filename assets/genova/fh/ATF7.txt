# ATF7

## Overview
ATF7 is a gene that encodes the activating transcription factor 7, a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which facilitates DNA binding and dimerization, allowing it to regulate gene expression by binding to cAMP response elements (CRE) in target promoters. ATF7 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, stress response, and metabolic regulation. It undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and sumoylation, which modulate its transcriptional activity and subcellular localization. The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers with other transcription factors like Jun and Fos, influencing its DNA-binding specificity and functional outcomes. ATF7 plays a significant role in metabolic and inflammatory conditions, as well as in maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Schaeffer2015ATF7; Hamard2005A; Camuzeaux2008p38β2Mediated).

## Structure
ATF7 is a transcription factor belonging to the ATF/CREB family, characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain that facilitates DNA binding and dimerization. The primary structure of ATF7 includes a zinc-binding element and two conserved threonine residues, Thr51 and Thr53, which are critical for its activation through phosphorylation (Hamard2005A; Camuzeaux2008p38β2Mediated). The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers with Jun or Fos proteins, influencing its DNA-binding specificity (Camuzeaux2008p38β2Mediated).

ATF7 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and sumoylation. Phosphorylation, mediated by p38β2 MAP kinase, occurs at Thr51, Thr53, and Thr112, enhancing its transcriptional activity by promoting interaction with TAF12 (Camuzeaux2008p38β2Mediated). Sumoylation at Lys118 inhibits transcriptional activity by affecting nuclear localization and interaction with TAF12, and is mutually exclusive with phosphorylation (Camuzeaux2008p38β2Mediated).

ATF7 exists in multiple isoforms, including ATF7-1, ATF7-2, and ATF7-3, which are produced through alternative splicing. These isoforms differ in their N-terminal regions but generally exhibit similar activities (Schaeffer2015ATF7; Hamard2005A). The ATF7-4 isoform is a C-terminally truncated variant that down-regulates the transcriptional activity of both ATF7 and ATF2 (Schaeffer2015ATF7).

## Function
ATF7 (activating transcription factor 7) is a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression, particularly during cell cycle progression. It is phosphorylated by the Cdk1-cyclin B1 complex at threonine residues Thr-51 and Thr-53 during the M phase, which is crucial for cell-cycle progression from the G2 phase to the M phase (Hasegawa2014Cdk1Mediated). This phosphorylation is essential for enabling Aurora kinase signaling, which is necessary for mitotic entry and progression (Hasegawa2014Cdk1Mediated). ATF7 also plays a role in the transition from M phase to G1 phase by regulating cyclin D1 expression, a key gene for cell cycle progression (Schaeffer2015ATF7).

ATF7 is structurally homologous to ATF2 and can heterodimerize with proteins such as c-Jun and c-Fos, influencing transcriptional activity through its interaction with TAF12, a subunit of the TFIID complex (Hamard2007Sumoylation). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to CRE elements within specific promoters, impacting cellular processes such as stress response and cell growth (Diring2011A). ATF7's activity is modulated by phosphorylation and sumoylation, which affect its transcriptional activity and subcellular localization (Camuzeaux2008p38β2Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ATF7 gene have been implicated in several metabolic and inflammatory conditions. ATF7 plays a role in diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Mice lacking ATF7 exhibit lower body weight, reduced adipose tissue mass, and increased insulin sensitivity, suggesting that ATF7 may contribute to obesity and related metabolic disorders by impairing adipose tissue development and function (Liu2016ATF7). 

ATF7 is also involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and thermogenic gene programming. Its loss promotes the browning of white adipose tissue, which can prevent diet-induced obesity and improve metabolic health (Liu2019The). 

In the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF), ATF7 mediates gene expression changes in the liver, potentially increasing susceptibility to metabolic diseases. ATF7-deficient mice show altered expression of metabolism-related genes, indicating its role in stress-induced epigenetic regulation (Liu2017The).

Additionally, ATF7 is crucial for maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity and repair mechanisms. Mice lacking ATF7 show increased sensitivity to colitis and impaired regenerative responses, highlighting its importance in protecting against intestinal damage (Meijer2020ATF2).

## Interactions
ATF7, a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, engages in various protein interactions that influence its transcriptional activity. It can heterodimerize with proteins such as Jun and Fos through its C-terminal leucine-zipper region, which is crucial for binding to CRE elements within specific promoters (Hamard2007Sumoylation). ATF7 also interacts with the adenovirus E1a oncoprotein, mediating part of its transcriptional activity (Hamard2005A).

ATF7 forms complexes with hsTAF12, a component of the general transcription factor TFIID, enhancing its transcriptional activation. This interaction is modulated by TAF4, which competes with TAF12, affecting ATF7's coactivator function (Hamard2005A). The interaction with TAF12 involves the N-terminal domains of both proteins and the TAF12 histone fold domain (Hamard2007Sumoylation).

ATF7 also associates with the Ku70/80 complex and TERT, forming a ternary complex that is disrupted upon TNF-α treatment, linked to the phosphorylation of ATF7 (Maekawa2018ATF7). Additionally, ATF7 interacts with the PRL-1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase, which can dephosphorylate ATF7, indicating a specific interaction involving ATF7's bZIP region and PRL-1's phosphatase domain (Peters2001ATF7).
