# OCEL1

## Overview
The OCEL1 gene encodes the occludin/ELL domain containing 1 protein, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular interactions and processes. This protein has been identified as a potential interaction partner for bacterial effectors, such as those from Legionella pneumophila, indicating its role in host-pathogen interactions (Yu2015Host–Pathogen). Despite its interactions with bacterial proteins, the precise cellular functions of OCEL1 remain to be fully elucidated. In the context of human health, OCEL1 expression is notably downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it is associated with poor prognosis and disease progression, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Deng2020Low). Additionally, OCEL1 has been linked to liver hepatocellular carcinoma through its negative association with TMCO3 expression, although the implications of this relationship require further investigation (Hu2022Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
The OCEL1 gene, encoding the occludin/ELL domain containing 1 protein, has been implicated in the clinical progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Research indicates that OCEL1 expression is significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to normal lung tissues. This downregulation is associated with a poor prognosis, higher TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis, suggesting that OCEL1 plays a critical role in the disease's progression (Deng2020Low).

Low expression levels of OCEL1 have been identified as an independent predictor of unfavorable prognosis in NSCLC. Patients with reduced OCEL1 expression exhibit poorer overall survival and shorter post-progression survival. The study highlights the potential of OCEL1 as a prognostic biomarker, with its expression levels effectively distinguishing NSCLC from normal tissues, as demonstrated by an area under the ROC curve of 0.922 (Deng2020Low).

These findings suggest that alterations in OCEL1 expression may contribute to the aggressive nature of NSCLC, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms by which OCEL1 influences cancer progression and to validate its utility in clinical settings (Deng2020Low).

## Interactions
OCEL1 (occludin/ELL domain containing 1) has been identified as a potential interaction partner for the Legionella pneumophila effectors SidM and LidA. Using a high-throughput interaction assay with NAPPA technology, OCEL1 was found to interact with both SidM and LidA, suggesting a specific interaction (Yu2015Host–Pathogen). In vitro studies using bead-immobilized LidA as bait confirmed a robust interaction between LidA and OCEL1, although OCEL1 did not localize to the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) during infection, indicating it may not be involved in LCV localization (Yu2015Host–Pathogen).

OCEL1 is also AMPylated by SidM, highlighting its interaction with this bacterial protein (Yu2015Host–Pathogen). Despite these interactions, OCEL1's role in cellular processes remains unclear, as it was not detected on or around the LCV during infection, suggesting it may not be recruited as part of the L. pneumophila pathogenesis program (Yu2015Host–Pathogen).

Additionally, OCEL1 has been identified as one of the top ten genes negatively associated with TMCO3 expression in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, although the specific nature of this interaction is not detailed (Hu2022Transmembrane).
