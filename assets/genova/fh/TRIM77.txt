# TRIM77

## Overview
TRIM77 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 77, which is part of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are involved in various cellular processes, including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The TRIM77 protein is implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, where mutations in the TRIM77 gene have been associated with poor prognosis and liver metastasis (Peng2021Prognostic). The protein's role in cancer biology suggests it may be involved in the mechanisms underlying tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Peng2021Prognostic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TRIM77 mutations have been identified as significant prognostic factors in colorectal cancer patients, particularly those with liver metastasis. These mutations are present exclusively in primary cancer tissues of patients with liver metastasis, suggesting a potential role in indicating liver metastasis. The presence of TRIM77 mutations is associated with poor prognosis and survival, marking them as independent risk factors for these patients (Peng2021Prognostic). The study by Peng et al. highlights that TRIM77 mutations are statistically significant in patients with liver metastasis, indicating distinct genetic origins and driving factors for liver metastasis in colorectal cancer (Peng2021Prognostic). The mutational frequency of the TRIM77 gene is significantly higher in patients with liver metastasis, making it the only independent risk factor identified for colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis (Peng2021Prognostic). These findings suggest that TRIM77 mutations could serve as genetic indicators for liver metastasis and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients, potentially correlating with subpopulations of primary cancer cells that migrate to the liver, indicating a role in metastasis and malignancy (Peng2021Prognostic).
