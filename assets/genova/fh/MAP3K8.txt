# MAP3K8

## Overview
MAP3K8 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8, also known as TPL-2. This protein is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K), playing a pivotal role in the MAPK signaling pathway. It is involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses by activating downstream kinases such as ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases, which are essential for various cellular processes (Gantke2010Regulation; Glossop2009Effect). MAP3K8 is crucial for the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the regulation of cytokine production, influencing both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (Gantke2010Regulation). The protein interacts with several other proteins, including NF-κB1 p105 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), which modulate its activity and stability (Chan2005TRAFdependent; Gantke2010Regulation). MAP3K8 has significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where its overexpression and rearrangements are associated with tumor progression and resistance to certain therapies (Lehmann2019Identification; Roy2023Epigenetic).

## Function
MAP3K8, also known as TPL-2, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in the MAPK signaling pathway, particularly in immune and inflammatory responses. It functions as a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K), activating downstream kinases such as ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases, which are crucial for various cellular processes (Gantke2010Regulation; Glossop2009Effect). In unstimulated cells, MAP3K8 is complexed with NF-κB1 p105, which inhibits its activity. Upon stimulation, the IKK complex phosphorylates p105, leading to its degradation and the release of MAP3K8, which then activates MEK and modulates NF-κB activation (Gantke2010Regulation).

MAP3K8 is essential for the production of TNF during inflammatory responses and is involved in the regulation of cytokine production, influencing both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (Gantke2010Regulation). It is also implicated in the differentiation of T cells and the regulation of immune responses to pathogens (Gantke2010Regulation). In human mesenchymal stem cells, MAP3K8 is upregulated in response to mechanical stress, indicating its role in mechanotransduction and cellular adaptation to mechanical stimuli (Glossop2009Effect).

## Clinical Significance
MAP3K8, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in key signaling pathways. In Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC), MAP3K8 is overexpressed, contributing to cancer progression through the activation of the Notch signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Roy2023Epigenetic). Its expression is also elevated in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) tissues, correlating with advanced disease stages (Roy2023Epigenetic).

In renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC), MAP3K8 is overexpressed and associated with poor overall survival. It influences tumor-related inflammation and immune responses, affecting pathways like I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB and toll-like receptor signaling (Hao2021Effect). MAP3K8 rearrangements are identified in melanomas lacking known driver mutations, where they contribute to tumorigenesis by preventing protein degradation. These rearrangements are associated with decreased overall survival and suggest sensitivity to MEK and ERK inhibitors (Lehmann2019Identification).

In Spitz melanoma, MAP3K8 alterations, such as fusions, are common and contribute to resistance against BRAF inhibitors (Newman2019Pathologic). These findings highlight MAP3K8 as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
MAP3K8, also known as TPL-2, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate its activity and stability. It interacts with NF-κB1 p105, which is crucial for maintaining TPL-2 stability and inhibiting its MEK kinase activity. In unstimulated cells, TPL-2 is associated with p105, preventing it from phosphorylating MEK. Upon stimulation, such as with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TPL-2 is released from p105, allowing it to activate MEK and downstream ERK MAP kinase signaling (Gantke2010Regulation).

TPL-2 also interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), particularly TRAF2 and TRAF6, which modulate its activity. TPL-2 is recruited to the CD40 receptor complex through TRAF-binding sites, and its phosphorylation is induced by TRAF2 and TRAF6. This interaction is important for the activation of IKK and NFκB, suggesting that TPL-2 acts as a downstream effector of TRAFs (Chan2005TRAFdependent).

Additionally, TPL-2 interacts with ABIN-2, which is important for its stability. The regulation of TPL-2 through these interactions highlights its role in immune response and inflammation (Gantke2010Regulation).
