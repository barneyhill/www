# GPHB5

## Overview
GPHB5 is a gene that encodes the glycoprotein hormone subunit beta 5, a member of the glycoprotein hormone family. This protein is characterized by its structural features, including a cystine-knot motif, which is crucial for its stability and ability to form dimers. Unlike other glycoprotein hormone subunits, GPHB5 has a unique N-glycosylation site and a shorter carboxy-terminal end, which influences its secretion and activation properties. The protein primarily interacts with glycoprotein alpha 2 (GPA2) to form the heterodimer thyrostimulin, which is more potent than thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in activating the TSH receptor. Despite its potential role in thyroid function, the physiological significance of GPHB5 remains unclear, as no specific receptor has been identified for the GPA2/GPB5 heterodimer in vertebrates, and its function appears to be more localized, acting as an autocrine or paracrine factor (Amoroso2016Multigenic; Querat2021Unconventional).

## Structure
The GPHB5 gene encodes the glycoprotein hormone subunit beta 5, which is part of the glycoprotein hormone family. This subunit shares structural characteristics with other glycoprotein hormone subunits, including a similar cysteine residue arrangement and the cystine-knot motif, which is a hallmark of the cystine-knot protein superfamily (Querat2021Unconventional). The cystine-knot motif contributes to the protein's tertiary structure, providing stability and allowing for the formation of homo or heterodimers (Querat2021Unconventional).

GPHB5 has only one N-glycosylated site, which is located differently compared to other glycoprotein hormone beta subunits. This glycosylation impacts the protein's secretion and activation abilities (Querat2021Unconventional). The carboxy-terminal end of GPHB5 is notably shorter than in other glycoprotein hormone beta subunits, lacking the two cysteine residues involved in the 'seatbelt' mechanism crucial for dimer stability in circulation (Querat2021Unconventional).

In its quaternary structure, GPHB5 can combine with glycoprotein alpha 2 (GPA2) to form a heterodimer known as thyrostimulin, which is more potent than thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in activating the TSH receptor (Querat2021Unconventional). The heterodimer's instability suggests it may act more as an autocrine or paracrine factor rather than an endocrine factor (Querat2021Unconventional).

## Function
The GPHB5 gene encodes the glycoprotein hormone subunit beta 5, which is part of the glycoprotein hormone family. In humans, GPHB5 can combine with the GPA2 subunit to form a heterodimer known as thyrostimulin. This heterodimer is more potent than thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in activating the TSH receptor (TSHR) but does not activate the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) or follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) (Querat2021Unconventional). The GPA2/GPB5 heterodimer is suggested to act more as an autocrine or paracrine factor due to its labile stability, with localized effects rather than systemic endocrine functions (Querat2021Unconventional).

The expression of GPHB5 is primarily observed in the pituitary gland, where it is involved in the hypothalamus-pituitary peripheral tissue (HPT) axis. It is known to activate TSH receptors, suggesting a role in thyroid function (Amoroso2016Multigenic). Despite its ability to form a functional heterodimer with GPA2, no specific receptor has been identified for the GPA2/GPB5 heterodimer in vertebrates, and its precise physiological role remains unclear (Dos2011Emergence). The absence of significant health issues in mice lacking GPB5 suggests that its role may not be critical under normal physiological conditions (Querat2021Unconventional).

## Interactions
The human GPHB5 protein, also known as glycoprotein hormone subunit beta 5, primarily interacts with the GPA2 subunit to form a heterodimer known as thyrostimulin. This heterodimer is capable of activating the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) in mammals, although it does not activate the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) or the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) (Querat2021Unconventional). The GPA2/GPB5 heterodimer binds to partially overlapping sites on the TSHR and is more potent than thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in displacing TSH binding (Querat2021Unconventional).

In invertebrates, the GPA/GPB heterodimer can activate the fly LGR-1 receptor, indicating a functional relationship, although no conserved role has been identified across different species (Querat2021Unconventional). The heterodimer's stability is affected by the absence of an extended C-terminus in GPHB5, which impacts its activity (Buechi2017Evolution). Despite these interactions, no specific receptor has been identified for the GPA2/GPB5 heterodimer in vertebrates, and its physiological function remains unclear (Querat2021Unconventional).
