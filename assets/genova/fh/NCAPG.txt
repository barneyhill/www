# NCAPG

## Overview
The NCAPG gene encodes the non-SMC condensin I complex subunit G, a crucial component of the condensin I complex involved in chromosome condensation and stabilization during mitosis and meiosis. This protein plays a vital role in maintaining chromosomal architecture and ensuring accurate segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells, which is essential for genomic integrity and proper cell division (Xiao2020NCAPG; Gong2019&lt). As a nuclear protein, NCAPG is integral to the structural maintenance of chromosomes and is involved in cell cycle regulation and organismal development (Xiao2020NCAPG). Beyond its fundamental role in cell division, NCAPG is implicated in various signaling pathways, particularly in cancer, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Zhang2022NCAPG; Shi2022NCAPG).

## Function
The NCAPG gene encodes a subunit of the condensin I complex, which is essential for chromosome condensation and stabilization during mitosis and meiosis. This function is crucial for the proper segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells, ensuring accurate cell division and maintaining genomic integrity (p&gt; NCAPG; Xiao2020NCAPG; Gong2019&lt). NCAPG is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the structural maintenance of chromosomes, playing a vital role in cell cycle regulation and organismal development (Xiao2020NCAPG).

In healthy human cells, NCAPG's primary role is related to its involvement in the cell cycle, particularly in chromosome condensation and stabilization during cell division. This process is essential for maintaining chromosomal architecture and ensuring the fidelity of cell division, which is critical for normal cellular function and development (Xiao2020NCAPG). The protein's activity in the nucleus underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability, which is fundamental for healthy cell proliferation and organismal growth (Xiao2020NCAPG).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NCAPG gene are significantly associated with various cancers. NCAPG is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and colorectal cancer, where it is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Shi2022NCAPG; Xiao2020NCAPG). In HCC, high NCAPG expression correlates with poor survival and is considered an independent risk factor for mortality (Xiao2020NCAPG). In breast cancer, NCAPG upregulation is associated with negative estrogen and progesterone receptor status and positive HER2 status, indicating a poor prognosis (Dong2021NCAPG).

In lung adenocarcinoma, NCAPG promotes tumor progression through the TGF-β signaling pathway, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Wu2021NCAPG). In colorectal cancer, NCAPG facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Shi2022NCAPG). Conversely, NCAPG is downregulated in certain hematologic malignancies, such as lymphoblastic acute myeloid leukemia, where its reduced expression is linked to chromosome cohesion defects (Xiao2020NCAPG).

NCAPG's involvement in multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and NF-κB, underscores its role in cancer progression and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024Important).

## Interactions
NCAPG, a component of the condensin I complex, plays a significant role in chromosomal organization and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. It forms part of the condensin complex I by interacting with other subunits such as NCAPH and NCAPD2, which is essential for maintaining chromosome stability and ensuring correct segregation during mitosis (Li2024Important). The NCAPG-NCAPH subcomplex specifically interacts with both double- and single-stranded DNA, facilitating proper chromosome assembly and segregation (Li2024Important).

In addition to its role in chromosomal maintenance, NCAPG is involved in several signaling pathways through its interactions with other proteins. In colorectal cancer, NCAPG interacts with β-catenin, activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and invasion (Shi2022NCAPG). In hepatocellular carcinoma, NCAPG interacts with CKII, enhancing the phosphorylation of PTEN and promoting cell proliferation through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (Zhang2022NCAPG). NCAPG also interacts with LGALS1 in non-small cell lung cancer, contributing to tumor progression (Sun2022NCAPG). These interactions highlight NCAPG's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
