# TNS3

## Overview
TNS3 is a gene that encodes the protein tensin 3, a member of the tensin family of proteins, which are integral to cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and cytoskeletal organization. Tensin 3 is characterized by its actin-binding domain (ABD) and its C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which facilitate interactions with actin filaments and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, respectively. These interactions are crucial for focal adhesion dynamics and signal transduction pathways (Zhang2023Tensin3; Park2022Tensin). The protein is involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and plays a significant role in maintaining cell shape and function through its interactions with integrins and actin filaments (Zhang2023Tensin3; Park2019Tensin3). Alterations in TNS3 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shen2021A; Martuszewska2009Tensin3).

## Structure
Tensin 3 (TNS3) is a member of the tensin family of proteins, characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in cellular processes. The primary structure of TNS3 includes a sequence of 1445 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 155,265 Da (Cui2004Epidermal). The protein contains an actin-binding domain (ABD) at the N-terminus, which facilitates interaction with actin filaments, and a C-terminal region that includes Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains. These domains enable TNS3 to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and integrin receptors, playing a crucial role in focal adhesion and signal transduction (Zhang2023Tensin3; Park2022Tensin).

The SH2 and PTB domains are involved in interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine residues, which are important for the protein's role in signaling pathways (Martuszewska2009Tensin3). TNS3 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and functions (Cui2004Epidermal). The protein may exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can result in variations in its functional properties (Juilland2022Malt1dependent).

## Function
Tensin-3 (TNS3) is a protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion, migration, and cytoskeletal organization. It is involved in the differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. TNS3 expression is crucial for osteogenic differentiation, where it enhances calcium phosphate deposition and mineralization, while inhibiting adipogenic differentiation (Zhang2023Tensin3). TNS3 influences cytoskeletal reorganization, particularly actin filament rearrangement, which is essential for osteoblast differentiation (Zhang2023Tensin3).

In tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs), TNS3 regulates integrin-mediated processes, affecting cell proliferation and differentiation. It maintains the active form of integrin β1 (ITGβ1), which is important for cell adhesion and signaling (Park2019Tensin3). TNS3's interaction with integrins and actin filaments contributes to focal adhesion dynamics, influencing cell motility and tissue development (Park2022Tensin). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it forms a stable integrin-TNS-actin complex, crucial for maintaining cell shape and function (Park2022Tensin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TNS3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lung adenocarcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In RCC, TNS3 is downregulated, which correlates with increased cell motility and a higher tumor grade, suggesting its role as a negative regulator of cell migration and metastasis (Martuszewska2009Tensin3). In NSCLC, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNS3, such as rs34211819, have been associated with survival outcomes in long-term former smokers, indicating a potential gene-environment interaction affecting prognosis (Shen2021A).

TNS3 expression is also linked to the regulation of migration-related genes, such as ADAM12 and COL5A3, and its depletion is associated with increased expression of these genes, contributing to enhanced cell migration and poor prognosis in cancers like kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (Zheng2021MLL3). Additionally, a chromosomal translocation involving TNS3 and EXOC6B has been associated with impaired kidney development and function, highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining normal cellular processes (Ludwig2013Functional). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TNS3 in cancer progression and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Interactions
Tensin 3 (TNS3) is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. TNS3 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is involved in the disassembly of EGF-related signaling complexes at focal adhesions. This interaction is enhanced upon EGF stimulation, leading to the dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and p130Cas, and the dissociation of the tensin3-FAK-p130Cas complex (Cui2004Epidermal).

TNS3 also interacts with talin and vinculin, which are essential for the formation of fibronectin-associated fibrillar adhesions. The central intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of TNS3 is crucial for its interaction with talin and vinculin, and this interaction is necessary for fibronectin fibrillogenesis (Atherton2021Tensin3). TNS3 binds to talin through a specific helical motif within its IDR, termed the H1 motif, which is identified as a talin binding site (Atherton2021Tensin3).

In osteoclasts, TNS3 interacts with Dock5, a regulator of osteoclast adhesion and activity, and is involved in the organization of podosome superstructures (Touaitahuata2016Tensin). These interactions highlight TNS3's role as a key adaptor protein in various cellular processes.
