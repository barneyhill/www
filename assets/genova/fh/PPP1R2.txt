# PPP1R2

## Overview
The PPP1R2 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 2, a critical regulatory protein involved in the modulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity. As a regulatory subunit, PPP1R2 functions primarily as an inhibitor of PP1, a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, mitosis, and cytokinesis (Bresch2020The). The protein is characterized as an intrinsically unstructured protein (IUP), which allows it to interact flexibly with various partners, including Aurora A kinase (AURKA) and PP1, to regulate centrosome dynamics and ensure proper cell division (KorrodiGregório2013Identification; Bresch2020The). The phosphorylation state of PPP1R2 is crucial for its regulatory functions, influencing its interactions and inhibitory capacity (Bresch2020The). Through these interactions, PPP1R2 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing aberrant cell division, which can lead to pathological conditions (Bresch2020The).

## Structure
The PPP1R2 protein is an intrinsically unstructured protein (IUP) with a high proportion of charged and hydrophilic residues, which affects its migration in SDS-PAGE, causing it to appear at a higher molecular mass than predicted by its primary sequence (KorrodiGregório2013Identification). The predicted molecular mass of PPP1R2 is 23 kDa, but it migrates at 32 kDa in SDS-PAGE (KorrodiGregório2013Identification). PPP1R2 forms a stable, catalytically inactive heterodimer with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1C), indicating its quaternary structure (KorrodiGregório2013Identification).

The protein contains specific motifs for interaction with PPP1C, such as the SILK and KSQKW motifs, which are conserved across related proteins (KorrodiGregório2013Not). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating PPP1R2's activity. Phosphorylation sites include Ser121, Ser122, and a novel site at Ser127, although these modifications could not be distinctly assigned to either PPP1R2 or its isoform PPP1R2P3 due to identical sequences in that region (KorrodiGregório2013Identification). The phosphorylation state of PPP1R2 is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as AURKA and PP1, affecting processes like centrosome regulation and cytokinesis (Bresch2020The).

## Function
The protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 2 (PPP1R2) plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression, particularly during mitosis and cytokinesis, in healthy human cells. It functions as a heat-stable inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a key enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including centrosome biology, mitosis, and cytokinesis (Bresch2020The). PPP1R2 interacts with Aurora A kinase (AURKA) and PP1, both essential for proper cell division. It regulates the G2/M transition by binding and activating AURKA, while also opposing AURKA activity to prevent the accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes (Bresch2020The).

PPP1R2 is involved in centrosome separation, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Its overexpression can lead to an increase in centrosome number, cell ploidy, and disrupted cytokinesis, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal centrosome numbers and ensuring accurate chromosome distribution during cell division (Bresch2020The). The phosphorylation state of PPP1R2 influences its ability to inhibit PP1 phosphatase activity, with glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylating and inactivating PPP1R2, thereby activating PP1 (Bresch2020The). PPP1R2 targets PP1 to the midbody, a crucial action for regulating events prior to abscission during cytokinesis (Bresch2020The).

## Interactions
PPP1R2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It forms a complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), inhibiting its phosphatase activity, which is crucial for regulating cell division and centrosome function (KorrodiGregório2013Identification; Bresch2020The). PPP1R2 also interacts with Aurora A kinase (AURKA), and this interaction is essential for maintaining proper centrosome numbers and spindle architecture during cell division. The C-terminal region of PPP1R2 is particularly important for binding AURKA, which in turn affects the phosphorylation state and activity of both AURKA and PP1 (Bresch2020The).

In human spermatozoa, PPP1R2 interacts with the phosphatase PPP1CC2, which is involved in sperm motility. This interaction involves specific binding motifs, and PPP1R2 acts as a reversible inhibitor of PPP1CC2. A related protein, PPP1R2P3, also interacts with PPP1CC2 but lacks key phosphorylation sites, suggesting it may serve as an irreversible inhibitor (KorrodiGregório2013Identification). These interactions highlight the regulatory role of PPP1R2 in various cellular contexts, including cell division and sperm function.
