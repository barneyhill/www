# NUMB

## Overview
The NUMB gene encodes the NUMB endocytic adaptor protein, which plays a pivotal role in cell fate determination and various cellular processes, including endocytosis and cell migration. As an endocytic adaptor protein, NUMB is characterized by its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and C-terminal endocytic-binding motifs, which facilitate interactions with multiple proteins and peptides, influencing receptor trafficking and cell adhesion (Dho2006Dynamic; Li1998Structure). The protein is involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways, such as Notch and TP53, and acts as a tumor suppressor in several cancers, including breast cancer, where its loss is associated with poor prognosis (Pece2004Loss; Pece2011NUMB-ing). NUMB's interactions with proteins like p120 catenin and α-adaptin underscore its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing cell fate decisions (Sato2011Numb; Tokumitsu2006Phosphorylation).

## Structure
The NUMB protein is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its role as an endocytic adaptor involved in cell fate determination. It contains an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which is crucial for its interactions with various proteins and peptides. This domain is known for its ability to bind diverse peptide motifs, including those that do not necessarily contain the NPXY motif typically associated with PTB domains (Zwahlen2000Multiple; Li1998Structure). The PTB domain has a β-sandwich structure with two antiparallel β-sheets and a C-terminal α-helix, similar to other PTB domains like Shc and IRS-1 (Zwahlen2000Multiple).

NUMB also features C-terminal endocytic-binding motifs, including DPF and NPF motifs, which are essential for its localization to the cortical membrane and interaction with proteins such as AP2 and Eps15 (Dho2006Dynamic). These motifs are conserved across all NUMB isoforms and the related Numblike protein (Dho2006Dynamic).

The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in four isoforms, with two (p66 and p72) associating with the cortical membrane (Dho2006Dynamic). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating NUMB's localization and function, particularly in response to G protein-coupled receptor activation and protein kinase C activation (Dho2006Dynamic).

## Function
The NUMB protein functions as an endocytic adaptor involved in various cellular processes, including receptor trafficking and cell migration. In healthy human cells, NUMB plays a critical role in the endocytosis of several receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and transferrin receptor (TfR), by translocating from the trans-Golgi network to endocytic compartments upon receptor internalization (Santolini2000Numb). NUMB also facilitates the endocytosis of integrins, specifically integrin-β1 and integrin-β3, which is essential for directional cell migration. This process is crucial for cell movement toward integrin substrates, although it does not affect cell adhesion or spreading (Nishimura2007Numb).

NUMB is involved in the regulation of E-cadherin endocytosis, a key process for maintaining cell-cell adhesion and polarity in epithelial cells. It interacts with p120 catenin and E-cadherin at cell contact sites, and its depletion impairs E-cadherin internalization, thereby strengthening cell-cell adhesion (Sato2011Numb). NUMB's function is modulated by phosphorylation through atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), which affects its interactions and localization, influencing processes like integrin endocytosis and E-cadherin trafficking (Sato2011Numb; Nishimura2007Numb).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NUMB gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. NUMB acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating key signaling pathways, including Notch, Hedgehog, and TP53. In breast cancer, loss of NUMB expression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor phenotypes, often due to enhanced ubiquitination and degradation rather than genetic mutations (Pece2004Loss; Pece2011NUMB-ing). This loss leads to overactivation of the Notch pathway and suppression of TP53 activity, contributing to increased cell proliferation and chemoresistance (Pece2011NUMB-ing; Rennstam2009Numb).

NUMB's role in cancer extends to other malignancies, such as non-small cell lung carcinomas and chronic myelogenous leukemia, where its reduced expression is linked to disease progression (Pece2011NUMB-ing). In these contexts, NUMB's interaction with signaling pathways is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its loss can lead to tumorigenic progression (Gulino2010The).

Therapeutic strategies targeting NUMB degradation or restoring its expression are being explored, as they may enhance tumor suppressor functions and improve treatment outcomes in cancers with poor prognosis (Pece2004Loss; Rennstam2009Numb).

## Interactions
NUMB, an endocytic adaptor protein, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. NUMB directly binds to p120 catenin, a component of the E-cadherin complex, which is essential for regulating E-cadherin endocytosis in epithelial cells. This interaction is critical for maintaining cell adhesion and polarity (Sato2011Numb). NUMB also associates with α-adaptin, a subunit of the AP-2 complex, which is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation, which can impair NUMB's binding to the AP-2 complex (Tokumitsu2006Phosphorylation).

In the context of neural stem cells, NUMB interacts with α-adaptin to regulate the endocytosis of Notch pathway components, influencing cell fate decisions (Song2012Interaction). NUMB also interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), affecting its trafficking and processing in an isoform-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of amyloid-beta production, which has implications in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Kyriazis2008Numb). These interactions highlight NUMB's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and endocytosis.
