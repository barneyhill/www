# RANBP9

## Overview
RANBP9 is a gene that encodes the RAN binding protein 9, a multifunctional scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by several domains, including SPRY, LisH, CTLH, and CRA, which facilitate its interactions with multiple proteins and its participation in diverse signaling pathways (Bowman2008The). RAN binding protein 9 is a component of the CTLH complex, an E3 ligase complex, and plays a significant role in protein turnover, apoptosis regulation, transcriptional activity, and spermatogenesis (Bao2014RANBinding; Salemi2017Cell). It is also implicated in disease pathogenesis, particularly in cancer and Alzheimer's disease, where it influences cell signaling and amyloid-beta generation (Wu2019Reduced; Wang2014RanBP9). The protein's ability to interact with a wide range of cellular components underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
RANBP9 is a 729-amino acid protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its multifunctional role in cellular processes. The protein features a long stretch of prolines and glutamines at the N terminus, which is considered a low-complexity region (LCR) and is hypothesized to be intrinsically disordered (Dhakal2020Cloning). This region is rich in glycine, alanine, proline, and serine, accounting for 80% of its sequence (Dhakal2020Cloning).

RANBP9 contains a SPRY domain, a LisH domain, a CTLH domain, and a CRA motif at the C terminus (Bowman2008The). These domains facilitate its role as a scaffolding protein, allowing it to interact with various proteins across different subcellular locations (Bowman2008The). The protein is involved in several signaling cascades and can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and sumoylation (Bowman2008The).

RANBP9 can form complexes with other proteins, indicating a potential quaternary structure. It is part of the CTLH complex, an E3 ligase structure that includes its paralog RANBP10 and other proteins (Soliman2020Tagging). Splice variant isoforms of RANBP9 have been identified, which may influence its functional diversity.

## Function
RANBP9, also known as RanBPM, is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. It acts as a scaffolding protein due to its multiple protein-protein interaction domains, including SPRY, LisH, CTLH, and CRA domains, which facilitate its involvement in diverse cellular functions (Salemi2017Cell). RANBP9 is part of the CTLH complex, which is implicated in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, suggesting a role in protein turnover (Salemi2017Cell).

In healthy human cells, RANBP9 is involved in regulating apoptosis by modulating members of the Bcl-2 family and interacting with proteins such as HIPK2 and p75NTR, leading to increased caspase activation and mitochondrial membrane permeability (Salemi2017Cell). It also plays a role in transcription regulation by associating with chromatin and interacting with transcription factors, influencing transcriptional activity in a ligand-dependent manner (Salemi2017Cell).

RANBP9 is critical for male germ cell development and fertility, particularly in spermatogenesis. It is involved in alternative splicing, interacting with splicing factors and poly(A) binding proteins, and regulating the expression of over 2,300 mRNAs crucial for spermatogenesis (Bao2014RANBinding). The protein is predominantly localized in the nuclei of spermatocytes and spermatids, with higher levels in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (Bao2014RANBinding).

## Clinical Significance
RANBP9 (RAN binding protein 9) is implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and Alzheimer's disease, due to its role in cellular signaling and apoptosis. In cancer, RANBP9 acts as a tumor suppressor in several contexts. It is involved in the regulation of apoptosis by modulating Bcl-2 family proteins and stabilizing pro-apoptotic factors like p73, which suggests its potential role in tumor suppression (Salemi2017Cell). In osteosarcoma, the RanBP9/TSSC3 complex inhibits the Src-mediated Akt signaling pathway, reducing anoikis resistance and metastasis, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor (Dai2016RanBP9TSSC3). Reduced expression of RANBP9 in colorectal cancer is associated with poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Wu2019Reduced).

In Alzheimer's disease, RANBP9 overexpression accelerates synaptic protein loss and increases amyloid plaque burden, contributing to cognitive deficits. It affects APP processing, leading to increased production of toxic Ab fragments, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's pathology (Wang2014RanBP9). These findings suggest that RANBP9's dysregulation can significantly impact disease progression in both cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
RANBP9, also known as RanBPM, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is a component of the CTLH complex, a multi-subunit E3 ligase complex, where it interacts with proteins such as Muskelin, ARMC8, and WDR26 (Kobayashi2007RanBPM; Soliman2020Tagging). RANBP9 also interacts with Nucleolin, a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and chromatin structure, suggesting a role in nucleic acid-related processes (Soliman2020Tagging).

RANBP9 has been shown to interact with several signaling molecules, including cell surface receptors and nuclear receptors. It acts as a transcriptional co-activator for steroid and hormone nuclear receptors, such as the androgen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor (Maitland2022Structural). It also interacts with the MET receptor, influencing cell motility and signaling pathways (Kobayashi2007RanBPM; Salemi2017Cell).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, RANBP9 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and BACE1, enhancing amyloid-beta generation and plaque deposition (Esteves2012Protein). These interactions highlight RANBP9's role in both normal cellular functions and disease pathogenesis.
