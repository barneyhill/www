# CTTN

## Overview
The CTTN gene encodes the protein cortactin, a key actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and various cellular processes. Cortactin is characterized by its ability to interact with the Arp2/3 complex, promoting actin polymerization and facilitating cell motility and migration. It is categorized as an actin-binding protein due to its role in modulating actin dynamics. The protein is integral to maintaining cellular structure and function, particularly in processes such as lamellipodia formation and endothelial barrier integrity. Cortactin's interactions with other proteins, such as VE-cadherin and β-catenin, underscore its importance in cellular junction stability and vascular permeability. Additionally, cortactin is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and respiratory diseases, due to its involvement in cell migration and invasion (Bandela2022Cortactin; MacGrath2012Cortactin; Moztarzadeh2024Cortactin).

## Structure
Cortactin (CTTN) is a protein encoded by the CTTN gene, characterized by several distinct structural domains. The protein includes an N-terminal acidic (NTA) domain, which is crucial for binding and activating the Arp2/3 complex, facilitating actin polymerization (BUDAY2007Roles). Following the NTA domain, cortactin contains six-and-a-half tandem repeats, each 37 amino acids long, which are essential for binding to filamentous actin (F-actin) (Kinley2003Cortactin). The fourth repeat is particularly important for F-actin binding, while the third and fifth repeats enhance binding efficiency (Lua2005Cortactin).

Cortactin also features a proline-rich region (PRR) that contains several phosphorylation sites, including tyrosine residues Y421, Y466, and Y482, which are targets for Src kinase and play a role in regulating actin dynamics and cell migration (Bandela2022Cortactin; Lua2005Cortactin). The C-terminal Src Homology-3 (SH3) domain facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as N-WASP and WASP-interacting protein (WIP), influencing actin polymerization and cellular processes (BUDAY2007Roles; Kinley2003Cortactin).

Cortactin undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and glycosylation, which are critical for its function and stability (Bandela2022Cortactin). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, with variations in the number of cortactin repeats, but all isoforms retain a conserved C-terminus (Lua2005Cortactin).

## Function
Cortactin, encoded by the CTTN gene, is an actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular functions by regulating the cytoskeleton. It is involved in actin polymerization and cell migration, essential for maintaining cell structure and function. Cortactin interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to promote branched actin polymerization at the cell periphery, facilitating processes such as lamellipodia formation and cell motility (Bandela2022Cortactin; Tanaka2009Generation). 

In endothelial cells, cortactin is vital for maintaining barrier integrity and regulating vascular permeability. It interacts with proteins like VE-cadherin and β-catenin to stabilize adherens junctions, influencing endothelial barrier function and cell junction stability (Moztarzadeh2024Cortactin). Cortactin also plays a role in cAMP-mediated signaling pathways, which are important for enhancing endothelial barrier resistance (Moztarzadeh2024Cortactin).

Cortactin undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins. These modifications are crucial for its role in actin dynamics and cellular motility, impacting processes like cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis (Bandela2022Cortactin).

## Clinical Significance
The CTTN gene, encoding the protein cortactin, is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases, particularly cancers. Overexpression of cortactin is linked to several aggressive cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma. This overexpression is often due to the amplification of the 11q13 segment on chromosome 11, where CTTN is located, and is associated with increased cell migration and metastasis (MacGrath2012Cortactin). Cortactin's role in cancer is further underscored by its involvement in the formation and function of invadopodia, which are actin-driven protrusions that facilitate cancer cell invasion (MacGrath2012Cortactin).

In lung diseases, CTTN is implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute lung injury (ALI). Altered expression of CTTN affects endothelial cell migration and barrier function, contributing to increased permeability and inflammation (Bandela2022Cortactin; García2016Loss). In asthma, CTTN is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and smooth muscle contraction, with specific polymorphisms linked to severe asthma (Bandela2022Cortactin). These findings highlight the gene's role in both cancer progression and respiratory diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Cortactin (CTTN) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for cellular functions. It forms a molecular complex with VE-cadherin and β-catenin, which is essential for maintaining endothelial cell junction stability and barrier function. The absence of cortactin disrupts the localization of these proteins at cell junctions, affecting transendothelial electrical resistance and actin cytoskeleton distribution (Moztarzadeh2024Cortactin). Cortactin also interacts with cofilin in osteoclasts, playing a role in podosome patterning and bone resorption. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation and acetylation, which are crucial for maintaining microtubule dynamic instability and podosome belt formation (Zalli2016The).

Cortactin interacts with the Nipah virus (NiV) F and G proteins, inhibiting viral infection. Overexpression of cortactin significantly reduces NiV pseudovirus infection, while its knockdown promotes infection, indicating its role in antiviral defense (Cui2024Interaction). Additionally, cortactin interacts with αDystrobrevin-1 (αDB1) at neuromuscular junctions, influencing their morphology and organization (De2023Cortactin). These interactions highlight cortactin's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its importance in maintaining structural and functional integrity in various cellular contexts.
