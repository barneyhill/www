# ZNF554

## Overview
ZNF554 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 554, a member of the KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box zinc finger) family, which is the largest family of transcription factors in mammals. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and enable it to function as a transcriptional regulator. ZNF554 is predominantly expressed in the human brain and placenta, where it plays significant roles in transcriptional regulation, neurodevelopment, and placental function. In the brain, it acts as a hub transcription factor, potentially influencing nervous system development and differentiation, while in the placenta, it is involved in trophoblast invasion and differentiation. The gene's expression levels have been linked to glioma progression, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its utility as a prognostic biomarker in certain cancer subtypes (Balogh2020Decreased; Than2018Integrated).

## Function
ZNF554 is a zinc finger protein predominantly expressed in the human brain and placenta, where it plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. In the brain, ZNF554 is suggested to function as a hub transcription factor, potentially influencing the development and differentiation of the nervous system. It is part of the KRAB-ZNF gene family, which is the largest transcription factor family in mammals and is particularly enriched in the human brain. This suggests that ZNF554 may have key roles in brain development and higher brain functions (Balogh2020Decreased). ZNF554 is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to approximately 150 gene promoters in the brain, maintaining consistent expression during neurodevelopment, which indicates its stable role in normal brain function (Balogh2020Decreased).

In the placenta, ZNF554 is highly expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast and is developmentally regulated during villous trophoblast differentiation. It plays a significant role in regulating trophoblast invasion and differentiation, processes crucial for normal placental function and development. The expression of ZNF554 is notably high in the placenta compared to other human tissues, highlighting its specialized function in this organ (Than2018Integrated).

## Clinical Significance
The ZNF554 gene has been implicated in the progression of gliomas, a type of brain tumor. Decreased expression of ZNF554 is associated with higher grades of gliomas, such as anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III) and glioblastoma (grade IV), and correlates with shorter patient survival (Balogh2020Decreased). This suggests that ZNF554 may function as a tumor suppressor, and its reduced expression could lead to the activation of tumor pathways, contributing to tumor progression and poorer outcomes (Balogh2020Decreased).

In glioblastoma cells, overexpression of ZNF554 results in the downregulation of numerous genes and affects several cancer-related pathways, including the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Balogh2020Decreased). This overexpression also decreases cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest, further supporting its role as a tumor suppressor (Balogh2020Decreased).

The potential clinical significance of ZNF554 as a prognostic biomarker in gliomas is highlighted by its association with patient survival outcomes. Higher expression levels of ZNF554 are linked to better survival, particularly in certain glioma subtypes, although this effect is not observed in all cases, possibly due to sample size limitations (Balogh2020Decreased).
