# HAPSTR2

## Overview
HAPSTR2 is a retrogene that encodes the protein HUWE1 associated protein modifying stress responses 2, which plays a pivotal role in cellular stress response and resilience. This protein is primarily expressed in neural and germline tissues, as well as in certain cancers, where it functions to stabilize its parental gene, HAPSTR1, by increasing its protein abundance without affecting mRNA levels. Unlike its parental gene, HAPSTR2 operates independently of the E3 ligase HUWE1, which typically regulates HAPSTR1. The protein is characterized by its ability to localize to the nucleus, oligomerize, and bind HUWE1, albeit with a weaker affinity compared to HAPSTR1. HAPSTR2's interaction with HAPSTR1 is crucial for maintaining cellular resilience under stress conditions, as it can buffer stress signaling pathways and safeguard cellular fitness, particularly in cells expressing both HAPSTR1 and HAPSTR2. The gene's expression is tissue-restricted and dynamically regulated during development, suggesting its significant role in neural contexts and potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer progression (Amici2023The).

## Function
HAPSTR2 is a retrogene that plays a significant role in cellular stress response and resilience in mammals. It is primarily expressed in neural and germline tissues, as well as in certain cancers, where it functions to stabilize its parental gene, HAPSTR1, by increasing its protein abundance without affecting mRNA levels (Amici2023The). This stabilization occurs through direct physical interaction and is independent of the E3 ligase HUWE1, which typically regulates HAPSTR1 (Amici2023The).

HAPSTR2's ability to stabilize HAPSTR1 suggests a protective role against protein degradation, contributing to cellular resilience under stress conditions (Amici2023The). In the absence of HAPSTR1, HAPSTR2 can buffer stress signaling pathways, safeguarding cellular fitness and maintaining organismal resilience (Amici2023The). This buffering mechanism is crucial for maintaining stress resilience, particularly in cells that express both HAPSTR1 and HAPSTR2 (Amici2023The).

HAPSTR2 is expressed in a tissue-restricted manner, with higher expression levels in the testis, brain, peripheral nerve, and adrenal gland, and its expression is dynamically regulated during development (Amici2023The). This expression pattern suggests that HAPSTR2's function may be particularly advantageous in neural contexts (Amici2023The).

## Clinical Significance
The HAPSTR2 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in stress signaling and resilience. Alterations in HAPSTR2 expression or function have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Genomic changes in HAPSTR2 and related factors have been identified in individuals with these disorders, suggesting its potential clinical significance in such conditions (Amici2023The). HAPSTR2's expression in neural and germline tissues, as well as in certain cancers, indicates its involvement in tumorigenesis. It is expressed in tumors derived from brain, adrenal, and germline tissues, and in some cancers from tissues that do not typically express HAPSTR2, such as lung and bone. This aberrant expression is linked to the overexpression of genes involved in neural lineage determination, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression (Amici2023The).

HAPSTR2's ability to stabilize HAPSTR1 and buffer stress signaling pathways is crucial when HAPSTR1 is compromised. This buffering effect is particularly important in maintaining cellular resilience under stress conditions, which could have implications for understanding stress response pathways in mammals (Amici2023The). The gene's interaction with HUWE1, a ubiquitin ligase involved in protein degradation, further underscores its significance in cellular stress responses (Amici2023The).

## Interactions
HAPSTR2, a retrogene derived from HAPSTR1, participates in several key protein interactions that influence cellular stress responses. It retains many biochemical features of HAPSTR1, including the ability to localize to the nucleus, oligomerize, and bind the E3 ligase HUWE1, albeit with a weaker affinity compared to HAPSTR1 (Amici2023The). HAPSTR2 can homo-oligomerize and hetero-oligomerize with HAPSTR1 through a conserved HBO domain interface, which is crucial for stabilizing HAPSTR1 and increasing its protein abundance without affecting mRNA levels (Amici2023The). This stabilization occurs independently of HUWE1, as HAPSTR2 can stabilize HAPSTR1 even in the absence of HUWE1 (Amici2023The).

HAPSTR2's interaction with HAPSTR1 is essential for maintaining the cellular availability of HAPSTR1, as knocking down HAPSTR2 significantly reduces HAPSTR1 protein levels (Amici2023The). The interaction between HAPSTR2 and HAPSTR1 does not require HUWE1, as demonstrated by the stabilization of HAPSTR1 mutants that do not bind HUWE1 (Amici2023The). HAPSTR2 also plays a role in buffering resilience when HAPSTR1 is compromised, suggesting a compensatory mechanism within the HAPSTR-HUWE1 complex (Amici2023The). These interactions highlight HAPSTR2's role in modulating stress signaling pathways and maintaining protein homeostasis.
