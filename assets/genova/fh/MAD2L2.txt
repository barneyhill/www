# MAD2L2

## Overview
The MAD2L2 gene encodes the mitotic arrest deficient 2 like 2 protein, commonly referred to as REV7, which is a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes, including DNA repair and mitotic regulation. As a component of the shieldin complex, MAD2L2 plays a pivotal role in DNA double-strand break repair through non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination pathways, contributing to genomic stability (de2021MAD2L2). The protein's ability to dimerize is essential for its function within the shieldin complex, as well as for its interactions with other proteins such as TRIP13, CDH1, and CAMP, which are crucial for mitotic events and spindle formation (Hara2017Dynamic; de2021MAD2L2). Additionally, MAD2L2 is involved in translesion DNA synthesis as part of the DNA polymerase ζ complex, highlighting its role in allowing DNA replication to proceed past damaged sites (Pernicone2020CDH1). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer pathogenesis, where alterations in its expression are linked to poor clinical outcomes (SUN2023Increased; Liu2023The).

## Structure
The MAD2L2 protein, also known as REV7, exhibits a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in its function. The primary structure of MAD2L2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure includes four α-helices and eight β-strands, which contribute to the protein's stability and function (Hara2017Dynamic).

In terms of tertiary structure, MAD2L2 has a dynamic C-terminal region known as the 'safety belt,' which is essential for its protein-protein interactions. This region undergoes conformational changes to accommodate binding with partner proteins, such as the chromosome alignment-maintaining phosphoprotein (CAMP) (Hara2017Dynamic). The interaction with CAMP involves specific residues, including Trp-334 and Pro-341, which are crucial for binding (Hara2017Dynamic).

The quaternary structure of MAD2L2 is characterized by its ability to form complexes with other proteins. In the MAD2L2-CAMP complex, MAD2L2 can adopt both monomeric and dimeric forms, with the dimeric structure involving the exchange of the C-terminal region between dimers (Hara2017Dynamic). This flexibility allows MAD2L2 to interact with multiple proteins, highlighting its role as a hub protein in cellular networks.

## Function
The MAD2L2 gene, also known as REV7, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes in healthy human cells. It is a key component of the shieldin complex, which is involved in DNA double-strand break repair, particularly through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways (de2021MAD2L2). MAD2L2's function within the shieldin complex is dependent on its ability to dimerize, a process that is essential for the complex's assembly and activity (de2021MAD2L2).

MAD2L2 also interacts with the ATPase TRIP13, which regulates the dynamics of the shieldin complex by facilitating the transition between different conformations of MAD2L2. This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly and disassembly of the shieldin complex during DNA repair (de2021MAD2L2). In addition to its role in DNA repair, MAD2L2 is involved in mitotic events, where it interacts with proteins such as CDH1 and CAMP, suggesting a role in spindle formation and chromosome alignment (Hara2017Dynamic). These interactions highlight MAD2L2's multifaceted role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the MAD2L2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In ovarian cancer, high MAD2L2 expression is associated with shorter overall survival and post-progression survival, and is more prevalent in older and Caucasian patients. It is also linked to TP53 mutations and serous ovarian cancer, suggesting its potential as a clinical predictor for this disease (Xu2022Combining; Xu2024MAD2L2). In colon adenocarcinoma, increased MAD2L2 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and is associated with chromosomal instability and abnormal mitosis, contributing to cancer progression (Rimkus2006Expression; SUN2023Increased).

MAD2L2 is also implicated in glioma, where its expression is linked to tumor grade and patient prognosis. Silencing MAD2L2 reduces glioma cell proliferation and invasion, while overexpression enhances these malignant behaviors, indicating its role in maintaining stemness and promoting tumor progression (Liu2023The). In DNA repair, MAD2L2 is crucial for the non-homologous end joining pathway, and mutations affecting its dimerization can impair DNA repair processes, potentially leading to genomic instability and contributing to disease pathology (Paniagua2022MAD2L2; de2021MAD2L2).

## Interactions
MAD2L2, also known as Rev7, is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is a component of the DNA polymerase ζ complex, where it interacts with REV3L to facilitate translesion DNA synthesis, allowing DNA replication to continue past damaged sites (Pernicone2020CDH1). MAD2L2 also forms part of the shieldin complex, interacting with SHLD2 and SHLD3 to regulate DNA repair by non-homologous end joining (Pernicone2020CDH1).

In mitosis, MAD2L2 interacts with CDH1, inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) by sequestering CDH1, which prevents premature activation of the APC/C (Pfleger2001Inhibition; Pernicone2020CDH1). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of mitotic progression and is mediated by specific binding motifs and residues on MAD2L2 (Pernicone2020CDH1).

MAD2L2 also interacts with proteins involved in replication fork protection, acting independently of the shieldin complex. It stabilizes stalled replication forks and has a complex relationship with RIF1, although it does not block DNA2-mediated fork degradation (Paniagua2022MAD2L2). These interactions highlight MAD2L2's role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating cell cycle progression.
