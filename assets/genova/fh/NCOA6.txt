# NCOA6

## Overview
NCOA6, or nuclear receptor coactivator 6, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors. The protein, also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 6, functions primarily as a transcriptional coactivator, facilitating chromatin remodeling and enhancing transcriptional activation. It is characterized by the presence of LXXLL motifs, which are essential for its interaction with various nuclear receptors, including steroid, retinoid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D receptors (Lee2024Nuclear; Mahajan2008Nuclear). NCOA6 is implicated in numerous physiological processes such as embryonic development, metabolism, and adipocyte differentiation, and it plays a role in pathological conditions like breast carcinogenesis and inflammatory diseases (Lee2024Nuclear; Li2011Identification). The protein is a component of several multiprotein complexes involved in chromatin remodeling, and its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation (Mahajan2008Nuclear; Bulynko2010Nuclear).

## Structure
Nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCOA6) is a multifunctional protein involved in transcriptional regulation. It contains several domains, including LXXLL motifs that facilitate interaction with nuclear receptors such as steroid, retinoid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D receptors (Lee2024Nuclear). NCOA6 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its function, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

NCOA6 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, including NCOA6-α, -β, -γ, and -δ, each with distinct subcellular localizations. NCOA6-α and -β are primarily nuclear, NCOA6-γ is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and NCOA6-δ is mainly mitochondrial (Li2011Identification). The C-terminal region, coded by the last four exons, is crucial for the nuclear localization of NCOA6-α and -β, while specific exon regions direct NCOA6-δ to mitochondria (Li2011Identification).

The protein is part of the ASCOM coactivator complex and interacts with other coactivators like ASC-2, SRC-1/CBP, TRAP, DRIP, and COAA to enhance nuclear receptor-dependent transcription (Li2011Identification; Bulynko2010Nuclear). However, detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of NCOA6 is not provided in the context.

## Function
NCOA6 (nuclear receptor coactivator 6) is a multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by interacting with nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors. It is involved in various physiological processes, including embryonic development, adipocyte differentiation, metabolism, and potentially breast carcinogenesis (Li2011Identification). NCOA6 enhances nuclear receptor-dependent transcription by recruiting multiple coactivator complexes, facilitating chromatin remodeling, and promoting transcriptional activation (Li2011Identification; Tong2019The).

NCOA6 is composed of 2063 amino acids and contains motifs that facilitate interactions with nuclear receptors, such as the LXXLL motifs, which are crucial for its coactivator function (Wang2010Lens; Surapureddi2011NCOA6). It is active primarily in the nucleus, where it enhances estrogen receptor α (ERα)-mediated transcription, particularly through its isoforms NCOA6-α and -β, which are localized in the nucleus (Li2011Identification).

The protein is also involved in the regulation of metabolic processes, such as lipogenesis and cholesterol homeostasis, by interacting with liver X receptor α (LXRα) and other nuclear receptors (Li2007Tissue). NCOA6's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NCOA6 gene have been implicated in several diseases. NCOA6 is a critical regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is involved in inflammatory diseases such as gouty arthritis and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). In gouty arthritis, NCOA6 is upregulated in macrophages within the synovial fluid, promoting inflammation through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the subsequent production of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β (Lee2024Nuclear). NCOA6 deficiency has been shown to reduce the severity of NLRP3-dependent inflammatory conditions, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lee2024Nuclear).

In cancer, NCOA6 is amplified and overexpressed in breast, colon, and lung cancers, indicating its role as a prosurvival gene necessary for normal growth and development. This overexpression is associated with its involvement in transcriptional activation and interaction with various transcription factors, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (Mahajan2008Nuclear). NCOA6 is also implicated in mammary tumorigenesis, where its partial impairment accelerates tumor development in mouse models (Mahajan2008Nuclear). These findings highlight the significance of NCOA6 in both inflammatory and oncogenic processes.

## Interactions
Nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCOA6) is involved in a variety of protein interactions that facilitate its role as a transcriptional coactivator. NCOA6 contains LxxLL motifs that enable it to interact with a wide range of nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptors (ERs), thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (Mahajan2008Nuclear). It also interacts with transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Jun, NF-kB, ATF-2, and p53, enhancing their transcriptional activity (Mahajan2008Nuclear).

NCOA6 is a component of several multiprotein complexes, including ASCOM, ALR, and PTIP, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and histone methylation (Mahajan2008Nuclear). It interacts with coactivators like CBP/p300, which are crucial for modulating chromatin structure and facilitating transcription (Mahajan2008Nuclear). NCOA6 also associates with RNA binding proteins such as CAPER and CoAA, which enhance its coactivator functions (Mahajan2008Nuclear).

In the context of inflammation, NCOA6 interacts with the NACHT domain of NLRP3, promoting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component in inflammatory responses (Lee2024Nuclear).
