# SDHAF1

## Overview
The SDHAF1 gene encodes the protein succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 1, which is a critical component in the assembly of mitochondrial complex II, also known as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial matrix protein and plays a pivotal role in the incorporation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters into the SDHB subunit of complex II, facilitating its proper assembly and function (Moosavi2019The). SDHAF1 interacts with the HSC20-HSPA9-ISCU complex, which is essential for Fe-S cluster recruitment, and contains LYR motifs that mediate these interactions (Fullerton2020The). Mutations in SDHAF1 can lead to mitochondrial complex II deficiency, resulting in various neurological and systemic conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Hensen2010Recent; Ghezzi2009SDHAF1).

## Function
SDHAF1, also known as LYRM8, is a soluble mitochondrial matrix protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a key enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is specifically involved in the assembly of SDH and does not affect other mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (Moosavi2019The). SDHAF1 contains a LYR motif, which is associated with proteins involved in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) metabolism. This motif allows SDHAF1 to interact with the co-chaperone HSC20, part of the ISCU-HSC20-HSPA9 complex, which is responsible for incorporating Fe-S clusters into the SDH structure (Moosavi2019The). SDHAF1 recruits the Fe-S transfer complex to the C-terminus of SDHB, facilitating Fe-S cluster incorporation, which is essential for the proper function of SDH (Moosavi2019The).

In conjunction with SDHAF3, SDHAF1 is involved in the maturation of SDH2 and protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage during oxidative metabolism (Moosavi2019The). A defect in SDHAF1 function can lead to impaired SDHB biogenesis and increased oxidative stress due to iron-dependent mechanisms (Moosavi2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDHAF1 gene are associated with a range of neurological and systemic conditions. SDHAF1 encodes a protein crucial for the assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mutations in this gene can lead to mitochondrial complex II deficiency, which is linked to infantile leukoencephalopathy, a condition characterized by severe neurological symptoms and rapid psychomotor regression beginning in infancy (Hensen2010Recent; Ghezzi2009SDHAF1). 

In adults, SDHAF1 mutations have been reported in cases presenting with spastic paraparesis, leukoencephalopathy, dementia, and cardiomyopathy. These symptoms can complicate diagnosis, as they may mimic other conditions such as multiple sclerosis (Vlahovic2021A). Despite the presence of mutations, some patients do not exhibit deficiencies in electron transport chain complex activities, indicating variability in clinical presentation and the pathogenic role of these mutations (Vlahovic2021A).

While SDHAF1 mutations are primarily linked to neurological disorders, they have not been associated with paragangliomas or pheochromocytomas, unlike mutations in other SDH-related genes (Dwight2017Analysis). This suggests that SDHAF1 mutations may not significantly impact tumorigenesis in these conditions.

## Interactions
SDHAF1 is a critical assembly factor for mitochondrial complex II, also known as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). It plays a vital role in the incorporation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters into the SDHB subunit of complex II. SDHAF1 interacts with the HSC20-HSPA9-ISCU complex, which is essential for the recruitment of Fe-S clusters to SDHB, facilitating the proper assembly and function of complex II (Fullerton2020The). 

SDHAF1 contains two LYR motifs that mediate its interactions with other proteins. The proximal LYR motif (Leu14-Tyr15-Arg16) interacts with HSC20, a component of the Fe-S cluster assembly machinery, while the distal LYR motif (Leu53-Tyr54-Arg55) interacts directly with SDHB (Fullerton2020The). These interactions are crucial for the stability and function of the SDH complex.

Mutations in SDHAF1, such as the c.169G>C p.(Gly57Arg) variant, can impair these interactions, leading to reduced complex II activity and associated mitochondrial diseases (Fullerton2020The). SDHAF1 also prevents the degradation of SDHB by the mitochondrial protease LONP1, further underscoring its role in maintaining the integrity of complex II (Moosavi2020Molecular).
