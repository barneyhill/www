# FZD3

## Overview
FZD3 is a gene that encodes the frizzled class receptor 3, a member of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is integral to the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including neurogenesis, axon guidance, and synapse formation. The FZD3 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that facilitates ligand binding, particularly with Wnt proteins (Hillier2024Structural). FZD3 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it is essential for the development of neural circuits and proper neuronal connectivity (Pascual-Vargas2021A). Alterations in the FZD3 gene have been associated with several diseases, including schizophrenia and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Zhang2004Positive; Li2021Expression).

## Structure
The FZD3 protein is a member of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. It features a canonical GPCR structure with seven transmembrane helices, forming a transmembrane domain (TMD) that exhibits a prominent pocket potentially accommodating small molecules, suggesting a druggable target (Hillier2024Structural). The extracellular region of FZD3 contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), which is the primary site for ligand binding, including Wnt proteins. This CRD features a lipid-binding groove that interacts with the palmitoleate moiety of Wnt proteins (Hillier2024Structural).

The interaction of FZD3 with nanobodies, such as Nb8 and Nb9, has been structurally characterized. Nb8 binds specifically to the CRD, potentially inhibiting Wnt signal transduction by interfering with FZD3 dimerization (Hillier2024Structural). Nb9 binds to the intracellular region, competing with the Dishevelled (DVL) protein and inhibiting GαS coupling, which affects downstream signaling (Hillier2024Structural).

FZD3 is also characterized by specific post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and palmitoylation, which are common in GPCRs and may influence its function and interactions (Hillier2024Structural). The structural insights into FZD3 provide a framework for understanding its role in signaling pathways and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Function
The FZD3 gene encodes a receptor that is integral to the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including neurogenesis, axon guidance, and synapse formation. FZD3 is highly expressed in the central nervous system and plays a critical role in the development of neural circuits by mediating Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. This signaling pathway is crucial for axon growth and guidance, particularly in the forebrain and other regions of the nervous system, ensuring proper neuronal connectivity and function (Wang2002Frizzled3Is; Pascual-Vargas2021A).

FZD3 is localized in the soma, dendrites, axons, and synapses, where it is involved in synaptogenesis and presynaptic differentiation. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, regulate its function, affecting its localization and activity in the cell membrane (Pascual-Vargas2021A). In the inner ear, FZD3 is necessary for the central pathfinding of afferent neurons, acting in a cell-autonomous manner to guide axons to their correct synaptic targets, which is vital for auditory and vestibular processing (Stoner2022Fzd3). The absence of FZD3 can lead to significant defects in axonal development and neural connectivity (Wang2002Frizzled3Is).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FZD3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In schizophrenia, particularly within the Chinese Han population, significant associations have been found between FZD3 gene polymorphisms and the disorder. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs2323019 and rs880481 show significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls, suggesting a role in genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia (Zhang2004Positive). FZD3 mutations may contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis through delayed differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and disrupted neurotransmission (Stuebner2009Fzd3andFzd6deficiency).

In cancer, FZD3 expression is altered in various types. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, high FZD3 expression is associated with better overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Li2021Expression). In colorectal cancer, the FZD3 variant rs11775139 is linked to a reduced risk, suggesting a protective role (Hildebrandt2016Germline). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, FZD3 is upregulated and contributes to disease progression through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Xia2018Circular).

FZD3 is also crucial for proper central nervous system development, with its absence leading to significant neuroanatomic and functional defects, such as impaired axonal development and connectivity (Wang2002Frizzled3Is).

## Interactions
FZD3 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway. It binds with Wnt proteins such as Wnt5a, which activates non-canonical signaling pathways, including the Gαs/cAMP/PKA pathway, leading to anti-migratory effects in breast cancer cells (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled). FZD3 also interacts with Wnt3a, which is crucial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, activating the TOPflash reporter in HEK293 cells (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled).

Nanobodies Nb8 and Nb9 have been identified as modulators of FZD3. Nb8 binds to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FZD3, competing with Wnt5a and potentially inhibiting Wnt signal transduction by interfering with FZD3 dimerization (Hillier2024Structural). Nb9 binds to the intracellular region of FZD3, competing with the Dishevelled (DVL) DEP domain and inhibiting G protein coupling, which affects GPCR signaling (Hillier2024Structural).

FZD3 is also targeted by 5′-tiRNA Val in breast cancer, which downregulates its expression by targeting the 3′-UTR of FZD3 mRNA, leading to suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Mo2019A). This interaction highlights the regulatory role of nucleic acids in modulating FZD3 activity.
