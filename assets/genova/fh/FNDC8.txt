# FNDC8

## Overview
The FNDC8 gene encodes the protein fibronectin type III domain containing 8, which is characterized by the presence of fibronectin type III domains. These domains are commonly involved in cell adhesion and receptor binding, suggesting that FNDC8 may play a role in cellular interactions and signaling pathways. Although the specific biological functions of the FNDC8 protein are not fully elucidated, it has been implicated in cancer-related processes, particularly in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), where it is expressed by both epithelial and cancer cells (Parker2022Extracellular). Additionally, challenges in measuring FNDC8 expression in certain neurological contexts, such as Huntington's disease, have been reported, although its direct involvement in such diseases remains unclear (Becanovic2010Transcriptional). Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional roles and clinical implications of FNDC8.

## Clinical Significance
The FNDC8 gene, encoding fibronectin type III domain containing 8, has been studied in the context of various diseases, although specific conditions directly resulting from its mutations or expression alterations are not extensively documented. In the study of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), FNDC8 was identified as part of a glycoprotein-enriched cluster significantly expressed by epithelial cells in non-tumor tissue and by cancer cells in tumor tissue, suggesting an epithelial origin and potential involvement in cancer progression (Parker2022Extracellular).

In Huntington's disease research, challenges were noted in amplifying and quantifying FNDC8 expression from striatal RNA, indicating potential difficulties in measuring its expression in certain contexts (Becanovic2010Transcriptional). However, the study did not specifically link FNDC8 to Huntington's disease pathogenesis.

Overall, while FNDC8 is implicated in cancer-related processes, particularly in NSCLC, its precise role and clinical significance in other diseases remain less clear. Further research is needed to elucidate its involvement in disease mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target.
