# MRPL44

## Overview
The MRPL44 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L44, a crucial component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, or mitoribosome. This protein is integral to mitochondrial translation, facilitating the synthesis of proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA, which are essential for the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, particularly complexes I and IV. These complexes play a vital role in oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy production. The MRPL44 protein contains an RNase III-like domain and a double-stranded RNA-binding domain, although the RNase III-like domain is non-functional in humans. Mutations in MRPL44 can lead to severe clinical conditions, such as infantile cardiomyopathy, due to impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis and subsequent deficiencies in respiratory chain complexes (Carroll2013Wholeexome; Friederich2021Pathogenic).

## Structure
The MRPL44 protein is a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit and consists of 332 amino acids. The first 30 amino acids at the N-terminus are predicted to serve as a mitochondrial targeting signal, directing the protein to the mitochondria (Carroll2013Wholeexome). Sequence analysis reveals that MRPL44 contains two domains: an RNase III-like domain (residues 86-228) and a double-stranded RNA-binding domain (residues 236-306). The RNase III-like domain is non-functional in humans due to the absence of critical residues for RNase activity (Carroll2013Wholeexome). 

A structural model of the RNase domain suggests that the leucine at position 156 (L156) is involved in hydrophobic interactions crucial for the protein's structural integrity. The L156R mutation disrupts these interactions, leading to protein instability (Carroll2013Wholeexome). This mutation is located within the RNase III-like domain and is highly conserved among vertebrates, indicating its importance in maintaining the protein's structure (Carroll2013Wholeexome). 

MRPL44 is essential for the assembly and stability of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, which is crucial for mitochondrial function (Carroll2013Wholeexome). The protein's role in the mitoribosome complex is non-redundant, highlighting its unique function in mitochondrial translation (Cheong2020Expression).

## Function
The MRPL44 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, known as the mitoribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial translation, which is essential for synthesizing proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA. These proteins are integral to the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, particularly complexes I and IV, which are vital for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production in cells (Friederich2021Pathogenic).

MRPL44 is located near the peptide exit channel of the mitoribosome and contains an RNA binding domain. Although it has an RNase III-like domain, this domain is likely non-functional (Friederich2021Pathogenic). The protein is expressed widely across multiple tissues during development, and its absence is embryonically lethal in mice, indicating its essential role in cellular function (Friederich2021Pathogenic).

In healthy human cells, MRPL44 contributes to the proper synthesis of mtDNA-encoded proteins, supporting efficient oxidative phosphorylation and energy production. This function is critical for maintaining the stability and activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, ensuring adequate cellular energy metabolism (Friederich2021Pathogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRPL44 gene are associated with several severe clinical conditions, primarily affecting the heart and other high-energy-demand tissues. Pathogenic variants in MRPL44 have been linked to infantile cardiomyopathy, a condition characterized by heart muscle weakness and dysfunction due to mitochondrial translation defects. These mutations lead to impaired synthesis of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins, resulting in deficiencies in respiratory chain complexes, particularly complexes I and IV, which are crucial for oxidative phosphorylation (Friederich2021Pathogenic).

Patients with MRPL44 mutations often present with symptoms such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis, muscle weakness, and metabolic dysfunction. In some cases, neurological symptoms and multisystem involvement, including pigmentary retinopathy and renal insufficiency, have been observed (Friederich2021Pathogenic; Distelmaier2015MRPL44). The mutation c.467T>G, p.Leu156Arg, is a recurrent variant associated with these conditions, leading to reduced protein stability and function (Friederich2021Pathogenic; Distelmaier2015MRPL44).

Alterations in MRPL44 expression can also impact mitochondrial function, as reduced levels of this protein affect the assembly of the large mitoribosomal subunit and the stability of mitochondrial RNA, further compromising oxidative phosphorylation capacity (Yeo2015A).

## Interactions
MRPL44 is a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is involved in the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit, interacting with chaperones or assembly factors that may contribute to the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and complex I (CI) in tissues (Carroll2013Wholeexome). The L156R mutation in MRPL44 affects the assembly of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit and the stability of 16S rRNA, although mitochondrial protein synthesis is not severely impaired in fibroblasts, indicating tissue-specific effects (Rackham2014Supernumerary).

MRPL44 interacts with other ribosomal components to maintain the integrity of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. The instability caused by the L156R mutation can be rescued by expressing wild-type MRPL44, which restores the levels of COX1 subunit and COX holocomplex to normal, highlighting its role in ribosomal subunit stability (Carroll2013Wholeexome). The mutation leads to a reduction in MRPL44 levels in heart and skeletal muscle tissues, affecting the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit and the stability of 16S rRNA, resulting in complex IV deficiency (Carroll2013Wholeexome). These interactions underscore the importance of MRPL44 in mitochondrial function and its potential interactions with other proteins involved in mitochondrial translation and respiratory chain assembly.
