# NBDY

## Overview
The NBDY gene encodes a microprotein known as the negative regulator of P-body association, which plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism within human cells. This intrinsically disordered protein is a component of the cytoplasmic RNA decapping complex, where it influences RNA stability and decay rates, particularly for DCP2 substrate transcripts. NBDY is characterized by its ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process essential for the formation and dynamics of P-bodies, which are cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules involved in mRNA metabolism. The protein's function is modulated by phosphorylation at specific residues, affecting its interactions and phase separation behavior. NBDY's interactions with components of the RNA decapping complex, such as EDC4 and DCP1A, are crucial for maintaining RNA stability and cell proliferation, underscoring its significance in cellular processes (Na2021Phosphorylation; Na2020The).

## Structure
The NBDY protein is a 68-amino acid intrinsically disordered protein, characterized by a lack of stable secondary structure, which is typical for proteins involved in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (Na2021Phosphorylation). Its primary structure is enriched in proline residues, comprising 23.5% of its amino acids, contributing to its disordered nature (Na2021Phosphorylation). The protein has a predicted charge of +4 at physiological pH, with a high local positive charge near its middle segment, specifically at residues 22-27 (Na2021Phosphorylation).

NBDY undergoes phosphorylation, a post-translational modification that significantly impacts its function. Phosphorylation at residue T40 is crucial for the dissociation of P-bodies during mitosis, while phosphorylation at S61 occurs during epidermal growth factor signaling, both affecting P-body dynamics (Na2021Phosphorylation). These modifications alter the local charge density, influencing the protein's interactions and phase separation behavior (Na2021Phosphorylation).

NBDY interacts with components of the RNA decapping complex, such as EDC4 and DCP1A, through specific domains like the WD40 domain of EDC4 and C-terminal polyproline repeats, although these interactions do not significantly affect RNA stability (Na2020The). The protein's intrinsically disordered nature and phosphorylation state are key to its role in regulating P-body dynamics and cell proliferation (Na2021Phosphorylation).

## Function
The NBDY gene encodes a microprotein that plays a crucial role in regulating RNA decapping in human cells. This protein is a component of the cytoplasmic RNA decapping complex and is involved in maintaining RNA stability and decay rates, particularly for DCP2 substrate transcripts. NBDY interacts directly with the RNA decapping complex through proteins EDC4 and DCP1A, localizing to P-bodies, which are cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules involved in mRNA metabolism (Na2020The).

In healthy cells, NBDY is essential for the proper functioning of the RNA decapping complex, influencing RNA metabolism and cell viability. The interaction between NBDY and EDC4 is direct and specific, requiring the W34 residue of NBDY for binding. This interaction is necessary for maintaining the correct half-life of DCP2 substrates, affecting the stability of over 1400 RNA transcripts (Na2020The).

NBDY also regulates non-DCP2 targets through mechanisms independent of EDC4, likely due to compensatory changes in RNA synthesis and processing. The absence of NBDY leads to increased P-body numbers and decreased cell proliferation, highlighting its role in maintaining normal RNA dynamics and cell growth (Na2020The).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The NBDY microprotein interacts with several components of the RNA decapping complex, playing a crucial role in RNA stability and P-body dynamics. NBDY directly interacts with the WD40 domain of EDC4, a component of the RNA decapping complex, with a stoichiometry of 1:3 relative to EDC4. This interaction is essential for the stability of DCP2 substrates and is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation, requiring the W34 residue of NBDY for binding (Na2020The). NBDY also interacts with the DCP1A EVH1 domain via its C-terminal polyproline repeats, although this interaction does not significantly affect RNA stability (Na2020The).

NBDY undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the presence of RNA, forming liquid droplets that are disrupted by phosphorylation. This phase separation is crucial for P-body formation and dynamics, with phosphorylation at specific residues like T40 and S61 playing a role in P-body dissociation during cell division and growth factor signaling (Na2021Phosphorylation). Phosphorylation alters NBDY's charge interactions, affecting its ability to form or dissociate from biomolecular condensates (Na2021Phosphorylation). These interactions highlight NBDY's role as a regulator of RNA metabolism and cellular processes.
