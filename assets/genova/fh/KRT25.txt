# KRT25

## Overview
KRT25 is a gene that encodes keratin 25, a type I intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in the inner root sheath of hair follicles. As a member of the keratin family, keratin 25 plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and resilience of epithelial cells, particularly in hair, nails, and tongue tissues. The protein's structure is characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain, which facilitates the formation of coiled-coil motifs essential for filament assembly and function. Keratin 25 interacts with type II keratins to form heterodimers, contributing to the stability and integrity of hair follicles. Mutations in KRT25 have been linked to hair disorders such as autosomal recessive woolly hair and hypotrichosis, underscoring its importance in normal hair development and maintenance (Ho2022Update; Ansar2015A).

## Structure
KRT25, or keratin 25, is a type I intermediate filament protein primarily found in the inner root sheath of hair follicles. Its primary structure consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This structure is typical of keratins, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil motifs that are characteristic of its secondary structure (Ho2022Update).

The tertiary structure of KRT25 involves the assembly of these coiled-coil motifs into filamentous structures, which are essential for the protein's function in maintaining hair structure. In terms of quaternary structure, KRT25 forms heterodimers with type II keratins, a process crucial for the stability and integrity of the hair follicle's inner root sheath (Thomer2018An).

Common post-translational modifications of KRT25 include phosphorylation, which may play a role in regulating its function and interactions with other proteins (Ho2022Update). The protein's role in hair structure is underscored by its involvement in conditions such as autosomal recessive woolly hair, where mutations in KRT25 can lead to altered hair texture and growth (Ansar2015A).

## Function
KRT25, or keratin 25, is a type I keratin gene that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It is primarily expressed in the inner root sheath of hair follicles, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of hair structure by interacting with other keratins to form intermediate filaments. These filaments provide mechanical support and resilience to cells, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of hair, nails, and tongue tissues (Ho2022Update; Ehrlich2019Comparative).

The evolutionary history of KRT25 suggests that it evolved from type I keratins in Amphibia ancestors and first appeared in tetrapods, providing protection from friction and preventing dehydration (Ho2022Update). Although specific functions of KRT25 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its expression in hair follicles indicates its involvement in hair differentiation and structural support (Morgan2019Hair). Mutations in KRT25 have been associated with conditions such as woolly hair and hypotrichosis, highlighting its importance in normal hair development and maintenance (Ho2022Update).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT25 gene are associated with autosomal recessive woolly hair (ARWH), a condition characterized by tightly curled hair and varying degrees of hair loss, known as hypotrichosis. This condition is non-syndromic, meaning it does not involve other skin symptoms or extracutaneous organ involvement. The KRT25 variant c.950T>C (p.(Leu317Pro)) has been identified in Pakistani families and is linked to ARWH, disrupting the protein structure and potentially interfering with the heterodimerization of K25 with type II keratins within the hair follicle (Ansar2015A). Another mutation, c.712G>T (p.Val238Leu), has been found in the Volga-Ural region of Russia, associated with milder phenotypes of ARWH (Akiyama2021Isolated).

In horses, mutations in KRT25, such as the missense variant KRT25:p.R89H, are linked to the curly coat phenotype and hypotrichosis. This variant affects the coil1A domain of KRT25, essential for keratin intermediate filament formation, and is associated with dominant inheritance of the curly hair trait (Morgenthaler2017A). The KRT25 variant also exhibits an epistatic effect over the SP6 gene, influencing hair structure and loss (Thomer2018An).
