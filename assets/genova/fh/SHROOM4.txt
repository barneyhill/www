# SHROOM4

## Overview
SHROOM4 is a gene that encodes the protein shroom family member 4, which is integral to cytoskeletal organization and cellular architecture. The protein is categorized as an actin-associated protein, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, essential for maintaining cell shape and facilitating various cellular processes (Yoder2006Shroom4). SHROOM4 is characterized by its unique structural domains, including an N-terminal PDZ domain and a C-terminal ASD2 domain, which are crucial for its function in actomyosin-dependent processes (Kolvenbach2022Xlinked; Bian2022SHROOM4). The gene is expressed in various tissues, notably the brain, where it contributes to synaptogenesis and the maintenance of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-mediated inhibition, underscoring its importance in neural function (Bian2022SHROOM4). Mutations in SHROOM4 are associated with several clinical conditions, including Stocco dos Santos syndrome and X-linked intellectual disability, highlighting its significance in neurodevelopmental and systemic congenital disorders (Kolvenbach2022Xlinked; Armanet2015Double).

## Structure
The SHROOM4 protein is characterized by its primary structure, which includes 1475 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 163 kDa, though it migrates at approximately 200 kDa in experimental settings (Yoder2006Shroom4). The protein contains two evolutionarily conserved domains: an N-terminal PDZ domain and a C-terminal ASD2 domain (Kolvenbach2022Xlinked; Bian2022SHROOM4). These domains are crucial for its function in cytoskeletal organization, particularly in actomyosin-dependent processes (Yoder2006Shroom4).

SHROOM4 lacks the central ASD1 domain found in other Shroom proteins but includes a unique sequence motif of glutamines and glutamic acids preceding the ASD2 domain, which is conserved in humans (Yoder2006Shroom4). The protein is capable of directly binding to F-actin and co-localizes with non-muscle myosin II, suggesting a role in regulating cytoskeletal architecture through a myosin II-dependent pathway (Yoder2006Shroom4).

The SHROOM4 gene is subject to variations that can result in different protein isoforms, potentially affecting its function and association with diseases such as idiopathic epilepsy and Stocco dos Santos syndrome (Kolvenbach2022Xlinked; Bian2022SHROOM4).

## Function
The SHROOM4 gene encodes an actin-associated protein that plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular architecture. In healthy human cells, SHROOM4 is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape and facilitating various cellular processes. The protein localizes to actin-rich structures within cells and is known to enhance the formation of actin-based structures, indicating its role in cytoskeletal reorganization or stabilization (Yoder2006Shroom4).

SHROOM4 interacts with non-muscle myosin II, suggesting it regulates cellular architecture through a myosin II-dependent pathway. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of myosin II to specific F-actin populations, which may influence cell motility and shape (Yoder2006Shroom4). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it is involved in synaptogenesis and maintaining gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-mediated inhibition, highlighting its importance in neural function (Bian2022SHROOM4).

SHROOM4's activity is particularly significant during embryonic development, where it contributes to processes such as neurulation and cellular architecture remodeling. Its role in actin filament assembly and cytoskeletal dynamics underscores its importance in vertebrate development and cellular function (Yoder2006Shroom4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SHROOM4 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting neurological and developmental processes. SHROOM4 is implicated in Stocco dos Santos syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, speech delay, seizures, and hyperactivity (Kolvenbach2022Xlinked; Armanet2015Double). Variants in SHROOM4 have also been linked to X-linked intellectual disability (XLMR), with symptoms including developmental delays and distinctive facial features (Armanet2015Double; Danyel2019Familial).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, SHROOM4 mutations are associated with congenital anomalies in multiple organ systems. These include defects in the urinary tract, anorectal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems, as evidenced by studies using zebrafish and mouse models (Kolvenbach2022Xlinked). The gene's role in these systems is further supported by findings of specific variants linked to conditions such as Dent disease, characterized by renal issues (Armanet2015Double; Danyel2019Familial).

SHROOM4 variants have also been associated with epilepsy, particularly X-linked epilepsy with generalized seizures or discharges. Several missense variants have been identified in individuals with idiopathic epilepsy, suggesting a genotype-phenotype correlation (Bian2022SHROOM4). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in both neurodevelopmental and systemic congenital disorders.

## Interactions
SHROOM4, a member of the shroom protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cytoskeletal organization and neuronal function. SHROOM4 interacts with GABA B receptors (GABA B Rs), forming a ternary complex with GABA B1 and the dynein intermediate chain (DIC). This interaction is essential for the dynein-dependent transport of GABA B Rs to dendrites, which is critical for maintaining proper inhibitory neurotransmission in neurons (Zapata2017Epilepsy).

SHROOM4 also binds to F-actin, influencing actin remodeling, which is important for synaptogenesis and spine plasticity. This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity of synapses, although SHROOM4's role in spine cytoskeleton regulation appears limited after neuronal maturation (Zapata2017Epilepsy; Yoder2006Shroom4).

In addition to its role in actin dynamics, SHROOM4 is involved in the recruitment of myosin II to actin structures, facilitating cytoskeletal organization. This interaction is independent of myosin II activity, indicating SHROOM4's role in localizing myosin II to specific actin-rich areas (Yoder2006Shroom4). These interactions highlight SHROOM4's multifaceted role in cellular architecture and neurotransmission.
