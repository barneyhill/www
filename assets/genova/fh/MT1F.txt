# MT1F

## Overview
MT1F is a gene that encodes the protein metallothionein 1F, which is part of the metallothionein family known for its high cysteine content and ability to bind metal ions. Metallothionein 1F is primarily involved in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification, particularly binding heavy metals such as zinc and copper. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating zinc metabolism and protecting cells from oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals. It is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in cellular metal regulation and antioxidant defense. The expression of MT1F is regulated by zinc-dependent transcription factors and is influenced by promoter methylation and histone modifications. Clinically, MT1F has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal and breast cancer, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and patient outcomes (Laukens2009Human; Merlos2020Metallothionein; Krężel2017The; Yan2012Downregulation).

## Structure
MT1F (metallothionein 1F) is a member of the metallothionein family, characterized by a high cysteine content, which facilitates metal ion coordination. The primary structure of MT1F is rich in cysteine residues, allowing it to bind metal ions effectively (Li2008Human; Laukens2009Human). The secondary structure of MT1F is minimal, lacking defined alpha-helices or beta-sheets, which is typical for metallothioneins (Li2008Human). The tertiary structure involves the formation of compact metal-thiolate clusters, which are crucial for its function in metal ion binding and detoxification (Li2008Human). MT1F does not form quaternary structures, as metallothioneins generally exist as monomers (Li2008Human).

MT1F is part of a cluster of metallothionein genes located on chromosome 16q13, which includes multiple MT1 isoforms (Laukens2009Human). The gene regulation of MT1F involves various transcription factors and promoter elements, but specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are less commonly reported for this protein (Laukens2009Human).

## Function
MT1F (metallothionein 1F) is a protein involved in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification, primarily binding heavy metals such as zinc and copper. In healthy human cells, MT1F plays a crucial role in regulating zinc metabolism, acting as a metal-buffering molecule that helps maintain cellular zinc ion balance (Krężel2017The). The protein is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and is involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals (Laukens2009Human). 

MT1F is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in cellular metal regulation and antioxidant defense. It is part of a complex feedback loop involving zinc and metallothionein expression, with its activity being regulated by zinc-dependent transcription factors such as MTF1 (Laukens2009Human). The protein's expression is influenced by various factors, including promoter methylation and histone modifications, which are crucial for its function in metal detoxification and homeostasis (Krężel2017The).

MT1F also plays a role in the cellular response to stress and inflammation, potentially regulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines through interactions with NFκB (Laukens2009Human). Its ability to bind and release zinc ions dynamically allows it to participate actively in zinc metabolism, rather than merely trapping zinc ions (Li2008Human).

## Clinical Significance
The MT1F gene, encoding metallothionein 1F, plays a significant role in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. In colorectal cancer, MT1F is downregulated, which is associated with the transition from normal mucosa to cancerous tissue. This downregulation is primarily attributed to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the MT1F locus, a common feature in colon cancer pathogenesis (Krizkova2018An; Yan2012Downregulation). The downregulation of MT1F is linked to increased tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced cancer stages, although it is not correlated with other clinicopathological features (Yan2012Downregulation).

In colon cancer cell lines, MT1F downregulation is associated with CpG island hypermethylation, particularly in poorly differentiated, microsatellite instability-positive cell lines like RKO and LoVo (Yan2012Downregulation). Restoration of MT1F expression in these cells has been shown to reduce proliferation and tumorigenicity, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Yan2012Downregulation).

MT1F expression is also implicated in other cancers, such as breast cancer, where its expression is associated with malignancy grade and poor survival outcomes (Merlos2020Metallothionein). These findings highlight the complex role of MT1F in cancer biology, acting as both a protective agent and a promoter of tumor growth depending on the context.
