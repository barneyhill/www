# MRPL48

## Overview
MRPL48 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L48, which is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a critical process for ATP production in cells (Lin2023MRPL48). As a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, MRPL48 is integral to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function. The protein's evolutionary origin from a gene duplication event underscores its specialized role in the mitoribosome, where it is involved in mitochondrial translation and potentially in apoptosis (Smits2007Reconstructing). MRPL48's involvement in the assembly of a mitoribosomal large subunit intermediate further highlights its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Key2023Translation).

## Function
MRPL48 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is part of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It facilitates the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process critical for ATP production in cells (Lin2023MRPL48). MRPL48 is active within the mitochondria, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function (Lin2023MRPL48).

The protein originated from a gene duplication event at the base of the metazoan radiation, evolving from MRPS10 to become part of a different mitoribosomal subunit (Smits2007Reconstructing). This evolutionary adaptation highlights its integration into the mitoribosome, where it plays a role in mitochondrial translation and potentially in apoptosis, linking mitochondrial translation to cell death processes (Smits2007Reconstructing).

MRPL48 is also involved in the assembly of a mitoribosomal large subunit (LSU) intermediate, which co-migrates and co-accumulates with CLPX, suggesting a potential role in mitochondrial function and translation efficiency (Key2023Translation). This involvement underscores its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The MRPL48 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MRPL48 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and survival outcomes in patients. High MRPL48 expression correlates with advanced cancer stages, high-grade tumors, and vascular invasion, making it a potential prognostic biomarker for HCC (Lin2023MRPL48). The gene's expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, affecting the Th1/Th2 balance, which may contribute to immune evasion by the tumor (Lin2023MRPL48).

MRPL48 has also been associated with Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder, highlighting its role in mitochondrial function and its potential impact on neuromuscular diseases (PerezMartinez2008Protein). Additionally, MRPL48 is listed among genes with deleterious mutations in the context of Tourette syndrome, suggesting a broader implication in neurological conditions (Clarke2021Tourette). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MRPL48 in various diseases, particularly those related to mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer progression.
