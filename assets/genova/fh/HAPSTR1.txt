# HAPSTR1

## Overview
HAPSTR1, also known as C16orf72 or TAPR1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular stress response pathways, particularly under conditions of replication stress. The protein encoded by HAPSTR1 is characterized by its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1, playing a pivotal role in modulating replication-associated R-loops and maintaining genome stability. It functions as a crucial mediator in the resolution of DNA:RNA hybrids at stalled replication forks, thereby preventing genome instability. HAPSTR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it collaborates with proteins such as BRCA1 and Senataxin to ensure proper DNA replication dynamics and cell viability. Its involvement in cellular stress responses and interactions with key proteins highlight its significance in both normal cellular function and disease contexts, including cancer progression (Li2024An; Amici2024Tight; Sharma2023C16orf72HAPSTR1TAPR1).

## Function
HAPSTR1, also known as C16orf72 or TAPR1, is a gene that plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability and cell viability under replication stress conditions. It functions in conjunction with BRCA1 and the RNA/DNA helicase Senataxin to modulate replication-associated R-loops, which are DNA:RNA hybrids that can accumulate at stalled replication forks and lead to genome instability if not properly regulated (Sharma2023C16orf72HAPSTR1TAPR1). HAPSTR1 is essential for replication fork recovery and restart, suppressing DNA damage, and ensuring proper DNA replication dynamics (Sharma2023C16orf72HAPSTR1TAPR1).

HAPSTR1 is recruited to chromatin in response to replication stress, where it interacts with Senataxin and BRCA1 to resolve R-loops, facilitating replication fork progression and restart (Sharma2023C16orf72HAPSTR1TAPR1). This function is crucial for cell survival, particularly in the absence of PARP1/2, as HAPSTR1 provides an alternative pathway to maintain R-loop homeostasis and cell viability (Sharma2023C16orf72HAPSTR1TAPR1). The gene's activity is primarily associated with the nucleus, where it influences cellular responses to replication stress and contributes to the maintenance of genomic integrity (Sharma2023C16orf72HAPSTR1TAPR1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the HAPSTR1 gene have been implicated in several disease contexts, particularly in cancer. In ovarian cancer, HAPSTR1 is overexpressed and associated with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall and progression-free survival. This overexpression promotes cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by interacting with proteins such as LRPPRC and PSMD14, which are involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and autophagy pathways (Li2024An). The gene's role in modulating these pathways suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer treatment (Li2024An).

HAPSTR1 is also involved in cellular stress response pathways, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in these pathways, regulated by HAPSTR1, are linked to diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration (Amici2024Tight). The gene's interaction with HUWE1, a ubiquitin ligase, is essential for nuclear protein quality control, and its dysregulation can lead to significant physiological consequences, including perinatal lethality in mice and reduced fitness in adults (Amici2024Tight). These findings underscore the critical role of HAPSTR1 in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Interactions
HAPSTR1, also known as C16orf72, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 through its conserved HBO domain, which is essential for its role in cellular stress response pathways. Key residues in this domain, such as F90, A94, and Y101, are crucial for binding to HUWE1, while G119 is important for dimerization (Amici2024Tight). HAPSTR1 also interacts with nuclear pore proteins, facilitating the nuclear localization of HUWE1, which is vital for its non-canonical nuclear functions (Amici2024Tight).

In the context of ovarian cancer, HAPSTR1 interacts with LRPPRC and PSMD14, forming a ternary complex that stabilizes LRPPRC by suppressing its ubiquitination. This interaction promotes cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration (Li2024An). HAPSTR1 also plays a role in modulating replication-associated R-loops by interacting with BRCA1 and Senataxin. This interaction is crucial for resolving R-loops and maintaining genome stability during replication stress (Sharma2023C16orf72HAPSTR1TAPR1). These interactions highlight HAPSTR1's multifaceted role in cellular stress responses and cancer progression.
