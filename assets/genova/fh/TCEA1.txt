# TCEA1

## Overview
TCEA1 is a gene that encodes the transcription elongation factor A1, a protein integral to the transcription process by RNA polymerase II. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in transcription elongation by facilitating the progression of RNA polymerase II along DNA, overcoming transcriptional pausing, and enhancing elongation efficiency. TCEA1 is involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair and is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with RNA polymerase II, particularly in its hypophosphorylated form, indicating its involvement in early transcription stages (Cojocaru2007Genomic). Additionally, TCEA1 is associated with transcription initiation by RNA polymerase III, suggesting a broader role in transcription regulation across different classes of genes (Carrière2011Genomic).

## Structure
The TCEA1 gene encodes a protein involved in transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. The protein structure of TCEA1 includes a TFIIS N-terminal domain (TND), which is a conserved structural element characterized by a compact right-handed bundle of five α-helices. This structure is highly conserved despite low sequence identity among different TNDs, with hydrophobic residues within these helices strongly conserved and buried in the core, contributing to the stability of the fold (Cermakova2021A).

TCEA1, also known as transcription elongation factor SII, is composed of three domains: I, II, and III. Domain I extends from the N-terminus to residue 130, Domain II comprises residues 131-240, and Domain III includes amino acids 260-309. Domain II contains a 3-helix bundle with a short N-terminal strand necessary for RNA polymerase II binding, while Domain III, the zinc ribbon, is the most conserved part and contains three antiparallel β-sheets stabilized by cysteines that chelate zinc. This domain is essential for TCEA1 function and is likely the site of direct contact with RNA (Wind2000Transcription).

The TCEA1 gene is intronless in humans, but a testis-specific isoform, TCEA2, contains introns (Wind2000Transcription).

## Function
TCEA1, also known as transcription elongation factor A1, plays a critical role in the transcription process by facilitating the progression of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) along DNA. It is involved in overcoming transcriptional pausing and enhancing elongation efficiency, which is crucial for proper gene expression regulation (Cojocaru2007Genomic). TCEA1 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with RNAPII, particularly in its hypophosphorylated form, suggesting its involvement in early transcription stages (Cojocaru2007Genomic). 

The protein is recruited to regions near the transcription initiation site and further downstream transcription regions, especially after exposure to stress conditions like UVC radiation, indicating its role in transcription-coupled DNA repair (Cojocaru2007Genomic). TCEA1 is also associated with transcription elongation by stimulating the intrinsic endoribonuclease activity of RNAPII, allowing transcript cleavage and resumption of transcription from paused or arrested elongation complexes (Cojocaru2007Genomic). 

In addition to its role in transcription elongation, TCEA1 is involved in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase III, as it is associated with class III genes and tRNA genes in mouse embryonic stem cells, suggesting a broader role in transcription regulation (Carrière2011Genomic).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TCEA1, also known as transcription elongation factor A1, is involved in various interactions within the transcription machinery. It is known to co-purify with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) subunits, particularly the hypophosphorylated form of Rpb1, which is recruited to promoter DNA before transcription initiation. This suggests that TCEA1 can associate with RNAPII at promoters in vivo (Cojocaru2007Genomic). TCEA1 also interacts with other components of the transcription machinery, such as TFIIE and TFIIH, although these interactions are weaker (Cojocaru2007Genomic).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, TCEA1 is associated with both class II and class III genes, indicating its role as a transcription factor for RNA polymerase III (Pol III) in mammals. It is found on a significant percentage of tRNA genes and BRF2-dependent genes associated with Pol III, suggesting a role in transcription initiation by Pol III (Carrière2011Genomic). TCEA1 is also involved in transcription-coupled repair (TC-NER) during human spermatogenesis, where it facilitates transcription elongation by recovering stalled RNAPII complexes, which is crucial for DNA repair (Pankaew2021Singlecell). These interactions highlight TCEA1's multifaceted role in transcription regulation and DNA repair processes.
