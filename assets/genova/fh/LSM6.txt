# LSM6

## Overview
LSM6 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Lsm (Like Sm) family, which is characterized by its role in RNA processing and degradation. The LSM6 protein is a component of the LSm1-7 and LSm2-8 complexes, which are involved in mRNA degradation and U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) processing, respectively. These complexes form heptameric ring structures that are crucial for their function in RNA metabolism. In the cytoplasm, the LSm1-7 complex, which includes LSM6, is involved in mRNA decapping and degradation, while the LSm2-8 complex participates in the maturation and stability of U6 snRNA within the spliceosome, essential for pre-mRNA splicing (INGELFINGER2002The; FromontRacine2000GenomeWide). LSM6 has also been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels correlating with patient survival outcomes in skin cutaneous melanoma, breast cancer, and gastric cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Liu2023Identification; Ta2021Potential; Sun2022Expression).

## Structure
The LSM6 protein is part of the Lsm family, characterized by a conserved Sm fold, which includes an N-terminal alpha helix followed by a twisted five-stranded beta sheet. In the SpLsm6 subunit from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the alpha helix comprises residues 4-12, while the beta strands are composed of residues 14-21 (b1), 24-35 (b2), 38-49 (b3), 52-63 (b4), and 68-72 (b5) (Wu2012Crystal). This structural motif is conserved across various species, including humans, bacteria, and archaea, indicating its fundamental role in RNA processing (Wu2012Crystal).

LSM6 forms part of the Lsm5/6/7 complex, which assembles into a hexameric ring structure. This complex is stabilized by inter-subunit interactions, including continuous anti-parallel beta sheets, hydrophobic clusters, and salt bridges. The SpLsm5/6 interface is particularly stabilized by the pairing of beta strands b4 and b5, while the SpLsm6/7 interface has fewer contacts, suggesting a weaker interaction (Wu2012Crystal). The hexameric structure allows for RNA binding through a positively charged central cavity, which is crucial for its function in RNA metabolism (Wu2012Crystal). The Lsm proteins, including LSM6, have a propensity to form oligomeric ring-like structures, a hallmark of their function in RNA processing (Wu2012Crystal).

## Function
The LSM6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the LSm1-7 complex, which plays a crucial role in mRNA degradation in human cells. This complex is predominantly located in the cytoplasm, where it forms distinct foci associated with mRNA-degrading enzymes such as the decapping enzyme Dcp1/2 and the exonuclease Xrn1. These foci are thought to be involved in mRNA decay, potentially serving as assembly centers or storage sites for mRNA degradation machinery (INGELFINGER2002The).

LSM6 is essential for the incorporation of other LSm proteins into these cytoplasmic foci, suggesting it may be a limiting factor for the formation of the heptameric LSm1-7 complexes. Overexpression of LSM6 enhances the presence of other LSm proteins in these foci, indicating its pivotal role in the assembly of functional LSm complexes (INGELFINGER2002The).

In addition to its role in mRNA degradation, LSM6 is involved in RNA processing, particularly in the maturation and stability of U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) within the spliceosome. This activity is crucial for proper RNA splicing and gene expression, highlighting the importance of LSM6 in maintaining cellular function (FromontRacine2000GenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
LSM6 has been studied for its clinical significance in various cancers, particularly skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), breast cancer (BRCA), and gastric cancer (GC). In SKCM, higher expression of LSM6 is associated with longer overall survival (OS), indicating a potential protective role in this cancer type (Sun2022Expression). However, LSM6 expression does not correlate with disease-free survival (DFS) in SKCM, suggesting its influence may be limited to overall patient survival rather than recurrence (Sun2022Expression).

In breast cancer, LSM6 is underexpressed, especially in the Basal-like subtype, and is associated with poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS), with a hazard ratio of 1.17, indicating a moderate risk of recurrence (Ta2021Potential). This suggests that LSM6 may play a role in tumor progression or recurrence in breast cancer.

In gastric cancer, LSM6 is linked to poor overall survival in patients undergoing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy, with a hazard ratio of 1.48, suggesting a potential role in chemoresistance (Liu2023Identification). However, the specific clinical significance of LSM6 mutations in these cancers remains unclear, as detailed studies on its mutations are lacking.

## Interactions
LSM6 is a component of the Lsm1-7 and Lsm2-8 complexes, which are involved in RNA processing and degradation. In the Lsm1-7 complex, LSM6 interacts with other Lsm proteins to form a heptameric ring structure that is crucial for mRNA decapping, a key step in mRNA degradation. This complex binds RNA sequences with micromolar affinities and is involved in various RNA metabolism pathways (Zhou2014Crystal). LSM6 specifically interacts with Lsm3 and Lsm7 through van der Waals contacts within this heptameric structure (Zhou2014Crystal).

In the Lsm2-8 complex, LSM6 is part of a ring structure that interacts with U6 snRNA, facilitating its base-pairing with U4 snRNA, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. This complex also interacts with the splicing factor Prp24, forming the U6 snRNP, a critical component in spliceosome assembly (Karaduman2008Structure; Montemayor2020Moleculara). The Lsm2-8 complex shows a preference for binding RNA with a 2′,3′ cyclic phosphate group, indicating a specific recognition mechanism (Montemayor2020Moleculara). These interactions highlight the role of LSM6 in both mRNA decay and splicing processes.
