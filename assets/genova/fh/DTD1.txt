# DTD1

## Overview
DTD1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase 1, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis by removing D-amino acids from tRNA molecules. This enzyme is categorized as a deacylase and is crucial for ensuring that only L-amino acids, the correct substrates for protein synthesis, are incorporated into proteins. The DTD1 protein is characterized by its α/β structural class, featuring a conserved active site motif 'SQFT' essential for its enzymatic function. It operates primarily in the cytoplasm, where it hydrolyzes the ester bond between D-amino acids and tRNA, thus preventing the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids into proteins. This proofreading activity is vital for cellular function and organismal health, as the presence of D-amino acids in proteins can be detrimental (Mazeed2021Recruitment; Bhatt2016Recent). Additionally, DTD1 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its involvement in certain myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms through fusion gene formation, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Gosenca2014Identification).

## Structure
The DTD1 protein, encoded by the human gene DTD1, is involved in maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis by removing D-amino acids from tRNA molecules. The primary structure of DTD1 includes an active site motif identified as 'SQFT', which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Bhatt2016Recent). The secondary structure of DTD1 is characterized by its belonging to the α/β class of proteins, featuring a five-stranded mixed β sheet and a three-stranded anti-parallel β sheet, which are covered by two parallel α helices. This structural architecture is conserved across different species, as indicated by crystallographic studies (Bhatt2016Recent).

The tertiary structure of DTD1 involves the three-dimensional folding that allows the d-amino acid of a d-aa-tRNA to fit snugly into its active site, preventing the accommodation of an N-ethylated amino group, which explains its specificity and inability to act on N-ethyl-d-aa-tRNAs (Mazeed2021Recruitment). The quaternary structure, specific domains, and post-translational modifications of DTD1 are not detailed in the provided context. There is no information on splice variant isoforms of DTD1 in the context provided.

## Function
DTD1, or D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase 1, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis in human cells. It functions by hydrolyzing the ester bond between D-amino acids and tRNA, effectively removing incorrectly charged D-amino acids from tRNA molecules. This proofreading activity is essential because the presence of D-amino acids in proteins can be detrimental to cellular function and organismal health (Bhatt2016Recent). By ensuring that only L-amino acids, the correct substrates for protein synthesis, are incorporated into proteins, DTD1 helps maintain the accuracy of protein translation.

DTD1 is active in the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis occurs, and its activity is crucial for preventing the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids into proteins. This function underscores its importance in cellular processes and overall organismal health (Bhatt2016Recent). The enzyme's role in editing tRNA molecules highlights its contribution to the quality control mechanisms that safeguard the integrity of protein synthesis, thereby supporting proper cellular function and development.

## Clinical Significance
The DTD1 gene has been investigated for its potential role in various medical conditions, particularly in relation to aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) and certain myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms. A study by Hyoung Shin explored the association between DTD1 gene variations and aspirin intolerance in asthmatic patients. Although the study found no significant association between DTD1 variants and the risk of AIA, some nominal associations were observed with the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) in AIA patients. These associations did not remain significant after corrections for multiple testing, suggesting that while DTD1 variations might influence airway function, they do not significantly impact AIA risk (Shin2011Association).

In another study, the DTD1 gene was identified as part of a fusion gene, DTD1-PDGFRB, in eosinophilia-associated myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms. This fusion gene results from chromosomal rearrangements and retains the PDGFRB tyrosine-kinase domain, leading to constitutive activation. The DTD1-PDGFRB fusion gene has been shown to have transforming activity and is sensitive to imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been effective in achieving complete hematologic remissions in affected patients (Gosenca2014Identification). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of DTD1 in specific neoplastic conditions.

## Interactions
DTD1, a D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase, is involved in interactions with both nucleic acids and proteins. It plays a crucial role in proofreading and recycling mischarged tRNAs, particularly by hydrolyzing D-aminoacyl-tRNAs to prevent the incorporation of D-amino acids into proteins, thus maintaining translational fidelity (Kumar2024When; Bhatt2016Recent). DTD1 interacts with tRNA molecules, distinguishing between cognate and non-cognate tRNAs through the discriminator base, which is the 73rd nucleotide of tRNA. This interaction is essential for the enzyme's ability to differentiate between Gly-tRNA Gly and Gly-tRNA Ala, ensuring the correct recycling of mischarged tRNAs (Kumar2024When).

In terms of protein interactions, DTD1 has been shown to interact with mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit proteins, such as MRPS11, suggesting a potential role in broader cellular processes beyond its primary function in tRNA proofreading (Revathi2021Expression). Additionally, DTD1 interacts with tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (tyrRS) to catalyze the hydrolysis of d-tyrosyl-tRNA, preventing the accumulation of misacylated tRNA molecules (Shin2011Association). These interactions highlight DTD1's involvement in maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis and its potential roles in cellular metabolism and immune responses.
