# UBE2B

## Overview
UBE2B is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 B, a critical component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through ubiquitination, a process essential for protein degradation, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation. UBE2B is characterized by a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, thereby influencing various cellular pathways (Yatsenko2013UBE2B; Garg2020Structural). The enzyme plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating transcription through the monoubiquitination of histone H2B (Du2021The). UBE2B's activity is modulated by interactions with E3 ligases and is subject to regulation by phosphorylation, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and response to DNA damage (Valimberti2015E2; Hsu2018Ubiquitinconjugating).

## Structure
UBE2B, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 B, is characterized by a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is crucial for its function in the ubiquitination process. This domain spans amino acids 7-140 and is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity (Yatsenko2013UBE2B). The UBC domain contains an active site that facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, a process vital for protein degradation and regulation (Garg2020Structural).

The primary structure of UBE2B includes a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure of UBE2B typically features alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in E2 enzymes (Meghan2022Review). The tertiary structure of UBE2B is likely similar to other class 1 E2 enzymes, which share high sequence identity and homology, suggesting a conserved three-dimensional conformation (Meghan2022Review).

UBE2B may also participate in quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, such as E3 ligases, which are crucial for its function in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate UBE2B's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
UBE2B, also known as RAD6B, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in DNA repair, particularly in response to DNA damage, where it is up-regulated and localizes to sites of damage to facilitate repair mechanisms (Voutsadakis2012Ubiquitin). UBE2B is also essential for the monoubiquitination of histone H2B, a process important for transcriptional activation and genomic stability (Du2021The).

In the context of the cell cycle, UBE2B participates in the ubiquitination of proteins such as p53 and Ki67, which are critical for the G2/M transition, thereby ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Du2021The). It also stabilizes β-catenin by forming Lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains, which is significant for the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation (Voutsadakis2012Ubiquitin).

UBE2B is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining protein homeostasis through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Hsu2018Ubiquitinconjugating). Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its catalytic function, indicating a sophisticated level of control over its involvement in cellular processes (Valimberti2015E2).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2B, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In tuberculosis (TB), the splicing event UBE2B-exon7-SE has been identified as a potential biomarker for TB onset. This splicing event is stable and independent of confounding factors, although its role in predicting TB prognosis remains uncertain (Lyu2023From). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCA), UBE2B is highly expressed and functions as an oncogene, promoting aggressive growth and migration of cancer cells. Its expression is significantly correlated with poor prognosis, particularly in overweight patients, and is involved in pathways like Wnt signaling and NF-kB, which enhance cancer development (Ding2024Identification). 

UBE2B is also associated with male infertility. Alterations in UBE2B mRNA are linked to severe oligozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count. These alterations include splicing, missense, and nonsense mutations, which can disrupt protein function and are not present in normozoospermic controls (Yatsenko2013UBE2B). Additionally, variants in the UBE2B promoter region have been associated with idiopathic azoospermia, affecting gene expression and contributing to infertility (Mou2015A).

## Interactions
UBE2B, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in the ubiquitination pathway. It interacts with E3 ligases, such as the atypical E3 ligase module in UBR4, which is part of the N-degron pathway. This interaction involves specific residues in UBE2B that are essential for its recognition and activity with UBR4, facilitating autoubiquitination processes (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A). UBE2B does not interact with the muscle-specific E3 ligase MuRF1, indicating that its role in myofibrillar protein loss during catabolic conditions is independent of MuRF1 and involves other E3 ligases (Polge2015UBE2B).

In the context of tuberculosis, UBE2B's splicing variant, UBE2B-exon7-SE, is regulated by the splicing factor SRSF1. This interaction is modulated by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which affects the splicing of UBE2B and subsequently alters the ubiquitination proteome in macrophages (Lyu2023From). These interactions highlight UBE2B's role in diverse cellular processes, including protein degradation and immune response regulation.
