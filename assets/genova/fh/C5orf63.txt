# C5orf63

## Overview
C5orf63 is a gene located on chromosome 5 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 5 open reading frame 63. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular processes that require interaction with the cell membrane. While the specific functions of C5orf63 are not fully elucidated, transmembrane proteins typically play critical roles in signaling pathways, transport of molecules, and maintaining cellular structure. The gene and its encoded protein may be implicated in various biological pathways and could have potential clinical significance, although further research is needed to fully understand its roles and interactions within the cell.
