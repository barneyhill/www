# KMT2D

## Overview
KMT2D is a gene that encodes the lysine methyltransferase 2D protein, a critical enzyme involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. This protein functions as a histone methyltransferase, specifically targeting histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with transcriptional activation (Froimchuk2017Histone). As a member of the SET domain-containing family of proteins, KMT2D plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and the regulation of transcriptional enhancers, which are essential for cell-type-specific gene expression during differentiation (Li2021The). The protein is a key component of the ASCOM complex, interacting with various proteins to facilitate its methyltransferase activity and influence RNA processing (Amin2023KMT2D). Mutations in the KMT2D gene are linked to Kabuki syndrome and have been implicated in several cancers, underscoring its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Bögershausen2016Mutation; Jung2022Characterizing).

## Structure
The KMT2D protein, also known as lysine methyltransferase 2D, is a large protein consisting of 5,537 amino acids. It plays a crucial role in histone modification, specifically in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) (Froimchuk2017Histone; Li2021The). The protein structure includes several key domains: two clusters of plant homeotic domains (PHDs) located in the N-terminus, an enzymatically active C-terminal SET domain, FY-rich N/C-terminal (FYRN and FYRC) domains, a high mobility group I (HMG-I) binding motif, and multiple nuclear receptor-interacting motifs (LXXLLs) (Froimchuk2017Histone; Li2021The).

The PHD domains are organized in clusters and are involved in recognizing histone modifications, such as H3K4me3 and acetylation marks, which are crucial for chromatin targeting and transcriptional regulation (Stroynowska-Czerwinska2023Clustered). The SET domain is responsible for the protein's methyltransferase activity and is essential for maintaining the stability of KMT2D (Froimchuk2017Histone; Li2021The).

KMT2D also contains two low-complexity domains (LCDs), which are important for forming a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) microenvironment. This LLPS is critical for the stability of the WDR5 protein and the formation of the KMT2D-enzyme complex, influencing its methyltransferase activity (Li2021The). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions (Li2021The).

## Function
KMT2D, also known as lysine methyltransferase 2D, is a crucial epigenetic regulator involved in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with transcriptional activation. This protein functions as a major enhancer histone methylation enzyme, playing a significant role in the regulation of transcriptional enhancers, which are critical for cell-type specific gene expression during differentiation (Froimchuk2017Histone). KMT2D is part of a multi-protein complex that includes components such as NCOA6, ASH2L, and RbBP5, and it is essential for the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases like CBP and p300 to enhancers, facilitating enhancer activation and enhancer-promoter looping (Froimchuk2017Histone).

In epithelial cells, KMT2D interacts with the transcription factor p63, a master regulator of epithelial development, to maintain the expression of genes involved in epithelial development, differentiation, and adhesion (LinShiao2018KMT2D). It is crucial for maintaining the proliferative capacity of epithelial progenitor cells and coordinating epithelial stratification (LinShiao2018KMT2D). KMT2D's role extends to cellular metabolism, where it influences mitochondrial respiration and energy production, highlighting its broad impact on cellular function and organismal homeostasis (Pacelli2020Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KMT2D gene are primarily associated with Kabuki syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and growth delays. KMT2D mutations account for 55-80% of Kabuki syndrome cases, with the majority being truncating mutations, including nonsense and frameshifting mutations (Bögershausen2016Mutation; de2018Burkitt). These mutations often lead to a loss of function of the KMT2D protein, which is crucial for chromatin modification and gene expression (Jung2022Characterizing).

In addition to Kabuki syndrome, alterations in KMT2D expression or function have been implicated in various cancers. Somatic mutations in KMT2D are frequently observed in lymphomas and leukemias, where they can act as a tumor suppressor gene. In B-cell lymphoma and leukemia, reduced KMT2D activity leads to tumor proliferation, while in other cancers like breast cancer, it causes decreased proliferation, indicating tissue-type-dependent effects (Faundes2018A; Jung2022Characterizing).

The presence of KMT2D mutations in both Kabuki syndrome and certain cancers suggests a potential predisposition to cancer in patients with Kabuki syndrome, highlighting the need for careful monitoring of these individuals (de2018Burkitt).

## Interactions
KMT2D, also known as lysine methyltransferase 2D, is a key component of the ASCOM complex, which includes proteins such as NCOA6, KMT2C, ASH2L, and RbBP5. This complex is involved in H3K4 methyltransferase activity, essential for gene expression regulation (Froimchuk2017Histone). KMT2D interacts with several proteins, including PTIP, WDR5, DPY30, UTX, and PA1, forming a complex that exhibits strong H3K4 methyltransferase activity. The WRAD sub-complex, consisting of WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30, is critical for this activity (Froimchuk2017Histone).

KMT2D also plays a role in RNA processing by binding to mRNAs of the genes it regulates. It interacts with spliceosomal RNAs and Cajal-body related RNAs, indicating its involvement in splicing-related processes (Amin2023KMT2D). KMT2D is associated with super-enhancers and interacts with Med1 and super-enhancer associated lncRNAs like GATA2-AS1 and OIP5-AS1 (Amin2023KMT2D). It is necessary for the correct positioning of RNA polymerase II at enhancers and colocalizes with RPOL 2 phosphorylated on serine 5, which is involved in mRNA splicing (Amin2023KMT2D). The polyQ region of KMT2D is crucial for its phase separation, affecting its localization and interaction with RPOL 2 (Amin2023KMT2D).
