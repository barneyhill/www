# NDST2

## Overview
The NDST2 gene encodes the enzyme N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 2, which is a type II membrane protein involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and heparin. This enzyme plays a critical role in the modification of glucosamine residues through N-deacetylation and N-sulfation, processes essential for the structural diversity and functional specificity of heparan sulfate chains. These modifications are crucial for the formation of high-affinity binding sites that influence various cellular processes, including growth factor signaling and cell-matrix interactions. NDST2 is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus and is expressed in various tissues, with significant roles in mast cells where it contributes to the sulfation of heparin, impacting inflammatory responses and mast cell function (Grobe2002Heparan).

## Structure
The NDST2 protein is a type II membrane protein involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and heparin. It consists of 883 amino acids and is characterized by a bifunctional enzymatic activity, with distinct domains responsible for N-deacetylation and N-sulfation (Duncan2006Characterization). The N-terminal domain (A66-P604) is responsible for N-deacetylase activity, while the C-terminal domain (residues 599T-883G) is responsible for N-sulfotransferase activity (Duncan2006Characterization).

The NDST2 protein is a type II membrane-bound protein, featuring a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, and a stem region followed by a catalytic domain (Grobe2002Heparan). The catalytic domain contains two independent active sites for its enzymatic functions. Although the specific tertiary structure of NDST2 is not detailed, it is suggested that the sulfotransferase domains of NDST isoforms, including NDST2, have been modeled based on the NDST1 structure, which has a spherical shape with a central five-stranded parallel beta-sheet and a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (KuscheGullberg2003Sulfotransferases).

NDST2 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing (Grobe2002Regulated).

## Function
NDST2 (N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 2) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a complex polysaccharide that plays a crucial role in cell signaling and development. NDST2 catalyzes the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine residues, which are essential steps in the modification of HS chains. This modification process is critical for creating high-affinity binding sites for various proteins, influencing growth factor and cytokine activity, cell-matrix adhesion, and other cellular processes (Grobe2002Heparan).

NDST2 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the structural diversity of HS, affecting its interaction with proteins and thereby modulating signaling pathways such as FGF, Wnt, and Hedgehog (Grobe2002Heparan). In healthy human cells, NDST2 is widely expressed, with its mRNA detectable in various tissues, although its protein expression may be limited to specific cell types like mast cells (Grobe2002Heparan). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the proper functioning of mast cells, as it contributes to the sulfation of heparin, a highly sulfated form of HS, which is necessary for the activation of mast cell proteases and the regulation of inflammatory responses (Grobe2002Heparan).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NDST2 gene can significantly impact mast cell function and inflammatory responses. NDST2 is crucial for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS) and heparin, particularly in connective tissue-type mast cells. Deficiency in NDST2 leads to a reduced number of mast cells and depleted granules of sulfated heparin chains, resulting in decreased histamine and mast cell protease content. This impairs the degradation of fibronectin and affects inflammatory responses, although neutrophil recruitment can still occur due to cytokines like TNF-a (Grobe2002Heparan; Forsberg2001Heparan).

Despite these deficiencies, NDST2-null mice do not exhibit signs of thrombosis, suggesting that endogenous heparin is not essential for blood clotting but is vital for mast cell homeostasis (Forsberg2001Heparan). The absence of NDST2 does not lead to structural changes in HS in the liver and kidney, possibly due to compensation by other NDST isoforms (Forsberg2001Heparan). These findings underscore the specific role of NDST2 in mast cells and its potential implications in disorders related to mast cell function and inflammatory responses.
