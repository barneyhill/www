# SNRPF

## Overview
SNRPF is a gene that encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide F, a critical component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). These snRNPs are essential for the splicing of pre-mRNA, a process that removes introns and joins exons to produce mature messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. The protein encoded by SNRPF is part of the Sm protein family and plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for RNA splicing. SNRPF forms part of the pentameric partial Sm ring, which is crucial for recognizing Sm-sites on small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) before the full heptameric ring is assembled with the assistance of the SMN complex (Raker1996The; Chauhan2024AMycobacterium). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and mRNA maturation, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Liu2022SNRPD1EFG; Chauhan2024AMycobacterium).

## Structure


## Function
SNRPF encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is involved in the assembly and function of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for removing introns from pre-mRNA, thereby facilitating the maturation of mRNA. SNRPF is part of the pentameric partial Sm ring, which is vital for recognizing Sm-sites on snRNAs before the assembly of the full heptameric ring with the help of the SMN complex. This process is essential for the formation of snRNPs, which are components of the spliceosome complex involved in RNA splicing (Chauhan2024AMycobacterium).

In healthy human cells, SNRPF is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to gene expression regulation and mRNA maturation. The protein's role in the spliceosome is critical for maintaining the fidelity of RNA splicing, ensuring that introns are accurately removed and exons are joined together to form mature mRNA transcripts. This function is fundamental to the proper expression of genes and the production of functional proteins, which are necessary for various cellular processes and overall organismal health (Chauhan2024AMycobacterium).

## Clinical Significance
SNRPF has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SNRPF is highly expressed in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous ones. Its abnormal expression is associated with TP53 mutations, tumor grades, and cancer stages. SNRPF serves as an independent prognostic factor for poorer overall survival in LUAD patients, indicating a carcinogenic role (Liu2022SNRPD1EFG). High mRNA levels of SNRPF are linked to poor overall survival in LUAD, particularly in non-smoking patients, with a hazard ratio of 3.27 (Liu2022SNRPD1EFG).

In tuberculosis, SNRPF is sequestered by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence factor Hsr1, disrupting host snRNP biogenesis. This sequestration is crucial for the pathogen's virulence, as it leads to dysregulation of RNA splicing in infected macrophages (Chauhan2024AMycobacterium).

SNRPF expression is also affected by second-generation antipsychotics, which decrease its levels in heart tissues, potentially contributing to cardiotoxicity and cardiac pathology (Wang2021Secondgeneration). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SNRPF in various pathological conditions, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SNRPF, also known as small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide F, is a component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. It forms part of the Sm protein family, which includes proteins such as SNRPD1, SNRPD2, and SNRPD3. These proteins assemble into a core snRNP complex that is essential for the formation of the spliceosome.

SNRPF interacts with other core snRNP proteins, including E and G, to form a stable E-F-G complex. This complex is a key component in the assembly of snRNP core particles and is involved in forming a 'subcore' particle with D1 and D2 proteins, which can bind to U1 snRNA (Raker1996The). The E-F-G complex is more stable than individual E-F or E-G complexes, indicating that these proteins likely exist in a multimeric form before associating with UsnRNA (Raker1996The).

SNRPF also participates in interactions mediated by the SMN complex, which includes Gemin2. Gemin2 interacts with the Sm pentamer, including SNRPF, to prevent premature RNA binding, ensuring proper assembly of the Sm core around pre-snRNAs (Zhang2011Structure). These interactions are crucial for the biogenesis and function of snRNPs, highlighting the importance of SNRPF in RNA splicing processes.
