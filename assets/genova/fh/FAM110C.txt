# FAM110C

## Overview
FAM110C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 110, specifically member C. This protein is involved in critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and DNA damage repair. It is associated with centrosomes and microtubule organization centers, playing a significant role in mitotic spindle formation and cell division. FAM110C is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular proliferation and growth. It interacts with various proteins to influence DNA repair pathways, such as inhibiting the ATR/CHK1 pathway and activating the ATM/CHK2 pathway, and is involved in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. The gene's ability to induce G1/S phase arrest highlights its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (liu2024methylation).

## Function
FAM110C is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage repair. In healthy human cells, FAM110C is associated with centrosomes and microtubule organization centers, playing a role in mitotic spindle formation and proper cell division (liu2024methylation). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular proliferation and growth.

FAM110C interacts with the protein HMGB1 to influence DNA damage repair pathways. It inhibits the ATR/CHK1 pathway, as indicated by elevated levels of phosphorylated ATR and CHK1 in cells lacking FAM110C expression. Conversely, it activates the ATM/CHK2 pathway, with increased levels of phosphorylated ATM and CHK2 observed upon FAM110C expression (liu2024methylation). FAM110C is also involved in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, as evidenced by higher levels of phosphorylated DNAPKcs and XRCC4 in cells expressing FAM110C (liu2024methylation).

The gene's role in cell cycle regulation is further highlighted by its ability to induce G1/S phase arrest, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and migration (liu2024methylation). These functions underscore FAM110C's importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
FAM110C has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In the context of Huntington's disease (HD), FAM110C is identified as a microtubule/actin binding gene. Dysregulation of such genes may disturb intracellular trafficking processes in the presence of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), potentially contributing to the pathological processes of HD (Cheng2020Identification).

In a case study involving a child with a ring chromosome 2, a deletion at the 2p25.3 region, which includes FAM110C, was associated with phenotypic consequences such as growth failure, microcephaly, and developmental anomalies. However, the specific clinical significance of FAM110C in these conditions is not detailed, as the study focuses on broader phenotypic effects of chromosomal deletions (Severino2015Clinicoradiological).

FAM110C is also mentioned in the context of cancer, where it is suggested to be involved in cell spreading, migration, and filopodia induction, indicating its potential relevance to malignancies. However, the clinical significance of FAM110C in cancer is not extensively detailed in the available studies (Zhong2023Pancancer). Further research is needed to fully elucidate its role in these diseases.
