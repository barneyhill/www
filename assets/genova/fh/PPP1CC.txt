# PPP1CC

## Overview
The PPP1CC gene encodes the gamma isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes. This gene is responsible for producing two main isoforms, PPP1CC1 and PPP1CC2, through alternative splicing. PPP1CC1 is ubiquitously expressed and involved in diverse cellular functions, including synaptic plasticity and cell cycle regulation, while PPP1CC2 is predominantly expressed in the testis and is crucial for spermatogenesis and sperm motility (Silva2017Construction; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). The protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma, encoded by PPP1CC, is involved in regulating cell division, glycogen metabolism, and muscle contractility, among other functions, by interacting with various regulatory proteins and substrates (Brautigan2018Protein). The gene's significance is underscored by its involvement in clinical conditions such as male infertility and its potential association with muscle strength phenotypes (Windelinckx2011Identification; Ferreira2019Functions).

## Structure
The PPP1CC gene encodes the gamma isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine phosphatase. The primary structure of PPP1CC consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific regions contributing to its functional diversity. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in serine/threonine phosphatases. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with regulatory subunits and substrates.

PPP1CC undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms: PPP1CC1, which is ubiquitously expressed, and PPP1CC2, which is testis-enriched and sperm-specific. These isoforms differ primarily in their carboxyl-terminus, contributing to their distinct functional roles in different tissues (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). The C-terminus of PPP1CC is noted for its divergence among isoforms, which is used to produce isoform-specific antibodies (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating PPP1CC activity and interactions. The protein interacts with various regulatory proteins through motifs like the RVxF motif, which is crucial for complex formation and modulating PPP1 activity and specificity (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

## Function
The PPP1CC gene encodes the gamma isoform of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. This enzyme plays a crucial role in regulating cell division, glycogen metabolism, muscle contractility, and protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, PPP1CC is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell cycle progression and signal transduction pathways, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Brautigan2018Protein; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

PPP1CC exists in two isoforms, PPP1CC1 and PPP1CC2, produced through tissue-specific splicing. PPP1CC1 is ubiquitously expressed and involved in various cellular functions, including synaptic plasticity, vesicular trafficking, and mitosis. It interacts with proteins such as Neurabin I and II, playing a role in dendritic spine signaling and chromatin recruitment during mitosis (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

PPP1CC2 is testis-enriched and sperm-specific, playing a critical role in spermatogenesis and sperm motility. It interacts with proteins like AKAP4, which is involved in motility-related functions, and its absence leads to male infertility due to defective spermiogenesis (Silva2017Construction). The unique C-terminus of PPP1CC2 is important for binding specific regulatory subunits, contributing to its specialized functions in reproductive tissues (Silva2017Construction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PPP1CC gene, which encodes the gamma isoform of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), have been implicated in several health conditions. In mice, the global ablation of PP1γ, encoded by PPP1CC, does not result in an overt phenotype except for male infertility due to impaired spermiogenesis. This suggests that other PP1 isoforms can compensate for the loss of PP1γ in most tissues, but not in the testis, where PP1γ2 is specifically expressed in post-meiotic germ cells. The deletion of PP1γ2 leads to male infertility and abnormal sperm morphology, highlighting its critical role in spermiogenesis (Ferreira2019Functions).

In the context of muscle strength, the PPP1CC gene has been identified as a candidate locus associated with skeletal muscle strength phenotypes. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PPP1CC have shown significant associations with muscle strength measurements, although these associations are influenced by factors such as age, weight, and fat-free mass. The clinical significance of these associations remains to be fully elucidated, but they suggest a potential role for PPP1CC in muscle function (Windelinckx2011Identification).

## Interactions
PPP1CC, a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. The isoform PPP1CC1 interacts with regulatory subunits such as PPP1R9A (Neurabin I) and PPP1R9B (Neurabin II), which are involved in dendritic spine signaling and synaptic plasticity. It also interacts with proteins like ARFGEF1 and ARFGEF2, which are associated with vesicular trafficking and neuronal cell cytoskeleton organization. PPP1CC1 plays a role in mitosis through interactions with proteins like AURKB (Aurora-B) and CASC5, which are involved in chromatin modification and microtubule-kinetochore attachment (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

The testis-specific isoform PPP1CC2 forms a complex with the testis-specific proteins TSSK1 and TSKS in the mouse testis. TSKS mediates the interaction between PPP1CC2 and TSSK1, facilitating the formation of a kinase/phosphatase complex crucial for spermatogenesis. This interaction is dependent on a PP1 docking motif in TSKS (MacLeod2014PPP1CC2). In human spermatozoa, PPP1CC2 interacts with AKAP4, a protein involved in sperm motility, suggesting a role in regulating motility-related functions (Silva2017Construction).
