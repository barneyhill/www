# WFDC6

## Overview
The WFDC6 gene encodes the WAP four-disulfide core domain 6 protein, which is part of the WFDC family characterized by the presence of a whey acidic protein (WAP) domain. This domain is known for its role in protease inhibition, suggesting that the WFDC6 protein may function as a protease inhibitor. The protein is implicated in various biological processes, including immune response and inflammation, and has been associated with several diseases, particularly cancer and inflammatory conditions. The expression of WFDC6 is modulated by cytokines, and its dysregulation is linked to the pathogenesis of diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Andrade2020Lipopolysaccharideinduced; Wen2024Versatile).

## Clinical Significance
WFDC6 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), WFDC6 is significantly upregulated in ABCB5-positive cells, suggesting a role in tumor progression. Mutations in WFDC6 and its interacting proteins are associated with improved survival in CRC patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker or therapeutic target (E2021Identifying). In ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, particularly late-onset cases, high expression levels of WFDC6 are linked to longer overall survival, suggesting its clinical significance in influencing patient outcomes (Ma2020Identification).

WFDC6 is also involved in inflammatory responses. In the context of lipopolysaccharide-induced epididymitis, WFDC6 expression is downregulated, highlighting its role in immune response and inflammation in the male reproductive system (Andrade2020Lipopolysaccharideinduced). The gene's expression is modulated by cytokines, and aberrant expression is linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases, offering insights for potential therapeutic strategies (Wen2024Versatile). These findings underscore the importance of WFDC6 in disease progression and its potential as a target for clinical interventions.
