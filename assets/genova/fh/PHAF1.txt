# PHAF1

## Overview
PHAF1 is a gene that encodes the protein phagosome assembly factor 1, which plays a crucial role in the formation and maturation of phagosomes, cellular structures involved in the degradation of pathogens and cellular debris. The protein is involved in the regulation of phagosome dynamics and is essential for the proper functioning of the immune response. Phagosome assembly factor 1 is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its involvement in the orchestration of phagosome assembly and maturation processes. The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest in the study of immune system function and related disorders, as they are implicated in the efficient clearance of pathogens and apoptotic cells (Qiu2020aarFDC).
