# ZBTB25

## Overview
ZBTB25 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 25 protein, which is a transcription repressor involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by a DNA-binding zinc finger motif and a protein-binding BTB/POZ domain, classifying it as a member of the POZ and Krüppel (POK) protein family (Madhavan2020Transcription). ZBTB25 plays a critical role in modulating transcriptional networks, particularly in immune cells such as T cells and macrophages. It acts as a repressor in the NF-AT signaling pathway, influencing T-cell activation and function (Benita2010Gene). Additionally, ZBTB25 forms a silencing complex with histone deacetylase HDAC1, which is recruited to specific gene promoters to regulate immune responses during infections, such as those caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Madhavan2020Transcription). The protein also facilitates influenza A virus replication by interacting with viral RNA and components of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (Chen2017Zinc). These functions underscore the importance of ZBTB25 in immune regulation and viral pathogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Structure


## Function
ZBTB25 is a transcription repressor protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by modulating transcriptional networks. It contains a DNA-binding zinc finger motif and a protein-binding BTB/POZ domain, classifying it as a member of the POZ and Krüppel (POK) protein family (Madhavan2020Transcription). In T cells, ZBTB25 functions as a repressor in the NF-AT signaling pathway, which is crucial for T-cell activation and function. Knockdown of ZBTB25 enhances T-cell receptor-mediated NF-AT reporter activity, indicating its role in suppressing NF-AT target genes such as IL2, CD25, and GPR18 (Benita2010Gene).

ZBTB25 also interacts with HDAC1, a histone deacetylase, forming a silencing complex that is recruited to specific gene promoters, such as IL-12B, in macrophages. This interaction leads to the downregulation of IL-12B expression, impacting the host's immune response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (Madhavan2020Transcription). The protein's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its role in regulating immune responses and cellular differentiation, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases like tuberculosis and influenza (Chen2017Zinc).

## Interactions
ZBTB25 is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in both host immune response and viral replication. In macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), ZBTB25 interacts with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 and the transcriptional corepressor Sin3a to form a repressor complex. This complex is recruited to the IL-12B promoter, suppressing the expression of the IL-12B gene and downregulating the host's immune response (Madhavan2020Transcription). The interaction between ZBTB25 and HDAC1 is crucial for the regulation of IL-12B expression and the survival of MTB within macrophages (Madhavan2020Transcription).

ZBTB25 also plays a role in influenza A virus (IAV) replication. It binds to U-rich sequences within the 5' untranslated region of viral RNA, facilitating viral RNA transcription and replication. ZBTB25 interacts with components of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, including PA, PB1, PB2, and NP, enhancing RdRp activity (Chen2017Zinc). These interactions are essential for IAV replication, and the zinc-finger domain of ZBTB25 is crucial for its function in this context (Chen2017Zinc).
