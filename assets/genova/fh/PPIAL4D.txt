# PPIAL4D

## Overview
PPIAL4D is a gene that encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase A like 4D, which belongs to the cyclophilin family of proteins. These proteins are known for their role as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, which facilitate protein folding by catalyzing the isomerization of peptide bonds at proline residues. The PPIAL4D protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein folding and potentially in pathways related to cancer development and progression. It has been identified as a potential biomarker in medulloblastoma, a type of brain cancer, due to its presence in microvesicles associated with aggressive tumor characteristics (Kaid2020Proteome). Additionally, PPIAL4D's expression is affected by the ZIP8 protein, suggesting its involvement in pathways influenced by ZIP8 activity (Tan2022Singlegene). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the specific functions and clinical significance of PPIAL4D.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
PPIAL4D has been identified as a potential biomarker in medulloblastoma, a type of brain cancer. Proteome and miRNA profiling of microvesicles derived from medulloblastoma cell lines revealed that PPIAL4D is one of the proteins present in these microvesicles, which are associated with aggressive tumor characteristics. This suggests that PPIAL4D may play a role in cancer development, particularly in processes like cell proliferation and DNA repair, which are crucial for tumor progression (Kaid2020Proteome).

In a study examining the effects of ZIP8 protein knockout in human cells, PPIAL4D was identified as one of the top-10 most downregulated proteins. This downregulation indicates that PPIAL4D may be involved in pathways affected by ZIP8 malfunction, although the specific clinical significance of this interaction remains unclear (Tan2022Singlegene).

While PPIAL4D's role in congenital heart disease (CHD) is not directly mentioned, the PPIAL4 gene family, which includes PPIAL4D, is noted for encoding proteins that accelerate protein folding, potentially influencing developmental processes related to CHD (Dasouki2020New). However, further research is needed to clarify PPIAL4D's specific contributions to these conditions.
