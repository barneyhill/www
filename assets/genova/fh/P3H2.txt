# P3H2

## Overview
P3H2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2, which is a member of the family of prolyl hydroxylases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of collagen, specifically through the hydroxylation of proline residues, a process crucial for the stability and function of the collagen triple helix. Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2 is particularly significant in the hydroxylation of fibril-forming collagens, such as type I and type II, and plays a vital role in the formation and maintenance of the basement membrane by modifying collagen type IV. The activity of P3H2 is essential for the structural integrity of various tissues, including the glomerular basement membrane and the sclera, and its dysfunction is associated with several pathologies, including kidney diseases and potential implications in cancer (Hudson2015Posttranslationally; Aypek2022Loss; Fernandes2011A).

## Function
Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2 (P3H2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of collagen, specifically through the hydroxylation of proline residues. This modification is essential for the stability and function of the collagen triple helix, which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of various tissues. P3H2 is particularly involved in the hydroxylation of proline residues in fibril-forming collagens, such as type I and type II collagen, at specific sites like Pro-944, Pro-707, and the C-terminal GPP repeat (Fernandes2011A). This enzymatic activity occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, where P3H2 contributes to the proper biosynthesis of collagen, affecting tissue integrity and function (Hudson2015Posttranslationally).

In endothelial cells, P3H2 is upregulated by vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) through the VEGFR-2/p38 MAPK signaling pathway, enhancing angiogenic responses such as cell migration and capillary sprouting (Pignata2021Prolyl). P3H2's activity on collagen type IV is particularly important for the formation and maintenance of the basement membrane, which is vital for vascular survival and maturation (Pignata2021Prolyl). The enzyme's role in collagen modification is also implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and the sclera, with its absence leading to structural abnormalities and potential pathologies (Hudson2015Posttranslationally; Aypek2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the P3H2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in kidney diseases. P3H2 is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) by modifying collagen IV. Mutations in P3H2 can lead to thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), conditions characterized by structural damage to the GBM, resulting in albuminuria and potential progression to kidney failure (Aypek2022Loss). In patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and high myopia, a specific nonsense mutation in P3H2 was identified, causing a premature stop codon and leading to significant glomerular damage (Aypek2022Loss).

The absence of P3H2 disrupts the collagen IV network, leading to GBM thinning and subsequent kidney pathologies. In mouse models, the loss of P3H2 resulted in progressive glomerular disease, with symptoms such as microhematuria and microalbuminuria, and eventually glomerulosclerosis (Aypek2022Loss). These findings underscore the importance of P3H2 in maintaining GBM structure and function, with its mutations or altered expression contributing to severe renal conditions. The clinical significance of P3H2 extends to its potential role in breast cancer, where its epigenetic silencing is associated with tumor suppressor activity (Shah2009The).

## Interactions
Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2 (P3H2) is involved in the post-translational modification of collagen, specifically hydroxylating proline residues in collagen IV. P3H2 is distinct from other prolyl hydroxylases, such as P3H1, which forms a complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) for the hydroxylation of fibrillar collagens. Unlike P3H1, P3H2 does not enhance solubility or activity when coexpressed with CRTAP, indicating a different interaction profile (Tiainen2008Characterization).

P3H2 is strongly expressed in tissues rich in basement membranes, such as the kidney, and is more effective in hydroxylating synthetic peptides corresponding to collagen IV than those corresponding to collagen I. This suggests that P3H2 has a specific role in modifying collagen IV, which is crucial for the structural integrity of basement membranes (Tiainen2008Characterization).

The enzyme's activity is inhibited by certain 2-oxoglutarate analogues, highlighting its interaction with these molecules as part of its enzymatic function. P3H2's distinct kinetic properties compared to collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (C-P4Hs) further suggest unique interactions within the collagen biosynthesis pathway (Tiainen2008Characterization).
