# PSTPIP1

## Overview
PSTPIP1, or proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a cytoskeletal adaptor protein involved in the regulation of immune responses. The protein is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and plays a critical role in modulating T-cell activation and signaling. It contains an F-BAR domain, which is essential for membrane binding and curvature, and an SH3 domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins such as WASP, ABL, and CD2. These interactions are crucial for actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and the formation of the immunological synapse. Mutations in PSTPIP1 are linked to autoinflammatory disorders, including PAPA syndrome and PAMI syndrome, due to altered protein interactions and increased inflammatory responses (Shoham2003Pyrin; Marcos2014Proline‐serine‐threonine; Dowbenko1998Identification).

## Structure
PSTPIP1 is a cytoskeletal-associated protein that plays a role in immune response regulation. It contains an F-BAR domain at the N-terminal end, which is crucial for membrane binding and curvature. The F-BAR domain forms an elongated crescent-shaped dimer, with each protomer consisting of five α-helices. The dimerization interface is primarily formed by helices α2, α4, and α5, with parts of α3 and α4 forming wings bent at approximately 30° to the central region (Manso2022PSTPIP1LYP). The concave side of the F-BAR dimer is electropositive, facilitating membrane binding, while the convex side is electronegative, interacting with PEST phosphatases (Manso2022PSTPIP1LYP).

PSTPIP1 also contains an SH3 domain at the C-terminal end, which interacts with poly-Pro motifs of proteins such as WASP, ABL, and CD2 (Marcos2014Proline‐serine‐threonine). This domain is essential for its role in inhibiting T-cell receptor signaling (Marcos2014Proline‐serine‐threonine).

Mutations in the F-BAR domain, such as E250K and E257K, alter the electrostatic potential and affect protein-protein interactions, leading to distinct inflammatory diseases (Holzinger2015Single). These mutations involve a charge switch from acidic to basic residues, impacting the protein's function (Holzinger2015Single).

## Function
PSTPIP1 (proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1) is a cytoskeletal adaptor protein primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it plays a significant role in T-cell activation and immune response modulation. It is involved in the regulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling by inhibiting the activation of transcription factors such as NF-AT, AP1, and NF-kB, which are crucial for immune function. This inhibitory role is dependent on the SH3 domain of PSTPIP1, rather than its F-BAR domain, which interacts with PEST phosphatases like LYP and PTP-PEST (Marcos2014Proline‐serine‐threonine).

PSTPIP1 also interacts with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) through its SH3 domain, facilitating actin cytoskeletal rearrangement necessary for the formation of the immunological synapse between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This interaction is crucial for linking CD2 engagement to WASP-mediated actin polymerization, which is essential for synapse formation and T cell activation (Wu1998Tyrosine; Badour2003The).

In addition to its role in immune cells, PSTPIP1 is associated with the cytoskeleton and is involved in cytokinesis, as it localizes to the cleavage furrow during cell division (Dowbenko1998Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene are associated with several autoinflammatory disorders, most notably PAPA syndrome (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne). This condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of sterile arthritis, severe cystic acne, and pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcers. Mutations such as A230T and E250Q in the PSTPIP1 gene increase its binding to pyrin, leading to hyperphosphorylation and increased IL-1β secretion, which contributes to the inflammatory phenotype observed in PAPA syndrome (Shoham2003Pyrin).

PSTPIP1 mutations are also implicated in PAMI syndrome, a condition marked by chronic systemic inflammation, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and elevated levels of myeloid-related protein (MRP) 8/14. The p.E250K and p.E257K mutations in PSTPIP1 enhance its interaction with pyrin, leading to excessive activation of the inflammasome pathway and overproduction of IL-1β (Zhang2021Clinical; Mejbri2023PSTPIP1Associated).

These mutations disrupt normal protein interactions and cytoskeletal organization, affecting immune cell dynamics and leading to excessive inflammation. Treatments targeting IL-1, such as anakinra and canakinumab, have shown some effectiveness in managing these conditions, although responses can be inconsistent (Holzinger2016Alarming).

## Interactions
PSTPIP1 (proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) through its SH3 domain, which binds to proline-rich motifs within WASP. This interaction is important for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and is regulated by the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in PSTPIP1 (Wu1998Tyrosine).

PSTPIP1 also interacts with the PEST-type protein tyrosine phosphatase HSCF. This interaction is mediated by the NH2-terminal region of PSTPIP1 and is essential for regulating tyrosine phosphorylation levels (Dowbenko1998Identification).

The protein binds to LYP, a phosphatase, through its F-BAR domain, with specific mutations affecting this interaction. This binding is significant for understanding autoinflammatory disorders (Manso2022PSTPIP1LYP).

PSTPIP1 also interacts with pyrin, a protein involved in inflammatory responses. This interaction is mediated by the SH3 and coiled-coil domains of PSTPIP1 and is linked to increased IL-1β production in PAPA syndrome (Shoham2003Pyrin).
