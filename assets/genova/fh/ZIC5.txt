# ZIC5

## Overview
ZIC5 is a gene that encodes the Zic family member 5 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The ZIC5 protein is part of the Zic family, which plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in neural crest formation and neural tube closure. Unlike other Zic family members, ZIC5 lacks significant transcriptional activation ability and does not interact with the I-mfa protein due to the absence of a complete ZOC domain. It is involved in various signaling pathways, including the WNT/β-catenin pathway, where it modulates gene expression through interactions with other proteins such as TCF7L2. ZIC5's function is further regulated by post-translational modifications like SUMOylation, which influence its role as a transcriptional co-factor. Clinically, ZIC5 has been implicated in several cancers, including lung, prostate, and melanoma, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ali2012Zinc; Dong2021The; Ali2020WNT; Satow2017ZIC5).

## Structure
The ZIC5 protein is a member of the Zic family, characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding. These domains consist of five tandemly repeated C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, a feature shared with other Zic proteins and the Drosophila homologue odd-paired (opa) (Inoue2004Mouse; Nakata2000A). The primary structure of ZIC5 includes a conserved zinc finger domain, but its amino acid sequence outside this domain is divergent from other Zic family members, such as ZIC1, ZIC2, and ZIC3 (Ishiguro2004Molecular).

ZIC5 lacks a canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS), but its nuclear import is controlled by an interspersed type of NLS within the zinc fingers, utilizing the importin pathway (Ali2012Zinc). Unlike ZIC1, ZIC2, and ZIC3, ZIC5 does not exhibit significant transcriptional activation ability and does not interact with the I-mfa protein, attributed to the absence of a complete ZOC domain (Ishiguro2004Molecular). The ZIC5 protein's molecular structure includes a zinc finger N-flanking conserved region (ZF-NC), though its function remains unknown (Ali2012Zinc). The protein's tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
ZIC5 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in embryonic development, particularly in neural crest formation and neural tube closure. It functions by binding to DNA and modulating the expression of target genes essential for proper neural and skeletal development (Ali2012Zinc; Inoue2004Mouse). ZIC5 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins, such as TCF proteins, to influence transcription through pathways like WNT/β-catenin signaling (Ali2020WNT). 

In a high WNT environment, ZIC5 undergoes SUMOylation, a post-translational modification that alters its function. This modification decreases the formation of the TCF/ZIC co-repressor complex, shifting ZIC5's role towards transcription activation, which is crucial for neural crest cell development (Ali2020WNT). ZIC5's expression is particularly strong in the forebrain region before neurulation, indicating its importance in neural tube formation (Aruga2004The). 

Disruption of ZIC5 in mice results in neural tube defects and craniofacial abnormalities, highlighting its essential role in neural and skeletal development (Inoue2004Mouse). Despite its critical functions, the specific regulatory proteins for ZIC5 in vivo have not been fully identified (Ali2012Zinc).

## Clinical Significance
ZIC5 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In lung cancer, ZIC5 expression is significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to noncancerous tissues, correlating with tumor differentiation and size. High ZIC5 expression is associated with shorter overall survival, suggesting its role as an independent prognostic biomarker (Dong2021The). In prostate cancer, ZIC5 is upregulated, particularly in metastatic lesions, and is linked to poor prognosis. It promotes metastasis through mechanisms involving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, interacting with androgen receptor signaling to enhance cancer cell migration and invasion (Tan2022ARregulated).

In melanoma, ZIC5 contributes to tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance. It suppresses E-cadherin expression, enhancing cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. ZIC5's downstream signaling involves PDGFD and FAK activation, which are crucial for maintaining melanoma malignancy and resistance to BRAF inhibitors (Satow2017ZIC5). In colorectal cancer, ZIC5 is involved in transcriptional regulation and glucose metabolism, with its knockout leading to increased glycolysis, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Zhao2019βCateninTcf7l2–dependent). These findings highlight ZIC5's potential as a therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
ZIC5, a member of the Zic family of transcription factors, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its role in transcriptional regulation. ZIC5 interacts with the β-catenin/TCF7L2 complex, a key component of the WNT signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating transcriptional activity, particularly in the context of neural crest cell development and glucose metabolism (Zhao2019βCateninTcf7l2–dependent). The interaction between ZIC5 and TCF7L2 is modulated by SUMOylation, a post-translational modification that affects ZIC5's function as a transcriptional co-factor. The SUMO-incompetent form of ZIC5 shows increased interaction with TCF7L2, which is important for repressing β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription (Ali2020WNT).

ZIC5 also participates in interactions with other Zic family proteins, such as Zic2, which can act as a transcriptional activator, while ZIC5 functions as a repressor in the regulation of GLUT1 gene expression (Zhao2019βCateninTcf7l2–dependent). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory roles of ZIC5 in transcriptional networks, where it can act as both a co-repressor and a transactivator depending on the cellular context and post-translational modifications (Ali2020WNT).
