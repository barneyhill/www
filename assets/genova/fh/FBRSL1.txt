# FBRSL1

## Overview
FBRSL1 is a gene that encodes the fibrosin-like 1 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein is a member of the Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1.3 and PRC1.5, which play a critical role in gene expression regulation through histone modification (Pauli2021Comparing; Bukvic2024De). Fibrosin-like 1 is expressed in multiple tissues, notably in the developing brain and craniofacial structures, suggesting its involvement in neural and craniofacial development (Pauli2021Comparing). The gene produces several isoforms, each with distinct structural features and localization patterns, indicating diverse functional roles within the cell (Ufartes2020De). Mutations in FBRSL1 have been linked to a novel malformation and intellectual disability syndrome, highlighting its significance in human development and disease (Pauli2021Comparing; Ufartes2020De).

## Structure
The FBRSL1 gene encodes multiple protein isoforms, each with distinct structural features and functions. Isoform 1 is the longest, with a predicted molecular weight of 110 kDa, and includes the AUTS2 domain, which is crucial for its function (Ufartes2020De). Isoforms 3.1 and 3.2 are shorter, with molecular weights of 66 kDa and 55 kDa, respectively, and contain a Ftsk DNA translocase domain. However, isoform 3.1 has a 23-bp deletion that disrupts this domain, leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon (Ufartes2020De).

FBRSL1 is part of the Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1.3 and PRC1.5, which are involved in transcriptional regulation through histone modification (Pauli2021Comparing; Bukvic2024De). The protein's structure includes a proline-rich domain, a PPPY motif, and a hexanucleotide repeat, although specific details on secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided (Pauli2021Comparing).

The gene produces both long and short N-terminal isoforms, with the latter localizing in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting diverse roles in cellular processes (Bukvic2024De). The presence of nuclear localization signals in some truncated versions allows them to interact with wild-type isoforms, potentially inactivating them through a negative dominance effect (Bukvic2024De).

## Function
The FBRSL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes in human cells. FBRSL1 is involved in both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions, similar to its paralog AUTS2. In the nucleus, FBRSL1 interacts with Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1.3 and PRC1.5, which are crucial for transcriptional gene regulation. It competes with AUTS2 for binding to the PRC1.5 complex, potentially influencing whether the complex acts in a repressive or activating manner in gene transcription (Pauli2021Comparing; Bukvic2024De). 

FBRSL1 is also suggested to have roles in cytoskeletal dynamics, possibly regulating small GTPases of the Rho family, which affect actin dynamics, similar to AUTS2 (Pauli2021Comparing). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the developing brain and craniofacial structures, indicating its involvement in neural and craniofacial development (Pauli2021Comparing). 

FBRSL1 is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with distinct domains potentially required for its nuclear versus cytoplasmic functions, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Ufartes2020De). The gene's function in healthy cells is not fully characterized, but it is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and development (Bukvic2024De).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FBRSL1 gene are associated with a novel malformation and intellectual disability syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by a range of clinical features, including microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, cleft palate, skin creases, skeletal anomalies, contractures, postnatal growth retardation, global developmental delay, respiratory problems, hearing impairment, and heart defects (Pauli2021Comparing; Ufartes2020De). The mutations often involve truncating variants in specific exons, leading to frameshifts and premature stop codons that disrupt the gene's function (Ufartes2020De; Bukvic2024De).

FBRSL1 is a paralogue of the AUTS2 gene, and both are components of the Polycomb subcomplexes PRC1.3 and PRC1.5, which are crucial for regulating gene expression during development (Pauli2021Comparing; Bukvic2024De). The clinical phenotype of FBRSL1-related syndrome overlaps with the severe form of AUTS2 syndrome, which includes neurodevelopmental disorders and various physical malformations (Pauli2021Comparing).

Research using animal models, such as Xenopus laevis, has shown that knockdown of FBRSL1 results in craniofacial defects and reduced brain size, indicating its role in neural and craniofacial development (Pauli2021Comparing; Ufartes2020De). These findings underscore the gene's importance in developmental processes and its potential impact when mutated or altered.

## Interactions
FBRSL1 is known to interact with Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1.3 and PRC1.5, which are involved in transcriptional regulation through histone modification. FBRSL1 competes with AUTS2 for binding to the PRC1.5 complex, suggesting that it may influence whether the complex acts in a repressive or active manner in transcriptional regulation (Pauli2021Comparing). The protein is part of the AUTS2 gene family and shares interactions with other proteins such as WDR68 and CK2, although the specific role of FBRSL1 in these interactions remains unclear (Bukvic2024De).

FBRSL1 has different isoforms that localize in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating potential diverse functional roles. The short N-terminal isoforms are associated with centrosomes and kinetochores in dividing cells, suggesting a role in microtubule-kinetochore organization and possibly cell division control (Ufartes2020De). A truncated version of FBRSL1 found in a patient includes two nuclear localization signals and can interact with wild-type isoforms through a self-binding domain, potentially exerting a negative dominance effect (Bukvic2024De). Despite these findings, specific interactions of FBRSL1 with nucleic acids have not been fully characterized (Pauli2021Comparing).
