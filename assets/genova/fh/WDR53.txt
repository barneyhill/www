# WDR53

## Overview
WDR53 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 53 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD repeat motifs. These motifs are integral to the protein's role in facilitating protein-protein interactions, forming a seven-bladed β-propeller structure that serves as a scaffold within large protein complexes. The WDR53 protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, where it is implicated in various cellular processes, including scaffolding, microtubule interactions, and vesicle trafficking. These functions are particularly relevant to cellulose synthesis, suggesting a potential role in this biological process. The conservation of WDR53 across diverse eukaryotic species and its collinearity with CesA8 in dicots further underscore its possible involvement in cellulose biosynthesis, although its expression pattern indicates it may have multiple functions (Guerriero2012Analysis).

## Structure
The WDR53 protein is characterized by a relatively small size of 371 amino acids and a theoretical molecular weight of 40,681 Da, with a neutral isoelectric point (pI) (Guerriero2012Analysis). It contains six theoretical WD repeats, which are structural motifs commonly involved in protein-protein interactions. These repeats contribute to the formation of a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, with antiparallel β-strands forming the blades around a central axis (Guerriero2012Analysis). This β-propeller structure provides multiple surfaces for protein-protein interactions, including the top, bottom, and sides of the truncated cone shape, allowing WDR53 to act as a scaffold in large protein complexes (Guerriero2012Analysis).

The subcellular localization of WDR53 is predominantly cytoplasmic, suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes such as scaffolding, microtubule interactions, protein turnover, compartmentalization, and vesicle trafficking, all of which are relevant to cellulose synthesis (Guerriero2012Analysis). The conservation of WDR53 across diverse eukaryotic groups and its collinearity with CesA8 in dicots suggest a potential role in cellulose biosynthesis, although its expression pattern indicates possible multifunctionality (Guerriero2012Analysis). Specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for WDR53 are not detailed in the provided context.
