# BAAT

## Overview
The BAAT gene encodes the enzyme bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase, a critical component in the metabolism of bile acids. This enzyme is primarily responsible for the conjugation of bile acids with amino acids such as glycine and taurine, a process essential for the solubility and reabsorption of bile salts within the enterohepatic circulation (Pellicoro2007Human; Kirilenko2019Evolutionary). Functioning predominantly in the peroxisomes of hepatocytes, BAAT plays a vital role in lipid digestion and cholesterol homeostasis. The enzyme is characterized by a catalytic triad typical of hydrolase and transferase enzymes, underscoring its biochemical significance (Kirilenko2019Evolutionary). Mutations in the BAAT gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as familial hypercholanemia, highlighting its clinical importance in maintaining liver function and overall metabolic health (Pellicoro2007Human; Carlton2004Molecular).

## Function
The BAAT gene encodes the enzyme bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the conjugation of bile acids with amino acids, primarily glycine and taurine, in the liver. This conjugation process is essential for the solubility and reabsorption of bile salts in the enterohepatic circulation, facilitating their role in fat digestion and absorption (Pellicoro2007Human; Kirilenko2019Evolutionary). BAAT is predominantly located in peroxisomes within hepatocytes, where it conjugates newly synthesized bile acids. It may also operate in the cytosol to reconjugate bile acids returning from the intestine (Pellicoro2007Human; Kirilenko2019Evolutionary).

The enzyme's activity is characterized by a catalytic triad composed of Cys, Asp, and His, which is common in hydrolase and transferase enzymes (Kirilenko2019Evolutionary). In humans, BAAT is the sole enzyme capable of bile acid conjugation due to the inactivation of the BAATP1 gene, underscoring its critical role in maintaining bile acid metabolism (Kirilenko2019Evolutionary). The proper functioning of BAAT is vital for lipid absorption and cholesterol homeostasis, and its dysfunction can lead to conditions such as Familial hypercholanemia (Kirilenko2019Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BAAT gene, which encodes the enzyme bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase, are associated with familial hypercholanemia (FHCA). This condition is characterized by elevated serum bile acids due to the absence of bile acid conjugation. Individuals with FHCA often experience symptoms such as pruritus, fat malabsorption, failure to thrive, vitamin-K dependent coagulopathy, and rickets. These symptoms are attributed to low intestinal bile acid concentrations, which affect nutrient absorption (Pellicoro2007Human; Carlton2004Molecular).

In FHCA, classic markers of liver disease, such as jaundice and elevated serum liver enzymes, are infrequently observed, except for sometimes elevated alkaline phosphatase activity, which may indicate vitamin D malabsorption rather than liver disease. The absence of amino acid conjugates of bile acids in the serum is a hallmark of this condition, leading to elevated serum bile acids and potential hepatic damage (Carlton2004Molecular).

The BAAT gene's role in bile acid conjugation is crucial for maintaining normal bile acid metabolism. Mutations disrupting this process can lead to significant metabolic disorders, highlighting the clinical significance of BAAT in maintaining liver and metabolic health (Pellicoro2007Human).
