# OR1L3

## Overview
The OR1L3 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily L member 3, a protein that belongs to the extensive family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are pivotal in the olfactory system, facilitating the detection and discrimination of odorants by binding specific molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway. The OR1L3 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, which enables it to interact with odorant molecules and activate downstream signaling cascades. Expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons of the nasal epithelium, OR1L3 contributes to the diversity of olfactory responses, playing a crucial role in the perception of smell (de2015Structure–odour; GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

## Structure
The OR1L3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in odor detection. These receptors typically have a seven-transmembrane domain structure, characteristic of GPCRs, which allows them to traverse the cell membrane multiple times. The primary structure of OR1L3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor (de2015Structure–odour).

The secondary structure of OR1L3 likely includes alpha helices, which are common in the transmembrane regions of GPCRs. These helices contribute to the receptor's ability to interact with odorant molecules and initiate signal transduction (de2015Structure–odour). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, which is crucial for the receptor's functional conformation and interaction with G proteins.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, which can influence the receptor's stability, localization, and activity. However, specific details on these modifications for OR1L3 are not provided in the available context. There is no information on splice variant isoforms or quaternary structure, as these receptors typically function as monomers (de2015Structure–odour).

## Function
OR1L3 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odorants. This receptor is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which plays a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odor molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). OR1L3 is expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons located in the nasal epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity of olfactory responses by recognizing and responding to various odorants (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

The receptor's function is characterized by its ability to activate a signaling cascade upon binding with an odorant. This cascade involves the activation of Gαolf, adenylyl cyclase 3 (Adcy3), and the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which are essential for the detection and discrimination of odorants (Tong2021Ectopic). The molecular activities of OR1L3, like other olfactory receptors, are integral to the combinatorial coding of odorant receptors, allowing for the perception of a wide range of smells (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).
