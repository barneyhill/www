# TSC1

## Overview
The TSC1 gene encodes the protein TSC complex subunit 1, commonly referred to as hamartin, which is a crucial component of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). This protein plays a significant role in cellular growth and proliferation by forming a complex with TSC2, another protein, to regulate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a central regulator of cell metabolism, growth, and survival. Hamartin is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal HEAT repeat domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its interactions and functional activities within the cell (Fitzian2021TSC1; Yang2020Structural). The TSC1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of primary cilia and the TGF-β-SMAD2/3 signaling pathway, contributing to cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Rosengren2018TSC1). Mutations in the TSC1 gene are linked to tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of benign tumors in multiple organs (Jones1997Molecular).

## Structure
The TSC1 protein, also known as hamartin, is a critical component of the TSC complex, which regulates cell growth and proliferation. TSC1 is characterized by several distinct structural domains. It contains an N-terminal HEAT repeat domain, which is involved in binding to phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipids, crucial for lysosomal recruitment and mTORC1 regulation (Fitzian2021TSC1). The protein also features a helical linker domain that facilitates oligomerization, forming antiparallel dimers that can further oligomerize into higher-order structures (Fitzian2021TSC1).

The C-terminal region of TSC1 includes a coiled-coil domain, which is essential for dimerization and interaction with TSC2, forming a stable complex that is crucial for the structural integrity of the TSC complex (Fitzian2021TSC1; Yang2020Structural). This coiled-coil domain forms a parallel structure, contributing to the quaternary structure of the TSC complex by stabilizing its conformation (Yang2020Structural).

TSC1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. The protein's ability to bind lipids and form oligomers is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular processes (Fitzian2021TSC1).

## Function
The TSC1 gene encodes a protein known as hamartin, which forms a complex with TSC2, called the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. This complex plays a critical role in regulating the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. In healthy human cells, the TSC1-TSC2 complex acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 by inhibiting its activity through the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity of TSC2, which converts Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP, thereby preventing mTORC1 activation (Fitzian2021TSC1; Huang2008The).

TSC1 is also involved in the regulation of primary cilia, which are sensory organelles that coordinate various signaling pathways, including Hedgehog signaling. In the absence of TSC1, cilia can become elongated, which is linked to increased mTORC1-dependent autophagic flux (Rosengren2018TSC1). TSC1 is necessary for the proper activation of the TGF-β-SMAD2/3 pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes (Rosengren2018TSC1).

The TSC1 protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis by regulating these critical signaling pathways (Fitzian2021TSC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TSC1 gene are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors, or hamartomas, in multiple organs, including the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, and lungs (Jones1997Molecular; Langkau2002TSC1). These tumors can lead to various disabilities, such as seizures, mental retardation, and behavioral problems (Langkau2002TSC1). TSC1 mutations are less frequent than TSC2 mutations, accounting for a minority of TSC cases (Rosset2017TSC1; Ali1998Mutations). 

Individuals with TSC1 mutations often exhibit a milder phenotype compared to those with TSC2 mutations, with a lower frequency of mental retardation and renal abnormalities (Jones1997Molecular; Sancak2005Mutational). This milder presentation may lead to underdiagnosis, as some patients with TSC1-related disease may not meet current diagnostic criteria (Langkau2002TSC1). 

Alterations in TSC1 can also impact the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation. Dysregulation of this pathway due to TSC1 mutations can contribute to other conditions, including various cancers, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, reproductive disorders, and diabetes (Mallela2021Role).

## Interactions
TSC1, a component of the TSC complex, interacts with several proteins to regulate cellular processes. It forms a complex with TSC2 and TBC1D7, which is crucial for the regulation of mTORC1 signaling. TBC1D7 stabilizes the dimerization of the TSC1 C-terminal coiled coil region, enhancing the structural integrity of the TSC complex. This interaction is mediated by hydrophobic interactions and is essential for the proper functioning of the TSC complex (Gai2016Structure).

TSC1 also binds to phosphoinositide lipids, specifically lysosomal PI3,5P2, through its N-terminal domain. This binding is important for the recruitment of the TSC complex to lysosomal membranes, where it regulates mTORC1 activity (Fitzian2021TSC1).

In addition to its role in the TSC complex, TSC1 interacts with other proteins such as 14-3-3ζ, which may influence its stability and function. The TSC1-TSC2 complex is phosphorylated at multiple sites, including T1462 by AKT, which inhibits its function and affects its cellular localization (HoogeveenWesterveld2012The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of TSC1 in cellular signaling and its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
