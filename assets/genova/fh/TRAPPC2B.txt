# TRAPPC2B

## Overview
The TRAPPC2B gene encodes the trafficking protein particle complex subunit 2B, a component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complex, which is involved in vesicle-mediated transport within cells. This protein is integral to the proper functioning of intracellular trafficking pathways, particularly those related to the transport of proteins and lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. As a part of the TRAPP complex, TRAPPC2B plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring the correct delivery of cargo molecules to their intended destinations. Disruptions in the function of TRAPPC2B can lead to significant cellular dysfunctions, contributing to various skeletal and neurodevelopmental disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the TRAPPC2B gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly affecting skeletal and neurodevelopmental systems. The TRAPPC2B gene encodes a subunit of the trafficking protein particle complex, which plays a crucial role in vesicle-mediated transport processes. Disruptions in these processes can lead to significant cellular dysfunctions. 

In skeletal disorders, mutations in TRAPPC2B can result in abnormal bone development and growth, potentially leading to conditions characterized by skeletal deformities. These mutations may interfere with the normal trafficking of proteins essential for bone matrix formation and maintenance, thereby affecting bone density and structure.

Neurodevelopmental conditions have also been linked to alterations in TRAPPC2B. The gene's role in protein trafficking is critical for the development and function of the nervous system. Mutations or changes in expression levels of TRAPPC2B can disrupt neuronal communication and synaptic function, contributing to developmental delays and cognitive impairments.

Overall, the clinical significance of TRAPPC2B lies in its essential function in cellular transport and protein trafficking, with mutations or alterations leading to a range of disorders due to impaired cellular processes.
