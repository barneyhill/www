# USO1

## Overview
The USO1 gene encodes a vesicle transport factor known as p115, which is a critical component in the intracellular transport system, particularly in the trafficking of vesicles between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. The protein p115 is categorized as a peripheral membrane protein and functions as a tethering factor, facilitating the docking and fusion of vesicles to target membranes. Structurally, p115 is a homodimer with a distinctive globular head domain and a coiled-coil dimerization domain, which are essential for its interaction with SNARE proteins and other components of the vesicular transport machinery. The USO1 gene and its protein product play a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where alterations in its expression can influence disease progression (BravoPlaza2023The; Sapperstein1995p115; Yamakawa1996Uso1).

## Structure
The USO1 protein, also known as p115, is characterized by its dimeric structure, consisting of two globular head domains and a long coiled-coil tail. The primary structure includes a long α-helical coiled-coil region, which is interrupted at specific points, forming hinges that contribute to its flexibility (Yamakawa1996Uso1). The globular head domain (GHD) is crucial for its function, interacting with SNARE proteins to facilitate vesicle docking and fusion (BravoPlaza2023The). 

The coiled-coil domain (CCD) is responsible for dimerization, giving the protein an elongated shape (BravoPlaza2023The). The C-terminal region, although acidic and containing aspartic and glutamic acids, is not essential for its function, as its removal does not affect membrane binding or cell growth (Noda2006Specific). 

The protein's quaternary structure is a homodimer, with electron microscopy studies confirming its dimeric nature and revealing a rod length distribution peaking at 154.5 nm (Yamakawa1996Uso1). The GHD is monomeric when isolated, while the CCD mediates dimerization (BravoPlaza2023The). The protein does not exhibit ATPase activity or bind to filamentous actin or microtubules, distinguishing it from motor proteins like myosin (Yamakawa1996Uso1).

## Function
The USO1 gene encodes a vesicle transport factor known as p115 in humans, which plays a critical role in vesicular trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. This protein is essential for the tethering of vesicles to target membranes, a process that is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus. p115 is a peripheral membrane protein predominantly found on the Golgi apparatus and is required for in vitro Golgi transport along with NSF and SNAPs (Sapperstein1995p115).

Structurally, p115 is an elongated homodimer with a globular domain, a coiled-coil dimerization domain, a linker segment, and a highly acidic domain. It shares significant homology with the yeast protein USO1p, particularly in the head domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions necessary for vesicular transport (Sapperstein1995p115). The protein is recruited to membranes via interaction with Rab1, a process that is regulated by conformational changes within the tether (Yu2010Tethering).

p115 also functions as a catalyst for the assembly of SNARE complexes, which are essential for membrane fusion. This role involves influencing SNARE assembly and facilitating the formation of hetero-tetrameric SNARE complexes, thereby preparing membranes for fusion (Yu2010Tethering). The protein's activity is crucial for proper protein and lipid transport within cells, impacting overall cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the USO1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In multiple myeloma (MM), USO1 expression is upregulated, promoting tumor progression through the activation of the Erk pathway. Knockdown of USO1 in MM cell lines results in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jin2016USO1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), two alternatively spliced isoforms of USO1 have been identified: USO1-N (normal form) and USO1-T (tumor form). The USO1-T isoform is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor prognostic outcomes. It disrupts the ER-Golgi network, leading to Golgi dysfunction and enhanced tumor invasiveness (Yoon2021USO1).

USO1 is also a vulnerability in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), particularly in cases with MLL-AF4 translocations. Depletion of USO1 in these cells reduces proliferation and survival, indicating its critical role in leukemogenesis. USO1's involvement in pathways such as mTOR and RNA homeostasis further underscores its significance in cancer progression (Jaiswal2021Focused).

In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), USO1 expression is significantly higher, and its downregulation is associated with reduced cell proliferation and increased differentiation, highlighting its role in disease progression (Li2021A).

## Interactions
USO1, also known as p115, is involved in vesicle transport and interacts with several proteins crucial for this process. It functions as a tethering factor in the ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport, interacting with rab GTPase Ypt1, which is essential for vesicle tethering and sorting of GPI-anchored proteins at the ER exit (Noda2006Specific). USO1 also interacts with SNARE proteins, including Sed5, Bos1, Bet1, and Sec22, which are critical for vesicle fusion events. These interactions are facilitated by the globular head domain (GHD) of USO1, which enhances its binding affinity to SNAREs, compensating for the loss of RAB1 (BravoPlaza2023The).

Mutations in USO1, such as E6K and G540S, have been shown to increase its affinity for SNARE proteins, allowing it to rescue the viability of rab1∆ strains by enhancing SNARE bundle formation (BravoPlaza2023The). USO1 is also required for the assembly of the ER to Golgi SNARE complex, functioning upstream of v-SNAREs in vesicular transport (Sapperstein1996Assembly). These interactions highlight the critical role of USO1 in maintaining the efficiency and specificity of vesicle transport within the cell.
