# C1S

## Overview
The C1S gene encodes the complement C1s protein, a serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the classical complement pathway, an essential component of the innate immune system. The C1s protein is part of the C1 complex, which also includes C1q and C1r, and is responsible for initiating the complement cascade by cleaving complement components C4 and C2. This process leads to the formation of the C3 convertase, crucial for pathogen opsonization and clearance. Structurally, C1s is characterized by domains such as CUB, EGF-like, and complement control protein (CCP) modules, which facilitate its interactions and activation within the C1 complex (Venkatraman2013Structural; Gaboriaud2000Crystal). The gene's expression and function are tightly regulated, with dysregulation linked to various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (Degn2011DiseaseCausing; Zhang2024Pancancer).

## Structure
The C1S protein is a serine protease involved in the classical complement pathway. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, and a catalytic domain. The secondary structure features beta-sheets and alpha-helices, with the catalytic domain composed of two six-stranded beta-barrels connected by trans-segments and a C-terminal alpha-helix (Gaboriaud2000Crystal). The tertiary structure of C1S involves a two-chain form linked by disulfide bonds, with a compact hydrophobic core in the CCP2 module stabilized by disulfide bridges (Gaboriaud2000Crystal).

C1S's quaternary structure is part of the C1 complex, associating with C1r and C1q. It forms a tetramer in the absence of collagen peptide, mimicking the organization of C1r and C1s polypeptides in the C1 complex (Venkatraman2013Structural). The protein contains several domains, including CUB domains, an EGF-like domain, and complement control protein (CCP) modules. The CCP2 module is oriented perpendicularly to the serine protease domain, providing additional substrate recognition sites (Gaboriaud2000Crystal). The CUB1-EGF regions can form Ca2+-dependent homodimers, a property shared with MASP proteases (Gaboriaud2021Structures). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation and cleavage activation.

## Function
The C1S gene encodes a serine protease that is a critical component of the C1 complex, which initiates the classical complement pathway. This pathway is essential for immune responses, including the lysis and opsonization of pathogens and the stimulation of inflammatory and adaptive immune responses (Almitairi2018Structure). The C1 complex is composed of C1q, which recognizes antibody-antigen complexes, and a tetramer of proteases, including two C1r and two C1s molecules. C1s, along with C1r, forms a Ca2+-dependent heterotetramer that becomes activated upon binding to C1q. This activation leads to the cleavage of substrates C4 and C2, forming the C3 convertase (C4b2a), which is essential for the continuation of the complement cascade (Almitairi2018Structure).

In healthy human cells, C1s is primarily involved in activating the classical complement pathway, which is crucial for controlling bacterial infections and clearing immune complexes and apoptotic cells (Lorvellec2023HMGB1). C1s is mostly in a proenzyme form within the C1 complex in normal human serum, and its activity is regulated by the presence of C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) to prevent unwarranted activation (Lorvellec2023HMGB1). C1s is active in the extracellular space, particularly in blood plasma, contributing to immune defense by promoting opsonization and clearance of pathogens (Ye2022Complement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the C1S gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Genetic polymorphisms, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene deletions, can lead to deficiencies in complement components, contributing to immune complex diseases (ICD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and recurrent infections (RI) (Mayilyan2012Complement). Specifically, C1S gene mutations are linked to a lupus-like syndrome and recurrent bacterial infections due to impaired complement activation (Degn2011DiseaseCausing).

In cancer, the C1S gene shows elevated expression in various tumors, including breast cancer and stomach adenocarcinoma, and is associated with poorer prognosis in glioblastoma and lower grade glioma (GBMLGG) (Zhang2024Pancancer). High C1S expression correlates with tumor stemness and a 'hot' immune microenvironment, suggesting its role in promoting tumor progression and influencing immune responses (Zhang2024Pancancer). Drug sensitivity analysis indicates that patients with high C1S expression may benefit from treatment with 6-mercaptopurine, which shows a negative correlation with C1S expression (Zhang2024Pancancer).

Overall, alterations in C1S gene expression and function are implicated in both autoimmune disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Interactions
C1S is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the classical pathway of the complement system. It forms part of the C1 complex, which includes C1q, C1r, and C1s. C1S interacts with C1r to form a C1r-C1s tetramer, which associates with C1q to form the C1 complex. This interaction is calcium-dependent and involves the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains of C1r and C1s, forming a compact antiparallel heterodimer (Almitairi2018Structure).

C1S is located within a cage-like structure formed by the collagenous stems of C1q, which protects it from premature activation by other serum proteases. The interaction between C1s and C1q is stabilized when C1r-C1s tetramers bind to C1q, facilitating the assembly and activation of the C1 complex (Venkatraman2013Structural).

Upon activation by C1r, C1S cleaves C4 and C2, initiating the complement cascade. The interaction with C4 involves an extended binding site on C1s, and the structural features of C1s, including the CCP1-CCP2 modules, are crucial for this function (Gaboriaud2021Structures).
