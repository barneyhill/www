# NXT1

## Overview
NXT1 is a gene that encodes the protein nuclear transport factor 2 like export factor 1, which plays a pivotal role in the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of RNA and proteins. This protein is categorized as a nuclear transport factor and is structurally related to Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2), sharing a conserved NTF2-like domain essential for its function in nuclear export (Black1999Identification). NXT1 forms a heterodimer with NXF1, facilitating the export of mRNA by enhancing the recruitment of export complexes to the nuclear pore complex (Aibara2015The). It interacts with key molecules such as Ran-GTP and Crm1, participating in both CRM1-dependent and CRM1-independent export pathways, which underscores its versatility and critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (OssarehNazari2000RanGTPBinding). The protein's interactions and structural features highlight its importance in regulating gene expression and ensuring the proper export of RNA and protein substrates across the nuclear envelope.

## Structure
NXT1, also known as nuclear transport factor 2 like export factor 1, is a protein involved in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. It is structurally related to Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2) and shares a 26% identity with it (Black1999Identification). NXT1 has a conserved NTF2-like domain, which is crucial for its function in nuclear export (Black1999Identification). This domain allows NXT1 to form a heterodimer with NXF1, facilitating mRNA export (Aibara2015The).

The protein's tertiary structure includes a hydrophobic pocket that interacts with Ran-GTP, a key component in nuclear transport (Black1999Identification). This interaction is mediated by specific residues, such as Asn48, which stabilizes Ran-GTP binding (Black1999Identification). NXT1's ability to bind Ran-GTP is essential for its role in nuclear export, as it enhances the formation or stability of cargo-containing export complexes (OssarehNazari2000RanGTPBinding).

NXT1 is involved in both CRM1-dependent and CRM1-independent export pathways, indicating its versatility in nuclear transport processes (OssarehNazari2000RanGTPBinding). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it plays a significant role in targeting export complexes to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) or mediating their interaction with nucleoporins (OssarehNazari2000RanGTPBinding).

## Function
NXT1, also known as nuclear transport factor 2 like export factor 1, plays a crucial role in the nuclear export of mRNA and proteins in human cells. It functions as a cofactor in the Crm1-mediated nuclear export pathway, facilitating the terminal step of this process. NXT1 is necessary for the release of Crm1 and Rev from the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), acting in conjunction with Ran and RanBP1 to promote the export of nuclear export signal (NES) substrates (Black2001Nxt1).

NXT1 also forms a heterodimer with the Tap protein, which is essential for the nuclear export of mRNA. This interaction enhances the recruitment of Tap to nuclear pore complexes, thereby facilitating mRNA export. The formation of the Tap/NXT1 heterodimer is crucial for efficient mRNA export, as it enhances the binding of Tap to nucleoporins, components of the NPC (Wiegand2002Formation).

In addition to its role in mRNA export, NXT1 interacts with Ran-GTP and Crm1, indicating its involvement in multiple export pathways, including the export of U1 snRNA and tRNA (Black2001Nxt1). NXT1's activity is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression by ensuring the proper export of RNA and protein substrates across the nuclear envelope.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the NXT1 gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of muscular and neurodegenerative diseases. In Drosophila, the loss of Nxt1 function leads to muscle degeneration, which is linked to the reduced expression of genes with long introns. This muscle degeneration can be rescued by increasing the expression of the abba gene, the Drosophila homologue of human Trim32, which is associated with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2H (van2019Loss). The study suggests that defects in RNA export factors like Nxt1 can lead to muscular dystrophy phenotypes, highlighting the potential link between RNA regulation and muscular degenerative diseases (van2019Loss).

In mammalian cells, NXT1 is crucial for the export of intron-containing RNA, and its interaction with TAP is essential for this process. Alterations in NXT1 function can disrupt RNA export, potentially contributing to diseases related to mRNA export dysfunction (Guzik2001NXT1; Wiegand2002Formation). The role of NXT1 in facilitating nuclear export through its interaction with RanGTP and CRM1-independent pathways further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis, with implications for understanding RNA transport-related diseases (OssarehNazari2000RanGTPBinding).

## Interactions
NXT1, also known as nuclear transport factor 2 like export factor 1, is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate nuclear export processes. It forms a complex with NXF1, creating a symmetric binding platform essential for the export of retroviral CTE-RNA. This interaction involves hydrophobic contacts, particularly around residue Leu370 of NXF1 with NXT1, and is crucial for binding 2-fold symmetric RNA substrates (Aibara2015The).

NXT1 also interacts with the influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) and CRM1, promoting NP's nuclear export via a CRM1-dependent pathway. NXT1 binds to the C-terminal region of NP, forming a complex with CRM1, which is essential for the nuclear export of NP (Chutiwitoonchai2016NXT1).

In the context of mRNA export, NXT1 forms heterodimeric complexes with hTap (also known as NXF1), which are crucial for mRNA export. This interaction enhances hTap's affinity for nucleoporins, facilitating mRNA transport through the nuclear pore complex (Wiegand2002Formation).

NXT1 also interacts with Ran-GTP and Crm1, playing a role in Crm1-mediated nuclear export. The interaction with Ran-GTP is crucial for NXT1's function in nuclear export, as it stabilizes cargo-containing export complexes (OssarehNazari2000RanGTPBinding; Black2001Nxt1).
