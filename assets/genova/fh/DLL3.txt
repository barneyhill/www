# DLL3

## Overview
The DLL3 gene encodes the delta like canonical Notch ligand 3, a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway is integral to various cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Unlike other Notch ligands that typically activate the pathway, the DLL3 protein functions primarily as an inhibitory ligand, modulating the activation of Notch receptors and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hermans2019DLL3; Xiang2023Identification). DLL3 is predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences neurogenesis and somitogenesis during embryonic development (Xiang2023Identification). Mutations in the DLL3 gene are linked to spondylocostal dysostosis, a condition characterized by abnormal vertebral segmentation (Turnpenny2003Novel). Additionally, DLL3 is aberrantly expressed in certain cancers, such as small cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine prostate cancer, where it serves as a potential therapeutic target (Puca2019Deltalike).

## Function
The DLL3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a ligand in the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, DLL3 primarily acts as an inhibitory ligand, modulating the activation of Notch receptors. This modulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and homeostasis (Xiang2023Identification). DLL3 is active in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences neurogenesis and somitogenesis during embryonic development (Xiang2023Identification).

During embryogenesis, DLL3 plays a critical role in the segmentation clock, which regulates the periodic formation of somites from the presomitic mesoderm. This process is vital for the proper development of the vertebral column and ribs (Turnpenny2003Novel). The protein must be correctly anchored into the membrane to function effectively during somitogenesis, and its disruption can lead to abnormal vertebral segmentation (Turnpenny2003Novel).

DLL3's role in the Notch signaling pathway involves inhibiting Notch1, contrasting with other Notch ligands that typically activate the pathway. This unique function of DLL3 is significant in the development of neuroendocrine cells and the regulation of cell signaling (Hermans2019DLL3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DLL3 gene are associated with spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD), a condition characterized by abnormal vertebral segmentation and rib anomalies. These mutations often result in truncated proteins that disrupt the Notch signaling pathway, leading to vertebral and rib malformations due to delayed and irregular somite formation (Turnpenny2003Novel). In humans, specific DLL3 mutations linked to SCD include frameshift, nonsense, splicing, and in-frame insertion mutations, which often result in truncated proteins lacking essential domains (Turnpenny2003Novel).

In cancer, DLL3 is aberrantly expressed in neuroendocrine prostate cancer and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In these cancers, DLL3 is overexpressed and serves as a potential therapeutic target. For instance, in SCLC, DLL3 is targeted by the antibody-drug conjugate rovalpituzumab tesirine, which has shown antitumor activity (Puca2019Deltalike). In neuroendocrine prostate cancer, DLL3 expression is associated with worse overall survival and is linked to treatment resistance (Puca2019Deltalike). In colon adenocarcinoma, high DLL3 expression correlates with poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Xiang2023Identification).

## Interactions
DLL3 (delta like canonical Notch ligand 3) is involved in several interactions within the Notch signaling pathway. It is known to bind to Notch receptors, such as NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4, at the cell surface, although it primarily localizes in the Golgi apparatus. This suggests a role in modulating Notch signaling by regulating the transit of Notch and its activating proteases through the Golgi (D’Souza2008The). DLL3 acts as a Notch antagonist, inhibiting Notch receptor activation and promoting neuroendocrine differentiation by binding to the Notch receptor in cis, which leads to the relocation and inactivation of Notch1 to the Golgi apparatus (Tendler2020The). 

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), DLL3 inhibits the interaction between DLL1 and NOTCH, thereby inhibiting the Notch pathway. This inhibition is significant in neuroendocrine tumors, where DLL3 is often upregulated, maintaining growth and neuroendocrine differentiation (LacalleGonzalez2023DLL3). DLL3's role in repressing Notch signaling involves interactions that maintain the neuroendocrine phenotype, making it a target for investigational anti-cancer therapeutics, including antibody-drug conjugates (Katoh2019Precision).
