# PHB1

## Overview
The PHB1 gene encodes the protein prohibitin 1, a highly conserved member of the SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/C) protein superfamily. Prohibitin 1 is primarily localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it forms large multimeric complexes with prohibitin 2 (PHB2), playing a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (CruzBustos2018Characterization; Tatsuta2005Formation). As a chaperone protein, prohibitin 1 is involved in the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins, regulation of mitochondrial DNA organization, and modulation of reactive oxygen species production, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and prevention of senescence (Schleicher2008Prohibitin1; Osman2009Prohibitins). Beyond its mitochondrial functions, prohibitin 1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and response to oxidative stress, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Yang2018Significance; Theiss2011The).

## Structure
Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) is a protein encoded by the PHB1 gene in humans, characterized by a conserved prohibitin domain that spans from amino acid 22 to 202. This domain is part of the SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/C) protein superfamily, which is involved in various cellular processes (CruzBustos2018Characterization). The primary structure of PHB1 consists of 268 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 30,272 Da and an isoelectric point of 8.42 (CruzBustos2018Characterization). 

PHB1 contains a hydrophobic region and a signal peptide from amino acids 1 to 23, which are crucial for its mitochondrial targeting (CruzBustos2018Characterization; Tatsuta2005Formation). The protein forms large ring-shaped complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane, with a molecular mass of approximately 1.2 MDa, in association with prohibitin 2 (PHB2) (Tatsuta2005Formation). The quaternary structure of PHB1 involves alternating subunits of Phb1 and Phb2, forming stable assemblies dependent on conserved coiled-coil regions (Tatsuta2005Formation).

PHB1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. It also has splice variant isoforms that may affect its function and localization (Winter2007Molecular).

## Function
Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) is a highly conserved protein primarily localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity. In mitochondria, PHB1 forms large multimeric ring complexes with prohibitin 2 (PHB2), which are essential for the organization and stability of mitochondrial nucleoids, as well as the assembly of the respiratory chain (Osman2009Prohibitins; Kasashima2008Human). PHB1 is involved in regulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) organization and copy number by stabilizing the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a key component of mitochondrial nucleoids (Osman2009Prohibitins; Kasashima2008Human).

PHB1 also plays a role in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential, which are critical for preventing cellular senescence and maintaining the angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells (Schleicher2008Prohibitin1). It is implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and mitochondrial morphology, and acts as a chaperone stabilizing mitochondrial proteins (Theiss2011The). PHB1's mitochondrial localization is essential for cell proliferation and is linked to its protective role against oxidative stress (Signorile2019Prohibitins:).

## Clinical Significance
PHB1 (prohibitin 1) is implicated in various diseases due to its role in mitochondrial function, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Alterations in PHB1 expression are linked to several cancers, including breast, gastric, prostate, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In these cancers, PHB1 can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the context. For instance, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, PHB1 is stabilized by LPLUNC1, which inhibits its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby suppressing tumor proliferation (Wang2019LPLUNC1). In prostate, gastric, and liver cancers, PHB1 is suggested to have a tumor suppressor role, with overexpression arresting tumor growth and knockdown accelerating it (Theiss2011The).

PHB1 is also involved in inflammatory diseases. In inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, PHB1 levels are decreased in inflamed mucosa, and its restoration can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation (Theiss2011The). In neurodegenerative diseases, decreased PHB1 levels are associated with conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, where it provides neuroprotection (Yang2018Significance). PHB1's role in mitochondrial dysfunction is also linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and obesity (Theiss2011The).

## Interactions
Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. PHB1 forms a complex with Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it stabilizes mitochondrial translation products and interacts with components of the electron transport chain, acting as a chaperone (HernandoRodríguez2018Mitochondrial). PHB1 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, particularly in the context of mitochondrial dynamics and chemoresistance in gynecologic cancers. This interaction is modulated by the Akt pathway and is crucial for the cellular response to chemotherapy (Kong2022Prohibitin).

PHB1 interacts with SH2D4A and STAT3 within the mitochondria, influencing mitochondrial function and integrity. These interactions have been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays (Ploeger2020Prohibitin). In bladder cancer cells, PHB1 is phosphorylated by Akt, which is essential for its mitochondrial localization and interaction with estrogen receptors, affecting cell proliferation (Jiang2015Akt).

PHB1 also plays a role in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics through its interaction with phosphorylated p53 and Bak, promoting mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin (Kong2022Prohibitin). These interactions highlight PHB1's involvement in critical cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
