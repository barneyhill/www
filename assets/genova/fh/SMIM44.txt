# SMIM44

## Overview
SMIM44, or small integral membrane protein 44, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular processes that occur at or across the cell membrane. While the specific functions of SMIM44 are not fully elucidated, transmembrane proteins typically play critical roles in signaling, transport, and maintaining cellular structure. The gene's expression and potential interactions with other cellular components may have implications in various biological pathways and could be significant in understanding certain disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
