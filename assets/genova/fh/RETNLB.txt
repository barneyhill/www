# RETNLB

## Overview
The RETNLB gene encodes the resistin-like beta (RELMβ) protein, a member of the resistin-like molecule family characterized by a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. RELMβ is primarily expressed in the goblet cells of the colon and plays a significant role in maintaining the colonic epithelial barrier and regulating glucose metabolism. As a secreted protein, RELMβ is involved in various physiological processes, including modulating insulin signaling, glucose transport, and contributing to the protective mucus layer in the gastrointestinal tract. It also functions as an immune effector molecule, influencing inflammatory responses and playing a role in defense against parasites and intestinal nematode infections. The protein's involvement in inflammation and pulmonary vascular remodeling highlights its importance in both health and disease (Di2023Resistinlike; Artis2004RELMβFIZZ2; Shi2023Resistinlike).

## Structure
The RETNLB gene encodes the resistin-like beta (RELMβ) protein, which is part of the resistin-like molecule family characterized by a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. The primary structure of RELMβ consists of 105-114 amino acids, featuring an amino (N) terminal signal sequence, a variable midsection, and a highly conserved carboxy (C) terminal signature sequence. This C-terminal region contains a unique and invariant spacing of cysteine residues crucial for the protein's structure (Shi2023Resistinlike).

In terms of quaternary structure, RELMβ forms disulfide-linked dimers, which can further assemble into hexamers through highly exposed disulfide bonds at the amino termini of their coiled-coil domains. The 11th cysteine residue in RELMβ is specifically responsible for mediating covalent dimerization through a disulfide bond, a feature not present in RELMα (Shi2023Resistinlike).

Post-translational modifications of RELMβ may include glycosylation, which can influence its stability and function, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context. The protein's structure and modifications are essential for its role in various physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation and pulmonary vascular remodeling (Shi2023Resistinlike).

## Function
RETNLB, also known as resistin-like beta, is primarily expressed in goblet cells of the colon and plays a crucial role in maintaining the colonic epithelial barrier and glucose metabolism. In healthy human cells, RETNLB is involved in the regulation of insulin signaling and glucose transport. It affects glucose absorption in the small intestine by modulating the activity of glucose transporters, specifically attenuating SGLT-1 activity and enhancing GLUT2 presence in the brush border membranes of enterocytes (Shi2023Resistinlike).

In the gastrointestinal tract, RETNLB is secreted by goblet cells and contributes to the maintenance of the protective mucus layer by enhancing the expression and secretion of mucins such as MUC2 and M1/MUC5AC. This process is dependent on calcium, protein kinase C (PKC), tyrosine kinases, and ERK activities (Shi2023Resistinlike). RETNLB also acts as an immune effector molecule, playing a role in the expulsion of gastrointestinal nematodes by disrupting their ability to sense the gastrointestinal microenvironment (Artis2004RELMβFIZZ2).

The protein is involved in inflammatory responses, influencing the microbial environment in the gastrointestinal tract and potentially playing a role in defense against parasites and intestinal nematode infections (Di2023Resistinlike).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RETNLB gene, which encodes the protein resistin-like beta (RELM-β), have been implicated in several diseases. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), RELM-β is associated with exacerbating intestinal inflammation. Studies using mouse models of colitis, such as the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model, have shown that the absence of RELM-β reduces the severity of colitis, suggesting a proinflammatory role for the protein. RELM-β may promote inflammation by inducing TNF-α synthesis and release by macrophages, leading to the recruitment of other inflammatory cells (McVay2006Absence).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), RETNLB expression is significantly reduced in cancerous tissues compared to healthy tissues. This reduction is associated with poor prognosis and correlates with the TNM grade and mutations in genes such as TP53, BRAF, and KRAS. Lower RETNLB levels are linked to a worse survival rate in CRC patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Di2023Resistinlike).

In asthma, RELM-β is involved in airway remodeling. Its expression is elevated in asthmatic patients and is associated with increased lung matrix collagen content. RELM-β may influence airway remodeling by regulating TGF-β production and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fang2015Resistin‐like).
