# HLA-DRB1

## Overview
The HLA-DRB1 gene is a critical component of the human immune system, encoding a protein that forms part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. These molecules are primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells and play a pivotal role in the adaptive immune response by presenting processed peptide antigens to CD4+ T-helper cells (Wysocki2020Current). The HLA-DRB1 protein, characterized as a transmembrane receptor, is highly polymorphic, which allows for a broad range of peptide presentations, enhancing the immune system's ability to recognize diverse pathogens (Scholz2017Human). This polymorphism also influences the protein's structure and its interaction with T cell receptors, impacting immune surveillance and tolerance (Wysocki2020Current). The gene's variations are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Ramagopalan2009Expression; Scally2013A).

## Structure
The HLA-DRB1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are essential for presenting peptides to T cells. The protein structure includes an alpha and beta chain, forming a heterodimer. The primary structure consists of specific amino acid sequences, with polymorphic regions that influence peptide binding and disease susceptibility (Ting2018The). The secondary structure of the HLA-DRB1 protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding groove (Scally2013A).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these chains into a three-dimensional shape, allowing the formation of pockets that accommodate peptide ligands. The P1, P4, P6, P7, and P9 pockets are particularly important for peptide interaction, with the P4 pocket being crucial for binding citrullinated residues (Ting2018The; Scally2013A). The quaternary structure refers to the assembly of the alpha and beta chains into a functional heterodimer, which is stabilized by specific interactions and hydrogen bonds (Penzotti1997Use).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, can occur, affecting the protein's function and stability. These structural features are critical for the protein's role in immune response and its association with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (Scally2013A).

## Function
The HLA-DRB1 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are crucial for the immune system's function. These molecules are primarily expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells (Wysocki2020Current). The primary role of HLA-DRB1 is to present processed peptide antigens to CD4+ T-helper cells. This interaction is essential for the activation of T cells, which is a critical step in initiating adaptive immune responses (Wysocki2020Current).

HLA-DRB1 is highly polymorphic, allowing for a diverse range of peptide presentations, which enhances the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to a wide array of pathogens (Scholz2017Human). The gene's polymorphisms influence the structure of the HLA-DR molecule, affecting its epitope binding affinity and specificity (Wysocki2020Current). In healthy individuals, HLA-DRB1 contributes to immune surveillance by facilitating the presentation of both foreign and self-antigens, maintaining a balance between immune response and tolerance (Wysocki2020Current). This function is vital for distinguishing between self and non-self antigens, thus playing a key role in preventing autoimmune reactions (Scally2013A).

## Clinical Significance
The HLA-DRB1 gene is clinically significant due to its association with several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Variations in the HLA-DRB1 gene, such as the HLA-DRB1*04:01 allele, are strongly linked to RA. This allele is involved in the presentation of citrullinated self-antigens, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. The presence of citrullinated proteins in the synovium of RA patients and their increased expression in smokers highlight the role of HLA-DRB1 in disease susceptibility (Scally2013A). The gene's P4 pocket is particularly suited to accommodate citrullinated residues, influencing T-cell receptor recognition and contributing to RA pathogenesis (Scally2013A).

In MS, the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele is a major genetic risk factor. Its expression is regulated by vitamin D, with a vitamin D response element (VDRE) in the promoter region of the gene. This VDRE is conserved in MS-associated haplotypes, suggesting a gene-environment interaction where vitamin D influences MS risk (Ramagopalan2009Expression; Handunnetthi2010Multiple). Vitamin D deficiency during early life may affect HLA-DRB1 expression, potentially increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases like MS (Ramagopalan2009Expression).

## Interactions
The HLA-DRB1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. These molecules are involved in presenting processed antigens to CD4+ T-helper cells, facilitating immune responses. The HLA-DRB1 protein interacts with T cell receptors (TCRs) in a trimolecular complex involving MHC class II and peptide. This interaction is crucial for the specificity of TCR recognition, particularly in the context of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Penzotti1997Use).

The HLA-DRB1*04:04 variant, for example, presents a polar surface to the TCR, with specific residues such as D66, Q70, and R71 being exposed. These residues form hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts with the TCR, involving all six complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops of the TCR (Penzotti1997Use). The shared epitope region, particularly the arginine at position 71, forms an extended hydrogen bonding network, creating a specific conformational unit recognized by the TCR (Penzotti1997Use).

Additionally, the HLA-DRB1 protein interacts with citrullinated peptides, which are relevant in RA. The P4 pocket of HLA-DRB1*04:01, for instance, accommodates citrulline, influencing peptide binding and TCR interactions (Scally2013A). These interactions highlight the role of HLA-DRB1 in immune system function and its association with autoimmune conditions.
