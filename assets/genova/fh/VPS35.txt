# VPS35

## Overview
VPS35 is a gene that encodes a core component of the retromer complex, a crucial element in the endosomal protein sorting and trafficking system within human cells. The protein product of VPS35, known as the VPS35 retromer complex component, is integral to the formation and function of the retromer complex, which includes other proteins such as VPS26 and VPS29. This complex is essential for the retrieval and recycling of transmembrane proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network or the plasma membrane, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing lysosomal degradation of key receptors (Reitz2014The; Macías‐Calvio2020An). VPS35 is characterized by its role as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions with various proteins, including sorting nexins and the WASH complex, to ensure proper endosomal dynamics and protein trafficking (Cui2021Formation; Reitz2018Retromer). Mutations in the VPS35 gene, such as the D620N mutation, have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining neuronal health and function (Sassone2020The; Tsika2014Parkinson’s).

## Structure
The VPS35 protein is a core component of the retromer complex, crucial for endosomal protein sorting. Its primary structure is encoded by the VPS35 gene and consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a conserved domain known as the VPS35 C-terminal domain, essential for its function (Haft2000Human). The secondary structure of VPS35 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with the N-terminal portion (VPS35N) displaying an α/α-solenoid fold formed by 20 α helices (Lucas2016Structural). The tertiary structure of VPS35 is characterized by a curved solenoid shape, facilitating interactions with other proteins such as VPS26 and VPS29 (Lucas2016Structural).

In its quaternary structure, VPS35 assembles with VPS26 and VPS29 to form the retromer complex, which has an elongated structure with VPS26 and VPS29 at opposite ends of VPS35 (Lucas2016Structural). The protein also interacts with SNX3, forming a T-shaped complex that is crucial for retromer coat assembly and membrane recruitment (Lucas2016Structural). Common post-translational modifications of VPS35 include phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions (Haft2000Human).

## Function
The VPS35 gene encodes a core component of the retromer complex, which is essential for endosomal protein sorting and trafficking in human cells. VPS35, along with Vps26 and Vps29, forms a trimeric core that interacts with sorting nexins to facilitate the retrieval of transmembrane proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or the plasma membrane (Reitz2014The; Macías‐Calvio2020An). This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper receptor recycling, preventing the lysosomal degradation of receptors like the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) (Abubakar2017Updated; Arighi2004Role).

VPS35 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in endosomes, where it serves as a cargo recognition component and scaffold protein, ensuring the proper sorting and transport of lysosomal hydrolases (Seaman2004Cargoselective; Cui2021Formation). The retromer complex also interacts with the WASH complex, facilitating actin polymerization and the formation of endosomal sub-compartments necessary for accurate protein sorting (Reitz2018Retromer). Through these functions, VPS35 plays a critical role in maintaining lysosomal function and preventing neurodegenerative diseases by ensuring proper endosomal dynamics and protein trafficking (Reitz2018Retromer; Vagnozzi2018Endosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS35 gene, particularly the D620N mutation, are linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). This mutation is associated with late-onset familial PD and is the second most common cause of familial PD after LRRK2 mutations (Tsika2014Parkinson’s). The D620N mutation is thought to induce a gain-of-function mechanism, leading to dopaminergic neurodegeneration by disrupting retromer-dependent trafficking of cargo proteins, contributing to the disease (Tsika2014Parkinson’s). It affects the endosome-to-trans-Golgi network transport, impairing the association with the WASH complex, which is crucial for autophagy and proper endosomal function (McGough2014Retromer; Zavodszky2014Mutation).

VPS35 mutations also impact mitochondrial dynamics, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction, which are linked to PD pathology (Sassone2020The). The D620N mutation enhances interaction with proteins like DLP1, causing excessive mitochondrial fission (Sassone2020The). These mutations can lead to impaired lysosomal function and increased α-synuclein levels, contributing to dopaminergic neuron degeneration (Sassone2020The). The clinical significance of VPS35 mutations in PD highlights their role in neuron survival, synaptic function, and cellular homeostasis (Rahman2019Contributions).

## Interactions
VPS35 is a core component of the retromer complex, which is crucial for endosomal protein sorting. It interacts with VPS26 and VPS29 to form the retromer core complex. In mammalian cells, VPS35 binds directly to VPS26 and VPS29, with specific residues facilitating these interactions (Haft2000Human; Gokool2007Identification). The interaction between VPS35 and VPS26 is essential for the assembly of the retromer complex, and mutations in VPS35 can disrupt this interaction, affecting the complex's stability and function (Gokool2007Identification).

VPS35 also interacts with SNX1, a sorting nexin involved in cargo recognition and transport, forming part of the larger retromer complex (Haft2000Human). The interaction with SNX1 is crucial for the retromer's role in retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.

Additionally, VPS35 interacts with the WASH complex, specifically through the binding of the Fam21 protein's tail to VPS35. This interaction is important for targeting the WASH complex to endosomes, influencing endosomal tubule dynamics (Harbour2012Recruitment). The interaction with Fam21 is mediated through the tail of Fam21, which is necessary for the recruitment of the WASH complex to endosomal membranes (Harbour2012Recruitment).
