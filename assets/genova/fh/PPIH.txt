# PPIH

## Overview
PPIH, or peptidylprolyl isomerase H, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cyclophilin family, characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. This protein plays a pivotal role in the spliceosome, a complex essential for pre-mRNA splicing, by facilitating protein folding and modulating protein-protein interactions within the spliceosomal machinery (Mesa2008Spliceosomal; Rajiv2017The). Structurally, PPIH features a cyclophilin fold, comprising a beta-barrel and alpha-helices, and is capable of forming complexes with other proteins, such as PRPF4, enhancing its functional diversity and stability (Rajiv2017The; Reidt2003Crystal). PPIH is implicated in various biological processes, including alternative splicing regulation, apoptosis, and inflammation, and its dysregulation is associated with diseases like autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and certain cancers (Sveen2015Aberrant; Rajiv2018Structural).

## Structure
PPIH, or peptidylprolyl isomerase H, is a member of the cyclophilin family characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. The primary structure of PPIH consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a single isomerase domain (Rajiv2018Structural). Its secondary structure includes typical cyclophilin features such as eight antiparallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices, forming a beta-barrel capped by an alpha-helix (Reidt2003Crystal). The tertiary structure of PPIH is marked by a cyclophilin fold, which is a barrel-like structure common to this protein family (Davis2010Structural).

PPIH can form complexes with other proteins, indicating a quaternary structure. It interacts with the U4/U6 snRNP-60K peptide, binding to a hydrophobic cleft distinct from its active site, allowing simultaneous substrate binding and interaction with other proteins like hPrp18 (Reidt2003Crystal). PPIH also interacts with PRPF4, forming a complex with increased thermal stability (Rajiv2017The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, contributing to its functional diversity (Davis2010Structural). Splice variant isoforms of PPIH exist, which may lead to variations in its function (Davis2010Structural).

## Function
PPIH (peptidylprolyl isomerase H) is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. It is part of the tri-snRNP sub-complex and interacts directly with core proteins such as PRPF4, forming a bipartite binding interface essential for spliceosomal function. This interaction modulates protein-protein interactions within the spliceosome, regulating alternative splicing and maintaining proper spliceosomal assembly and function (Rajiv2017The).

PPIH is involved in both trans-esterification steps of splicing, forming unique assemblies with splicing factors like hPrp3, hPrp4, and hPrp18. Its PPIase domain aids in the folding and transport of other spliceosomal proteins, contributing to the efficiency of the splicing reaction by facilitating peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization, a rate-limiting step in protein folding (Mesa2008Spliceosomal).

PPIH also acts as a master regulator of alternative splicing, particularly in the context of apoptosis and inflammation. It exerts substantial regulatory control over splicing events, with its interactions outside the active site largely dictating its ability to modulate splicing (Rajiv2018Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPIH gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of splicing-related disorders. PPIH is a critical component of the spliceosome, and its interactions with other spliceosomal proteins, such as PRPF4, are essential for proper spliceosomal assembly and function. Disruptions in these interactions can lead to aberrant splicing, which is associated with diseases like autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) (Rajiv2017The). 

In cancer, splicing factor genes, including PPIH, often exhibit dysregulation. PPIH shows a larger variance in expression in normal samples compared to cancer samples, suggesting its potential role as a target for cancer therapies. Mutations in splicing factor genes, including PPIH, can act as oncogenic drivers, particularly in hematopoietic malignancies (Sveen2015Aberrant). 

Additionally, PPIH is involved in alternative splicing regulation, which is crucial in processes like apoptosis and inflammation. Knockdown studies in human cell lines have shown that PPIH influences splicing events, indicating its role as a master regulator of alternative splicing (Rajiv2018Structural). These findings underscore the importance of PPIH in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
PPIH, also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase H, is involved in several interactions within the spliceosome, a complex essential for pre-mRNA splicing. PPIH interacts with the U4/U6-60K protein, forming a stable complex that does not interfere with its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, indicating a pre-shaped binding site (Reidt2003Crystal). This interaction is crucial for the structural rearrangements during spliceosome maturation and catalysis (Reidt2003Crystal).

PPIH also forms a ternary complex with U4/U6-60K and U4/U6-90K proteins, although it does not directly contact U4/U6-90K (Reidt2003Crystal). Additionally, PPIH interacts with hPrp18, a protein important for the second transesterification step in splicing (Reidt2003Crystal).

PPIH exhibits a bipartite binding mode with PRPF4, involving a high-affinity site within residues 106-169 and a weaker site in residues 1-98. This interaction enhances the thermal stability of the complex and is conserved across eukaryotes, highlighting its functional importance (Rajiv2017The). The interaction with PRPF4 is specific to PPIH, as PRPF4 fragments do not bind to PPIA, another cyclophilin family member (Rajiv2017The).
