# PRR5L

## Overview
PRR5L, or proline rich 5 like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling pathway. The PRR5L protein is characterized by its interaction with mTORC2 components, such as Rictor and SIN1, and plays a role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Although PRR5L is not essential for the structural integrity or kinase activity of mTORC2, it is phosphorylated by both mTORC1 and mTORC2, indicating its function as a downstream effector in mTOR signaling (Thedieck2007PRAS40). The protein's involvement in apoptosis, particularly under conditions of hyperactive mTOR signaling, suggests a potential tumor suppressor role, akin to its homolog PRR5 (Thedieck2007PRAS40). Additionally, PRR5L has been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its significance in both cellular regulation and disease pathogenesis (Cheng2016Genetic; Sobczyk2021Triangulating).

## Structure


## Function
PRR5L is a protein that interacts with the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), a key regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. PRR5L binds to mTORC2 through components such as Rictor and SIN1, but it is not essential for the integrity or kinase activity of the complex (Thedieck2007PRAS40). In healthy human cells, PRR5L is phosphorylated by both mTORC1 and mTORC2, with mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation being sensitive to rapamycin, suggesting a role as a downstream effector of mTORC2 (Thedieck2007PRAS40).

PRR5L is involved in regulating apoptosis, particularly in the context of mTOR signaling. It is suggested to promote apoptosis when dissociated from mTORC2, especially under conditions of hyperactive mTOR signaling, such as in TSC1/2 deficient cells (Thedieck2007PRAS40). Despite its interaction with mTORC2, PRR5L knockdown does not disrupt the phosphorylation of mTORC2 targets like Akt S473, indicating that it may regulate apoptosis independently of mTORC2 (Thedieck2007PRAS40). PRR5L's role in apoptosis suggests it might function as a tumor suppressor, similar to its related protein PRR5 (Thedieck2007PRAS40).

## Clinical Significance
PRR5L has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in the mTOR signaling pathway. Alterations in PRR5L expression are associated with cancer, particularly in the context of mTOR hyperactivation. PRR5L is involved in apoptosis regulation, and its knockdown has been shown to reduce apoptosis even in mTORC2-deficient cells, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression (Thedieck2007PRAS40).

In the context of breast cancer, a synonymous SNP in PRR5L, rs3740958, has been associated with increased risk in European American women, indicating a potential genetic predisposition linked to this gene (Cheng2016Genetic).

PRR5L is also associated with atopic dermatitis (AD) and other inflammatory diseases. It has been identified as a candidate causal gene at the 11p13 locus for AD, with increased expression linked to protective alleles in various tissues, suggesting a role in immune regulation (Sobczyk2021Triangulating). Additionally, PRR5L has been identified as a new genetic locus associated with AD, although the genetic risk factors account for only a small portion of the disease's heritability (Hoffjan2015Unravelling).

## Interactions
PRR5L, also known as proline rich 5 like, is a protein that interacts with components of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). It specifically binds to mTORC2 via the proteins Rictor and/or SIN1, as demonstrated in HeLa and HEK293 cells (Thedieck2007PRAS40). Despite its interaction with mTORC2, PRR5L is not essential for the integrity or kinase activity of the complex, as its knockdown does not affect the phosphorylation of mTORC2 targets such as Akt S473 and Paxillin Y118 (Thedieck2007PRAS40).

PRR5L dissociates from mTORC2 in cells deficient in tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2, which is associated with hyperactive mTOR signaling (Thedieck2007PRAS40). This dissociation suggests a role for PRR5L in regulating apoptosis, as its knockdown reduces apoptosis induced by TNFa/cycloheximide (Thedieck2007PRAS40). PRR5L is phosphorylated by both mTORC1 and mTORC2, with mTORC1 phosphorylation being sensitive to rapamycin, indicating that PRR5L might be regulated through mTOR phosphorylation (Thedieck2007PRAS40). These interactions suggest that PRR5L may act as a downstream effector of mTORC2, potentially influencing cell growth and apoptosis.
