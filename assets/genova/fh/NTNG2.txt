# NTNG2

## Overview
The NTNG2 gene encodes the netrin-G2 protein, a member of the Netrin-G subfamily, which is distinct from classical netrins due to its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring. Netrin-G2 is primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of synaptic connections in the central nervous system. It plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity by interacting with its postsynaptic receptor, NGL2, to form a trans-synaptic complex essential for synapse formation and function (Matsukawa2014NetrinGNGL; Heimer2019Netrin‐G2). The protein is implicated in various neural processes, including axonal guidance and synaptic transmission, and is essential for higher brain functions such as cognition and memory (Zhang2016Diversification). Mutations in NTNG2 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in neural development and function (AbuLibdeh2019Homozygous).

## Structure
Netrin-G2 (NTNG2) is a protein that is part of the Netrin-G subfamily, characterized by its unique molecular structure. The primary structure of NTNG2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains. It shares a common architecture with other Netrin-G proteins, comprising a laminin N-terminal (LN) domain followed by three laminin-EGF (LE) domains and a C-terminal hydrophobic glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor (Heimer2019Netrin‐G2). This GPI anchor is a post-translational modification that attaches the protein to the plasma membrane, distinguishing it from classical netrins (NishimuraAkiyoshi2007Axonal).

NTNG2 interacts with its specific receptor, NGL-2, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and the organization of dendritic properties (Matsukawa2014NetrinGNGL). The protein is involved in synapse formation and neurite outgrowth, playing a significant role in neural connectivity and synaptic communication (AbuLibdeh2019Homozygous). The presence of splice variant isoforms of NTNG2 can result in different protein forms with distinct functions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The evolutionary conservation of NTNG2 in vertebrates suggests its importance in higher brain functions (NishimuraAkiyoshi2007Axonal).

## Function
The NTNG2 gene encodes the netrin-G2 protein, a synaptic cell adhesion molecule involved in the regulation of neuronal connectivity and synaptic communication. Netrin-G2 is part of the Netrin-G subfamily, which is specific to vertebrates and plays a crucial role in synapse establishment and function. It is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein enriched in presynaptic terminals, where it binds to its trans-synaptic partner NGL2 to promote axon outgrowth and maintain excitatory synapse formation (AbuLibdeh2019Homozygous; Zhang2016Diversification).

Netrin-G2 is involved in modulating synaptic efficacy and plasticity, particularly in specific neural pathways. In knockout mice models, the absence of netrin-G2 leads to altered synaptic transmission and plasticity, indicating its role in presynaptic mechanisms involving cAMP signaling pathways, which are crucial for neurotransmitter release (Matsukawa2014NetrinGNGL). The protein is also implicated in the diversification of higher brain functions, including complex cognitive processes such as working memory, attention, and anxiety regulation (Zhang2016Diversification).

Netrin-G2's interaction with NGL2 is essential for proper axonal guidance during early brain development and is involved in N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated synaptic transmission, contributing to the development and organization of the central nervous system (Heimer2019Netrin‐G2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NTNG2 gene have been linked to a Rett-like phenotype characterized by areflexia, developmental delays, and hypotonia. Patients with these mutations often exhibit features such as impaired motor skills, limited speech, stereotypic hand movements, and intense eye contact, distinguishing them from classic Rett syndrome due to the absence of seizures (Heimer2019Netrin‐G2). A specific homozygous frameshift mutation in NTNG2 has been identified in individuals from consanguineous families, presenting with global developmental delay, hypotonia, and autistic features. These individuals also show symptoms like failure to thrive and stereotypic hand movements, although they do not experience regression or seizures (AbuLibdeh2019Homozygous).

NTNG2 mutations are also associated with intellectual disability, delayed language development, and epilepsy, particularly when linked with KDM5C defects. These mutations can lead to severe neurodevelopmental impairments, including reduced neurite length and arborization, which are critical for proper neuronal function (Heimer2019Netrin‐G2). Additionally, NTNG2 has been implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with alterations in its expression affecting synaptic connectivity and neural circuit formation (AYAZ2022NTNG2; Hao2020The).

## Interactions
Netrin-G2, encoded by the NTNG2 gene, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that plays a significant role in synaptic formation and function through its interactions with other proteins. Netrin-G2 specifically binds to its postsynaptic receptor NGL2 (also known as LRRC4), forming a trans-synaptic complex that is crucial for synapse formation and maintenance (Matsukawa2014NetrinGNGL; NishimuraAkiyoshi2007Axonal). This interaction is essential for the regulation of synaptic plasticity and the diversification of synaptic inputs, particularly in the hippocampus (Matsukawa2014NetrinGNGL).

The netrin-G2/NGL2 complex influences the localization and stabilization of synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95, at postsynaptic sites. NGL2 interacts with members of the Discs large homolog (Dlg) family through its PDZ binding domain, which includes proteins like PSD-95, NR1, and NR2B, contributing to the assembly of glutamatergic postsynaptic proteins (Matsukawa2014NetrinGNGL; Zhang2016Diversification). In netrin-G2 knockout mice, the absence of netrin-G2 leads to the translocation of NGL2 to the cytosolic compartment, indicating its role in maintaining NGL2 at postsynaptic sites (Zhang2016Diversification). These interactions highlight the importance of netrin-G2 in synaptic organization and function.
