# NNMT

## Overview
Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a gene that encodes the enzyme nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, which is a key player in the methylation of nicotinamide, converting it into 1-methylnicotinamide (MeNAM). This enzyme is categorized as a methyltransferase and is primarily expressed in the liver, although it is also present in other tissues such as adipose tissue, muscle, and the brain (Roberti2021Nicotinamide; Emanuelli2011NNMT). NNMT is involved in various metabolic processes, including the regulation of NAD+ levels and cellular energy homeostasis, by influencing the SAM/SAH ratio and the cell's methylation balance (Ramsden2017Nicotinamide; Roberti2021Nicotinamide). The enzyme's activity is linked to several physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurological diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Ramsden2020Nicotinamide; Sazci2013Association).

## Structure
Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is an enzyme with a well-defined molecular structure. The primary structure of NNMT consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes a class I AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) core fold, characterized by a seven-stranded β sheet flanked by α helices (Peng2011Structural). Unique to NNMT are additional structural features, such as two α helices at the N-terminus and a reverse β hairpin that forms a 'cap' over the active site (Peng2011Structural).

The tertiary structure of NNMT is described as having a Rossmann-like fold, which is common in methyltransferases. This structure includes a central sheet composed of seven strands, with the active site involving loops from the central domain (Swaminathan2017Crystal). The active site is where the demethylated cofactor, S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH), and nicotinamide substrates bind, facilitated by specific interactions between hydrophilic residues and the substrate (Peng2011Structural).

NNMT can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and is involved in various metabolic processes (Peng2011Structural).

## Function
Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the methylation of nicotinamide, converting it into 1-methylnicotinamide (MeNAM) using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor. This reaction is part of the nicotinamide metabolism pathway, which is important for cellular energy homeostasis and the regulation of NAD+ levels (Ramsden2017Nicotinamide; Emanuelli2011NNMT). NNMT is primarily expressed in the liver but is also found in other tissues such as adipose tissue, muscle, and the brain (Roberti2021Nicotinamide).

In healthy human cells, NNMT influences several metabolic pathways, affecting the SAM/SAH ratio and the cell's methylation balance. This balance is crucial for processes like DNA and histone methylation, which are important for gene regulation and epigenetic modifications (Ramsden2017Nicotinamide; Roberti2021Nicotinamide). NNMT's activity is linked to improved lipid parameters in the liver and is associated with metabolic processes such as gluconeogenesis and cholesterol synthesis (Roberti2021Nicotinamide). The enzyme's role in modulating NAD+ usage is significant, particularly in tissues where NAD+ synthesis relies on the salvage pathway (Ramsden2017Nicotinamide).

## Clinical Significance
The nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) gene is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression and genetic variations. Elevated NNMT expression is observed in several cancers, including thyroid, breast, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers, where it is associated with tumor growth and poor prognosis (Ramsden2020Nicotinamide; Roberti2021Nicotinamide). NNMT overexpression contributes to drug resistance and influences cancer cell metabolism and epigenetic regulation, affecting pathways like Akt signaling and promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Roberti2021Nicotinamide; Parsons2021Nicotinamide).

In non-cancerous conditions, altered NNMT expression is linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Ramsden2020Nicotinamide; Sazci2013Association). The SNP rs694539 in the NNMT gene is associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy, potentially through its influence on homocysteine metabolism (Ramsden2020Nicotinamide). In chronic kidney disease, NNMT expression correlates with renal fibrosis and inflammation, suggesting its role in disease progression (Takahashi2022The). These findings highlight NNMT's significant role in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is known to interact with several proteins involved in the methionine cycle, influencing methyl donor metabolism. NNMT interacts with betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) and methionine adenosyltransferase 1a (MAT1A), as identified through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses. These interactions suggest that NNMT may facilitate the proximity of methionine cycle components, potentially promoting the recycling of methyl donor metabolites (Hong2018Nicotinamide).

The interaction between NNMT and BHMT was confirmed in 293T cells and primary hepatocytes, indicating that both wild-type and mutant forms of NNMT can pull down BHMT (Hong2018Nicotinamide). NNMT also interacts with adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY), suggesting a role in supplying the AdoMet methyl donor and eliminating the AdoHcy demethylated product (Portillo2020Proteinprotein).

These interactions are part of a broader network controlling AdoMet synthesis and its regulation through pathways like glycolysis and the polyol pathway (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). The interactions of NNMT with MAT1A, BHMT, and AHCY were confirmed by reverse immunoprecipitation in mouse livers overexpressing NNMT (Portillo2020Proteinprotein).
