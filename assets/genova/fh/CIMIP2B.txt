# CIMIP2B

## Overview
CIMIP2B is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary microtubule inner protein 2B, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells that are involved in movement and sensory functions. The protein encoded by CIMIP2B is categorized as a structural protein, specifically associated with the microtubule components of cilia. It is essential for the proper assembly and maintenance of ciliary architecture, contributing to the stability and function of these organelles. Mutations or dysregulation of CIMIP2B can lead to defects in ciliary function, which are implicated in a range of ciliopathies, disorders characterized by abnormal cilia function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
