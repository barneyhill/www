# TMEM106B

## Overview
TMEM106B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 106B, a type II transmembrane protein predominantly localized to the membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes. This protein plays a critical role in lysosomal function and trafficking, contributing to cellular homeostasis and neuronal health. Structurally, transmembrane protein 106B consists of an N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal domain, with the latter being implicated in the formation of amyloid fibrils associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Schweighauser2022Agedependent; Jiao2023TMEM106B). Functionally, TMEM106B is involved in maintaining lysosomal morphology, acidification, and transport, and it interacts with various proteins to regulate these processes (Zhu2024Physiological; Feng2020A). Genetic variations in TMEM106B have been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Jiao2023TMEM106B; Busch2016Increased).

## Structure
TMEM106B is a type II transmembrane protein consisting of 274 amino acids, primarily located in the membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes (Schweighauser2022Agedependent; Jiao2023TMEM106B). The protein is composed of three main domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD) that is cytoplasmic, a transmembrane domain (TMD), and a C-terminal domain (CTD) that resides in the lysosomal lumen (Zhu2024Physiological; Jiao2023TMEM106B).

The N-terminal domain is intrinsically disordered, allowing for dynamic interactions with various proteins (Kang2018TMEM106B; Perneel2022Identification). This domain can form homopolymers or hetero-multimers at the lysosome surface (Jiao2023TMEM106B). The C-terminal domain is significant for its role in forming amyloid fibrils, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Zhu2024Physiological; Schweighauser2022Agedependent).

TMEM106B undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at several sites, which are crucial for its transport and function (Schweighauser2022Agedependent; Jiao2023TMEM106B). The protein can form amyloid filaments with a five-layered ordered core structure, consisting of 17 β-strands (Schweighauser2022Agedependent). These filaments exhibit polymorphisms, with variations primarily in the middle and C-terminal regions (Perneel2022Identification).

## Function
TMEM106B is a type II transmembrane protein primarily localized to late endosomes and lysosomes, where it plays a crucial role in lysosomal function and trafficking. In healthy human cells, TMEM106B is involved in maintaining lysosomal morphology, acidification, and transport, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and myelination (Zhu2024Physiological; Feng2020A). The protein interacts with various partners, including the clathrin heavy chain, AP2M1, and MAP6, to regulate endolysosome sorting and lysosomal transport (Jiao2023TMEM106B). TMEM106B also modulates lysosomal activity by interacting with v-ATPase, which controls lysosomal acidification, and cathepsin D, a lysosomal protease involved in protein degradation (Zhu2024Physiological; Jiao2023TMEM106B).

In neurons, TMEM106B is critical for dendritic branching and maintenance, influencing lysosomal trafficking through its interaction with MAP6. This interaction acts as a molecular brake for retrograde lysosomal transport, ensuring proper dendrite morphology and synapse stability (Schwenk2013The). TMEM106B's role in lysosomal exocytosis is also vital for delivering proteolipid protein to the myelin sheath, which is crucial for nerve signal transmission (Feng2020A). Overall, TMEM106B is essential for maintaining lysosomal function and neuronal health, contributing to the integrity of the central nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM106B gene are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. TMEM106B is notably associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), where increased expression of the gene is a significant risk factor. This overexpression can lead to lysosomal dysfunction, characterized by impaired acidification and increased cytotoxicity, which contributes to the pathogenesis of FTLD-TDP (Zhu2024Physiological; Busch2016Increased). 

The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1990622 in TMEM106B is particularly implicated in neurodegenerative conditions. The T allele of this SNP is associated with a higher risk of developing diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), while the C allele is considered protective (Zhu2024Physiological; Jiao2023TMEM106B). 

TMEM106B also forms amyloid fibrils in the brain, which are more prevalent in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases compared to healthy controls. These fibrils may contribute to age-dependent neurodegeneration (Zhu2024Physiological). Additionally, TMEM106B polymorphisms can modify the clinical phenotype and pathological burden in FTLD/ALS-TDP cases, potentially through mechanisms involving lysosomal dysfunction and impaired protein degradation (Llibre‐Guerra2021A).

## Interactions
TMEM106B is a type II transmembrane protein that participates in various interactions crucial for its role in lysosomal function and neurodegenerative disease pathways. It interacts with CHMP2B, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is linked to frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD). The T185 variant of TMEM106B shows a stronger association with CHMP2B compared to the S185 variant, leading to reduced autophagic flux and increased neurotoxicity (Jun2015TMEM106B).

TMEM106B also interacts with galactosylceramidase (GALC), a lysosomal enzyme involved in myelin lipid metabolism. This interaction regulates GALC activity, affecting myelin lipid levels, and is implicated in neurological disorders such as FTLD and Alzheimer's disease (Takahashi2023Lysosomal).

The protein forms homo- and heterodimers with its homolog TMEM106C through a zinc-binding motif and interacts with several other proteins, including v-ATPase and cathepsin D, which are essential for lysosomal acidification and function (Perneel2022Identification). TMEM106B's interaction with microtubule-associated protein 6 (MAP6) influences lysosomal trafficking by inhibiting retrograde transport (Zhu2024Physiological). These interactions highlight TMEM106B's role in maintaining lysosomal homeostasis and its potential involvement in neurodegenerative processes.
