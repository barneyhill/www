# BAP1

## Overview
BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, cell cycle progression, and chromatin remodeling. The protein product of BAP1, also known as BRCA1 associated protein 1, is categorized as a ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase. It is involved in the deubiquitination of specific substrates, influencing protein turnover and cellular homeostasis. BAP1 interacts with several key proteins, such as Host Cell Factor 1 (HCF-1) and the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), forming complexes that are essential for transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control. Additionally, BAP1 is implicated in metabolic regulation and mitochondrial function. Mutations in the BAP1 gene are linked to various cancers, including uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, and renal cell carcinoma, and are associated with BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1-TPDS), which significantly increases cancer risk (Bhattacharya2015Cancer; Yu2010The; Carbone2020Biological).

## Structure
BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of BAP1 consists of 729 amino acids, with a catalytic domain located at the N-terminus (residues 1-240) that shows homology to other ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) (Bhattacharya2015Cancer). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy studies (Hanpude2017Ubiquitin).

The tertiary structure of BAP1 is characterized by a UCH domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes conserved catalytic residues such as Q85, C91, H169, and D184, which are essential for its function (Peng2018Familial). BAP1 also contains a UCHL5-like domain (ULD) at its C-terminus, which interacts with other proteins and is important for its enzymatic activity (Hanpude2017Ubiquitin).

BAP1 forms quaternary structures by interacting with other proteins, such as BRCA1, BARD1, and ASXL family members, to form complexes involved in tumor suppression and chromatin modification (Peng2018Familial). Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, further regulate BAP1's activity and interactions (Bhattacharya2015Cancer). The protein also has splice variant isoforms that may influence its function (Hanpude2017Ubiquitin).

## Function
BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. It interacts with host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) and the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) to form a ternary complex essential for transcriptional regulation. This complex is involved in the regulation of genes associated with various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and DNA repair (Yu2010The).

BAP1's enzymatic activity is crucial for its function, as it deubiquitinates specific substrates, including HCF-1, which influences protein turnover and cell proliferation. The interaction between BAP1 and HCF-1 is necessary for proper cell cycle regulation, particularly the transition from the G1 to S phase (Misaghi2009Association; Machida2009The). BAP1 is also involved in chromatin remodeling, associating with transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes, which suggests its role in maintaining transcriptionally active chromatin (Yu2010The; Machida2009The).

In addition to its nuclear functions, BAP1 is implicated in metabolic regulation and mitochondrial function, influencing processes such as gluconeogenesis and glucose homeostasis (Szczepanski2021Emerging). Its activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BAP1 gene are associated with a range of cancers, including uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, and renal cell carcinoma. These mutations can be either germline or somatic and are linked to BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1-TPDS), which increases the risk of developing various malignancies (Masoomian2018Overview; Vimercati2022Case). Germline BAP1 mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and are associated with a high incidence of cancer, with penetrance approaching 100% with age (Carbone2020Biological). 

In mesothelioma, BAP1 mutations are common and can lead to a better prognosis and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy in germline mutation carriers (Vimercati2022Case). In contrast, somatic BAP1 mutations in uveal melanoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma are linked to a worse prognosis and a more aggressive disease course (Carbone2020Biological). BAP1 mutations also play a role in the response to immunotherapy by affecting the tumor microenvironment (Carbone2020Biological).

BAP1 mutations are early events in the development of malignant mesothelioma and are often associated with asbestos exposure, highlighting the gene-environment interaction in cancer susceptibility (Vimercati2022Case). Testing for BAP1 mutations is recommended for patients with certain cancers to aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning (Carbone2020Biological).

## Interactions
BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that participates in various protein interactions, forming complexes that play critical roles in cellular processes. BAP1 interacts with Host Cell Factor 1 (HCF-1), a cell cycle regulator, through a conserved NHNY sequence in BAP1 and the β-propeller domain of HCF-1. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of HCF-1's ubiquitination state and affects cell cycle progression, particularly the G1-to-S phase transition (Misaghi2009Association).

BAP1 also forms a ternary complex with the transcription factor YY1 and HCF-1, which is essential for regulating gene expression. The interaction with YY1 is mediated by the C-terminal region of BAP1, and HCF-1 is necessary for the optimal interaction between BAP1 and YY1 (Yu2010The).

In the cytoplasm, BAP1 interacts with proteins such as HAT1 and the COPI complex, indicating its involvement in histone modification and vesicle transport processes (Baas2021Proteomic). BAP1's interaction with ASXL proteins forms the PR-DUB complex, which targets H2AK119ub1, linking BAP1 to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Baas2021Proteomic).
