# LNPK

## Overview
The LNPK gene encodes the lunapark protein, a critical component in the maintenance and organization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network. Lunapark is categorized as an integral membrane protein, characterized by its ability to stabilize the curvature at three-way junctions within the tubular ER network. This stabilization is vital for the ER's dynamic structure, which supports various cellular functions, including protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, and calcium storage (Breuss2018Mutations; Accogli2023Lunapark). The protein's structure includes transmembrane domains, a coiled-coil region, and a zinc-finger domain, which are essential for its localization and function at ER junctions (Wang2016Cooperation). Mutations in the LNPK gene have been linked to a neurodevelopmental syndrome, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in maintaining proper ER function and neuronal development (Breuss2018Mutations; Accogli2023Lunapark).

## Structure
The LNPK gene encodes the protein lunapark, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing the curvature of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at tubular three-way junctions. The molecular structure of lunapark includes several key domains: an N-terminal domain important for N-myristoylation and ER targeting, two transmembrane domains, a coiled-coil region, and a unique zinc-finger domain (Breuss2018Mutations; Accogli2023Lunapark). The zinc-finger domain is particularly significant as it may facilitate oligomerization, which is essential for lunapark's localization to ER junctions (Wang2016Cooperation).

Lunapark's structure allows it to form sheet-like structures when overexpressed, indicating its localization to the sheets of tubular junctions (Wang2016Cooperation). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affects its oligomerization and function during mitosis. Phosphorylation occurs primarily in the unstructured domain between the second coiled-coil and zinc-finger domains, leading to changes in molecular weight and abundance (Wang2016Cooperation). This modification weakens lunapark's oligomerization, causing it to dissociate from three-way junctions and facilitating the expansion of junctions into larger sheets (Wang2016Cooperation).

## Function
The LNPK gene encodes the protein Lunapark, which plays a critical role in maintaining the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by stabilizing three-way junctions within the tubular ER network. This stabilization is essential for preserving the dynamic shape of the ER, which is crucial for its various cellular functions, including protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, and calcium storage (Breuss2018Mutations; Accogli2023Lunapark). Lunapark is an integral membrane protein that undergoes N-myristoylation, a lipid modification necessary for its function in inducing morphological changes in the ER, such as the formation of polygonal tubular structures (Moriya2013Protein).

Lunapark localizes preferentially to the three-way junctions of the ER, where it interacts with other proteins like reticulons and Sey1p to maintain ER architecture (Moriya2013Protein). It is involved in the network formation of the ER, contributing to cellular homeostasis and efficient intracellular transport (Moriya2013Protein). The protein's function is particularly important in neurons, where the ER's structure supports axon maintenance and extension, highlighting its role in neurodevelopment (Breuss2018Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LNPK gene, which encodes the lunapark protein, are associated with a recessive neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by severe psychomotor delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, epilepsy, and corpus callosum hypoplasia. These mutations lead to the absence of full-length lunapark, resulting in aberrant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structures and increased luminal mass density (Breuss2018Mutations). The disorder is marked by developmental delay, epilepsy, and nonspecific brain malformations, including corpus callosum hypoplasia and variable impairment of cerebellar development. Affected individuals often present with moderate to profound developmental delay, cognitive impairment, regression, and refractory epilepsy (Accogli2023Lunapark).

Research has identified 12 distinct homozygous loss-of-function variants in LNPK, which are extremely rare in human population variant databases. These variants are predicted to cause premature truncation of the transcript, likely resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Accogli2023Lunapark). The clinical manifestations include global developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and developmental regression, with neurological symptoms such as axial hypotonia, hyporeflexia, limb hypertonia, cerebellar tremor, and ataxic gait (Accogli2023Lunapark). Additionally, LNPK mutations have been linked to impaired migration of cortical interneurons, which may contribute to neurological conditions like epilepsy (Meng2022CRISPR).

## Interactions
Lunapark (LNPK) is involved in the formation and maintenance of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network through its interactions with other ER-shaping proteins. It interacts with atlastin (ATL), a membrane-fusing GTPase, and reticulons (Rtns), which stabilize the high membrane curvature of ER tubules. Although LNPK does not physically interact with ATL, it plays a role in the localization and function of these proteins within the ER network. LNPK's function appears to be upstream of ATL, as overexpression of LNPK does not significantly affect ATL localization, but ATL can compensate for the absence of LNPK by converting ER sheets into tubules and junctions (Wang2016Cooperation).

LNPK also interacts with itself through its Zn2+-finger domain, which is implicated in its dimerization and oligomerization. This self-interaction is crucial for its localization to three-way junctions in the ER (Wang2016Cooperation). During mitosis, LNPK undergoes phosphorylation, which interferes with its oligomerization and affects its ability to maintain ER junctions, leading to morphological changes in the ER (Wang2016Cooperation).
