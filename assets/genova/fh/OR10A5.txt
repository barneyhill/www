# OR10A5

## Overview
The OR10A5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily A member 5, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odorants, contributing to the sense of smell. The olfactory receptor family is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The OR10A5 protein is involved in the initial molecular interactions that occur when odorant molecules bind to receptors in the nasal epithelium, triggering a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in olfactory perception (Qiu2020aarFDC).
