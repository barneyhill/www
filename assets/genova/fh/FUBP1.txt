# FUBP1

## Overview
FUBP1, or far upstream element binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The FUBP1 protein is characterized by its ability to bind to single-stranded DNA and RNA, playing a crucial role in the regulation of the MYC oncogene and other key cellular processes such as cell proliferation, hematopoiesis, and alternative splicing (Debaize2018The). Structurally, the protein contains K-homology (KH) motifs that facilitate its interaction with nucleic acids, and it undergoes conformational changes that are essential for its function (Ni2020Comparative). FUBP1 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression and mutations can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yin2021FUBP1; Debaize2018The).

## Structure
The FUBP1 protein is composed of 644 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 67.5 kDa. It is structured into three main domains: an N-terminal repression domain, a central domain containing four K-homology (KH) motifs, and a C-terminal transactivation domain (Gerlach2013FUBP1; Debaize2018The). The KH motifs, located in the central domain, are crucial for binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA. These motifs are approximately 70 amino acids long and share a highly conserved topology, characterized by a three-stranded β-sheet packed against three helices (Ni2020Comparative).

The KH domains facilitate nucleotide recognition through a hydrophobic binding cleft formed by helices and a GXXG-motif-containing loop. Each KH domain can independently bind to ssDNA, with KH3 showing the highest binding affinity (Ni2020Comparative). The protein undergoes conformational changes upon activation, releasing the C-terminal domain essential for transcriptional activation (Debaize2018The).

FUBP1 exists in two isoforms due to alternative splicing, with isoform 1 consisting of 655 amino acids and isoform 2 consisting of 644 amino acids (Debaize2018The). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which modulate its function and interactions (Debaize2018The).

## Function
FUBP1 (far upstream element binding protein 1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of transcription, translation, and RNA splicing. FUBP1 acts as a master regulator by binding to single-stranded DNA and RNA, influencing the expression of key genes such as the MYC oncogene, which is essential for cell growth and division (Debaize2018The).

In the nucleus, FUBP1 promotes cell proliferation by activating MYC and repressing P21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that regulates the cell cycle (Debaize2018The). It also plays a significant role in hematopoiesis, supporting the expansion and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by regulating factors like Cyclin D2 and Myc, while repressing pro-apoptotic proteins such as Noxa (Debaize2018The).

FUBP1 is involved in alternative splicing, influencing exon inclusion or exclusion, which contributes to genetic diversity. It regulates the splicing of several genes, including MDM2, an oncogene, by binding to intronic regions (Debaize2018The). The protein's activity is context-dependent, with its functions varying based on subcellular localization and interactions with other proteins (Debaize2018The).

## Clinical Significance
FUBP1 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating the MYC oncogene. Overexpression of FUBP1 is associated with oncogenic roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), where it is linked to MYC overexpression and deregulation of other cell cycle and apoptotic regulators (Debaize2018The). In neuroblastoma, high FUBP1 expression correlates with increased malignancy and decreased survival rates, acting as an oncogene independent of N-Myc (Jiang2019FUBP1). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), FUBP1 upregulation is associated with increased tumor size and stage, promoting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis (Duan2017Upregulation).

FUBP1 mutations are also significant in lower-grade gliomas, where they are often associated with the 1p/19q codeletion and IDH1 mutations, leading to a loss of function and unfavorable survival outcomes, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Debaize2018The). In colorectal cancer, FUBP1 enhances cell stemness and metastasis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Yin2021FUBP1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FUBP1 expression alterations and mutations in cancer progression and prognosis.

## Interactions
FUBP1 interacts with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. It binds to the far upstream element (FUSE) of the c-Myc promoter, forming a complex with the general transcription factor TFIIH to enhance helicase activity, which promotes c-Myc transcription (Gerlach2013FUBP1; Zhang2012Far). FUBP1 also interacts with the FBP interacting repressor (FIR), which binds to FUSE and inhibits TFIIH helicase activity, thereby repressing c-Myc transcription (Zhang2012Far).

In addition to its role in transcription, FUBP1 is involved in RNA interactions. It binds to the 3' UTR of nucleophosmin (NPM) and GAP43 mRNAs, influencing their stability and translation (Gerlach2013FUBP1). FUBP1 also binds to the 5' UTR of p27 mRNA, activating its translation in breast cancer cells (Debaize2018The).

FUBP1's interactions extend to viral RNA, where it enhances the replication of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Enterovirus 71 (EV71) by binding to specific regions within their RNA (Debaize2018The). These interactions highlight FUBP1's multifaceted role in regulating gene expression and its potential impact on cellular and viral processes.
