# CYP2D7

## Overview
CYP2D7 is a gene that is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, specifically categorized within the family 2 subfamily D. It is traditionally classified as a pseudogene due to a frameshift mutation that typically results in a non-functional protein. However, recent studies have identified a brain-specific variant of CYP2D7 that can be functional, capable of metabolizing codeine to morphine, a role usually attributed to the CYP2D6 enzyme (Pai2004A). This suggests that CYP2D7 may have a localized function in drug metabolism within the central nervous system, although its activity and significance vary across different populations and remain under investigation (Gaedigk2005CYP2D7; Zhang2008Expression).

## Function
CYP2D7 is traditionally considered a pseudogene due to a frameshift mutation that typically renders it non-functional. However, a specific frameshift mutation (138delT) and alternate splicing in the human brain can generate a functional form of CYP2D7. This brain-specific variant is capable of metabolizing codeine to morphine, a function usually associated with the CYP2D6 enzyme in the liver (Pai2004A). The presence of this functional variant in the brain suggests that CYP2D7 may play a role in local drug metabolism, potentially influencing the pharmacological effects of drugs like codeine at the site of action within the central nervous system (Pai2004A).

Despite these findings, other studies have not consistently confirmed the functional activity of CYP2D7 in healthy human cells. Some research has failed to detect functional CYP2D7 transcripts in various populations, suggesting that the gene may not encode a functional protein in all individuals (Gaedigk2005CYP2D7). The role of CYP2D7 in drug metabolism remains a subject of investigation, with conflicting reports about its activity and significance in different populations (Zhang2008Expression).
