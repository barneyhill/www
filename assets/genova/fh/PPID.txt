# PPID

## Overview
The PPID gene encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase D, also known as Cyclophilin 40 (CyP40), which is a member of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases). These enzymes are crucial for protein folding, as they catalyze the isomerization of proline residues in polypeptides, thereby influencing protein conformation and function (Yokoi1996The; Jandova2013Cyclophilin). CyP40 is characterized by a cyclophilin-like domain and a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins, such as those in steroid receptor complexes (Yokoi1996The; Davis2010Structural). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, apoptosis, and stress responses, and is localized in multiple cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and mitochondria (Jandova2013Cyclophilin). Its role in mitochondrial function and interaction with viral proteins underscores its significance in cellular homeostasis and potential implications in disease contexts (Dong2021Identification; Perrucci2015Peptidylprolyl).

## Structure
The PPID gene encodes the human cyclophilin 40 (hCyP40) protein, which is a member of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family. The primary structure of hCyP40 includes an open reading frame of 370 amino acids (Yokoi1996The). The protein's secondary structure features a cyclophilin-like domain, which is common among cyclophilins and is involved in binding the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (Davis2010Structural). The tertiary structure of hCyP40 is compact and globular, typical of cyclophilins, and includes a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain in the C-terminal region, which is associated with protein-protein interactions (Yokoi1996The; Davis2010Structural).

The quaternary structure of hCyP40 involves interactions with other proteins, such as its association with steroid receptor complexes, indicating a role in protein folding and cellular signaling pathways (Yokoi1996The). The protein is highly conserved across species, suggesting its evolutionary importance (Yokoi1996The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, although specific modifications for hCyP40 are not detailed in the provided context. The gene may also have splice variant isoforms, which could differ in function and localization, although specific variants are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
The PPID gene encodes Cyclophilin 40 (CyP40), a member of the cyclophilin family known for its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity, which facilitates protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues in polypeptides (Yokoi1996The; Jandova2013Cyclophilin). CyP40 is involved in the assembly of heat shock protein Hsp90 in chaperone protein-folding machinery, forming part of steroid receptor complexes with Hsp90, FKBP51, and FKBP52 (Jandova2013Cyclophilin). This protein is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and mitochondria, and plays a role in processes such as signal transduction, apoptosis, and cellular stress responses (Jandova2013Cyclophilin).

CyP40 exhibits altered intracellular localization following heat shock, moving from nucleolar to nuclear, which may imply a role in nuclear transport or chaperoning under stress (Mark2001Human). It is also involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions, influencing mitochondrial pore formation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Jandova2013Cyclophilin). The protein's activity can impact organismal outcomes like immune response and cellular homeostasis, highlighting its importance in fundamental cellular functions (Yokoi1996The).

## Interactions
PPID, also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase D, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is primarily targeted to the mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. This regulation is essential for maintaining metabolic function and controlling cell death activation (Perrucci2015Peptidylprolyl).

PPID has been identified as interacting with the M protein of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). This interaction is significant as it is the first time PPID has been shown to interact with a coronavirus structural protein. The interaction between the PEDV M protein and PPID may block Vero cell apoptosis, thereby enhancing PEDV proliferation (Dong2021Identification). The study confirmed extensive cytoplasmic co-localization of the M protein with PPID, indicating a strong interaction (Dong2021Identification).

PPID also contributes to protein folding, ligand binding, and nuclear sorting of various receptors, highlighting its role in the context of viral infection and suggesting further investigation into its interactions with viral proteins (Dong2021Identification).
