# PRR27

## Overview
Proline Rich 27 (PRR27) is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 27, which is characterized by its abundance of proline residues. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. PRR27 is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting a role in diverse biological pathways. The protein encoded by PRR27 is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but its proline-rich nature implies potential interactions with other proteins, possibly influencing cellular signaling and structural dynamics. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of PRR27 in health and disease.
