# ATP10D

## Overview
ATP10D is a gene that encodes the protein ATPase phospholipid transporting 10D (putative), which is a member of the P4-ATPase family, a group of transmembrane proteins known as phospholipid flippases. These enzymes are integral to the maintenance of phospholipid asymmetry across cellular membranes, a process vital for cellular functions such as vesicle formation, cell signaling, and apoptosis (Roland2018Identification). ATP10D specifically facilitates the transport of glucosylceramide, a sphingolipid implicated in metabolic diseases, thereby playing a crucial role in lipid homeostasis and membrane organization (Roland2018Identification). The protein's expression in human testes and spermatozoa suggests a potential role in fertility, although this requires further exploration (Norris2024ATP10A). ATP10D's interactions, particularly with the β-subunit CDC50A, are essential for its localization to the plasma membrane, underscoring its importance in lipid metabolism and cellular membrane integrity (liou2017characterization).

## Function
ATP10D encodes a P4-ATPase, a type of phospholipid flippase involved in the translocation of lipids across the membrane bilayer. This enzyme plays a crucial role in maintaining phospholipid asymmetry in cellular membranes, which is essential for various cellular processes, including vesicle formation, cell signaling, and apoptosis (Roland2018Identification). ATP10D is specifically involved in the transport of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), a sphingolipid that is significant in metabolic disease contexts. The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of sphingolipid homeostasis and systemic lipid delivery, suggesting its importance in lipid transport and membrane organization in healthy human cells (Roland2018Identification).

ATP10D is expressed in human testes and has been identified as a transcript in human spermatozoa, indicating a potential role in human fertility. However, its exact function in this context requires further investigation (Norris2024ATP10A). The gene's activity in the plasma membrane suggests it may influence lipid metabolism and transport, contributing to the maintenance of cellular membrane integrity and function (Roland2018Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The ATP10D gene is associated with several metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. Variants near ATP10D have been linked to circulating levels of hexosylceramide, obesity, insulin resistance, plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, coronary stenotic index, and intracranial atherosclerotic index (Sigruener2017Lipidomic). In mice, ATP10D deficiency is linked to increased susceptibility to obesity and insulin resistance, particularly when subjected to a high-fat diet. Transgenic mice with restored ATP10D function exhibit lower weight gain, reduced fat cell mass, improved insulin sensitivity, and altered lipid metabolism, suggesting a protective role against these metabolic disorders (Sigruener2017Lipidomic).

The gene also plays a significant role in regulating plasma glucosylceramide (GlcCer) levels. Although ATP10D is a strong regulator of GlcCer, studies indicate that it is not involved in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, despite an association between GlcCer levels and the disease (Somerville2024Plasma). These findings suggest that while ATP10D influences lipid metabolism and related metabolic conditions, it does not contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease.

## Interactions
ATP10D is a member of the P4-ATPase family, which are integral membrane transporters involved in phospholipid translocation. The localization of ATP10D to the plasma membrane is dependent on its interaction with CDC50A, a known β-subunit for P4-ATPases. This interaction is crucial for the correct assembly and folding of the protein complex, allowing ATP10D to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and localize to the plasma membrane (liou2017characterization). CDC50A is not directly involved in the subcellular targeting of P4-ATPases but may participate in ATP-dependent phospholipid transport, which is essential for the phosphorylation at the catalytically important Asp residue (liou2017characterization).

Beyond its interaction with CDC50A, there is no specific mention of ATP10D's physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in the available literature. The substrate specificity of ATP10D has not been determined, and there is no detailed information on its potential interactions with other proteins involved in lipid metabolism or membrane dynamics (liou2017characterization).
