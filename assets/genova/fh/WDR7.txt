# WDR7

## Overview
WDR7, or WD repeat domain 7, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of multiple WD40 repeat domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. The protein encoded by WDR7 is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking and neurotransmitter exocytosis, through its interactions with other proteins such as Rab3 GDP/GTP exchange protein and Odin (Crummy2019The; Park2009Identification). The WD40 repeats in WDR7 contribute to its tertiary structure, likely forming a beta-propeller configuration, which is a common structural motif for proteins with these domains (Merkulova2015Mapping). Functionally, WDR7 plays a significant role in neuroendocrine cells as part of the rabconnectin3β complex, essential for dense-core vesicle acidification and exocytosis (Crummy2019The). Additionally, WDR7 is implicated in the EphA8-Odin signaling pathway, influencing cell migration and axonal retraction (Park2009Identification). The gene's involvement in critical cellular pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and neuroendocrine disorders (Tian2017Calycosin; Crummy2019The).

## Structure
The WDR7 protein is characterized by the presence of nine WD40 repeats, which are conserved domains typically involved in protein-protein interactions. These repeats are approximately 40-60 amino acids long and are initiated by a glycine-histidine (GH) dipeptide at the N terminus and end with a tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) dipeptide at the C terminus, with a conserved core sequence in between (Park2009Identification). The WD40 repeats contribute to the protein's tertiary structure, likely forming a beta-propeller configuration, which is common for proteins with these motifs (Merkulova2015Mapping).

WDR7 does not contain other known protein-protein interaction motifs or catalytic domains beyond the WD40 repeats (Park2009Identification). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking and neurotransmitter exocytosis, through its interactions with other proteins such as Rab3 GDP/GTP exchange protein and Odin (Crummy2019The; Park2009Identification).

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of WDR7 may exist, potentially affecting its function and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Merkulova2015Mapping).

## Function
WDR7 (WD repeat domain 7) is involved in several cellular processes, primarily through its role in protein-protein interactions facilitated by its WD40 repeat domains. In neuroendocrine cells, WDR7 is part of the rabconnectin3β complex, which is crucial for the localization and function of CAPS1, a priming factor necessary for dense-core vesicle (DCV) acidification and exocytosis. This interaction is essential for the proper acidification of DCVs, which is mediated by V-ATPase, a proton pump that WDR7 helps stabilize (Crummy2019The). 

WDR7 also plays a role in the EphA8-Odin signaling pathway, where it interacts with Odin, a scaffolding protein. This interaction is important for cell migration and axonal retraction, processes critical for cellular development and function (Park2009Identification). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to the assembly of protein complexes and influencing cellular homeostasis and development. While its specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, WDR7's involvement in these pathways suggests it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular processes and signaling pathways (Crummy2019The; Park2009Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WDR7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neuroendocrine cell function. In breast cancer, the WDR7-7-GPR30 signaling pathway plays a significant role. The long non-coding RNA WDR7-7 is downregulated in breast cancer cells, and its overexpression has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation by reducing GPR30 expression. Calycosin, a phytoestrogen, has been found to upregulate WDR7-7, leading to decreased breast cancer cell growth, suggesting potential therapeutic implications (Tian2017Calycosin).

In neuroendocrine cells, WDR7, as part of the rabconnectin3β complex, is crucial for the localization and function of CAPS1, a protein involved in dense-core vesicle (DCV) acidification. Alterations in WDR7 expression can disrupt CAPS1 localization, affecting neurotransmitter loading and hormonal processing. This disruption can lead to impaired DCV acidification and exocytosis, highlighting the importance of WDR7 in maintaining normal neuroendocrine cell function (Crummy2019The).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of WDR7 in both cancer and neuroendocrine disorders, where its altered expression or interaction can contribute to disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
WDR7 (WD repeat domain 7) is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. One notable interaction is with Odin, a scaffolding protein involved in the EphA8-mediated signaling pathway. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed by GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The C-terminal region of WDR7, which contains two WD40 repeats, is crucial for its binding to Odin. The interaction is enhanced by ephrinA5 ligand stimulation, suggesting a role in the EphA8 signaling pathway, potentially influencing cell migration and axonal retraction processes (Park2009Identification).

In the context of breast cancer, WDR7 is associated with the long non-coding RNA WDR7-7, which interacts with the GPR30 protein. This interaction is part of a signaling pathway that affects cell proliferation. Calycosin, a compound with anti-cancer properties, up-regulates WDR7-7 expression, leading to decreased GPR30 expression and influencing the phosphorylation of proteins such as SRC, EGFR, ERK1/2, and Akt. These interactions play a significant role in breast cancer cell growth, particularly in estrogen receptor-negative cells (Tian2017Calycosin).
