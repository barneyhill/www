# TNFRSF13B

## Overview
The TNFRSF13B gene encodes the TACI protein, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of B cell function and immune responses. TACI, a type III transmembrane receptor, is characterized by its two cysteine-rich domains that facilitate binding to ligands such as BAFF and APRIL, crucial for B cell survival and differentiation (Bossen2006BAFF; Schneider2009The). The gene's mutations are linked to immunodeficiency disorders, including Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Mohammadi2009Novel; Salzer2009Relevance). TACI's involvement in both T cell-independent and T cell-dependent pathways underscores its essential function in immune regulation and its potential impact on autoimmune conditions (Salzer2021TACI; Cascalho2021TNFRSF13B).

## Structure
The TNFRSF13B gene encodes the TACI protein, which is a type III transmembrane protein lacking a signal peptide and containing two cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) in its extracellular region (Schneider2009The). These CRDs are crucial for ligand binding, with CRD2 binding BAFF and APRIL with high affinity, while CRD1 binds with low affinity (Bossen2006BAFF). The structure of TACI includes a β-hairpin followed by a short helix, a conserved feature among related receptors, which is important for ligand-binding properties (Schneider2009The).

TACI can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, including a short form that lacks the first ligand-binding domain (Bossen2006BAFF). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which may influence its function and stability (Bossen2006BAFF).

Mutations in the TNFRSF13B gene can affect the protein's structure and function. For example, the C104R mutation impacts the CRD2 domain, potentially impairing its function by altering the spatial structure (Mohammadi2009Novel). These structural changes can affect the protein's stability and ligand-binding capacity, contributing to disease pathology (Salzer2009Relevance).

## Function
The TNFRSF13B gene encodes the TACI protein, a receptor in the TNF receptor superfamily that plays a crucial role in B cell regulation and immune function. TACI is primarily involved in signaling through the canonical NF-kB pathway and is linked to the Toll-like receptor pathway, influencing metabolic and cellular differentiation processes in B cells (Salzer2021TACI). It binds to ligands such as BAFF (B cell activating factor) and APRIL (A proliferation-inducing ligand), which are essential for B cell survival, differentiation, and function (Salzer2021TACI; Mohammadi2009Novel).

TACI is involved in both T cell-independent and T cell-dependent immune responses. It plays a significant role in promoting T cell-independent antibody responses and plasma cell differentiation, while also counteracting BAFF-driven B-cell activation to maintain immune balance (Salzer2021TACI; Cascalho2021TNFRSF13B). TACI is expressed variably across different B-cell subpopulations, with high expression on memory B cells, activated B-cells, and plasmablasts (Salzer2021TACI).

In healthy human cells, TACI helps maintain central and peripheral B-cell tolerance, preventing the development of autoreactive B-cells and regulating autoimmunity (Salzer2021TACI). It also plays a role in class switch recombination, necessary for the production of different classes of immunoglobulins (Mohammadi2009Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNFRSF13B gene, which encodes the TACI receptor, are associated with several immunodeficiency disorders, most notably Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). CVID is characterized by low serum immunoglobulin levels, leading to recurrent infections and an increased risk of autoimmune diseases and lymphoproliferative disorders (Mohammadi2009Novel; Salzer2009Relevance). The C104R mutation is particularly significant, as it impairs TACI function and is strongly associated with CVID, affecting both homozygous and heterozygous carriers (Salzer2009Relevance).

TNFRSF13B mutations are also linked to other conditions such as selective IgG subclass deficiencies and tonsillar hypertrophy (TH). In TH, mutations like I87N and c.204insA have been identified, with I87N being a loss-of-function mutation affecting ligand binding (Speletas2013Heterozygous). Additionally, TNFRSF13B mutations have been implicated in sarcoidosis, with mutations such as E36L and R202H noted in patients (Speletas2013Heterozygous).

The gene's alterations can lead to increased autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation, with conditions such as autoimmune thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia being more prevalent in patients with certain TNFRSF13B mutations (Salzer2009Relevance). These mutations may act as modifying factors rather than direct causes of disease, influencing the phenotype when combined with other immune gene alterations (Speletas2011TNFRSF13BTACI).

## Interactions
The TNFRSF13B gene encodes the TACI protein, which is involved in various interactions crucial for immune function. TACI interacts with ligands such as APRIL and BAFF, which are part of the tumor necrosis factor ligand family. These interactions are essential for activating the NF-kB signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in B cell maturation, plasma cell differentiation, and antibody response (Fırtına2023TNFRSF13B; Mackay2009Cracking). TACI recruits TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), particularly TRAF2 and TRAF6, to activate NF-kB when multiple receptors are clustered together (Mackay2009Cracking).

TACI also interacts with calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand (CAML), leading to the activation of calcineurin and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (Cascalho2021TNFRSF13B). Additionally, TACI is linked to the Toll-like receptor pathway via MyD88, connecting it to the mTOR signaling pathway, which influences metabolic and cellular differentiation processes in B cells (Salzer2021TACI).

Mutations in TNFRSF13B, such as the C104R mutation, can disrupt these interactions. The C104R mutation acts as a dominant-negative by preassociating with wild-type TACI, inhibiting NF-kB signaling without affecting ligand binding (Garibyan2007Dominantnegative). These interactions and mutations highlight the complex role of TACI in immune regulation and its impact on conditions like common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) (Salzer2009Relevance).
