# CTF1

## Overview
The CTF1 gene encodes cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1), a cytokine belonging to the interleukin-6 family, which plays a pivotal role in cardiac physiology and pathology. CT-1 is primarily involved in cardiac myocyte survival and hypertrophy, functioning through the gp130 signaling subunit and activating pathways such as JAK/STAT and MAP kinase (Sheng1997Cardiotrophin; Pennica1996Human). Beyond its cardiac functions, CT-1 is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle and the ovary, indicating its broader biological significance (Pennica1996Human). The protein's interactions with multiple signaling pathways underscore its potential therapeutic applications in cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, as well as its involvement in conditions like metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis (Miteva2020Cardiotrophin1; Watanabe2018Emerging).

## Function
Cardiotrophin 1 (CTF1) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in cardiac myocyte survival and hypertrophy. It is a member of the interleukin-6 cytokine family and functions primarily through the gp130 signaling subunit, which is essential for its biological activities (Sheng1997Cardiotrophin; Pennica1996Human). CTF1 activates the JAK/STAT and MAP kinase-dependent pathways, which are crucial for its anti-apoptotic effects in cardiac myocytes, helping to maintain heart function and prevent cardiac diseases (Sheng1997Cardiotrophin). 

In addition to its role in preventing apoptosis, CTF1 induces hypertrophy in cardiac muscle cells by promoting sarcomere assembly and increasing cell size, a process distinct from hypertrophy induced by α-adrenergic stimulation (Wollert1996Cardiotrophin1). This hypertrophic response involves the reactivation of genes typically expressed during fetal heart development, such as the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene (Wollert1996Cardiotrophin1).

CTF1 is expressed in various human tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and ovary, indicating its involvement in multiple biological systems beyond the heart (Pennica1996Human). Its ability to activate distinct signaling pathways underscores its potential therapeutic role in cardiac health and other physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), encoded by the CTF1 gene, is implicated in several cardiovascular and metabolic diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. Elevated plasma levels of CT-1 are associated with conditions such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, and polycystic ovary syndrome. These elevated levels correlate with increased diastolic blood pressure and triglyceride levels, particularly in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (Watanabe2018Emerging). CT-1 is also linked to hypertension, hypertensive heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure. Overexpression of CT-1 is associated with myocardial fibrosis and increased collagen expression in hypertensive patients (Watanabe2018Emerging).

In the context of atherosclerosis, CT-1 is expressed in endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells within atherosclerotic lesions, contributing to the disease by promoting endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and inflammatory cytokine synthesis (Watanabe2018Emerging). However, CT-1 deficiency in mouse models has shown atheroprotective effects, reducing cholesterol levels, atherosclerotic plaque size, and promoting plaque stability (Miteva2020Cardiotrophin1). Genetic variations in the CTF1 locus have been linked to insulin sensitivity, suggesting a role in insulin resistance and metabolic disorders (Lutz2014Common). These findings highlight CT-1's dual role in both promoting and protecting against cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), encoded by the CTF1 gene, is a cytokine that interacts with several proteins to mediate its biological effects. CT-1 primarily binds to a receptor complex composed of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) heterodimer. This binding activates multiple signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, c-Src tyrosine kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (Watanabe2018Emerging). These pathways are involved in various cellular responses such as cardiac protection, cardiovascular hypertrophy, and vascular inflammation.

CT-1 is also involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and metabolic processes. It interacts with the AMPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for improving insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function (Lutz2014Common). Additionally, CT-1 is up-regulated in response to hypoxic conditions through a mechanism involving hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which binds to hypoxia response elements in the CTF1 promoter, enhancing CT-1 transcription (Robador2011HIF1mediated). These interactions highlight CT-1's role in both cardiovascular and metabolic regulation.
