# C6orf136

## Overview
C6orf136 is a gene located on chromosome 6 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 6 open reading frame 136. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Emerging research suggests that C6orf136 may play a role in cancer biology, as its expression levels have been associated with prognostic outcomes in several types of cancer, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma and bladder cancer (Liu2023A; Tao2020Cancer). Additionally, alterations in C6orf136 expression and DNA methylation patterns have been implicated in other diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and pediatric central nervous system germ cell tumors, highlighting its potential significance in disease pathogenesis and as a biomarker for clinical outcomes (Wang2010Pediatric; CastelliniPérez2024Molecular). Further research is needed to fully understand the functional roles and mechanisms of C6orf136 in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
C6orf136 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), C6orf136 is identified as a protective factor for overall survival. Higher expression of C6orf136 is associated with better survival outcomes, and it contributes negatively to the risk score in a prognostic model, indicating its protective role in PAAD (Liu2023A). In bladder cancer, C6orf136 is part of the co-expression networks that correlate with cancer progression and recurrence. High expression levels of C6orf136 are associated with significant differences in overall and disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic indicator (Tao2020Cancer).

In pediatric primary central nervous system germ cell tumors, C6orf136 is overexpressed in germinomas, potentially due to chromosomal aberrations, although the specific clinical significance in this context is not detailed (Wang2010Pediatric). Additionally, DNA methylation changes in C6orf136 have been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where it may play a role in modulating genetic risk (CastelliniPérez2023The; CastelliniPérez2024Molecular). These findings suggest that C6orf136 may have diverse roles in different diseases, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.
