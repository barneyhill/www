# CYP26C1

## Overview
CYP26C1 is a gene in humans that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily C member 1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme functions as a hydroxylase, primarily involved in the metabolism of retinoic acid (RA) isomers, such as all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), by converting them into more polar metabolites. This metabolic process is crucial for maintaining retinoid homeostasis, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Zhong2018CYP26C1; Taimi2004A). The enzyme is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and interacts with cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs) to facilitate retinoid metabolism (Montalbano2016Retinoic). Mutations in CYP26C1 have been linked to Focal Facial Dermal Dysplasia Type IV, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental processes (Slavotinek2012Focal).

## Function
The human gene CYP26C1 encodes an enzyme that is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, specifically functioning as a hydroxylase for multiple active retinoids. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolism of retinoic acid (RA) isomers, including all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), by converting them into more polar, water-soluble metabolites. This conversion is essential for maintaining retinoid homeostasis in healthy human cells (Zhong2018CYP26C1; Taimi2004A).

CYP26C1 is involved in the regulation of intracellular RA levels, which is vital for processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The enzyme's activity is NADPH-dependent and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs) to facilitate the metabolism of retinoids (Zhong2018CYP26C1; Montalbano2016Retinoic).

The enzyme exhibits distinct substrate specificity and stereoselectivity, with a preference for 9-cis-RA and 4-oxo-atRA, and is less sensitive to inhibition by compounds like ketoconazole compared to other CYP26 family members (Zhong2018CYP26C1; Taimi2004A). This specificity allows CYP26C1 to play a unique role in retinoid metabolism, contributing to the regulation of RA levels necessary for normal embryonic development and tissue maintenance in adults (Taimi2004A; Montalbano2016Retinoic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYP26C1 gene are associated with Focal Facial Dermal Dysplasia (FFDD) Type IV, a rare condition characterized by facial lesions. These mutations lead to a loss of function of the CYP26C1 enzyme, which is crucial for the metabolism of retinoic acid (RA), a key regulator in developmental processes. Specifically, two mutations have been identified: a seven base pair duplication (c.844_851dupCCATGCA) causing a frameshift and a missense mutation. These mutations result in a non-functional protein, disrupting normal facial development and leading to the characteristic skin lesions of FFDD Type IV (Slavotinek2012Focal).

The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and the mutations are rare in control populations, underscoring their clinical significance. Despite the loss of function, FFDD Type IV typically presents with a mild phenotype, as developmental disabilities and extracutaneous findings are uncommon. This suggests some functional redundancy with other enzymes in the CYP26 family, such as CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, which also participate in RA metabolism (Slavotinek2012Focal). Not all patients with FFDD Type IV have CYP26C1 mutations, indicating potential genetic heterogeneity within the condition (Slavotinek2012Focal).

## Interactions
CYP26C1 interacts with cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs), which play a significant role in the metabolism of retinoids. CRABPs, specifically CRABP-I and CRABP-II, deliver active retinoids such as all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and 4-oxo-atRA to CYP26C1 for metabolism. This interaction facilitates substrate channeling, indicating a specific protein-protein interaction mechanism (Zhong2018CYP26C1). The presence of CRABPs does not significantly alter the Km value of atRA when compared to free atRA, suggesting that CRABPs deliver atRA to CYP26C1 without affecting its intrinsic clearance (Zhong2018CYP26C1). 

CRABPs also modulate the availability of retinoids for metabolism by CYP26C1, as the formation of 4-OH-atRA from atRA is significantly decreased in the presence of CRABP-I and CRABP-II, while the metabolism of 9-cis-RA is not affected due to low binding affinity (Zhong2018CYP26C1). These interactions suggest that CRABPs may decrease metabolism by CYP26C1 through allosteric modulation or noncompetitive inhibition, highlighting their regulatory role in retinoid homeostasis (Zhong2018CYP26C1).
