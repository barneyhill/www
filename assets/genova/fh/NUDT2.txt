# NUDT2

## Overview
NUDT2 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 2, an enzyme belonging to the nudix hydrolase family. This protein plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and homeostasis by regulating the levels of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) and participating in RNA turnover. Nudix hydrolase 2 is involved in the degradation of Ap4A, a molecule implicated in various cellular processes such as stress responses, DNA replication, and apoptosis. Additionally, the enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to mRNA decapping and nucleotide recycling, thereby influencing cell proliferation and stress responses. NUDT2's enzymatic activity is also crucial for antiviral defense, as it dephosphorylates viral RNA, facilitating its degradation. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in clinical contexts, including intellectual disability and cancer, where alterations in NUDT2 can affect disease progression and prognosis (Marriott2016NUDT2; CarrerasPuigvert2017A; Laudenbach2021NUDT2).

## Function
NUDT2, or nudix hydrolase 2, is an enzyme that plays a significant role in cellular metabolism by maintaining low levels of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) in cells. This regulation is crucial as Ap4A is involved in various cellular processes, including stress responses, DNA replication regulation, and apoptosis promotion (Marriott2016NUDT2). NUDT2 degrades Ap4A, preventing its accumulation, which can affect gene expression and potentially influence pathways related to metastasis, invasion, immunosuppression, and apoptosis (Marriott2016NUDT2).

In addition to its role in Ap4A regulation, NUDT2 is involved in the degradation of viral RNA by removing 5′-phosphates from triphosphorylated RNA (PPP-RNA), converting it into a substrate for the cellular exonuclease XRN1. This process is essential for controlling viral RNA abundance and preventing its accumulation in cells (Laudenbach2021NUDT2). NUDT2's activity is conserved across various species, indicating its broad functionality in RNA turnover and antiviral defense mechanisms (Laudenbach2021NUDT2).

NUDT2 is active in the cytoplasm and contributes to processes like mRNA decapping and nucleotide recycling, impacting cell proliferation and stress responses (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). Its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NUDT2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A novel homozygous frameshift variant, c.186delA (p.A63Qfs*3), in the NUDT2 gene has been associated with intellectual disability and polyneuropathy. This variant was identified in individuals from two unrelated families and is characterized by distal upper and lower extremity weakness and demyelinating and/or axonal features (Diaz2020Novel). Another study reported a case of a Chinese girl with intellectual disability, ADHD, and motor delays due to compound heterozygous variants in NUDT2, including a novel missense variant, expanding the known genotype and phenotype spectrum associated with NUDT2-related intellectual disability (Bi2024The).

Alterations in NUDT2 expression have also been implicated in cancer. In breast carcinoma, NUDT2 expression is associated with cell proliferation and is considered a potent prognostic factor. Its expression correlates with clinical factors such as stage, lymph node metastasis, and HER2 status, and it is linked to an increased risk of recurrence and adverse clinical outcomes in invasive ductal carcinoma patients (Oka2011Nudix‐type). Additionally, NUDT2 disruption in cancer cells leads to elevated levels of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), affecting gene expression and potentially inhibiting cancer progression (Marriott2016NUDT2).

## Interactions
NUDT2, or nudix hydrolase 2, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cellular processes. It plays a critical role in the mTORC1 signaling pathway by interacting with Rag GTPases. This interaction is essential for the lysosomal localization and activation of mTORC1, a process crucial for cell growth and proliferation. NUDT2 enhances the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane upon amino acid stimulation, facilitating the interaction between mTORC1 and Rag GTPases (Kwon2017Nudixtype).

NUDT2 also interacts with viral RNA, where it dephosphorylates 5′-triphosphorylated RNA (PPP-RNA), preparing it for degradation by the XRN1-dependent 5′-to-3′ RNA degradation machinery. This interaction highlights a cooperative role between NUDT2 and XRN1 in RNA degradation pathways, contributing to antiviral defense mechanisms (Laudenbach2021NUDT2).

In addition, NUDT2 has been shown to bind to the replicative helicase component MCM6, which may relate to replication initiation inhibition by diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A). However, the significance of this interaction in vivo remains unclear (Marriott2016NUDT2). These interactions underscore NUDT2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and homeostasis.
