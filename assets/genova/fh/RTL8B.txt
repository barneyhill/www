# RTL8B

## Overview
RTL8B is a human gene that encodes the protein retrotransposon Gag-like 8B, which is involved in the regulation of retrotransposon activity. This protein is categorized as a retrotransposon Gag-like protein due to its structural and functional similarities to retroviral Gag proteins. RTL8B is part of a gene cluster on the X chromosome and is conserved across eutherian mammals, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Fujioka2023Targeting). The protein encoded by RTL8B plays a crucial role in the formation and regulation of virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from the PEG10 protein, a retroelement-derived gene. By incorporating into these VLPs, RTL8B modulates their release efficiency, suggesting a regulatory function in cellular processes that may impact genomic stability and gene expression (Campodonico2023The). Additionally, RTL8B is implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, particularly in the context of disorders such as Angelman Syndrome, where it interacts with PEG10 in neuronal cells (KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived).

## Function
The RTL8B gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating retrotransposon activity, particularly in the context of its interaction with the PEG10 protein. RTL8B is part of a cluster of genes located on the X chromosome and is conserved across eutherians, indicating its evolutionary importance (Fujioka2023Targeting). The RTL8B protein is involved in the formation and regulation of virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from PEG10, a retroelement-derived gene. RTL8B incorporates into PEG10-derived VLPs, decreasing their release efficiency, which suggests a regulatory role in the formation and release of these particles (Campodonico2023The).

In neuronal cells, RTL8B, along with its paralogs, accumulates with PEG10, indicating a potential role in neurodevelopmental processes. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of Angelman Syndrome, where RTL8B and related proteins are targeted by the UBE3A gene (KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived). The protein is expressed in the prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus, localizing to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons, which suggests its involvement in brain functions related to growth and behavior (Fujioka2024Targeting). The modulation of RTL8B levels can impact PEG10-derived VLP production, highlighting its role in cellular processes that may affect genomic stability and gene expression (Campodonico2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the RTL8B gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Research indicates that RTL8B, along with its related genes RTL8A and RTL8C, plays a significant role in brain function, particularly in the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex, which are critical for regulating behaviors and emotions (Fujioka2024Targeting; Fujioka2023Targeting). Double knockout (DKO) mice lacking RTL8A and RTL8B exhibit late-onset obesity, reduced social responses, and increased apathy-like behavior, suggesting a link to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) (Fujioka2024Targeting; Fujioka2023Targeting).

The RTL8B gene is also associated with the regulation of GABRB2, a subunit of the GABAA receptor, which is involved in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. The downregulation of GABRB2 in DKO mice may contribute to the observed behavioral abnormalities, indicating a potential mechanism by which RTL8B influences neuropsychiatric conditions (Fujioka2024Targeting). Additionally, RTL8B interacts with PEG10, a gene implicated in neurological diseases like AS, potentially affecting the formation and release of virus-like particles, which may have further implications for neurological health (Campodonico2023The).

## Interactions
RTL8B, a human gene encoding a retrotransposon Gag-like protein, is involved in interactions with the PEG10 protein. RTL8B, along with its paralogs RTL8A and RTL8C, shares high homology with the N-terminal domain of the PEG10 capsid. This homology facilitates RTL8B's incorporation into PEG10-derived virus-like particles (VLPs), where it acts as an antagonist by decreasing the release efficiency of these particles (Campodonico2023The). The interaction between RTL8B and PEG10 is mediated through the N-terminal domain of the PEG10 capsid, which is necessary and sufficient for this interaction (Campodonico2023The).

In addition to its role in VLP modulation, RTL8B is implicated in neurodevelopmental processes. It accumulates with PEG10 in neuronal cells derived from iPS cells of Angelman Syndrome patients, suggesting a potential regulatory role in neurodevelopmental disorders (KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived). Although specific physical interactions of RTL8B with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its involvement in these processes indicates a broader functional significance in cellular and developmental contexts (Fujioka2024Targeting).
