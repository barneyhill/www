# NDUFV1

## Overview
The NDUFV1 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V1, a critical component of mitochondrial complex I, which is the largest enzyme of the electron transport chain located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. As a core subunit, NDUFV1 is involved in the initial steps of electron transfer, catalyzing the oxidation of NADH and contributing to the mitochondrial electrochemical potential by sustaining proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The protein is characterized by a Rossmann-fold domain for binding flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and NADH, as well as an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster domain crucial for electron transfer. Mutations in the NDUFV1 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, leading to various mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome and other encephalomyopathies, underscoring its clinical significance (Zanette2021NDUFV1; Schuelke1999Mutant; Varghese2015Characterization).

## Structure
The NDUFV1 gene encodes a 51 kDa subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is crucial for electron transport in the respiratory chain. The primary structure of NDUFV1 includes a sequence of 464 amino acids, with a deduced molecular weight of approximately 50.8 kDa (Schuelke1998Cloning). The protein is mainly hydrophilic and contains a putative mitochondrial import sequence within the first 20 amino acids (Schuelke1998Cloning).

The secondary structure of NDUFV1 features a Rossmann-fold domain, which is essential for binding flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and NADH, playing a critical role in the enzyme's catalytic activity (Varghese2015Characterization). The protein also includes an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster domain, which is vital for electron transfer (Varghese2015Characterization).

In terms of tertiary structure, NDUFV1 is involved in forming the peripheral arm of complex I, contributing to the NADH oxidation process (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian). The quaternary structure involves its assembly with other subunits, such as NDUFS1 and NDUFV2, to form the N-module of complex I (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian).

NDUFV1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including potential phosphorylation and acetylation, which may regulate its function and stability (Varghese2015Characterization).

## Function
The NDUFV1 gene encodes a 51-kDa subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This subunit plays a vital role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Zanette2021NDUFV1; Schuelke1999Mutant).

The NDUFV1 protein contains the NADH-binding site and is part of the electron input (N) module of complex I, which also includes subunits encoded by the genes NDUFV2 and NDUFS1 (Zanette2021NDUFV1). It is involved in the initial steps of electron transfer, where it catalyzes the oxidation of NADH in the mitochondrial matrix, contributing to the mitochondrial electrochemical potential by sustaining the translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Bénit2001LargeScale).

In healthy human cells, the NDUFV1 gene is essential for the proper functioning of mitochondrial complex I, ensuring efficient energy production and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its activity is crucial for the conversion of NADH to NAD+, which is necessary for the continuation of the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis (Srivastava2018Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFV1 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which can lead to a variety of mitochondrial disorders. These include Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, and other mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Patients with NDUFV1 mutations often present with symptoms such as neuromotor regression, spasticity, tremors, ataxia, dystonia, seizures, hypotonia, and cognitive decline (Zanette2021NDUFV1; Laugel2007EarlyOnset). 

Specific mutations, such as p.Arg386Cys and p.Arg386His, have been linked to diffuse leukodystrophy and Leigh syndrome, respectively, highlighting the diverse clinical manifestations associated with NDUFV1 mutations (Vilain2011A; OrtegaRecalde2013A). These mutations can disrupt the structure and function of complex I, impairing mitochondrial energy metabolism and leading to the observed clinical symptoms (Varghese2015Characterization).

The clinical significance of NDUFV1 mutations is further underscored by their association with conditions like myoclonic epilepsy and muscular hypotonia, as seen in patients with isolated complex I deficiency (Schuelke1999Mutant). The phenotypic variability in patients with NDUFV1 mutations suggests that these genetic alterations can result in a range of clinical outcomes, from mild to severe (Björkman2015Broad).

## Interactions
NDUFV1, a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I, participates in several critical interactions that influence its function and stability. It interacts with CYTL1, a novel tumor suppressor, which stabilizes NDUFV1 by competitively binding to its N-terminal sequence. This interaction prevents MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of NDUFV1, thereby maintaining its stability and function in oxidative phosphorylation (Xue2022Intracellular). 

NDUFV1 also interacts with Src, a kinase that phosphorylates LDHA, a key enzyme in glycolysis. By interacting with Src, NDUFV1 inhibits LDHA phosphorylation, reducing its activity and shifting cancer cell metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (Xue2022Intracellular). 

In the context of mitochondrial complex I, NDUFV1 is part of the dehydrogenase module, which is involved in NADH oxidation. It contains binding sites for NADH, FMN, and iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential for its role in electron transport (Schuelke1998Cloning; Dieteren2011Defective). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of complex I, which is vital for cellular respiration and energy production.
