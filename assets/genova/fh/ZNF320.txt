# ZNF320

## Overview
ZNF320 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 320, a member of the Kruppel-like zinc-finger protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a KRAB domain and multiple C2H2 zinc-finger motifs, which classify it as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. Zinc finger protein 320 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates the transcription of various target genes, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Chernova2001A). The gene is expressed in a range of human tissues, with notable expression in the placenta, pancreas, kidney, and heart (Chernova2001A). ZNF320 has also been implicated in cancer biology, where it functions as a tumor suppressor, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma and other cancer types, by influencing cell viability and proliferation (Ito2020Endogenousa).

## Function
ZNF320 is a member of the Kruppel-like zinc-finger protein family, characterized by a KRAB domain and a tandem array of twelve C2H2 zinc-fingers. These structural features suggest its role as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. ZNF320 is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels observed in the placenta, pancreas, kidney, and heart, and lower levels in the liver, skeletal muscle, and brain (Chernova2001A). 

In healthy cells, ZNF320 likely functions in transcription regulation, given its structural characteristics and expression pattern. The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene regulatory networks by binding to DNA and modulating the transcription of target genes. This activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Chernova2001A).

ZNF320 is also involved in tumor suppression. It is part of the KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which regulates genes critical for cancer cell viability and proliferation. The loss of function of ZNF320 can lead to increased cancer cell viability, indicating its role in suppressing tumor progression (Ito2020Endogenousa).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF320 has been implicated in various cancer types due to its role in transcription regulation. In glioblastoma, a chromosomal translocation involving ZNF320 and the WDR11 gene results in a chimeric transcript, potentially affecting ZNF320 expression and contributing to tumorigenesis (Chernova2001A). The gene is expressed in several cancer cell lines, including glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and prostate cancer, suggesting its involvement in cancer biology (Chernova2001A).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ZNF320, as part of the KRAB zinc-finger family proteins (KZFPs), is involved in tumor suppression. Overexpression of KZFPs, including ZNF320, in LUAD cells leads to apoptosis and reduced cell growth, migration, and invasion, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role (Ito2020Endogenousa). The expression of ZNF320 and other KZFPs is modulated by endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which act as enhancers, suggesting a feedback loop that may suppress tumor progression (Ito2020Endogenousa).

While the clinical significance of ZNF320 mutations is not directly addressed, its altered expression and interactions in cancer suggest a potential role in tumorigenesis and tumor suppression (Chernova2001A; Ito2020Endogenousa).
