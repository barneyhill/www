# S100Z

## Overview
S100Z is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein Z, a member of the S100 protein family known for its role in calcium-dependent signaling pathways. The S100Z protein is characterized by its two EF-hand motifs, which facilitate calcium binding and are crucial for its function (Calderone2019Reviewing). Upon binding calcium, S100Z undergoes conformational changes that enable it to interact with various target proteins, potentially influencing cellular processes. Structurally, S100Z forms homodimers and can assemble into higher-order oligomers, particularly in the presence of calcium, which enhances its protein-protein interactions (Calderone2019Reviewing). While the precise biological functions and pathological roles of S100Z remain largely unknown, its expression levels have been associated with prognostic outcomes in certain cancers, suggesting a potential role as a biomarker (Zheng2021Comprehensive; Li2021Prognostic). Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms and clinical significance of S100Z in human health and disease (SantamariaKisiel2006Calciumdependent).

## Structure
The S100Z protein is a member of the S100 family, characterized by its ability to bind calcium through two EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures typical of this protein family (Calderone2019Reviewing). The primary structure of S100Z includes these motifs, which are crucial for its calcium-binding function. Upon calcium binding, S100Z undergoes significant conformational changes, transitioning from a closed to an open conformation that exposes a hydrophobic cleft, facilitating interactions with target proteins (Calderone2019Reviewing).

In its tertiary structure, S100Z typically forms homodimers, a common feature among S100 proteins. These dimers can further assemble into higher-order oligomers, such as tetramers, particularly in the presence of calcium, which enhances the buried surface area involved in these interactions, indicating stronger protein-protein interactions (Calderone2019Reviewing). The structural differences between the apo (calcium-free) and holo (calcium-bound) forms of S100Z are significant, with the holo form showing a larger root mean square deviation compared to the apo form, highlighting the structural flexibility and variability of S100Z (Calderone2019Reviewing). The biological functions and pathological relevance of S100Z remain largely unknown, although its mRNA expression varies across different human tissues (Calderone2019Reviewing).

## Clinical Significance
S100Z, a member of the S100 protein family, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression of S100Z is associated with better overall survival, although specific details about its mutations or interactions in this context are not provided (Zheng2021Comprehensive). In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), S100Z shows a 3% genetic alteration rate, and its high expression is linked to sensitivity to small molecule drugs (Li2021Prognostic). Low mRNA expression of S100Z in PAAD is associated with worse overall survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker (Li2021Prognostic).

Despite these associations, the specific functional roles or extracellular functions of S100Z in tumors remain largely unexplored, and no detailed information on its clinical significance regarding gene mutations or interaction changes is available (Donato2012Functions; SantamariaKisiel2006Calciumdependent). The lack of identified biological targets for S100Z suggests that further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications in cancer and other diseases (SantamariaKisiel2006Calciumdependent).
