# NPIPA2

## Overview
NPIPA2, or Nuclear Pore Complex Interacting Protein Family Member A2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, a vital cellular process that facilitates the exchange of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The NPIPA2 protein is a component of the nuclear pore complex, which is crucial for the transport of RNA and proteins across the nuclear envelope, thereby influencing gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Jiang2019Populationspecific; Sotcheff2022Zika). The protein's localization to the cell membrane and its role in transport across the membrane suggest its significant contribution to nuclear envelope integrity. Although the specific functions of NPIPA2 in healthy human cells are not extensively documented, its involvement in nuclear transport processes underscores its importance in cellular function and integrity (Sotcheff2022Zika). NPIPA2 has been implicated in various diseases, including diabetic kidney disease and cancer, and its expression is affected by viral infections, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (French2020Immunotherapy; Pan2022A).

## Function
NPIPA2, or Nuclear Pore Complex Interacting Protein Family Member A2, is involved in the regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, a critical cellular process that maintains the exchange of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This protein is a component of the nuclear pore complex, which is essential for the transport of RNA and proteins across the nuclear envelope, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular homeostasis (Jiang2019Populationspecific; Sotcheff2022Zika).

The localization of NPIPA2 to the cell membrane and its function in transport across the membrane suggest that it plays a significant role in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity. This function is crucial for the proper functioning of cells, as it ensures that the necessary molecules are correctly transported to and from the nucleus, impacting various cellular processes (Jiang2019Populationspecific).

While the specific function of NPIPA2 in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed in the available literature, its involvement in nuclear transport processes indicates its importance in maintaining cellular function and integrity (Sotcheff2022Zika). The gene's role in these processes makes it a potential target of natural selection, as evidenced by its association with various diseases (Jiang2019Populationspecific).

## Clinical Significance
NPIPA2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and potential mutations. In diabetic kidney disease (DKD), NPIPA2 is significantly overexpressed, correlating positively with the urine albumin/creatinine ratio and serum creatinine, and negatively with albumin and hemoglobin levels. This suggests that NPIPA2 may serve as a biomarker for DKD and play a role in its pathogenesis (Pan2022A).

In cancer, NPIPA2 is associated with various malignancies. Polymorphisms in NPIPA2 are linked to several cancer types, and its deletion is common in early-onset colorectal cancer (Jiang2019Populationspecific). In medullary thyroid cancer, NPIPA2 is identified as a highly expressed tumor-associated antigen, suggesting its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Pozdeyev2020Comprehensive; French2020Immunotherapy).

NPIPA2 expression is also affected by viral infections. Zika virus infection alters NPIPA2 expression in placental cells, impacting cell cycle control and mRNA processing (Sotcheff2022Zika). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in diverse pathological conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its clinical implications fully.
