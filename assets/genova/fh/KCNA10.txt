# KCNA10

## Overview
KCNA10 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 10, which is a part of the Shaker superfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels. This protein is characterized by its inclusion of a cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNB) domain, distinguishing it from other Kv channels and suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism involving cyclic nucleotides (Yao2002Expression; Tian2002Regulation). The KCNA10 protein is a transmembrane channel that plays a critical role in regulating cell membrane potential and modulating cellular excitability, particularly in the kidney, heart, and vascular tissues (Yao2002Expression). It is involved in various physiological processes, including renal potassium metabolism and vascular tone regulation, and is subject to modulation by protein kinase C and interaction with the β-subunit KCNA4B, which enhances its functional properties (Carlisle2012Specific; Tian2002Regulation). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with conditions such as chronic kidney disease and vestibular dysfunction, highlighting its potential role in human health and disease (Nanayakkara2015Wholeexome; Lee2013A).

## Structure
KCNA10 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel protein that is part of the Shaker superfamily. The protein is characterized by a cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNB) domain at the COOH terminus, which is a distinguishing feature among Kv channels (Yao2002Expression; Tian2002Regulation). This domain suggests that KCNA10 may belong to a subclass of K channels with structural features common to both Kv channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels (Yao2002Expression).

The KCNA10 protein has a predicted secondary structure that is identical to other Shaker-related K+ channels, indicating a typical arrangement of six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) with a pore-forming region between S5 and S6 (Tian2002Regulation). The channel forms tetramers, contributing to its quaternary structure, which is common among voltage-gated potassium channels (Wulff2009Voltagegated).

KCNA10 is subject to regulation by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase C, which inhibits its activity (Yao2002Expression; Tian2002Regulation). The interaction with the β-subunit KCNA4B modifies its kinetic properties and increases current expression, suggesting a role in the regulation of channel activity (Tian2002Regulation).

## Function
KCNA10 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that plays a significant role in regulating cell membrane potential and modulating various cellular functions. This channel is primarily active in the kidney, heart, and aorta, where it contributes to renal potassium metabolism and the regulation of vascular tone (Yao2002Expression). In the kidney, KCNA10 is expressed at the apical membrane of proximal tubular cells and in the glomerulus, suggesting a role in facilitating proximal tubular sodium absorption by stabilizing cell membrane voltage (Yao2002Expression). The channel is also present in glomerular endothelial cells and intrarenal arteries, indicating its involvement in potassium ion transport and vascular function (Yao2002Expression).

KCNA10 is part of the Shaker superfamily and contains a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, which allows it to mediate voltage-gated potassium currents with minimal steady-state inactivation. It is activated by depolarizations more positive than -66 mV and has a high potassium-to-sodium selectivity ratio (Yao2002Expression). The channel's activity is modulated by protein kinase C and an accessory subunit, KCNA4B, which increases its current expression and alters its sensitivity to cAMP (Carlisle2012Specific). These molecular characteristics enable KCNA10 to play a crucial role in maintaining cellular excitability and ion homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCNA10 gene have been implicated in several health conditions. A specific variant, c.658G>A (p.V220M), in the KCNA10 gene has been associated with chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka. This variant was exclusively observed in CKDu cases, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis. The study highlights that hypertension, a major risk factor for CKDu progression, may be linked to KCNA10's involvement in blood pressure regulation (Nanayakkara2015Wholeexome).

In a mouse model, disruption of the Kcna10 gene resulted in significant vestibular dysfunction and mild hearing impairment, indicating its role in auditory and vestibular systems. The study suggests that KCNA10 may be involved in human nonsyndromic vestibulopathy, although no overt balance problems were observed in the mice (Lee2013A).

KCNA10 is also expressed in the kidney, heart, and aorta, where it may play a role in renal potassium metabolism and vascular tone regulation. Its expression in these tissues suggests potential involvement in conditions related to cardiovascular function, although specific diseases were not directly addressed in the studies (Yao2002Expression).

## Interactions
KCNA10 interacts with the novel β-subunit KCNA4B, which was identified using the yeast two-hybrid system as a protein that binds to the COOH terminus of KCNA10. This interaction was confirmed through in vitro assays, including co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a specific and significant interaction between these proteins (Tian2002Regulation). KCNA4B is a soluble protein with a conserved aldoketoreductase motif and is located on chromosome 13 (Tian2002Regulation).

The interaction between KCNA10 and KCNA4B enhances the function of KCNA10 by increasing potassium currents by approximately 2.8-fold when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. This suggests that KCNA4B acts as an accessory protein that modifies the properties of KCNA10, making the current more sensitive to activation by cAMP (Tian2002Regulation). KCNA4B does not affect the expression of other related channels, such as Kv1.3, indicating a specific interaction with KCNA10 (Tian2002Regulation). This interaction likely plays a role in modulating the activity of KCNA10 in tissues where it is highly expressed, such as the heart, muscle, kidney, small intestine, and placenta (Tian2002Regulation).
