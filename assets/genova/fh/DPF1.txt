# DPF1

## Overview
DPF1, or double PHD fingers 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the d4-family of proteins, which are involved in chromatin remodeling. The DPF1 protein functions as an adaptor protein, facilitating interactions between the NF-κB transcription factor and the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, thereby playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression (Kobayashi2017Tumor). This protein is particularly significant in the context of glioma-initiating cells, where it contributes to the maintenance of stemness, a property that is crucial for therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence in glioblastoma (Hiramatsu2017The). DPF1 is predominantly expressed in the brain and is implicated in neuronal development and cell survival, acting as a neurospecific transcription factor (Lange2008Regulation).

## Function
DPF1, a member of the d4-family proteins, plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling, which is crucial for regulating gene expression. It functions as an adaptor protein linking NF-κB with the SWI/SNF complex, a chromatin-remodeling factor involved in epigenetic regulation (Kobayashi2017Tumor). This interaction facilitates NF-κB transactivation, which is essential for gene expression related to cell growth and survival. The SWI/SNF complex, with which DPF1 interacts, is involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling, impacting various biological processes (Kobayashi2017Tumor).

In the context of glioma-initiating cells (GICs), DPF1 is involved in maintaining stemness, which is crucial for therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence in glioblastoma. DPF1, along with DPF3a, links a corepressor complex containing the nuclear receptor TLX and LSD1/RCOR2 with the SWI/SNF core complex, playing essential roles in maintaining the stem-like properties of GICs (Hiramatsu2017The). Knockdown of DPF1 reduces the sphere-forming ability and tumor-forming activity of GICs, indicating its importance in stemness maintenance (Hiramatsu2017The). DPF1 is predominantly expressed in the brain and may play a role in developing neurons through regulation of cell survival, acting as a neurospecific transcription factor (Lange2008Regulation).
