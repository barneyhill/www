# PTCH2

## Overview
PTCH2 is a gene that encodes the patched 2 protein, a transmembrane receptor involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating developmental processes and cellular differentiation. The PTCH2 protein shares structural and functional similarities with its paralog PTCH1, including the presence of a sterol-sensing domain and the ability to regulate the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) protein. PTCH2 acts as a ligand-dependent antagonist in the Hh pathway, sequestering Hh ligands and modulating pathway activity to maintain proper cellular function (Zhulyn2015Ptch2; Fleet2018The). While PTCH2 is not as critical as PTCH1, it can partially compensate for PTCH1 loss, contributing to the robustness of the Hh signaling system (Zhulyn2015Ptch2). Mutations in the PTCH2 gene have been linked to various diseases, including basal cell carcinoma and Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health (Smyth1999Isolation; Fan2008A).

## Structure
The PTCH2 protein is a transmembrane receptor involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. It consists of 1203 amino acids and is encoded by the PTCH2 gene located on chromosome 1p32.1-32.3 (Smyth1999Isolation). Structurally, PTCH2 shares significant homology with PTCH1, particularly in its transmembrane domains, which include a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) that is conserved across species and resembles those found in cholesterol transport proteins like NPC1 (Smyth1999Isolation; Fleet2018The). The protein features 12 transmembrane domains with two large extracellular loops and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Kawamura2008Two).

The CTD of PTCH2 is shorter than that of PTCH1 and lacks the PPXY motif, which is associated with protein turnover, suggesting that PTCH2 is more stable (Kawamura2008Two). PTCH2 also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms with distinct roles in Hh signaling. Some splice variants lack specific exons, such as exon 9, which is part of the SSD, and are expressed in tissues like the intestine and cerebellum (RAHNAMA2004Distinct). These structural features contribute to PTCH2's role as a potential ligand-dependent antagonist in the Hh pathway (Fleet2018The).

## Function
PTCH2 (patched 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental processes and cellular differentiation. In healthy human cells, PTCH2 functions as a receptor that regulates the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) protein, thereby controlling gene expression. PTCH2 is primarily active in the cell membrane and influences processes like tissue patterning and growth (Fleet2018The).

PTCH2 shares functional similarities with its paralog PTCH1, particularly in its role as a negative regulator of the Hh pathway. It inhibits the localization of SMO to primary cilia, which is essential for pathway activation (Zhulyn2015Ptch2). Although PTCH2 is not as critical as PTCH1, it can partially compensate for the loss of PTCH1 by regulating SMO localization and maintaining pathway activity at a lower level (Zhulyn2015Ptch2).

PTCH2 also acts as a ligand-dependent antagonist of Hh signaling, sequestering Hh ligands and limiting their activity range, rather than directly repressing SMO-dependent signaling (Fleet2018The). This modulation of Hh signaling is important for maintaining proper cellular processes and preventing excessive pathway activation, which can lead to developmental defects (Zhulyn2015Ptch2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTCH2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily through their role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. PTCH2 is considered a putative tumor suppressor gene, and mutations can contribute to the development of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma. For instance, a 2 bp deletion in PTCH2 was identified in a medulloblastoma, leading to premature truncation of the protein, while a splice donor site mutation in exon 20 was found in a BCC, suggesting a role in tumor genesis (Smyth1999Isolation).

PTCH2 mutations have also been associated with Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple BCCs and other developmental anomalies. A missense mutation (2157GRA) in exon 15 of PTCH2, resulting in an R719Q amino acid substitution, was identified in a Chinese family with NBCCS. This mutation led to a loss of function in the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, failing to suppress GLI reporter activity and not inhibiting cell proliferation (Fan2008A).

The role of PTCH2 in Gorlin syndrome, a condition related to NBCCS, is less clear. Some studies suggest PTCH2 mutations may contribute to a milder phenotype of Gorlin syndrome, but the evidence is not definitive, and the pathogenicity of PTCH2 in this context remains debated (Smith2021PTCH2; Casano2020Gorlinlike).

## Interactions
PTCH2 interacts with several proteins within the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in cellular differentiation and development. PTCH2 forms complexes with the primordial germ cell-specific protein C2EIP, which promotes PTCH2 ubiquitination and activates the Hh signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for primordial germ cell (PGC) differentiation, as C2EIP binds to PTCH2, excluding SMO and activating Hh signaling (Zuo2018Interaction).

PTCH2 also interacts with the co-receptor Gas1, which is essential for its role in PGC migration. Gas1 facilitates the binding of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) to PTCH2, leading to the dissociation of SMO and the formation of a PTCH2/Gas1/Shh complex. This interaction is crucial for the rapid de-repression of SMO and the induction of specific signaling outcomes, such as the phosphorylation of Creb and Src proteins (Kim2020Ptch2Gas1).

PTCH2 can form both homomeric and heteromeric complexes with PTCH1. These complexes exhibit synergistic activity, with PTCH2 providing cation transport that supports PTCH1's cholesterol transport activity. This interaction enhances the robustness of the Hh signaling system, particularly in conditions of PTCH1 haploinsufficiency (Timmis2023The).
