# ABITRAM

## Overview
The ABITRAM gene encodes the actin binding transcription modulator, a protein that plays a crucial role in cellular processes by interacting with actin filaments and modulating transcriptional activity. This protein is categorized as a transcription modulator due to its ability to influence gene expression by binding to actin, which is a key component of the cytoskeleton. The actin binding transcription modulator is involved in various cellular pathways, including those that regulate cell shape, motility, and division. Its function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental signals, making it a significant focus of research in understanding cellular dynamics and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
