# CSF3R

## Overview
The CSF3R gene encodes the colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R), a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in hematopoiesis, particularly in the production and maturation of neutrophils. This receptor, also known as the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), is integral to the regulation of granulopoiesis through its interaction with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Upon ligand binding, CSF3R activates several intracellular signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT, which are essential for the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neutrophil precursors (Zhang2018Gainoffunction; Triot2014Inherited). The gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can influence its function and role in disease. Mutations in CSF3R are implicated in various hematological disorders, such as chronic neutrophilic leukemia and severe congenital neutropenia, highlighting its clinical significance (Pardanani2013CSF3R; Trottier2020Heterozygous).

## Structure
The CSF3R protein, also known as the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, is a transmembrane receptor involved in neutrophil production and maturation. It is composed of several structural domains, including an extracellular region with an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, a cytokine receptor homologous (CRH) domain, and fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains. The intracellular region contains motifs known as Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3, along with four critical tyrosine residues (704, 729, 744, and 764) essential for signal transduction (Wang2020Cytokine; Park2022A).

The CSF3R gene can produce seven mRNA isoforms through alternative splicing, with Class I and Class IV isoforms being prominent in hematopoietic cells. The Class IV isoform is associated with acute myeloid leukemia and features a truncation that affects receptor internalization, leading to overexpression (Wang2020Cytokine; Park2022A).

Post-translational modifications of CSF3R include glycosylation, which plays a significant role in modulating receptor activity. Mutations such as T618I and N610H affect glycosylation sites, leading to altered receptor function and signaling (Hollander2022Mutational).

## Function
The CSF3R gene encodes the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), which is a critical component in the regulation of granulopoiesis, the process of producing granulocytes, a type of white blood cell. In healthy human cells, G-CSFR is involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow. The receptor is activated by binding to its ligand, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which triggers downstream signaling cascades involving pathways such as JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT (Zhang2018Gainoffunction; Triot2014Inherited).

These signaling pathways lead to the transcription of genes necessary for neutrophil development and function, playing a crucial role in the immune system by ensuring proper neutrophil production and function (Plo2009An). The receptor is composed of an extracellular region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, which are responsible for ligand binding, dimerization, and downstream signaling activation, respectively (Zhang2018Gainoffunction). The activation of STAT3 and STAT5 is particularly important, with STAT3 being critical for G-CSF-induced cell differentiation and STAT5 linked to the proliferation and survival signaling of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Zhang2018Gainoffunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CSF3R gene are associated with several hematological disorders. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is frequently linked to acquired activating heterozygous variants in CSF3R, with the T618I mutation being highly prevalent and specific to this condition (Pardanani2013CSF3R; Bezerra2021CSF3R). This mutation leads to constitutive activation of hematopoietic cytokine receptor signaling, which is crucial for inducing neutrophilia in CNL (Adam2022CoOccurring).

In severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), biallelic germ line hypomorphic variants in CSF3R can cause a hypoproliferative condition (Trottier2020Heterozygous). CSF3R mutations are also found in about 30% of SCN patients, often resulting in amino acid substitutions or truncations that lead to sustained activation of kinase pathways (Zhang2018CSF3R).

CSF3R mutations are implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in patients with CEBPA double mutations, where they are associated with unfavorable prognosis (Su2019CSF3R). These mutations are often found in subclones and may not act as founder mutations in primary AML but can be driver mutations in secondary AML (Zhang2018CSF3R).

Germ line CSF3R variants, such as p.Trp547*, p.Ala119Thr, and p.Pro784Thr, have been identified as risk factors for developing myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Trottier2020Heterozygous).

## Interactions
The CSF3R protein, also known as the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, engages in various interactions with proteins that are crucial for its signaling and regulatory functions. Upon binding with its ligand, CSF3, CSF3R forms a homodimeric complex, which facilitates the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK/ERK (Touw2013Scratching; Park2022A). 

CSF3R interacts with Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2), which phosphorylate the receptor, enabling the recruitment and activation of STAT proteins, including STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 (NguyenJackson2011GCSF; Park2022A). STAT3 is particularly important for granulocytic differentiation and oncogenesis in solid tumors (Park2022A).

The receptor also interacts with suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on CSF3R, mediating its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Touw2013Scratching). This interaction serves as a negative feedback mechanism to attenuate CSF3R signaling. Additionally, CSF3R is associated with proteins like Lyn, a tyrosine kinase that links to phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3) and promotes mitogenic behavior (Park2022A).

CSF3R's interaction with E6-associated protein (E6AP) leads to its ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, reducing STAT3 phosphorylation and attenuating receptor function (Park2022A). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network governing CSF3R signaling and its role in cellular processes.
