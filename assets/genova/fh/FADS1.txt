# FADS1

## Overview
FADS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme fatty acid desaturase 1, also known as delta-5 desaturase, which is a crucial component of lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a desaturase and is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) from dietary precursors. The FADS1 gene plays a significant role in the conversion of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid to arachidonic acid, a process essential for the production of biologically active lipids that influence cellular membrane composition and function. These lipids are vital for various physiological processes, including the formation of signaling molecules such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The activity of FADS1 is tightly regulated by transcription factors, and its expression is associated with several health conditions, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancer (Reynolds2018Tissue-specific; Heravi2022Fatty; Schaeffer2006Common).

## Function
The FADS1 gene encodes the enzyme delta-5 desaturase, which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) from dietary 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (Reynolds2018Tissue-specific). This enzyme is involved in the conversion of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) to arachidonic acid (ARA), a key step in the formation of ARA-containing complex lipids (Reynolds2020FADS). These LC-PUFAs are crucial components of cellular membranes, influencing membrane fluidity and protein function, and serve as precursors for signaling lipid molecules such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and endocannabinoids (Heravi2022Fatty).

FADS1 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it catalyzes the desaturation of fatty acids by introducing double bonds into carbon chains (Heravi2022Fatty). This process is essential for maintaining the balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are critical for cellular processes and have been associated with the etiology of several complex diseases, including metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases (Schaeffer2006Common). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the synthesis of biologically active lipids, such as phospholipids and signaling molecules, which are involved in various cellular processes (Reynolds2020FADS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FADS1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Variants in FADS1, such as rs174547 and rs174537, have been linked to metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). These variants influence fatty acid metabolism, leading to altered lipid profiles and increased inflammation, which are risk factors for these conditions (Žák2022FADS). The GG genotype of rs174537 is associated with higher levels of arachidonic acid and increased risk of T2DM and CAD (Žák2022FADS).

FADS1 expression is also implicated in cancer. Increased expression is associated with worse overall survival in non-brain cancers, such as renal cancers, but better survival in brain cancers like lower grade glioma and glioblastoma multiforme (Heravi2022Fatty). FADS1 is linked to tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and recurrence, particularly in non-brain cancers, and is associated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (Heravi2022Fatty). The gene's expression is correlated with TP53 mutation status, with higher levels observed when P53 is mutated (Heravi2022Fatty). These findings suggest FADS1 as a potential target for precision cancer treatment (Heravi2022Fatty).

## Interactions
FADS1, a key enzyme in lipid metabolism, is involved in the desaturation of fatty acids and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. The regulation of FADS1 expression is influenced by the transcription factor PATZ1, which binds to the rs174557 locus within the FADS1 gene. This binding is allele-specific, with a preference for the A allele, and results in the downregulation of FADS1 expression. The interaction of PATZ1 with the rs174557 locus is competitive, as it overlaps with the binding site for the transcription factors SP1 and SREBP1c. While PATZ1 acts as a suppressor, the SP1-SREBP1c complex functions as an activator, enhancing FADS1 expression (Pan2016PATZ1).

The binding of these transcription factors to the rs174557 locus affects the enhancer activity of this region, thereby modulating FADS1 expression. The competition between PATZ1 and SP1 for the GC-box element at rs174557 is crucial in determining the level of FADS1 expression. Overexpression of PATZ1 has been shown to decrease the response of certain alleles to SREBP1c, highlighting the importance of PATZ1's binding affinity in regulating FADS1 (Pan2016PATZ1).
