# HMGN4

## Overview
HMGN4 is a gene that encodes the high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 4 protein, a member of the high mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) protein family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to bind specifically to the nucleosome core particle, which is the fundamental unit of chromatin. The HMGN4 protein plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and function, influencing gene expression and chromatin dynamics through its interaction with nucleosomes. It is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can alter its binding affinity and localization within the cell (Cherukuri2008Cell; Gerlitz2009The). HMGN4 has been implicated in several cancers, including thyroid and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its overexpression is associated with tumorigenesis and poor prognosis (Kugler2017Elevated; Nanduri2020Biological).

## Clinical Significance
Elevated expression of the HMGN4 gene is associated with thyroid tumorigenesis. Studies have shown that HMGN4 expression is increased in various types of thyroid carcinomas, including papillary, anaplastic, and follicular thyroid carcinomas. This overexpression leads to the downregulation of several tumor suppressor genes, such as ATM, ATRX, and BRCA2, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and DNA repair. The downregulation of these genes results in increased genomic and chromosomal instability, contributing to cancer development (Kugler2017Elevated).

In transgenic mice models, HMGN4 overexpression has been linked to increased DNA damage and a higher incidence of thyroid tumors, suggesting its role in promoting tumorigenesis by impairing DNA repair mechanisms (Kugler2017Elevated). Additionally, HMGN4 has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma, where its elevated levels are associated with high-grade tumors and shorter overall survival, indicating its potential as a biomarker for poor prognosis (Nanduri2020Biological).

HMGN4's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in gastric cancer, where its expression correlates with immune infiltration and tumor immune escape, suggesting a role in antitumor immunity (Wu2022Expression).

## Interactions
HMGN4 is a member of the high mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) protein family, which specifically binds to the nucleosome core particle, the fundamental unit of chromatin. This interaction is mediated by a conserved nucleosome-binding domain (NBD) that includes an essential 8 amino acid motif (RRSARLSA) necessary for specific binding. The C-terminal region of HMGN proteins also contributes to binding affinity, as truncation of this region results in weaker binding (Gerlitz2009The).

HMGN proteins, including HMGN4, can form homodimeric complexes with nucleosomes, such as two HMGN1 or two HMGN2 molecules, but do not form mixed complexes. This suggests that each HMGN variant may induce unique structural modifications in nucleosome core particles (Gerlitz2009The). In living cells, HMGN proteins bind to nucleosomes with similar affinities, but their interactions are variant-specific (Gerlitz2009The).

Phosphorylation of HMGN proteins, particularly during mitosis, affects their binding to chromatin. Phosphorylation within the NBD significantly impacts chromatin interactions, leading to weaker and non-specific binding in mitotic chromatin compared to interphase chromatin (Cherukuri2008Cell; Gerlitz2009The). When specific binding to nucleosomes is disrupted, HMGNs mislocalize to the nucleolus, indicating the importance of high-affinity interactions for proper localization (Gerlitz2009The).
