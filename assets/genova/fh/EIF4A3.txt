# EIF4A3

## Overview
EIF4A3 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in mRNA processing, particularly as a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC), which is crucial for post-splicing mRNA regulation, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and mRNA localization (Linder2011From; CHAN2004eIF4A3). EIF4A3 functions as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, facilitating the remodeling of RNA structures and interactions necessary for efficient mRNA metabolism (Ye2021Eukaryotic). The protein's involvement extends to the regulation of autophagy and cell cycle processes, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Sakellariou2021eIF4A3; Mazloomian2019Pharmacological). Clinically, EIF4A3 is implicated in various cancers and developmental disorders, underscoring its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Yan2023Identification; Hir2015The).

## Structure
The EIF4A3 protein is a member of the DEAD-box protein family, characterized by its ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity. It consists of 411 amino acids and includes several key motifs: a DEAD-box motif at positions 187-190, a Q motif at positions 38-60, an ATP-dependent helicase motif between amino acids 69-239, and a C-terminal helicase motif between amino acids 250-411 (Ye2021Eukaryotic). The protein structure includes two globular domains connected by a linker, referred to as the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD), which are critical for its function (Budiman2011Identification). These domains facilitate RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis, essential for its role in mRNA processing (Ye2021Eukaryotic).

EIF4A3 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation at threonine 163 by cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1 and CDK2. This phosphorylation affects its interaction with other proteins and its role in exon junction complex (EJC) assembly and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Ryu2019eIF4A3). The phosphorylation state influences the protein's conformation, switching between open and closed states, which impacts its RNA-binding ability (Ryu2019eIF4A3). The protein's interaction with SECIS elements is also significant, where it binds to specific regions, stabilizing the structure of these elements (Budiman2011Identification).

## Function
EIF4A3, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, plays a critical role in mRNA processing and regulation in human cells. It is a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC), which is deposited on mRNA during splicing and remains bound to the spliced RNA, influencing several RNA metabolic processes, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), translation, and RNA localization (Linder2011From; CHAN2004eIF4A3). EIF4A3 functions as an ATP-dependent RNA clamp, binding RNA in an ATP-dependent manner and serving as a platform for EJC assembly (Linder2011From).

In the context of autophagy, EIF4A3 acts as an inhibitor of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Its depletion leads to increased autophagic flux, as evidenced by increased levels of lipidated LC3B and reduced levels of the autophagic cargo protein p62 (Sakellariou2021eIF4A3). EIF4A3 also regulates the transcriptional response mediated by the transcription factor TFEB, influencing TFEB's phosphorylation state and intracellular localization, which is crucial for autophagy regulation (Sakellariou2021eIF4A3).

EIF4A3 is involved in cell cycle regulation and stress response, with its inhibition leading to cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. It also plays a role in RNA stress granule formation, which is important for cellular stress responses (Mazloomian2019Pharmacological).

## Clinical Significance
EIF4A3 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in mRNA splicing and translation initiation. Overexpression of EIF4A3 is associated with poor prognosis in several malignancies, including bladder cancer, glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Yan2023Identification; Wei2023Eukaryotic; BlázquezEncinas2023The; Lin2020Comprehensive). In glioblastoma, EIF4A3 stabilizes non-coding RNAs like LINC00680 and TTN-AS1, promoting tumor growth and invasion (Tang2020LINC00680). In pancreatic cancer, EIF4A3 influences alternative splicing, affecting genes related to RNA translation and apoptosis (BlázquezEncinas2023The).

EIF4A3 is also linked to immune response modulation in cancer, affecting immune cell infiltration and response to immunotherapy (Yan2023Identification). In acute myeloid leukemia, high EIF4A3 expression correlates with disease progression, and its inhibition induces leukemic cell death, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Miliara2023The).

Beyond cancer, EIF4A3 mutations are associated with intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders, such as Richieri-Costa-Pereira syndrome, which involves craniofacial abnormalities and limb defects (Hir2015The). These findings highlight EIF4A3's clinical significance in both oncological and non-oncological conditions.

## Interactions
EIF4A3, a component of the exon junction complex (EJC), engages in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that binds to spliced mRNAs, specifically 20-24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions, forming a stable complex with other EJC components such as MAGOH, Y14, and MLN51 (Bono2006The; Andersen2006Structure). These interactions stabilize EIF4A3 in an RNA-bound conformation, inhibiting its ATPase activity and contributing to the stability of the EJC (Bono2006The; Andersen2006Structure).

EIF4A3 also interacts with the mRNA export factors TAP and Aly/REF, suggesting a role in nuclear mRNA export (CHAN2004eIF4A3). It binds to SECIS elements in the 3' untranslated region of non-essential selenoprotein mRNAs, acting as a translational repressor during selenium deficiency by preventing the incorporation of selenocysteine (Budiman2011Identification).

The protein's interaction with RNA involves binding to the sugar-phosphate backbone of nucleotides, with specific contacts made through its helicase motifs (Andersen2006Structure). EIF4A3's interactions with other EJC components, such as MAGOH and Y14, are crucial for its function in mRNA processing and nonsense-mediated decay (Zhang2007Splicing; Bono2006The).
