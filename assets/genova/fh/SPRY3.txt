# SPRY3

## Overview
SPRY3 is a gene that encodes the protein sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 3, which is a crucial regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. This protein functions primarily as a negative regulator, modulating pathways such as the MAPK/ERK pathway to maintain cellular homeostasis and control processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Ning2015Regulation). The sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 3 is categorized as a signaling modulator and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it prevents excessive signaling that could lead to abnormal cellular behaviors (Ning2015Regulation). The expression of SPRY3 is observed in various tissues, including the nervous system, where it plays a role in neural development and connectivity (Ning2015Regulation). The gene's expression is tightly regulated by complex transcriptional mechanisms, ensuring its activity is appropriately modulated across different cellular contexts (Ning2015Regulation). The clinical significance of SPRY3 is underscored by its involvement in conditions such as autism and certain cancers, where its dysregulation can contribute to disease pathogenesis (Ning2015Regulation; CelikSelvi2019Sprouty3).

## Function
The SPRY3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways, particularly the MAPK/ERK pathway. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Ning2015Regulation). In healthy human cells, SPRY3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a role in inhibiting excessive signaling that could lead to abnormal cellular growth or differentiation (Ning2015Regulation).

SPRY3 is expressed in various tissues, including the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it is involved in regulating neurite growth and branching. This function is particularly evident in cerebellar Purkinje cells and other ganglion cells, where SPRY3 helps maintain proper neural connectivity and function (Ning2015Regulation). The gene's expression is tightly regulated by complex transcriptional mechanisms, including X-linked and pseudoautosomal promoters, which ensure its activity is appropriately modulated in different cellular contexts (Ning2015Regulation).

Overall, SPRY3's role in RTK signaling inhibition is essential for normal cellular and tissue development, preventing conditions such as hyperplasia or inappropriate cell death due to unregulated growth factor signaling (Ning2015Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
The SPRY3 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in regulating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Alterations in SPRY3 expression have been associated with autism susceptibility. The gene is located in a region linked to autism, and its expression pattern coincides with Purkinje cell loss observed in autism, suggesting it may be a candidate susceptibility locus for the disorder (Ning2015Regulation). Although no direct genetic associations with autism have been confirmed, the regulation of SPRY3 and its interaction with other genes like TMLHE, which is involved in carnitine biosynthesis, may influence autism risk (Ning2015Regulation).

In cancer, SPRY3 has been shown to have a tumor-promoting role in glioblastoma and osteosarcoma. In glioblastoma-derived cell lines, elevated levels of SPRY3 promote tumor growth and migration, while its repression leads to reduced proliferation and migration rates (CelikSelvi2019Sprouty3). Similarly, in osteosarcoma cells, SPRY3 expression enhances cell proliferation and migration, contributing to the malignant potential of these cells (Kamptner2021Sprouty3). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SPRY3 in both developmental disorders and cancer progression.

## Interactions
SPRY3, a member of the Sprouty family, is involved in modulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. It interacts with various proteins that play crucial roles in signal transduction. One of the key interactions of SPRY3 is with the E3-ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, which is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of RTKs. This interaction suggests that SPRY3 may influence receptor degradation processes, potentially affecting the intensity and duration of signaling pathways (Kamptner2021Sprouty3; CelikSelvi2019Sprouty3).

SPRY3 is also known to interact with proteins involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. It enhances the amplitude of ERK phosphorylation, a critical component of the MAPK pathway, in response to external stimuli such as serum. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, as it contributes to increased cell proliferation and migration, particularly in osteosarcoma and glioblastoma cells (Kamptner2021Sprouty3; CelikSelvi2019Sprouty3).

Additionally, SPRY3 may form inactive heterodimers with other Sprouty proteins, such as Spry2, which has tumor-suppressing activity. This interaction could modulate the overall activity of Sprouty proteins in various cellular contexts (Kamptner2021Sprouty3).
