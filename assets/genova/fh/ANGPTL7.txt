# ANGPTL7

## Overview
ANGPTL7, or angiopoietin-like 7, is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein belonging to the angiopoietin-like protein family. This protein is characterized by an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, which are integral to its function in protein-protein interactions and receptor binding, respectively (Guan2010Identification; Liu2021Angiopoietinlike). Unlike other angiopoietins, ANGPTL7 does not bind to TIE receptors, which distinguishes its functional pathways (Xia2020Cord). The protein is primarily expressed in ocular tissues, such as the cornea and trabecular meshwork, where it plays a critical role in maintaining intraocular pressure (IOP) and extracellular matrix remodeling (Praveen2022ANGPTL7). Beyond its ocular functions, ANGPTL7 is implicated in metabolic processes, including insulin resistance, and is associated with conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (Xu2020Angptl7). Its involvement in angiogenesis and potential roles in cancer and metabolic diseases underscore its significance in both cellular and systemic physiology (Parri2014Angiopoietinlike).

## Structure
ANGPTL7 is a protein characterized by an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, which are common features of the angiopoietin-like protein family (Guan2010Identification; Liu2021Angiopoietinlike). The coiled-coil domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, forming disulfide-linked homotrimers and tetramers, which are crucial for its biological function (Yang2021Emerging; Parri2014Angiopoietinlike). The fibrinogen-like domain is considered the receptor-binding domain, although ANGPTL7 does not bind to the TIE receptors, distinguishing it from angiopoietins (Xia2020Cord; Guan2010Identification).

ANGPTL7 is secreted as a glycoprotein, indicating that it undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Yang2021Emerging). The protein is also associated with exosomes, suggesting a role in intercellular communication (Parri2014Angiopoietinlike). ANGPTL7's expression is influenced by hypoxic conditions, which are common in tumor environments, although it lacks canonical hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) binding sites in its promoter (Parri2014Angiopoietinlike). The protein's structure and modifications contribute to its roles in angiogenesis and potential involvement in cancer and metabolic diseases.

## Function
ANGPTL7 (angiopoietin-like 7) is a secreted glycoprotein involved in several biological processes, including angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. In healthy human cells, ANGPTL7 is primarily expressed in the cornea and trabecular meshwork of the eye, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining intraocular pressure (IOP) (Praveen2022ANGPTL7). The protein is known to form homo-oligomers and is highly expressed in the juxtacanalicular tissue, which is essential for IOP regulation (Praveen2022ANGPTL7).

ANGPTL7 is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, influencing cell adhesion and migration. It affects the deposition of the extracellular matrix in trabecular meshwork cells, which is significant for IOP homeostasis (Praveen2022ANGPTL7). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of actin network cross-linking and tissue permeability, contributing to its role in maintaining the structural integrity of ocular tissues (Sun2022A).

In addition to its ocular functions, ANGPTL7 has been associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus through the upregulation of SOCS3, which affects AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating its involvement in metabolic regulation (Xu2020Angptl7). These diverse roles highlight ANGPTL7's importance in both cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ANGPTL7 gene have been linked to glaucoma, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Elevated levels of ANGPTL7 protein are associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP), a major risk factor for glaucoma. Studies have shown that excessive ANGPTL7 can elevate IOP to pathological levels, suggesting its role in the disease's progression (Praveen2021Genetic). Genetic association analyses have identified rare missense and predicted loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL7, such as Gln175His, Arg177*, and Trp188*, which are linked to decreased IOP and a reduced risk of glaucoma. These variants are associated with a loss of protein function, potentially offering protection against the disease (Praveen2021Genetic).

ANGPTL7 is expressed in the cornea and trabecular meshwork, areas critical for IOP regulation. Its expression is upregulated by TGF-beta, a factor involved in extracellular matrix modulation and IOP increase (Praveen2021Genetic). The therapeutic knockdown of ANGPTL7 has been proposed as a novel mechanism to lower IOP, potentially intervening in the disease process of glaucoma by addressing pathophysiological changes at the trabecular meshwork level (Praveen2021Genetic).

## Interactions
ANGPTL7 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various signaling pathways. It has been shown to impair the IRS1-Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for insulin signaling. Overexpression of ANGPTL7 decreases the expression of INSR and IRS1 and reduces the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1, leading to insulin resistance. This process involves the upregulation of SOCS3, a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, which promotes IRS1 degradation. Knocking down SOCS3 blocks ANGPTL7-induced IRS1 degradation, indicating a significant interaction between ANGPTL7 and SOCS3 in this pathway (Xu2020Angptl7).

ANGPTL7 also activates several signaling pathways in endothelial cells, including ERK1/2, Akt, and FAK, which are involved in cell proliferation, survival, and motility. This activation is confirmed through Western blot analysis, showing that ANGPTL7 stimulates the phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, and FAK kinases (Parri2014Angiopoietinlike). These interactions suggest that ANGPTL7 plays a role in promoting angiogenesis, particularly in cancer-related contexts, by enhancing the motility, invasiveness, and proliferation of endothelial cells (Parri2014Angiopoietinlike).
