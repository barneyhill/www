# AOC2

## Overview
AOC2, or amine oxidase copper containing 2, is a gene that encodes a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) protein, which is primarily expressed in the human retina. This enzyme is part of the copper-containing amine oxidase family and is involved in the oxidative deamination of primary amines, leading to the production of aldehydes, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia. These products are implicated in various cellular processes, particularly within the ocular environment (Finney2014Human; Kaitaniemi2009The). The AOC2 protein is characterized by a trimeric quaternary structure and a unique substrate specificity, favoring larger monoamines such as 2-phenylethylamine, tryptamine, and p-tyramine, distinguishing it from its homolog AOC3 (Hofmann2006The; Kaitaniemi2009The). While the physiological role of AOC2 in human health is not fully understood, its expression pattern and enzymatic activity suggest a specialized function in retinal amine metabolism and cellular signaling (Kaitaniemi2009The).

## Structure
The AOC2 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism, provides insights into the structure of the human AOC2 protein. AOC2 forms a trimeric quaternary structure, with monomers arranged such that their barrel axes are tilted approximately 30 degrees with respect to the trimer axis. This trimerization buries about 2000 Å² of the barrel surface, and the residues involved are highly conserved among known AOCs (Hofmann2006The). The tertiary structure is characterized by an eight-stranded strictly antiparallel β-barrel, a feature of the lipocalin superfamily, forming a hydrophobic cavity for binding small lipophilic compounds (Hofmann2006The). 

In humans, AOC2 is a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) with a unique substrate specificity, favoring larger monoamines like 2-phenylethylamine, tryptamine, and p-tyramine (Kaitaniemi2009The). The protein shares significant sequence similarity with AOC3, suggesting a possible evolutionary link, and contains conserved copper-binding and active sites (Zhang2003Characterization). The primary structure includes a sequence of 757 amino acids in mice, with a similar length in humans, and features a predicted membrane-spanning domain at the N-terminal (Zhang2003Characterization). Glycosylation sites are present, particularly at the N-terminal before the active site (Zhang2003Characterization).

## Function
AOC2, or amine oxidase copper containing 2, is a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) primarily active in the retina, where it plays a significant role in the oxidative deamination of primary amines. This enzymatic activity results in the production of aldehydes, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia, which are involved in various cellular processes (Finney2014Human; Kaitaniemi2009The). AOC2 exhibits a unique substrate specificity, favoring larger monoamines such as 2-phenylethylamine, tryptamine, and p-tyramine, unlike its homolog AOC3, which prefers methylamine and benzylamine (Finney2014Human; Kaitaniemi2009The).

The enzyme's activity is predominantly detected in the retina, suggesting its critical role in ocular health and potentially in the metabolism of specific amines within the eye (Kaitaniemi2009The). AOC2's larger active site, compared to AOC3, allows it to accommodate these larger substrates, which may be crucial for its function in the retina (Kaitaniemi2009The). While AOC2 mRNA is expressed in various tissues, its enzymatic activity outside the eye is minimal, indicating a specialized function in the retina (Finney2014Human). The exact physiological role of AOC2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its substrate specificity and expression pattern suggest a role in amine metabolism and cellular signaling (Kaitaniemi2009The).

## Interactions
The human AOC2 protein, a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase, has been studied for its potential interactions with other proteins, particularly AOC3. AOC2 is expressed at the mRNA level in various human tissues, with notable enzymatic activity in the retina. Research suggests that AOC2 may form heterodimers with AOC3, which typically exists as a homodimer on the cell surface. Structural modeling indicates that heterodimerization is possible, with only 44 residues differing in the heterodimer interface compared to homodimers. These differences are mainly located in the central cavity between the catalytic domains and the arm extending from one monomer to the substrate cavity of the other (Kaitaniemi2009The).

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments conducted in HEK293 cells transfected with tagged AOC2 and AOC3 cDNAs support the possibility of AOC2 interacting with AOC3. These experiments involved the use of anti-flag and anti-myc antibodies to detect interactions, suggesting that AOC2 may physically interact with AOC3, potentially affecting their cell surface expression and function (Kaitaniemi2009The). However, there is no specific evidence of AOC2 interacting with nucleic acids or forming complexes with other proteins beyond AOC3.
