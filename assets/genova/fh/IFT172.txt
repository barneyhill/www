# IFT172

## Overview
IFT172 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 172 protein, a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-B complex. This protein is integral to the assembly and maintenance of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling and sensory functions in eukaryotic cells. The IFT172 protein is characterized by its large size and complex structure, featuring multiple domains that facilitate interactions with other proteins and membrane surfaces. These interactions are vital for the bidirectional transport of molecular cargo along the ciliary axoneme, a process necessary for cilium assembly and function. IFT172 plays a significant role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for neurodevelopmental processes. Mutations in the IFT172 gene are linked to various ciliopathies and developmental disorders, highlighting its critical role in embryonic development and organ function (Pruski2019Roles; Zheng2023Primary; Wang2018Membrane).

## Structure
IFT172 is a large protein with a molecular weight of approximately 200 kDa, making it the largest subunit of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, specifically part of the IFT-B2 complex (Zheng2023Primary; Wang2018Membrane). The primary structure of IFT172 includes 1,755 amino acids encoded by a gene consisting of 15 exons in Chlamydomonas (Zheng2023Primary). The protein's secondary structure features seven WD repeats and seven WAA repeats at the amino terminus, which are homologous to tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) and are predicted to form an α-helix secondary structure (Zheng2023Primary).

The tertiary structure of IFT172 is characterized by two N-terminal β-propeller domains followed by a long α-solenoid region, which is structurally similar to coatomer proteins like COP-I, II, and clathrin (Taschner2012Architecture; Wang2018Membrane). The quaternary structure involves its incorporation into the IFT-B complex through interactions with other proteins, such as the CH-domain of IFT57, forming a salt-labile interaction (Petriman2022Biochemically).

IFT172 can exist in distinct open and closed conformations, influenced by lipids or detergents, with the open conformation featuring two spherical domains and a rod-shaped protrusion (Zheng2023Primary; Wang2018Membrane). The protein's interaction with membranes is facilitated by its β-propeller domains, which have a negatively charged surface, allowing it to remodel membrane surfaces (Wang2018Membrane).

## Function
IFT172 is a critical component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically part of the IFT-B complex, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of primary cilia in eukaryotic cells. This protein plays a significant role in the anterograde transport process, moving materials from the base to the tip of the cilium, which is crucial for cilium assembly and elongation (Zheng2023Primary). IFT172 interacts with other proteins such as IFT57, IFT20, Cluap1, and IFT80, maintaining the structural integrity of the IFT complex (Katoh2016Overall).

In healthy human cells, IFT172 is involved in the bidirectional transport of various cargo, including tubulin proteins and receptor molecules, along the ciliary axoneme. This transport is necessary for the structural and functional integrity of cilia, which act as signaling hubs in cells, translating extracellular cues into intracellular signals essential for embryonic development and organ function (Pruski2019Roles). IFT172 is also necessary for the normal activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for neurodevelopmental processes (Zheng2023Primary). Dysfunction in IFT172 can lead to defects in cilium formation and function, affecting cellular signaling and sensory functions (Zheng2023Primary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT172 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies and developmental disorders. These include skeletal ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome, Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, and Sensenbrenner syndrome, which are characterized by abnormalities in the chest, long bones, kidneys, liver, and retina (Zheng2023Primary). IFT172 mutations are also linked to retinal degeneration, specifically nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa or rod-cone dystrophy, and growth hormone deficiency (Zheng2023Primary). In animal models, IFT172 deficiency results in severe developmental issues, including neural tube defects and craniofacial abnormalities, suggesting its critical role in embryonic development (Yang2015Cilia).

In humans, IFT172 mutations have been identified in Jeune syndrome (asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy) and Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, with affected individuals displaying skeletal abnormalities, nephronophthisis, and liver and eye involvement (Halbritter2013Defects). These mutations can lead to a complex phenotype with extraskeletal involvement, including obesity and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (Halbritter2013Defects). Additionally, IFT172 mutations have been implicated in Bardet-Biedl syndrome, characterized by retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, obesity, and kidney dysfunction (Schaefer2016Identification). The gene's role in ciliary function and Hedgehog signaling pathways suggests its involvement in various neuropsychiatric conditions, although further studies are needed to confirm these associations (Zheng2023Primary).

## Interactions
IFT172 is a key component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically part of the IFT-B2 complex. It interacts with several other proteins within this complex, including IFT80, IFT57, IFT54, IFT38, and IFT20, forming a stable hexameric assembly (Taschner2016Intraflagellar). IFT172 directly interacts with IFT57, facilitated by the calponin homology (CH) domain of IFT57, which is crucial for the structural assembly of the IFT-B2 complex (Taschner2016Intraflagellar; Wang2018Membrane).

IFT172 also exhibits interactions with membrane surfaces, primarily through its N-terminal β-propeller domains. This interaction is competitive with IFT57, as the presence of IFT57 reduces IFT172's membrane binding, indicating mutually exclusive interactions (Wang2018Membrane). The protein can adopt different conformations, influenced by its interactions with lipids or other proteins, which are essential for its function in ciliogenesis and membrane remodeling (Wang2018Membrane).

IFT172's role extends to the switch between anterograde and retrograde IFT at the ciliary tip, where it is necessary for the turnaround of IFT trains, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Wang2018Membrane).
