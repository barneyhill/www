# NCOA7

## Overview
NCOA7, or nuclear receptor coactivator 7, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the TLDc protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of lysosomal homeostasis and neurodevelopmental processes. The NCOA7 protein contains a TLDc domain, which is crucial for its interaction with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, a multi-subunit enzyme responsible for proton transport across cellular membranes. This interaction is essential for maintaining the optimal pH within lysosomes, thereby facilitating the degradation of macromolecules. NCOA7 is expressed in various neuroanatomical regions, including the amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, and cortical areas, where it influences dendritic outgrowth and synaptic connectivity. The protein's role in neurodevelopment and its involvement in the kynurenine pathway, through interaction with 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, underscore its significance in both cellular homeostasis and behavior (Castroflorio2020The; Gargaro2019Engagement).

## Structure
The NCOA7 protein is part of the TLDc protein family, which includes a TLDc domain known for its role in oxidative stress protection and interaction with the vacuolar proton pump V-ATPase (ArnaudArnould2021Crystal). The TLDc domain of NCOA7-AS, a splice variant of NCOA7, has been structurally characterized. It consists of 219 amino acids, with the TLDc domain spanning residues 54-219. This domain is globular, featuring two alpha-helices and ten beta-strands that form two antiparallel beta-sheets, creating a pseudo-orthogonal beta-sandwich structure (ArnaudArnould2021Crystal). The TLDc domain shares 62% sequence identity with its zebrafish counterpart, indicating a conserved structure across species (ArnaudArnould2021Crystal).

NCOA7 interacts with the V-ATPase complex, particularly binding to the V1 domain subunits, which is crucial for the assembly and function of the V-ATPase in the brain (Castroflorio2020The). The protein is cytoplasmic and membrane-associated, interacting with phosphoinositides important for V-ATPase functionality (Castroflorio2020The). NCOA7 also exists in multiple isoforms, including a shorter version containing only the TLDc domain, which is involved in neurodevelopmental processes (Castroflorio2020The).

## Function
NCOA7 (nuclear receptor coactivator 7) plays a crucial role in maintaining lysosomal homeostasis in the brain by regulating the formation and function of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. It binds to the cytoplasmic V1 domain of V-ATPase, modulating its assembly and functionality, which is essential for maintaining the optimal pH within lysosomes. This pH regulation is necessary for the proper functioning of enzymes that degrade macromolecules from endocytic and autophagic pathways (Castroflorio2020The).

NCOA7 is also involved in neurodevelopmental processes, influencing dendritic outgrowth and the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain, which are crucial for social motivation and behavior. It is expressed in key neuroanatomical regions such as the amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, and cortical areas (Castroflorio2020The).

Additionally, NCOA7 interacts with specific phosphoinositides involved in vesicle trafficking and endolysosomal homeostasis, suggesting a membrane-associated role for the protein. This interaction is important for the recruitment of V-ATPase to the membrane, emphasizing its role in cellular homeostasis and neurodevelopment (Castroflorio2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NCOA7 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the kidney, NCOA7 is crucial for the proper function of the vacuolar proton pumping ATPase (V-ATPase), which is essential for urine acidification. Targeted deletion of the NCOA7 gene in mice results in incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), characterized by high urine pH and hypobicarbonatemia, suggesting that mutations in NCOA7 could contribute to dRTA in humans (Merkulova2018Targeted).

In the brain, NCOA7 is involved in neurodevelopment and synaptic connectivity. Its absence leads to increased proximal neurites and reduced inhibitory synaptic contacts, which can be rescued by exogenous NCOA7 expression. This indicates that NCOA7 is important for maintaining inhibitory synapse density and interneuron populations. Mutations in NCOA7 have been associated with autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Castroflorio2020The).

The gene's interaction with V-ATPase is also significant for lysosomal function, and its deletion can lead to lysosomal dysfunction, potentially affecting neuronal patterning and behavior (Castroflorio2020The). These findings suggest that NCOA7 is critical for both renal and neurological health.

## Interactions
NCOA7 (nuclear receptor coactivator 7) is known to interact with the vacuolar proton pump V-ATPase, a multi-subunit complex essential for ATP hydrolysis and proton pumping across membranes. This interaction is mediated through the TLDc domain of NCOA7, which is necessary and sufficient for binding to V-ATPase. Specific amino acid residues within the TLDc domain, such as G815, G845, and G896, are critical for this interaction, as mutations at these sites abolish binding (Eaton2021The). NCOA7 interacts specifically with the cytosolic V1 subunits of V-ATPase, including ATP6V1B2, ATP6V1A(1), and ATP6V1C, but not with the integral membrane V0 subunits (Castroflorio2020The).

NCOA7 also interacts with 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), a metabolite in the kynurenine pathway, enhancing the activation of the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) in dendritic cells. This interaction promotes AhR-dependent gene transcription and the induction of regulatory T cells (Gargaro2019Engagement). Additionally, NCOA7 is involved in the regulation of lysosomal function, where its interaction with V-ATPase is crucial for maintaining lysosomal pH and enzyme activity (Castroflorio2020The).
