# POLR2G

## Overview
POLR2G is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase II subunit G, a critical component of the RNA polymerase II complex, which is essential for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. This subunit plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase II complex, thereby influencing gene expression regulation. The protein encoded by POLR2G is categorized as a transcription factor subunit and is active in the cell nucleus, where it contributes to various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals (Muste2023Deregulations). POLR2G's interactions with other subunits and its involvement in transcriptional regulation underscore its importance in maintaining transcriptional homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Carré2011Human; Hart2023miR34a5p).

## Structure


## Function
POLR2G encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. This subunit is involved in the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase II complex, playing a significant role in gene expression regulation. POLR2G is active in the cell nucleus, where transcription occurs, contributing to various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals (Muste2023Deregulations).

In healthy human cells, POLR2G is part of the transcription machinery that regulates a wide range of gene expression processes, including transcription, mRNA export and decay, and translation (You2021Comprehensive). It interacts with other subunits of RNA polymerase II, such as RPB7, and is involved in the nuclear import of the polymerase complex, which is essential for the transcription of messenger RNAs and several noncoding genes (Carré2011Human).

The regulation of POLR2G and its associated complexes is vital for maintaining transcriptional homeostasis. Disruptions in its function can lead to various cellular and organismal outcomes, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function and development (Luo2024ARMC5).

## Clinical Significance
The POLR2G gene, encoding a subunit of RNA polymerase II, plays a significant role in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), head and neck carcinomas, and colorectal cancer. Its expression is often upregulated in these cancers, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis or cancer progression (Muste2023Deregulations). In HCC, the role of POLR2G is controversial. While some studies identify it as a protective factor associated with better prognosis and overall survival, others find it highly expressed in cancer stem cells, which are linked to treatment resistance and tumor aggressiveness (Muste2023Deregulations).

Alterations in POLR2G expression are associated with cancer stem cell characteristics, contributing to tumor heterogeneity and resistance to treatment. Increased expression of POLR2G has been linked to higher tumor grades and nodal metastasis status, indicating tumor progression and aggressiveness (Muste2023Deregulations). These findings suggest that while POLR2G may have protective roles in certain contexts, its upregulation in cancer stem cells could contribute to adverse clinical outcomes.

The regulation of POLR2G, along with other RNA polymerase II subunits, is crucial for normal cellular function and development. Disruptions in its expression or interactions may lead to pathological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer biology (Muste2023Deregulations).

## Interactions
POLR2G, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, is involved in various interactions crucial for transcription processes. It is part of the 12-subunit RNA polymerase II complex, which is essential for mRNA synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Within this complex, POLR2G interacts with other subunits to maintain the structural integrity and functionality of the polymerase (Luo2024ARMC5).

In the context of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), POLR2G has been identified as a key gene with altered expression in GDM placenta tissues, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. This highlights its potential role in transcriptional regulation under specific physiological conditions (Zhang2018Comprehensive).

POLR2G is also a direct target of miR-34a-5p, a microRNA implicated in Huntington's Disease (HD). The interaction between miR-34a-5p and POLR2G suggests a regulatory mechanism at the protein level, potentially affecting transcriptional processes in HD (Hart2023miR34a5p).

Additionally, POLR2G is part of a protein-protein interaction network identified in studies of prostate cancer cells, indicating its involvement in cellular processes related to proliferation and stress response (Félix2018Functional). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of POLR2G in various biological contexts.
