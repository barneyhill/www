# POTEI

## Overview
POTEI is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member I, which is part of the POTE gene family. This family is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains, structural motifs that suggest a role in protein-protein interactions and cytoskeletal functions. The POTEI protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including cytoskeleton reorganization and response to stimuli, and is expressed in tissues such as the prostate, ovary, testis, and placenta. It has been associated with signaling pathways and is involved in specific cancer types, indicating its potential role in oncogenesis and cellular signaling (Wang2009Discovery; Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Additionally, POTEI has been linked to processes such as endothelial mesenchymal transition and has shown altered expression in response to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Feng2022Screening; Stasiak2017Differential). Despite these associations, the precise molecular functions of POTEI remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its roles in cellular biology and disease contexts (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

## Structure
The POTEI protein is a member of the POTE gene family, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats, coiled-coil domains, and a β-actin retrogene insertion. These structural features are common among POTE family members and contribute to their role in protein-protein and cell membrane interactions (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The POTEI gene contains 11 exons and is part of group III in the phylogenetic classification of POTE genes (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). 

The molecular structure of POTEI includes a full-length long inverted repeat (LIR) sequence and a β-actin retrogene insertion, which is in-frame in some cases, resulting in an actin module within the protein (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The presence of cysteine and ankyrin repeats, along with coiled-coil domains, suggests a complex tertiary structure that facilitates interactions with other proteins (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). 

POTEI, like other POTE proteins, is involved in signaling pathways and is expressed in specific tissues and cancer types, indicating potential post-translational modifications that may affect its function and localization (Wang2009Discovery). The evolutionary dynamics of POTEI, including duplication events, have contributed to its current structure and function (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

## Function
The POTEI gene is part of the POTE gene family, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains. These structural features suggest that POTEI proteins may be involved in cytoskeletal functions or protein-protein interactions, potentially playing a role in maintaining cell structure or participating in signaling pathways (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The POTEI protein is expressed in various tissues, including the prostate, ovary, testis, and placenta, indicating its involvement in normal cellular functions (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). 

The presence of a β-actin retrogene insertion in some POTE proteins, including POTEI, suggests a possible role in actin-related functions, which could affect cell motility or stability (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Additionally, POTEI contains a full-length LIR sequence, which might be involved in autophagy-related processes, although the exact molecular processes and organismal outcomes remain to be fully elucidated (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Despite these insights, specific details about the molecular activities of POTEI in healthy human cells are not fully understood, and further research is needed to clarify its precise functions and roles in cellular biology (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
POTEI, a member of the POTE ankyrin domain family, is involved in various protein interactions that play roles in cellular processes such as cytoskeleton reorganization and response to stimuli. Proteomic analysis has shown that POTEI is upregulated in response to TGF-β1 treatment, indicating its involvement in endothelial mesenchymal transition (EndMT). In this context, POTEI interacts with proteins like DBNL and MYO1D, which are associated with fibrosis, cancerogenesis, and cell migration (Stasiak2017Differential).

POTEI has also been identified in studies related to SARS-CoV-2, where it was found to be significantly reduced in individuals infected with the virus. This suggests a potential interaction or regulatory role in the context of viral infection (Feng2022Screening). Additionally, POTEI is connected to a significant number of validated nodes in a protein interaction network related to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential relevance in understanding the virus's pathogenicity (Guo2021Integrative).

In the context of human temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, POTEI is associated with cellular components like extracellular vesicles and organelles, although specific interactions in this setting are not detailed (Valmiki2020Phosphoproteomic).
