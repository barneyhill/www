# ZNF665

## Overview
ZNF665 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 665, a member of the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger protein family, which is the most abundant group of DNA-binding motifs in humans. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in recognizing specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. ZNF665 is located on chromosome 19q and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation (Huang2015Susceptible). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of target genes, influencing cellular differentiation and development. ZNF665 is also involved in the regulation of retrotransposon expression, particularly interacting with LINE-1 elements, which suggests a role in genomic stability and cellular aging (RuizPérez2024Retrotransposon). Variations in the ZNF665 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, including type 2 diabetes and treatment resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, highlighting its potential significance in medical research (Rink2009Gene; Huang2015Susceptible).

## Function
ZNF665 is a member of the Kruppel zinc finger family, which is the most abundant group of DNA-binding motifs in humans. These proteins primarily function as transcription factors, recognizing specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. ZNF665 is located on chromosome 19q and is involved in cell growth and differentiation processes (Huang2015Susceptible). Although the specific functions of ZNF665 in healthy human cells are not fully documented, it is speculated that polymorphisms in this gene might affect its DNA binding ability, potentially impacting cell growth and differentiation. This could lead to disturbances in epithelial repair and contribute to conditions such as dry or scaly skin, as well as endothelial dysfunction, which is a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis (Huang2015Susceptible).

ZNF665, along with other KRAB zinc finger proteins, is involved in recognizing similar sequence motifs in overlapping genomic targets, including LINE1 integrants. Its expression pattern is similar to that of ZNF160 across various tissues, suggesting potential functional overlap (Thorball2020Ongoing). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with specific DNA sequences to modulate the transcription of target genes, influencing cellular processes such as differentiation and development.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF665 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in transcriptional regulation. Variations in the ZNF665 gene have been associated with increased susceptibility to high Yu-Zhi (YZ) scores in patients with type 2 diabetes, which may be linked to cardiovascular disturbances. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ZNF665, such as the AA genotype of rs1133146 and the GG genotype of rs12971799, are associated with a higher risk of these conditions (Huang2015Susceptible).

In the context of cri-du-chat syndrome, ZNF665 is part of a protein-protein interaction network involved in transcription regulation and cellular response to growth factors. Alterations in DNA methylation of ZNF665 may contribute to the phenotypic manifestations of this syndrome (Naumova2017DNA).

ZNF665 has also been identified in studies related to gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), where its expression levels were higher in patients who did not respond well to imatinib mesylate treatment. This suggests that ZNF665 could be part of a gene expression signature associated with treatment resistance (Rink2009Gene).

Additionally, ZNF665 is a predicted target of miRNA-200, which is associated with preterm birth, indicating its potential involvement in this condition (Lu2019Predicting).

## Interactions
ZNF665, a member of the Kruppel zinc finger family, is implicated in various interactions primarily through its role as a transcription factor. It is involved in recognizing DNA sequences and regulating gene expression by interacting with control regions of genes (Huang2015Susceptible). Although specific protein interactions of ZNF665 are not extensively documented, it is speculated that polymorphisms in ZNF665 may affect its DNA binding ability, potentially leading to altered gene expression and cellular processes (Huang2015Susceptible).

In the context of retrotransposon regulation, ZNF665 is noted for its potential role in recognizing transposable element (TE)-embedded sequences as genomic targets. It interacts with LINE-1/L1 family elements, suggesting a role in the regulation of retrotransposon expression during aging and regeneration processes (RuizPérez2024Retrotransposon). This interaction may involve the modulation of methylation levels at KZFP binding sites within LINE-1/TE promoters, influencing the repressive potential of KZFPs over TEs (RuizPérez2024Retrotransposon).

In gain-of-function mutant p53 tumors, ZNF665 is among the upregulated genes with increased chromatin accessibility, indicating a possible interaction with chromatin and transcription regulatory networks (Dhaka2021Differential). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving ZNF665 in this context are not detailed.
