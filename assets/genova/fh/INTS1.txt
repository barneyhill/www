# INTS1

## Overview
INTS1 is a gene that encodes the protein integrator complex subunit 1, a critical component of the Integrator complex. This complex is involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription, particularly in the processing and integration of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Xu2024Comprehensive; Zheng2020Identification). The protein encoded by INTS1 is part of the backbone module of the Integrator complex, contributing to its structural integrity and chromatin localization (Zheng2020Identification). As a subunit of the Integrator complex, integrator complex subunit 1 plays a significant role in transcription regulation, including the dephosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, which is essential for transcription initiation and elongation (Zheng2020Identification). Mutations in the INTS1 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining transcriptome integrity and proper cellular function (Xu2024Comprehensive; Oegema2017Human).

## Function
INTS1 is a subunit of the Integrator complex, which is involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated transcription. The Integrator complex, composed of at least 14 subunits, plays a crucial role in the processing and integration of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) by cleaving and polyadenylating their 3' ends, which is essential for RNA splicing and stability (Xu2024Comprehensive; Zheng2020Identification). INTS1 is part of the backbone module of the Integrator complex, contributing to its structural integrity and chromatin localization (Zheng2020Identification).

The Integrator complex, including INTS1, is involved in the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II at specific serine residues, which is critical for transcription initiation, pausing, and elongation (Zheng2020Identification). This dephosphorylation is facilitated by the association of the Integrator complex with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), forming the INTAC complex (Zheng2020Identification). INTS1 also plays a role in maintaining transcriptome integrity and proper brain development, as mutations in INTS1 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (Oegema2017Human). The Integrator complex, through its interaction with RNA polymerase II, regulates transcription termination and prevents non-productive transcription (LykkeAndersen2020Integrator).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the INTS1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), INTS1 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its elevated expression is associated with poor prognosis and survival outcomes. Genetic alterations in INTS1, along with other integrator complex subunits, are observed in over 61% of HCC patients, correlating with poorer overall and disease-free survival. These findings suggest that INTS1 could serve as a potential biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis (Xu2024Comprehensive).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, biallelic mutations in INTS1 have been identified as a cause of a rare condition characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, and distinct physical features. These mutations lead to significant disruptions in gene expression and RNA processing, contributing to the disorder's etiology (Oegema2017Human; Zhang2019Biallelic). The integrator complex, of which INTS1 is a part, plays a crucial role in maintaining transcriptome integrity, and mutations in INTS1 can result in severe neurodevelopmental delays and brain abnormalities (Oegema2017Human). These clinical associations highlight the importance of INTS1 in both cancer progression and neurodevelopmental health.

## Interactions
INTS1 is a component of the Integrator complex, which is associated with RNA polymerase II and plays a crucial role in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). INTS1 interacts with other subunits of the Integrator complex, such as INTS12, through an N-terminal microdomain, as observed in Drosophila (Fianu2024Reconstitution). The Integrator complex, including INTS1, is involved in the 3' end processing of snRNAs, which is essential for RNA splicing and the stability of snRNP particles (Xu2024Comprehensive).

While specific interactions of INTS1 with nucleic acids are not detailed, its inclusion in the reconstitution of the full Integrator complex suggests its involvement in complex formation and function (Fianu2024Reconstitution). The complex is known to interact with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, integrating CTD phosphorylation signals necessary for snRNA processing (Fianu2024Reconstitution). Although the precise biological role of INTS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain unclear, its overexpression in cancer tissues and involvement in broader transcription regulation have been noted (Xu2024Comprehensive).
