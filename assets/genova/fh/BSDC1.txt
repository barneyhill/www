# BSDC1

## Overview
BSDC1 is a gene that encodes the BSD domain containing 1 protein, which is characterized by the presence of a BSD domain. This domain is typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that BSD domain containing 1 may play a role in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. While the specific functions of BSD domain containing 1 are not fully elucidated, proteins with BSD domains are often implicated in regulatory pathways and cellular signaling. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in health and disease.
