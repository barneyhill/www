# UNCX

## Overview
UNCX is a gene that encodes the UNC homeobox protein, a paired-type homeobox transcription factor. This protein is integral to the development and maintenance of neural and skeletal structures, particularly within the olfactory system and axial skeleton. In the olfactory epithelium, the UNC homeobox protein is essential for the proliferation and survival of olfactory sensory neurons and basal progenitor cells, influencing gene expression through potential interactions with transcriptional co-repressors (Sammeta2010Uncx). Additionally, the protein plays a pivotal role in the development of the axial skeleton by regulating the condensation of mesenchymal cells in the lateral sclerotome, which is crucial for the formation of skeletal structures such as pedicles and ribs (Nittoli2019Characterization; Sánchez2013Characterization).

## Function
The UNCX gene encodes a paired-type homeobox transcription factor that plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of neural and skeletal structures. In the olfactory epithelium, UNCX is crucial for the proliferation and survival of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and basal progenitor cells. It regulates neural progenitor cell proliferation and supports the survival of OSNs by influencing gene expression, potentially through interactions with TLE family transcriptional co-repressors (Sammeta2010Uncx). UNCX is expressed throughout the OSN lineage, from basal progenitor cells to mature OSNs, and is necessary for maintaining normal levels of olfactory neurogenesis and cell homeostasis (Sammeta2010Uncx).

UNCX also plays a critical role in the development of the axial skeleton. It is involved in the condensation of mesenchymal cells in the lateral sclerotome, which is essential for the proper formation of pedicles, transverse processes, and proximal rib derivatives (Nittoli2019Characterization; Sánchez2013Characterization). The gene's activity as a transcription factor involves binding to DNA in the nucleus to regulate the expression of genes necessary for the differentiation and proliferation of sclerotomal cells, influencing vertebral column development (Sánchez2013Characterization).
