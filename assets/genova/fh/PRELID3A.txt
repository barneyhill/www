# PRELID3A

## Overview
PRELID3A is a gene that encodes the protein PRELI domain containing 3A, which plays a significant role in mitochondrial lipid transfer. This protein is categorized as a lipid transfer protein and is primarily involved in the transport of phosphatidic acid between mitochondrial membranes, a process essential for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a key phospholipid for mitochondrial membrane integrity and function (Paesano2017Data). The PRELI domain containing 3A protein operates within the mitochondrial intermembrane space as part of the TRIAP1:PRELID3A complex, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial lipid homeostasis and supporting cellular energy production and homeostasis (Nedara2022Relevance). The structural and functional interactions of PRELID3A with TRIAP1 highlight its importance in mitochondrial lipid trafficking and its potential implications in cellular stress responses and diseases such as cancer (Miliara2019Structural; Castelo2024Stomatinlike).

## Function
PRELID3A, also known as PRELI domain containing 3A, is a protein involved in mitochondrial lipid transfer, specifically facilitating the transfer of phosphatidic acid between mitochondrial membranes. This function is crucial for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a phospholipid essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and function (Paesano2017Data). The protein operates within the mitochondrial intermembrane space as part of the TRIAP1:PRELID3A complex, which is vital for the proper organization and function of mitochondrial membranes (Nedara2022Relevance; Paesano2017Data).

In healthy human cells, PRELID3A's role in lipid transfer is integral to mitochondrial function, impacting processes such as energy production and cellular homeostasis. The TRIAP1-PRELID3A interaction is part of a broader mechanism of mitochondrial lipid trafficking, which is important for cellular stress responses and may have implications in cancer (Nedara2022Relevance). Although specific details about PRELID3A's function in healthy cells are limited, its involvement in mitochondrial lipid metabolism suggests a critical role in maintaining cellular energy balance and structural integrity.

## Interactions
PRELID3A, a member of the PRELI domain-containing family, primarily interacts with the protein TRIAP1 to form a complex that facilitates the transfer of phospholipids across the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This interaction is crucial for the transport of phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylserine (PS), which are essential for mitochondrial lipid homeostasis and cardiolipin synthesis in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Paesano2017Data; Castelo2024Stomatinlike). The PRELID3A-TRIAP1 complex has been structurally characterized, revealing specific intermolecular associations, such as the swapping of C-terminal α3 helices, which suggest a stable interaction between these proteins (Miliara2019Structural).

The interaction between PRELID3A and TRIAP1 is not only structural but also functional, as it plays a role in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR). Disruption of this interaction through RNA interference against PRELID3A or TRIAP1 induces the mtUPR, indicating that their interaction is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function under stress conditions (Castelo2024Stomatinlike). While specific interactions of PRELID3A with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in lipid transport and mitochondrial function underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis.
