# GOSR2

## Overview
The GOSR2 gene encodes the protein golgi SNAP receptor complex member 2, also known as membrin, which is a member of the SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) family. This protein is categorized as a Golgi Qb-SNARE and plays a pivotal role in the intracellular vesicular transport system. GOSR2 is primarily involved in the docking and fusion of vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cis-Golgi, a critical process for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper membrane trafficking (Larson2018TRAPPC11; Hentrich2023Novel). The protein forms a complex with other SNARE proteins, such as Syntaxin-5, Bet1, and Sec22b, facilitating the fusion of membranes within the ER, the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and the Golgi apparatus (Hentrich2023Novel). Mutations in the GOSR2 gene have been linked to various neurological disorders, including autosomal recessive progressive myoclonic epilepsy and congenital muscular dystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance (van2013Ramsay; Henige2021Compound).

## Function
The GOSR2 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) family, specifically a Golgi Qb-SNARE protein, which plays a crucial role in vesicular transport within cells (Larson2018TRAPPC11; Hentrich2023Novel). In healthy human cells, GOSR2 is involved in the docking and fusion of vesicles originating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cis-Golgi, a process essential for proper membrane trafficking and cellular homeostasis (Larson2018TRAPPC11; Hentrich2023Novel). 

GOSR2 forms a complex with other SNARE proteins, including Syntaxin-5, Bet1, and Sec22b, which is vital for the fusion of membranes involving the ER, the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and the Golgi apparatus (Hentrich2023Novel). This protein is packaged into COPII-coated vesicles, which are responsible for transporting materials to the Golgi complex, facilitated by the interaction between the IxM motif in GOSR2 and the subunit Sec24c/d (Hentrich2023Novel). 

The proper functioning of GOSR2 is critical for the intracellular trafficking of proteins and lipids, ensuring they reach their correct destinations, which is particularly important in neurons and glial cells (Hentrich2023Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GOSR2 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably autosomal recessive progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) and congenital muscular dystrophy. A specific homozygous missense mutation, c.430G>T (p.Gly144Trp), is linked to North Sea Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy (NSPME), a condition characterized by myoclonus, ataxia, seizures, and areflexia. This mutation is particularly prevalent in Friesland, the Netherlands, due to a founder effect (van2013Ramsay). Patients with NSPME often experience spontaneous and action-induced myoclonic jerks, with seizures being relatively mild compared to the myoclonus (van2013Ramsay).

Compound heterozygous variants in GOSR2 have also been identified, expanding the clinical spectrum to include congenital muscular dystrophy. This condition is characterized by congenital hypotonia, elevated creatine kinase levels, progressive muscle weakness, and areflexia. Muscle biopsy findings in affected individuals suggest a dystroglycanopathy, with hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan observed (Henige2021Compound).

In addition to neurological disorders, variations in the GOSR2 gene have been associated with myocardial infarction in Japanese men, where a specific haplotype acts as a protective factor against the condition (Pan2013A).

## Interactions
The GOSR2 protein, also known as membrin, is a member of the SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) family and plays a critical role in mediating membrane fusion processes. It forms a complex with three other SNARE proteins: Syntaxin-5, Bet1, and Sec22b. This complex is essential for the fusion of membranes during vesicular transport, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and the Golgi apparatus (Hentrich2023Novel). 

GOSR2 interacts with COPII-coated vesicles, which are responsible for transporting materials from the ER to the Golgi complex. The interaction between the IxM motif in GOSR2 and the Sec24c/d subunit is the primary mechanism for packaging GOSR2/membrin and syntaxin-5 into these vesicles, facilitating vesicular trafficking under normal conditions (Hentrich2023Novel). 

Mutations in GOSR2, such as p.Gly144Trp, can introduce changes that destabilize the assembly of the SNARE complex, affecting its function in vesicular transport (Hentrich2023Novel). GOSR2 is also involved in autophagy and intracellular trafficking, interacting with proteins like TRAPPC11, ATG2B-WDR45, and EPG5, which are involved in autophagosome formation and fusion (Hentrich2023Novel).
