# TEX46

## Overview
The TEX46 gene encodes the protein testis expressed 46, which is primarily expressed in the testis. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. As a testis-specific protein, TEX46 is thought to play a role in spermatogenesis and may be involved in the regulation of gene expression during the development of male germ cells. The study of TEX46 and its encoded protein is ongoing, with research focusing on understanding its interactions and potential implications in reproductive health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
