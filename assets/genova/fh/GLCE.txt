# GLCE

## Overview
The GLCE gene encodes the enzyme glucuronic acid epimerase, which is integral to the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, a critical component of the extracellular matrix involved in various cellular processes. This enzyme, categorized as an epimerase, catalyzes the conversion of D-glucuronic acid to L-iduronic acid within heparan sulfate chains, a modification essential for the structural diversity and functional specificity of the polysaccharide (Debarnot2019Substrate). The GLCE protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes distinct domains facilitating its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis (Qin2015Structural). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in health and disease, including roles in cancer progression and cardiovascular health, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Grigorieva2007Decreased; Kunnas2016Glucuronic).

## Structure
The human GLCE protein, involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, exhibits a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of GLCE is highly conserved, sharing significant sequence identity with its zebrafish counterpart (Qin2015Structural). The secondary structure of GLCE includes an N-terminal β-hairpin domain, a β-barrel domain, and a C-terminal α-helical domain. The N-terminal β-hairpin domain consists of two β-hairpins connected by a short α-helix, while the C-terminal α-helical domain comprises two β-strands forming a β-hairpin and eight α-helices arranged in four pairs of anti-parallel helices. The β-barrel domain contains one α-helix and 13 β-strands (Qin2015Structural).

The tertiary structure is characterized by the arrangement of these domains, with the α-helical domain being the most conserved region. The quaternary structure involves the formation of a stable dimer through interactions between the N-terminal β-hairpin and C-terminal α-helical domains, burying a total surface area of 6020 Å². This dimeric structure is supported by size exclusion chromatography, indicating that GLCE exists as a dimer in solution (Qin2015Structural). The dimer interface involves hydrophobic packing interactions and ionic interactions, with specific residues contributing to these interactions (Qin2015Structural).

## Function
The GLCE gene encodes the enzyme glucuronyl C5-epimerase, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a linear polysaccharide involved in various cellular processes. This enzyme catalyzes the C5-epimerization of D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) into L-iduronic acid (IdoA) within the HS chain, a modification essential for providing flexibility to the polymer and creating protein-binding sites critical for its function (Debarnot2019Substrate). The enzyme's activity involves specific substrate binding and catalytic mechanisms, with key residues such as Glu499 and Tyr578 facilitating the reversible abstraction and readdition of a proton at the C5 position (Debarnot2019Substrate).

In healthy human cells, GLCE is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies heparan sulfate chains, impacting cell signaling, cell adhesion, and regulation of growth factors (Debarnot2019Substrate). The structural variability introduced by GLCE's action is important for the biological properties of HS, including its ability to bind proteins and modulate their activity (Debarnot2019Substrate). This modification is crucial for the formation of binding sites for protein ligands, such as antithrombin and fibroblast growth factors, influencing various physiological processes (Sarrazin2011Heparan).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GLCE gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast, lung, and prostate cancer. In breast cancer, GLCE expression is significantly downregulated in 82-84% of tumors, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This downregulation is associated with decreased mRNA and protein levels, indicating that GLCE may serve as a predictive marker for breast cancer (Grigorieva2007Decreased). In lung cancer, GLCE acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and tumor growth, with its inactivation being necessary for tumor progression (Grigorieva2011D). 

In prostate cancer, GLCE expression shows a complex pattern. While decreased expression is observed in 53% of prostate tumors, increased expression correlates with advanced disease markers such as Gleason score and PSA levels. This suggests that GLCE may have a pro-oncogenic role in prostate cancer, potentially promoting angiogenesis and metastasis (Rosenberg2013dglucuronyl; Prudnikova2013Heterogeneity). 

The GLCE gene is also associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. A polymorphism in GLCE, rs3865014, is linked to hypertension, BMI, and cerebrovascular events, highlighting its potential impact on cardiovascular health (Kunnas2016Glucuronic). These findings underscore the gene's diverse roles in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
GLCE, or glucuronic acid epimerase, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in heparan sulfate (HS) and heparin biosynthesis. It physically interacts with 2-O-sulfotransferase and 6-O-sulfotransferase, forming a complex that facilitates the coupling of 2-O-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation with C5 epimerization during HS/heparin biosynthesis. However, GLCE does not interact with N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, as demonstrated by an AlphaScreen in vitro binding assay (Qin2015Structural).

In the context of kidney fibrosis, GLCE interacts with the intracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), acting as an 'on-off' switch to regulate EGFR activation. This interaction is significant for modulating EGFR signaling pathways, which are associated with fibrosis (Jing2022Protective).

GLCE also forms a stable dimer through interactions between its N-terminal β-hairpin and C-terminal α-helical domains. This dimerization involves extensive hydrophobic and ionic interactions, which are crucial for its structural stability and function in binding negatively charged HS chains (Qin2015Structural). These interactions highlight GLCE's role in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways, influencing various biological processes.
