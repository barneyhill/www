# MBD3L5

## Overview
MBD3L5 is a gene that encodes the protein methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3 like 5, which is part of the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) protein family. These proteins are known for their role in binding to methylated DNA, which is a key process in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling. MBD3L5, like other members of the MBD family, is implicated in the interpretation of DNA methylation marks, thereby influencing transcriptional repression and activation. The protein encoded by MBD3L5 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genomic stability, although its specific functions and interactions are still under investigation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
