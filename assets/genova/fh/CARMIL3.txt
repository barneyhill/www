# CARMIL3

## Overview
CARMIL3 is a gene that encodes the protein capping protein regulator and myosin 1 linker 3, which is a member of the CARMIL protein family. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a dynamic structure essential for various cellular processes such as motility, shape, and signaling. CARMIL3 interacts with capping proteins to modulate actin filament dynamics, thereby influencing cell movement and structure (Zhao2021Capping; Liang2009Distinct). It is also involved in immune responses, particularly in the regulation of cytokine transcription in phagocytic cells, and plays a role in the NF-κB signaling pathway (Zhao2021Capping). Additionally, CARMIL3 has been implicated in cancer progression, with its expression levels serving as a prognostic marker in certain cancers (Wang2020Capping). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as β-catenin and ZEB2, further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and disease (Wang2020Capping).

## Structure
CARMIL3, a member of the CARMIL protein family, is involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation. It contains several structural domains, including a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a CARMIL-specific interaction motif, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) (Zwolak2013CARMIL). The LRR domain is characterized by a planar horseshoe shape, composed of β-strands and α-helices, and is capped at both ends by helix-loop-helix motifs, which are conserved among CARMIL isoforms (Zwolak2013CARMIL). 

The protein also features a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is involved in lipid binding, particularly with phosphatidylserine and monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositides. This domain is distinct from canonical PH domains due to its unique structural features and low sequence identity (Zwolak2013CARMIL). The PH domain's lipid-binding capability is crucial for CARMIL3's localization to the plasma membrane and its role in cell motility (Zwolak2013CARMIL).

CARMIL3 is known to exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its interaction with actin and other proteins (Yeh2021Capping). The protein's activity may also be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
CARMIL3, a member of the CARMIL protein family, plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton regulation by interacting with capping proteins (CP) to modulate actin filament dynamics. This interaction is crucial for processes such as cell shape, motility, and signaling, particularly at sites of dynamic actin remodeling (Liang2009Distinct). CARMIL3 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in enhancing actin polymerization, which is essential for cell movement and structure (Zhao2021Capping).

In immune cells, CARMIL3 is implicated in the regulation of cytokine transcription, particularly in activated phagocytic cells like macrophages and dendritic cells. It is essential for the induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12p40 and IL-6 in response to inflammatory stimuli, playing a role in the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is key in immune responses and inflammation (Zhao2021Capping). CARMIL3's involvement in these pathways suggests its importance in immune defense and the prevention of autoimmune diseases (Zhao2021Capping). Despite its significant roles in immune cells, specific functions of CARMIL3 in healthy human cells remain less explored (Liang2009Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
CARMIL3 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in breast and prostate cancers. High expression of CARMIL3 is associated with poor outcomes in these cancers, as it is upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. In breast cancer, CARMIL3 expression is notably higher in primary breast carcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and metastatic tumors, correlating with poor patient survival. It serves as an independent predictor of breast cancer patient survival (Wang2020Capping). In prostate cancer, higher CARMIL3 expression is observed in metastatic cell lines compared to nonmetastatic ones, and its loss impairs tumor growth and prolongs survival in murine models (Wang2020Capping).

CARMIL3 influences tumor metastasis by regulating the transcription of the CDH1 gene, which encodes E-cadherin, a protein crucial for cell adhesion. CARMIL3 deficiency leads to increased expression of ZEB2, a transcriptional repressor of CDH1, resulting in decreased E-cadherin levels and reduced metastatic colonization of tumor cells in the lungs (Wang2020Capping). CARMIL3 also interacts with the destruction complex of β-catenin, protecting it from degradation, which is essential for cancer progression (Wang2020Capping).

In addition to its role in cancer, CARMIL3 is identified as a molecular signature in ischemic neurons following a stroke. Its expression is associated with neuronal edema, impaired autophagy, and oxidative stress, indicating its involvement in the cellular response to ischemic conditions (Yeh2021Capping).

## Interactions
CARMIL3 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to cancer metastasis and immune response. It is known to interact with actin cytoskeleton proteins, including capping proteins, which are crucial for actin filament dynamics and cell movement (Wang2020Capping). CARMIL3 also interacts with β-catenin, protecting it from ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation, thereby stabilizing its protein levels. This interaction involves the destruction complex of β-catenin, including proteins such as Axin1, APC, GSK-3, CK1, and the E3-ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP (Wang2020Capping).

In the context of immune response, CARMIL3 is involved in the regulation of cytokine transcription in phagocytic cells. It affects NF-κB signaling by influencing the phosphorylation levels of key signaling proteins, such as p65 and IκBα, in macrophages (Zhao2021Capping). CARMIL3's role in transcriptional regulation is also evident in its interaction with the transcriptional repressor ZEB2, where it inhibits ZEB2 to promote the transcription of Cdh1, a gene encoding E-cadherin (Wang2020Capping). These interactions highlight CARMIL3's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and its potential impact on cancer progression and immune function.
