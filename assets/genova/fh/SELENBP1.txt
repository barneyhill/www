# SELENBP1

## Overview
Selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) is a gene that encodes the selenium-binding protein 1, a cytosolic protein involved in various cellular processes, including detoxification and redox regulation. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind selenium, a trace element essential for numerous biological functions, and is implicated in the oxidation of methanethiol, contributing to cellular homeostasis and differentiation (Philipp2021A; Elhodaky2018SeleniumBinding). SELENBP1 is expressed in several tissues, such as the liver, lung, and gastrointestinal tract, and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular health by modulating redox balance and detoxifying harmful compounds (Elhodaky2018SeleniumBinding). Its expression is often reduced in various cancers, where it may act as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis in several malignancies (Caswell2018Tumor; Kim2006Suppression). The protein's interactions with other cellular proteins, such as ubiquitin-specific peptidase 33 and glutathione peroxidase 1, further underscore its involvement in critical cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2022The; Elhodaky2018SeleniumBinding).

## Structure
The human selenium binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 472 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 56 kDa (Elhodaky2018SeleniumBinding). The secondary structure of SELENBP1 is composed of an alpha-beta configuration, featuring 4 short alpha-helices, one 3_10 helix, and 30 antiparallel beta-strands. This structure is stabilized by two disulfide bonds between Cys80-Cys141 and Cys83-Cys466 (Raucci2011Structural). The tertiary structure of SELENBP1 includes loop regions, some of which are predicted to be intrinsically disordered, contributing to the protein's flexibility (Raucci2011Structural). 

Cysteine at position 57 is notably solvent-exposed and is likely involved in selenium binding, potentially through a selenosulfide bond, which is crucial for the protein's stability and interactions (Raucci2011Structural; Elhodaky2018SeleniumBinding). SELENBP1 does not appear to have a quaternary structure involving multiple subunits, as no information on such assembly is provided. The protein's expression is often reduced in cancerous tissues, and its structural features may influence its role in cellular processes and cancer prognosis (Elhodaky2018SeleniumBinding).

## Function
Selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) plays a crucial role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is involved in the oxidation of methanethiol, a sulfur-containing compound, into hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and formaldehyde, indicating its function in detoxification and redox modulation (Philipp2021A). This activity is particularly significant in enterocytes, where SELENBP1 levels and methanethiol oxidase (MTO) activity increase with cell differentiation, suggesting its role in cell maturation and differentiation (Philipp2021A).

SELENBP1 is abundantly expressed in tissues such as the liver, lung, and gastrointestinal tract, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Elhodaky2018SeleniumBinding). Its expression is strongly induced during the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, positioning it to effectively eliminate microbiome-derived methanethiol, which is important for gut health (Philipp2021A).

The protein is also involved in the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis and may act as an intracellular selenium buffer, helping to manage the cytotoxic effects of selenite (Philipp2021A). These functions underscore SELENBP1's role in maintaining cellular and organismal health through its involvement in detoxification and redox processes.

## Clinical Significance
SELENBP1 (selenium-binding protein 1) is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels often reduced in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. In colorectal cancer, SELENBP1 expression is significantly suppressed, particularly in stages II and III, and this suppression is associated with poor prognosis and rapid carcinoma progression (Kim2006Suppression). Similarly, in breast cancer, reduced SELENBP1 expression is linked to poor survival, especially in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) patients, and its levels decrease with advancing clinical stages (Zhang2013Reduced). In lung adenocarcinoma, SELENBP1 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its inactivation leads to increased tumor growth and progression (Caswell2018Tumor).

SELENBP1's role extends beyond cancer. It is involved in redox regulation, and its knockdown in cancer cells leads to increased reactive oxygen species and apoptosis, indicating its role in maintaining cellular redox balance (Elhodaky2018SeleniumBinding). In renal cell carcinoma, decreased SELENBP1 mRNA expression is associated with poor prognosis, high-grade tumors, and advanced cancer stages (Ha2014Decreased). These findings suggest that SELENBP1 expression levels could serve as a prognostic marker in various cancers.

## Interactions
SELENBP1, also known as selenium-binding protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cancer progression and cellular processes. SELENBP1 interacts with ubiquitin-specific peptidase 33 (USP33), also known as von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL)-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme 1 (VDU1), suggesting a role in protein degradation pathways (Zhang2022The; Ying2015Quantitative). This interaction is dependent on the presence of selenium, as the dissociation of selenium from SELENBP1 blocks its interaction with VDU1 (Elhodaky2018SeleniumBinding).

SELENBP1 also interacts with glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), a selenoprotein, inhibiting its enzyme activity without affecting its protein levels. This interaction is part of a reciprocal relationship where GPX1 expression can reduce SELENBP1 levels (Elhodaky2018SeleniumBinding). In prostate cancer, SELENBP1 interacts with proteins involved in ubiquitination, such as VDU1 and VDU2, affecting the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a tumor suppressor (Zhang2022The).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma, SELENBP1 downregulation is influenced by miR-4786-3p, which binds to its 3′ untranslated region, affecting the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) by promoting its polyubiquitination and degradation (Zhang2022The). These interactions highlight SELENBP1's involvement in various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
