# LLGL2

## Overview
LLGL2, or Lethal Giant Larvae Homolog 2, is a gene that encodes the LLGL scribble cell polarity complex component 2, a protein integral to maintaining cell polarity and tissue organization. This protein is a member of the WD40 family, characterized by its double β-propeller structure, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and is crucial for its function in the Scribble polarity complex (Barreda2020The; Almagor2019Structural). LLGL2 plays a pivotal role in epithelial apical-basal polarity and asymmetric cell division, processes essential for proper cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue morphogenesis (Gu2023LLGL2). The protein's interactions with other components of the Scribble complex, such as SCRIB and DLG, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and preventing tumorigenesis (Kallay2006Scribble). LLGL2's involvement in actin dynamics and its regulatory role in signaling pathways further highlight its significance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, including various cancers (Bii2023Lethal; Gu2023LLGL2).

## Structure
The LLGL2 protein is characterized by a double β-propeller structure, consisting of 14 antiparallel β-sheets that fold into two seven-bladed β-propeller structures, resembling an open clamshell. The first β-propeller includes residues 33-379, while residues 380-923 form the second β-propeller. The last β-strand of the second propeller is formed by residues 24-29, connecting the first and last strands of the structure. This topology is common in double-barrel β-propeller proteins and contributes to the structural stability and interaction between the two propellers (Almagor2019Structural).

The second β-propeller contains irregular features, including long insertions between blades 8-11, with the largest insertion between blades 10 and 11, which includes aPKC-targeted serines (Almagor2019Structural). Phosphorylation by atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) at these serine-rich sequences induces a structural switch, affecting LLGL2's association with the plasma membrane and disrupting its interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-containing membranes (Almagor2019Structural).

LLGL2 is part of the WD40 family, with these motifs acting as interaction modules. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which influences its function and interactions (Barreda2020The). LLGL2 has multiple splice variant isoforms, which may have distinct functional roles (Barreda2020The).

## Function
LLGL2 is a crucial component of the Scribble polarity complex, which includes SCRIB and DLG, and is essential for maintaining epithelial apical-basal polarity (ABP) and asymmetric cell division. These functions are vital for epithelial cell formation and function, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and tissue morphogenesis (Gu2023LLGL2). In healthy human cells, LLGL2 plays a significant role in regulating cell polarity, which is important for maintaining tissue organization and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Bii2023Lethal).

LLGL2 is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and interacts with proteins like aPKC to maintain cell polarity and actin polymerization, which are crucial for cell structure and function (Gu2023LLGL2). It also participates in protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, contributing to cell proliferation and potentially influencing tumor progression (Gu2023LLGL2). In the context of epithelial cells, LLGL2 is associated with the plasma membrane and is involved in maintaining cell polarity and organization (Kallay2006Scribble). The protein's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing the onset of cancer by regulating key signaling pathways (Bii2023Lethal).

## Clinical Significance
The LLGL2 gene has significant clinical implications in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and migration. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LLGL2 is overexpressed and associated with poor clinicopathologic features and prognosis. High LLGL2 expression correlates with lower overall survival and disease-free survival rates, making it a potential prognostic marker for HCC. The gene promotes oncogenic activities through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by increasing calcium ion influx, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis (Leng2021LLGL2).

In ovarian cancer, LLGL2 appears to function as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is higher in ovarian clear cell carcinoma tissues but lower in advanced stages, suggesting a protective role against tumor progression. High LLGL2 expression is linked to longer progression-free survival and inversely correlated with advanced tumor stages (Gu2023LLGL2).

In gastric cancer, the loss of LLGL2 expression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. It correlates with epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, indicating its role in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and suppressing tumor progression (Nam2013Deregulation). These findings highlight LLGL2's complex role in cancer, acting as either a tumor promoter or suppressor depending on the context.

## Interactions
LLGL2, a component of the Scribble cell polarity complex, engages in several critical protein interactions that influence cell polarity and tumor suppression. It interacts with the Discs Large (Dlg) protein in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This interaction requires the phosphorylation of conserved serine residues in LLGL2, which facilitates its binding to the guanylate kinase (GK) domain of Dlg. This binding is crucial for the formation of the Scribble complex, which is involved in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and tissue growth (Zhu2014Phosphorylationdependent).

In mammalian cells, LLGL2 also associates with the Scribble protein, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction suggests that LLGL2 is part of large protein complexes that include Scribble, which are essential for cell polarity (Kallay2006Scribble).

LLGL2 interacts with α-actinin-1 (ACTN1), an actin-binding protein, in ovarian cancer cells. This interaction affects cytoskeleton remodeling, which is crucial for inhibiting cancer metastasis. LLGL2 does not alter ACTN1 expression levels but influences its intracellular localization, thereby impacting actin filament organization (Gu2023LLGL2).
