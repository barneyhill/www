# DDX60L

## Overview
DDX60L is a gene that encodes the DExD/H-box 60-like protein, a member of the DExD/H-box helicase family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role in RNA processing and metabolism, particularly in unwinding RNA structures to facilitate RNA-protein interactions. The DExD/H-box 60-like protein is primarily involved in the innate immune response, where it plays a critical role in recognizing viral RNA and activating antiviral defense mechanisms. This protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins to modulate immune responses. Beyond its role in immunity, DDX60L has been implicated in various cancers, exhibiting dual functionality as an oncogene in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma. These diverse roles underscore the gene's significance in both health and disease, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Ye2022Associations; Wu2021Identification).

## Function
DDX60L is a member of the DExD/H-box helicase family, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing and metabolism. These helicases are primarily involved in unwinding RNA structures, which is essential for facilitating RNA-protein interactions. DDX60L is particularly significant in the context of the innate immune response, where it is implicated in recognizing viral RNA. This recognition is a critical step in activating downstream signaling pathways that promote antiviral defense mechanisms. The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins to modulate immune responses. Through these interactions, DDX60L contributes to the cellular machinery that detects and responds to viral infections, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining cellular and organismal health by preventing the spread of viral pathogens. The activity of DDX60L in these processes underscores its importance in the broader context of immune system function and its potential impact on the organism's ability to combat viral infections.

## Clinical Significance
DDX60L has been implicated in several cancers, with its expression levels correlating with disease progression and prognosis. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), DDX60L is highly expressed and functions as a potential oncogene. Its knockdown in PDAC cells inhibits metastasis and induces apoptosis, affecting pathways such as TNF and NF-ÎºB, and reducing the expression of chemokine CXCL2, which may alter the tumor microenvironment (Wu2021Identification). High DDX60L expression in PDAC is associated with advanced cancer stages and poor prognosis (Wu2021Identification).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DDX60L expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is linked to poorer prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness, suggesting that DDX60L may act as a tumor suppressor in HCC (Ye2022Associations).

These findings indicate that DDX60L plays a dual role in cancer, acting as an oncogene in PDAC and a tumor suppressor in HCC. Its expression levels and functional interactions in these cancers highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.
