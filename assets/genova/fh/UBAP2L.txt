# UBAP2L

## Overview
UBAP2L, or ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, stress response, and hematopoietic stem cell maintenance. The protein is characterized by its complex domain structure, which includes a Ubiquitin-Associated Domain (UBA), an Arginine-Glycine-Glycine (RGG) domain, and several RNA-binding regions, facilitating its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Guerber2022Ubiquitin; Huang2019UBAP2L). UBAP2L plays a critical role in the assembly of stress granules and nuclear pore complexes, highlighting its importance in cellular stress responses and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (Liao2023UBAP2L). Clinically, UBAP2L is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (YOSHIDA2019Clinical; Li2022UBAP2L).

## Structure
UBAP2L is a protein encoded by the KIAA0144 gene, located on chromosomal region 1q21, and is highly conserved in vertebrates. The protein is 1,087 amino acids long and features a complex domain structure. It includes an N-terminal Ubiquitin-Associated Domain (UBA) spanning amino acids 49-89, an Arginine-Glycine-Glycine (RGG) domain, and three predicted RNA-binding regions located at amino acids 239-257, 282-290, and 850-864. Additionally, UBAP2L contains a Domain of Unknown Function (DUF) between amino acids 495-526 (Guerber2022Ubiquitin; Huang2019UBAP2L).

The RGG domain is crucial for interactions with other proteins and is asymmetrically dimethylated by PRMT1, a post-translational modification that influences its function in stress granule assembly (Huang2019UBAP2L). This domain is also essential for UBAP2L's interaction with FXR1 and nucleoporins, which is largely RNA-independent (Liao2023UBAP2L).

UBAP2L is involved in the assembly of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) at the nuclear envelope, interacting with various nucleoporins and facilitating the formation of mature NPCs during early interphase (Liao2023UBAP2L). The protein's ability to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is supported by the presence of Nuclear Localization Signals (NLS) and Nuclear Export Signals (NES) (Guerber2022Ubiquitin).

## Function
UBAP2L, also known as ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like, is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in mitotic progression, where it ensures proper chromosome alignment and segregation. Depletion of UBAP2L leads to chromosome misalignment and impaired mitotic progression, underscoring its importance as a cell cycle regulator (Guerber2022Ubiquitin).

In the context of stress response, UBAP2L is essential for the formation of stress granules (SGs), which are non-membranous structures that form in response to cellular stress. UBAP2L interacts with G3BP1 and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) to promote SG assembly, which is crucial for mRNA turnover and protection (AsanoInami2023The). This interaction is mediated by snoRNAs, highlighting the protein's role in RNA-binding and stress signaling (AsanoInami2023The).

UBAP2L is also involved in maintaining hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity. It forms a complex with Polycomb group proteins, such as BMI1, which is crucial for the regulation of long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (Bordeleau2014UBAP2L). This interaction is essential for HSC function and organismal development (Bordeleau2014UBAP2L).

## Clinical Significance
UBAP2L is implicated in various cancers, with its overexpression linked to poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior. In gastric cancer, UBAP2L is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor survival outcomes. It promotes metastasis by activating the NF-κB pathway through the PI3K/AKT/SP1 axis, enhancing tumor aggression and metastatic potential (Li2022UBAP2L). In uterine cervical cancer, high UBAP2L expression is associated with shorter overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Knockdown of UBAP2L in cervical cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation, indicating its role in cancer cell growth (YOSHIDA2019Clinical).

In lung adenocarcinoma, UBAP2L is frequently amplified, with higher expression levels correlating with reduced survival. It plays a critical role in maintaining epithelial cell identity and promoting metastasis, as evidenced by its involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Aucagne2017UBAP2Lis). UBAP2L's role in cancer progression is further supported by its influence on oncogenic pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway, and its regulation of EMT-related genes (Guerber2022Ubiquitin). These findings suggest that UBAP2L could be a target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers.

## Interactions
UBAP2L is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with BMI1, a member of the Polycomb group proteins, forming a Polycomb subcomplex that regulates hematopoietic stem cell activity (Bordeleau2014UBAP2L). UBAP2L is also a core component of stress granules (SGs), where it interacts with G3BP1 and other SG-localized proteins such as FMR1, FXR1, FXR2, and Caprin1. These interactions are mediated by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), specifically C/D box snoRNAs like SNORD44 and SNORD49A, which are crucial for SG assembly (AsanoInami2023The).

UBAP2L forms distinct ribonucleoprotein granules independently of G3BP1, acting as a nucleator for SGs and facilitating their assembly under stress conditions (Cirillo2020UBAP2L). It also interacts with PRMT1, which methylates UBAP2L's RGG motif, influencing SG dynamics by modulating its assembly (Huang2019UBAP2L). These interactions highlight UBAP2L's role in stress response and cellular regulation, making it a potential target for therapeutic studies.
