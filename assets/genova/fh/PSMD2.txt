# PSMD2

## Overview
PSMD2 is a gene that encodes the protein proteasome 26S subunit ubiquitin receptor, non-ATPase 2, which is a critical component of the 26S proteasome complex. This protein functions as a ubiquitin receptor within the 19S regulatory particle, playing a pivotal role in the recognition and delivery of ubiquitinated substrates for proteasomal degradation. The proteasome is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including the cell cycle and apoptosis. PSMD2 is characterized by an Armadillo-like helical domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as RACK1 and β-catenin, influencing pathways like WNT signaling and autophagy (Xiong2018ATG16; Tian2023RACK1). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in cancer, where its expression is often dysregulated (Wang2022PSMD2; Li2018PSMD2).

## Structure
PSMD2 is a component of the 26S proteasome, specifically part of the 19S regulatory particle. It acts as a ubiquitin receptor, playing a crucial role in recognizing and delivering substrates for degradation (Tian2023RACK1). The protein's structure includes an Armadillo-like helical domain, spanning amino acids 355 to 853, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins such as RACK1 and β-catenin (Tian2023RACK1).

The binding of macrocyclic ligands to PSMD2 has been studied extensively. For instance, the macrocycle MC1 binds between the C-terminal domain and the helical solenoid of PSMD2, in a region distinct from other known binding sites (Bashore2022Targeted). This binding site is characterized by a wide and shallow surface area, with interactions mediated by residues at opposite ends of the macrocycle's long axis (Bashore2022Targeted).

PSMD2 is involved in the formation of ternary complexes with other proteins, such as BRD4, facilitating targeted protein degradation (Bashore2022Targeted). The protein's interaction with macrocycles and other ligands highlights its potential role in therapeutic applications, particularly in the context of targeted degradation strategies (Bashore2022Targeted).

## Function
PSMD2 is a component of the 26S proteasome, a complex responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PSMD2 functions as a ubiquitin receptor, facilitating the recognition and processing of proteins marked for degradation. This process is essential for the regulation of the cell cycle and the turnover of proteins, ensuring proper cellular function and response to environmental changes (Li2018PSMD2).

PSMD2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the degradation of cell cycle inhibitors such as p21 and p27. This activity is critical for cell cycle progression and proliferation, as it prevents the accumulation of these inhibitors, which can lead to cell cycle arrest (Li2018PSMD2). The interaction of PSMD2 with these proteins is selective and independent of p53, highlighting its specific role in cell cycle regulation (Li2018PSMD2).

Through its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, PSMD2 helps maintain cellular protein balance, which is vital for normal cell growth and division. Its activity is linked to the regulation of apoptosis and cellular senescence, processes that are fundamental to organismal development and homeostasis (Li2018PSMD2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSMD2 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In bladder cancer, PSMD2 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its elevated expression is associated with advanced tumor grade and poor overall survival. PSMD2's role in bladder cancer progression is linked to its involvement in the tumor immune microenvironment, where it may contribute to immune escape by influencing immune markers such as PD-L1 and CTLA4 (Wang2022PSMD2).

In breast cancer, PSMD2 is significantly upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival and distant-metastasis-free survival. The gene promotes cell cycle progression by facilitating the degradation of cell cycle regulators p21 and p27, leading to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth (Li2018PSMD2).

PSMD2 is also overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma, correlating with advanced disease stages and poor survival outcomes. Its expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and tumor progression, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in this cancer type (Zhao2022Prognostic).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma, high levels of PSMD2 are associated with poor prognosis, potentially due to its role in regulating lipid metabolism and cell proliferation (Tan2019PSMD1).

## Interactions
PSMD2, a component of the 26S proteasome, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It acts as a ubiquitin receptor within the 19S regulatory particle, recognizing substrates for degradation. PSMD2 interacts with the autophagy protein ATG16, which mediates the autophagic degradation of PSMD2 and PSMD1, suggesting a role in the crosstalk between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Xiong2018ATG16).

In breast cancer cells, PSMD2 interacts with RACK1 and β-catenin. RACK1 competes with β-catenin for binding to PSMD2, affecting β-catenin stability and promoting cancer cell proliferation through the WNT signaling pathway (Tian2023RACK1). PSMD2 also regulates the degradation of cell cycle regulators p21 and p27, interacting with these proteins to influence cell cycle progression and proliferation in breast cancer (Li2018PSMD2).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, PSMD2 interacts with argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), promoting tumor growth by inhibiting autophagy through the mTOR pathway (Liu2023PSMD2). These interactions highlight PSMD2's role in various cancer-related pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
