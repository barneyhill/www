# TK1

## Overview
Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme thymidine kinase 1, a key player in the DNA salvage pathway. This enzyme is classified as a kinase due to its role in catalyzing the phosphorylation of thymidine to thymidine monophosphate, a critical step in the synthesis of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) necessary for DNA replication and repair (Bitter2020Thymidine; Topolcan2008The). TK1 is predominantly active during the S phase of the cell cycle, reflecting its importance in cell proliferation and genomic stability (Bitter2020Thymidine). The enzyme's activity is modulated by various interactions and regulatory mechanisms, ensuring its function aligns with cellular replication demands (HUANG2001Interaction; Ke2007Hiding). Dysregulation of TK1 is associated with tumorigenesis, making it a significant focus in cancer research for its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker (Malvi2019Loss; Cai2022Comprehensive).

## Structure
Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is a cytosolic enzyme with a tetrameric quaternary structure, where each subunit consists of two distinct domains: an α/β-domain and a zinc-containing domain. The α/β-domain features a central six-stranded parallel β-sheet, similar to ATP-binding domains in the RecA-F1 ATPase family, but is smaller than those in other family members (Welin2004Structures). The zinc-containing domain includes a lasso-shaped structure that covers the deoxynucleoside-binding site, with a zinc ion tetrahedrally coordinated by cysteine pairs in human TK1 (hTK1) (Welin2004Structures). 

The primary structure of TK1 consists of 234 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 25.5 kDa per monomer (Birringer2006Highlevel). The enzyme's tertiary structure forms a globular shape, with the base and deoxyribose binding in a cleft between the α/β-domain and the lasso domain, stabilized by specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Welin2004Structures). 

TK1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and stability. The enzyme's quaternary structure is typically a homotetramer, although it can exist in dimeric forms under certain conditions (Birringer2006Highlevel). The presence of different splice variant isoforms can also influence its structural and functional properties.

## Function
Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is a crucial enzyme in the DNA salvage pathway, primarily involved in the phosphorylation of thymidine to thymidine monophosphate (dThMP), which is subsequently converted to deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) for DNA synthesis and repair (Bitter2020Thymidine; Topolcan2008The). TK1 activity is tightly regulated and peaks during the S phase of the cell cycle, correlating with its role in DNA replication and cell proliferation (Bitter2020Thymidine; Wang2001Investigation). 

In healthy human cells, TK1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining the intracellular thymidine pools necessary for DNA synthesis (Bitter2020Thymidine; Kauffman1991Cell). The enzyme's activity is modulated by various cell cycle checkpoints and regulatory pathways, ensuring its expression aligns with the cell's replication needs (Bitter2020Thymidine). TK1 is also involved in DNA repair processes, providing dTTP for replacing damaged nucleotides, which is vital for genomic stability (Bitter2020Thymidine). The regulation of TK1 is crucial for preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, and its dysregulation can contribute to tumorigenesis (Bitter2020Thymidine).

## Clinical Significance
Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and mutations. In breast and colorectal cancers, a consistent mutation at codon 106 (Met → Val) near the ATP binding site of TK1 has been identified, suggesting a potential role in cancer development. Silent polymorphisms at codons 11 and 75 are also frequently observed in these cancers (Gilles2003Mutation). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TK1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It is involved in pathways crucial for tumor growth, such as cell proliferation and DNA repair, and is linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly regulatory T cells, which are associated with poor outcomes (Cai2022Comprehensive).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), TK1 overexpression is linked to tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Knockdown of TK1 results in reduced tumor growth and metastasis, indicating its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastatic attributes. This effect is partly mediated through the regulation of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) (Malvi2019Loss). TK1 is also upregulated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, where it serves as an independent prognostic marker (Kolberg2015Protein). These findings highlight TK1 as a potential target for cancer therapy and a biomarker for prognosis.

## Interactions
Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) interacts with several proteins, influencing its stability and function. One significant interaction is with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 Waf1. TK1 forms a complex with p21 Waf1, specifically interacting with its C-terminal domain. This interaction does not inhibit TK1's enzymatic activity but can counteract the growth-suppressive effects of p21 Waf1 by blocking its association with CDK2, a key regulator of the cell cycle. This suggests that TK1 can modulate the inhibitory function of p21 Waf1, potentially affecting cell proliferation (HUANG2001Interaction).

TK1 also interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) co-activator Cdh1. Thymidine binding to TK1 prevents its interaction with Cdh1, thereby inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation via the APC/C-Cdh1 pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating TK1 stability and, consequently, dTTP production during the cell cycle. The presence of thymidine alters the conformation of TK1, hiding the KEN box, a signal necessary for Cdh1 recognition, thus preventing degradation (Ke2007Hiding).

These interactions highlight TK1's role in cell cycle regulation and its potential impact on cellular proliferation, particularly in cancer cells where TK1 expression is often elevated.
