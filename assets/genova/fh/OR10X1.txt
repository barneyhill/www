# OR10X1

## Overview
OR10X1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily X member 1, which belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors play a crucial role in the olfactory system by detecting odorant molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. The OR10X1 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity and specificity of olfactory detection. Although OR10X1 is non-functional in some modern humans and Neanderthals due to shared non-sense mutations, its presence highlights its historical significance in olfactory function and suggests potential variability in olfactory capabilities across different human populations (Hughes2014Loss).

## Function
OR10X1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR10X1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (Hughes2014Loss).

In the context of hominin evolution, OR10X1 has been identified as a non-functional olfactory receptor gene in both Neanderthals and some modern humans, due to identical non-sense mutations. This shared loss of function suggests a common evolutionary pathway affecting olfactory capabilities (Hughes2014Loss). Despite its non-functionality in certain populations, the presence of OR10X1 in the olfactory epithelium indicates its historical role in odor detection and the potential for functional variation among different human populations.

The study of OR10X1 and other olfactory receptors provides insights into the genetic basis of olfactory perception and its evolutionary changes, reflecting adaptations to different ecological niches and environments (Hughes2014Loss).
