# ALDH16A1

## Overview
The ALDH16A1 gene encodes the protein aldehyde dehydrogenase 16 family member A1, which is part of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily. Unlike other members of this superfamily, ALDH16A1 is characterized as a pseudoenzyme due to its lack of the catalytic triad necessary for enzymatic activity (Xanthis2023Human). The protein is notable for its unique structural features, including two ALDH domains and a distinctive C-terminal domain, which suggest potential roles in protein-protein interactions rather than catalytic functions (Liu2019Crystal; Vasiliou2013ALDH16A1). ALDH16A1 is implicated in various biological processes, including uric acid homeostasis and neurological functions, through its interactions with other proteins such as maspardin and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) (Charkoftaki2017Transcriptomic; Hanna2009Interaction). The gene's expression and structural characteristics suggest it may play a role in lipid metabolism and renal function, with clinical significance in conditions like gout and hyperuricemia (Charkoftaki2017Transcriptomic; Vasiliou2013ALDH16A1).

## Structure
The ALDH16A1 protein is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily and is characterized by its unique structural features. It consists of 802 amino acids and includes two ALDH domains, which is atypical compared to other ALDH family members that typically have one domain (Vasiliou2013ALDH16A1). The primary structure of ALDH16A1 includes a missense SNP that results in a proline to arginine alteration at specific positions (Vasiliou2013ALDH16A1).

The secondary structure of ALDH16A1 features a Rossmann fold in the NAD+ binding domain, which is a common motif in the ALDH superfamily (Liu2019Crystal). The tertiary structure includes a unique C-terminal domain with a Rossmann fold subdomain and a protruding β-flap, which mimics the quaternary structural interactions of classical ALDH dimers (Liu2019Crystal). This domain architecture allows for potential protein-protein interactions, despite the absence of the catalytic cysteine residue, suggesting a pseudoenzyme function (Liu2019Crystal; Luo2016Structures).

The quaternary structure of ALDH16A1 is dimeric, forming a unique dimer that resembles the classic ALDH tetramer in terms of intermolecular β-sheet hydrogen bonding and overall shape (Liu2019Crystal). The protein also contains four transmembrane domains and a coiled-coil domain, contributing to its membrane association (Vasiliou2013ALDH16A1).

## Function
ALDH16A1 is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, but it is characterized as a pseudoenzyme due to its lack of the catalytic triad necessary for enzymatic activity (Xanthis2023Human). Despite its inactivity in aldehyde oxidation, ALDH16A1 is believed to have significant biological roles through protein-protein interactions. It interacts with maspardin, a protein linked to Mast syndrome, suggesting a role in neurological processes (Xanthis2023Human; Hanna2009Interaction).

ALDH16A1 is highly expressed in the kidney, particularly in the proximal and distal convoluted tubule cells, and is associated with uric acid homeostasis. A rare missense variant in ALDH16A1 has been linked to elevated serum uric acid levels and gout, indicating a potential interaction with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT1), which is involved in uric acid metabolism (Charkoftaki2017Transcriptomic; Xanthis2023Human). The gene's expression pattern and structural characteristics suggest it may play a role in lipid metabolism and renal function, potentially influencing solute transporters in the kidney (Charkoftaki2017Transcriptomic). While its exact physiological role in humans remains to be fully elucidated, ALDH16A1 may serve as an allosteric regulator or binding scaffold, influencing other proteins and metabolic processes (Xanthis2023Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ALDH16A1 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, particularly gout and hyperuricemia. A rare missense single nucleotide variant (SNV) in ALDH16A1, known as ALDH16A1*2, has been identified as a risk factor for these conditions. This variant results in a proline to arginine alteration, which may disrupt the gene's interaction with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1), a key enzyme in uric acid metabolism (Vasiliou2013ALDH16A1). The disruption of this interaction is thought to contribute to elevated serum uric acid levels, leading to gout (Vasiliou2013ALDH16A1).

In addition to its role in gout, ALDH16A1 has been implicated in renal function. Studies using Aldh16a1-null mice have shown differential expression of genes involved in uric acid homeostasis, suggesting that reduced expression of ALDH16A1 may alter uric acid transport in the kidney, potentially contributing to hyperuricemia (Charkoftaki2017Transcriptomic). Furthermore, ALDH16A1 interacts with maspardin, a protein associated with Mast syndrome, a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia, indicating a potential role in neurological conditions (Hanna2009Interaction).

## Interactions
ALDH16A1, a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily, is known for its interactions with various proteins despite being a non-catalytic enzyme. It interacts with S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKIP-1), proteasomal ATPase-associated factor 1 (PAAF1), ubiquitin specific peptidase 1 (USP1), and protein kinase AMP-activated gamma 2 non-catalytic subunit (PRKAG2) (Charkoftaki2017Transcriptomic; Jackson2015Dead). These interactions suggest a role in cellular processes beyond enzymatic activity.

ALDH16A1 also interacts with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1), a key enzyme in uric acid metabolism. This interaction is significant as it may influence the etiology of gout, with certain mutations in ALDH16A1 affecting its interaction with HPRT1 (Xanthis2023Human; Vasiliou2013ALDH16A1). The protein is also associated with maspardin, which is linked to mast syndrome, although the functional implications of this interaction are not fully understood (Hanna2009Interaction).

Predicted interactions include those with albumin (ALB), solute carrier family 2-facilitated glucose transporter (SLC2A4), heat shock protein 90 kDa alpha class B member 1 (HSP90AB1), betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT), and glioblastoma amplified sequence (GBAS) (Charkoftaki2017Transcriptomic; Jackson2015Dead). These interactions highlight ALDH16A1's potential role in structural and binding properties rather than catalytic functions.
