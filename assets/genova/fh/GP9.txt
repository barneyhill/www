# GP9

## Overview
The GP9 gene encodes glycoprotein IX (GPIX), a transmembrane protein that is a vital component of the GPIb-IX-V complex on the surface of platelets. This complex plays a crucial role in platelet adhesion and aggregation, particularly under high shear stress conditions, by facilitating the binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to damaged vascular walls. GPIX, through its leucine-rich repeat domains, interacts with other components of the complex, such as GPIbα and GPIbβ, to form a stable structure necessary for platelet function. Mutations in the GP9 gene can lead to Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a bleeding disorder characterized by defective platelet adhesion due to impaired formation and function of the GPIb-IX-V complex (McEwan2011Quaternary; Savoia2014Spectrum).

## Structure
The GP9 gene encodes glycoprotein IX (GPIX), a component of the GPIb-IX-V complex on platelets, which is crucial for platelet adhesion. The GP9 gene is located on chromosome 3q21.3 and is organized into three exons, with exon 3 coding for the entire 177 amino acid sequence of GPIX (Savoia2014Spectrum). The primary structure of GPIX includes a signal peptide of 16 amino acids, a single leucine-rich repeat (LRR) flanked by LRR N-terminal (LRRNT) and LRR C-terminal (LRRCT) regions in the extracellular domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular domain consisting of eight residues (Savoia2014Spectrum).

The secondary structure is characterized by the LRR domain, which is a common structural motif involved in protein-protein interactions. The tertiary structure of GPIX is stabilized by disulfide bonds and glycosylation, which are important for its function and stability (Savoia2014Spectrum). In the quaternary structure, GPIX interacts with GPIbα and GPIbβ to form the GPIb-IX-V complex, essential for binding von Willebrand factor and platelet adhesion (Kenny1999The; Curtis2013Human). Mutations in GP9 can disrupt these interactions, leading to Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a bleeding disorder characterized by defective platelet adhesion (Nurden2013Congenital).

## Function
The GP9 gene encodes glycoprotein IX (GPIX), a critical component of the GPIb-IX-V complex on the platelet membrane. This complex is essential for platelet adhesion and aggregation, particularly under conditions of high shear stress, such as those found in blood vessels. GPIX, along with GPIbα and GPIbβ, forms a tetrameric structure that facilitates the binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a key step in platelet adhesion to damaged vascular walls (Gentilini2019A; McEwan2011Quaternary).

GPIX is involved in the proper assembly and surface expression of the GPIb-IX complex. It interacts with GPIbβ through leucine-rich repeat domains, forming a stable heterodimeric interface that is crucial for the complex's function (McEwan2011Quaternary). The transmembrane helix of GPIX bridges two GPIbβ helices, contributing to the stability and surface expression of the complex (McEwan2011Quaternary).

Mutations in GP9 can disrupt the formation and function of the GPIb-IX-V complex, leading to Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a bleeding disorder characterized by impaired platelet adhesion and aggregation (Salles2008Inherited; NURDEN2011Advances).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GP9 gene are associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS), a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, large dysfunctional platelets, and bleeding tendencies. These mutations disrupt the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex on the platelet surface, impairing platelet adhesion and aggregation, which are crucial for normal hemostasis (Rivera2001Identification; Savoia2014Spectrum). 

In humans, various mutations in the GP9 gene have been identified, including missense mutations such as p.Asn61Ser, which is prevalent in the European population due to a founder effect, and p.Cys24Arg, common in families from India and Pakistan (Savoia2014Spectrum). These mutations can lead to the absence or low expression of the GPIb-IX-V complex on platelets, affecting their function (Savoia2014Spectrum). 

In addition to humans, a large deletion in the GP9 gene has been identified in Cocker Spaniel dogs, leading to a BSS-like bleeding disorder. This deletion causes a frameshift and premature stop codon, truncating the protein and resulting in similar clinical manifestations as seen in humans, such as macrothrombocytopenia and bleeding tendencies (Gentilini2019A).

## Interactions
Glycoprotein IX (GP9) is a component of the platelet glycoprotein complex GPIb-IX-V, which is essential for platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. GP9 interacts closely with glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) and glycoprotein Ibβ (GPIbβ) within this complex. The interaction between GP9 and GPIbβ is particularly crucial for the surface expression of the GPIb-IX complex. Mutations in GPIbβ can disrupt this interaction, leading to a lack of surface expression of GP9, which is associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a bleeding disorder characterized by large platelets and a deficiency in the GPIb-IX complex (Kenny1999The).

The structural organization of the GPIb-IX complex involves a parallel tetrameric α-helical bundle, where GP9 bridges two GPIbβ transmembrane helices. This interaction is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains of GP9, which form a critical interface with GPIbβ (McEwan2011Quaternary). The convex loops of GP9 are essential for its interaction with GPIbβ, supporting the stability and surface expression of the complex (MO2009Binding).

GP9 also plays a role in drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, where drugs like quinine bind specifically to the C-terminal extracellular region of GP9, leading to the formation of drug-dependent antibodies (Ahmadi2017Druginduced).
