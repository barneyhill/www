# SPAG17

## Overview
The SPAG17 gene encodes the sperm associated antigen 17 protein, which plays a critical role in the function and structural integrity of motile cilia and flagella. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the axonemal central apparatus, particularly within the central pair microtubules, essential for the motility of sperm and other ciliated cells. SPAG17 is involved in the assembly and stability of the C1a projection of the central pair complex, interacting with other proteins such as SPAG6 and SPAG16L to maintain ciliary and flagellar function. Beyond its role in motility, SPAG17 is also implicated in spermiogenesis, affecting the manchette structure and protein transport necessary for sperm head and flagellum formation. Additionally, it has been associated with bone development, potentially influencing cellular signaling and mechanotransduction through primary cilia (Teves2015Spag17; Abdelhamed2020A; Kazarian2018SPAG17).

## Structure
The SPAG17 protein is encoded by the Spag17 gene, which consists of 49 exons and encodes a full-length protein of 2320 amino acids (Abdelhamed2020A). The protein structure includes a small coiled coil domain and two regions with compositional bias, specifically lysine-rich and glycine-rich areas, along with C-terminal Pfam domains associated with flagellar function. These domains are highly conserved in mammals (Abdelhamed2020A). The SPAG17 protein is a large protein, approximately 250 kDa, and is thought to act as a scaffold for the assembly of smaller components of the central pair complex (CPC) C1a projection (Kazarian2018SPAG17). The C-terminus of SPAG17 is essential for flagellar motility and assembly, while the N-terminal half is important for the stability of the C1a complex (Kazarian2018SPAG17).

SPAG17 interacts with other central pair proteins like SPAG6 and SPAG16L, forming complexes at the C1a microtubule projections (Abdelhamed2020A). The protein is expressed in the cytoplasm of round and condensing spermatids and co-localizes with manchette microtubule structures during spermiogenesis (Kazarian2018SPAG17). The role of SPAG17 extends beyond motility, affecting the manchette structure, protein transport, and formation of the sperm head and flagellum (Kazarian2018SPAG17).

## Function
The SPAG17 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the function of motile cilia and flagella, particularly within the axonemal central apparatus. In healthy human cells, SPAG17 is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of the central pair microtubules, which are essential for the motility of sperm and other ciliated cells (Xu2017A; Kazarian2018SPAG17). The protein is involved in the development and stability of the C1 microtubule structure within motile cilia, playing a key role in the central pair apparatus, which is necessary for the rhythmic beating of cilia that moves fluids across epithelial surfaces (Abdelhamed2020A).

SPAG17 interacts with other proteins, such as SPAG6 and SPAG16L, within the C1a projection, and its absence can lead to severe ciliary motility defects, resulting in conditions like hydrocephalus, respiratory distress, and male infertility due to impaired sperm flagellum development (Abdelhamed2020A). The protein is also involved in the formation and function of the manchette, a microtubular structure essential for intracellular transport during spermatogenesis, affecting sperm head and flagellum formation (Kazarian2018SPAG17). Additionally, SPAG17 is implicated in bone development, potentially through its role in primary cilia, which are important for cellular signaling and mechanotransduction (Teves2015Spag17).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPAG17 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. SPAG17 is crucial for the function of motile cilia and flagella, and its dysfunction can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), characterized by respiratory distress and infertility due to impaired ciliary motility (Roberson2021RNASeq; Kazarian2018SPAG17). In males, SPAG17 mutations can result in severe asthenozoospermia, a condition marked by reduced sperm motility, leading to infertility. This is due to defects in sperm morphology, including abnormalities in the sperm head and flagellum (Xu2017A; Kazarian2018SPAG17).

SPAG17 is also implicated in skeletal malformations and bone abnormalities. Mutations in this gene can cause shorter limb lengths, altered bone maturation, and reduced mineralization, suggesting its role in bone development and ossification (Teves2015Spag17). Additionally, decreased expression of SPAG17 has been observed in systemic sclerosis (SSc), a fibrotic disease, where it may play a role in antifibrotic signaling (Roberson2022Alterations). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in diverse physiological processes and its potential impact on human health when altered.

## Interactions
SPAG17 is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in spermiogenesis and ciliary motility. It interacts with protamines PRM1 and PRM2, which are crucial for chromatin compaction and nuclear remodeling in sperm cells. These interactions facilitate the nuclear translocation of protamines during spermiogenesis, a process disrupted in Spag17 knockout mice, leading to abnormal protamination and defects in chromatin compaction (AgudoRios2023SPAG17).

SPAG17 also plays a role in the organization of the manchette, a microtubular structure involved in protein transport during spermatid development. It recruits proteins such as Pcdp1 to the manchette microtubules, and its disruption affects the recruitment of proteins necessary for intramanchette transport (Kazarian2018SPAG17). SPAG17 is known to interact with SPAG6 and SPAG16L, which are important for the structural integrity and function of the axoneme in cilia and flagella (Kazarian2018SPAG17).

In the context of ciliary function, SPAG17 is the orthologue of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii PF6 protein, which interacts with calmodulin and other proteins to influence the sliding activity of outer doublets in cilia and flagella (Teves2015Spag17). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structure and function of microtubules, particularly in the axonemal central pair complex.
