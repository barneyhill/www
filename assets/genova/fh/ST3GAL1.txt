# ST3GAL1

## Overview
ST3GAL1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 1, a type II membrane protein involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme plays a critical role in the transfer of sialic acid to terminal galactose residues, forming α2,3-linkages on oligosaccharide chains, which are essential for various biological processes such as cell trafficking, signaling, and immune regulation (OrtizSoto2019Structural). The enzyme's activity is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids, impacting cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways (OrtizSoto2019Structural). Alterations in ST3GAL1 expression have been associated with cancer progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies (Wu2018Sialyltransferase; Pietrobono2020ST3GAL1).

## Structure
The ST3GAL1 gene encodes the human beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 1 enzyme, which is involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The primary structure of ST3Gal1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure is characterized by a mixed αβ fold, with seven twisted β-strands flanked by 12 α-helices (OrtizSoto2016Expression). The tertiary structure includes a Rossmann-like fold, which is common in enzymes that bind nucleotides, and is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity (OrtizSoto2019Structural).

The enzyme contains several disulphide bonds, such as C142-C281 and C61-C139, which are essential for its structural integrity and activity. These bonds contribute to the stabilization of the enzyme's β-sheet and α-helix structures (OrtizSoto2019Structural). The quaternary structure of ST3Gal1 has not been explicitly detailed, but the enzyme is known to function as a monomer (OrtizSoto2016Expression).

ST3Gal1 is a type II membrane protein, featuring a transmembrane domain and a catalytic domain. The enzyme's structure is modeled based on its porcine homolog, which shares 85% identity, providing insights into its substrate binding and catalytic mechanisms (OrtizSoto2019Structural).

## Function
ST3GAL1 encodes the enzyme beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 1, which plays a crucial role in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to terminal galactose residues, forming α2,3-linkages on oligosaccharide chains. This process is essential for various biological recognition processes, including cell trafficking, transmembrane signaling, and immunological regulation (OrtizSoto2019Structural).

In healthy human cells, ST3GAL1 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the normal functioning of cellular processes by modifying glycoproteins and glycolipids. The enzyme's activity is integral to maintaining cell-cell interactions, signaling pathways, and the stability of glycoproteins, impacting immune responses and cell adhesion (OrtizSoto2019Structural).

The structural integrity and enzymatic activity of ST3GAL1 are influenced by specific residues and disulphide bonds, which are crucial for substrate binding and catalytic efficiency. Mutations in these residues can significantly affect the enzyme's function, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (OrtizSoto2019Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ST3GAL1 gene have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers, including ovarian cancer and melanoma. In ovarian cancer, ST3GAL1 is upregulated, particularly in higher-grade tumors, and is associated with increased cell growth, migration, invasion, and resistance to the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel. This resistance is linked to the gene's role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis (Wu2018Sialyltransferase). 

In melanoma, ST3GAL1 is also upregulated and contributes to cancer progression by enhancing the invasiveness and motility of melanoma cells. It is a target of the SOX2-GLI1 transcriptional complex and promotes metastasis through the activation of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase. This interaction facilitates melanoma cell invasion and metastasis, suggesting that the ST3GAL1-AXL axis is a key driver of melanoma progression (Pietrobono2020ST3GAL1).

The gene's role in cancer is linked to its function in sialylation, a post-translational modification that affects cell adhesion and signaling. Targeting ST3GAL1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy to combat cancer metastasis and drug resistance (OrtizSoto2019Structural; Pietrobono2020ST3GAL1).

## Interactions
ST3GAL1, a sialyltransferase enzyme, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cancer progression. In breast cancer, ST3GAL1 interacts with vasorin (VASN), facilitating its sialylation. This modification enhances the interaction of VASN with TGF-β1, promoting tumor angiogenesis and progression through the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) (Yeo2019Sialylation).

In melanoma, ST3GAL1 interacts with the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. This interaction involves the sialylation of AXL, which enhances its dimerization and autophosphorylation, promoting melanoma cell invasion and metastasis. The ST3GAL1-AXL axis is a significant driver of melanoma metastasis, and silencing ST3GAL1 reduces melanoma cell motility and invasiveness (Pietrobono2020ST3GAL1).

ST3GAL1 is also implicated in the modulation of other proteins such as the nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in melanoma, affecting their sialylation and activity. These interactions contribute to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance the invasive properties of melanoma cells (Pietrobono2020ST3GAL1).
