# FLYWCH1

## Overview
FLYWCH1 is a gene that encodes the FLYWCH-type zinc finger 1 protein, which is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, suggesting a role in DNA binding and protein interactions. This protein functions primarily as a nuclear transcription factor involved in DNA repair and cell signaling pathways, particularly within the DNA damage response (DDR) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. FLYWCH1 is implicated in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and acts as a suppressor of nuclear β-catenin, influencing cell migration and morphology, which may contribute to tumor suppression. The protein's interaction with β-catenin is phosphorylation-independent and involves competition with TCF4, affecting transcriptional activity. FLYWCH1's role in cellular processes extends to clinical significance, with implications in colorectal cancer, coronary artery disease, and potentially other conditions due to its regulatory functions in cellular homeostasis and response to DNA damage (Almozyan2021FLYWCH1; Muhammad2018FLYWCH1; Foroughi2015Expression).

## Structure
The FLYWCH1 protein is encoded by the human FLYWCH1 gene and consists of 716 amino acids (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1). It features a tandem array of five FLYWCH-type zinc-finger motifs, which are part of its primary structure and suggest potential DNA-binding capabilities (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1). These zinc-finger motifs are evolutionarily conserved in mammals and are typically involved in protein-protein interactions and DNA binding (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1).

The secondary structure of FLYWCH1 likely involves zinc-finger domains forming stable folds stabilized by zinc ions (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1). The tertiary structure is influenced by these motifs and includes a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif (KRAK), which resembles classical NLS consensus sequences, facilitating its nuclear localization (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1).

In terms of quaternary structure, FLYWCH1 interacts with unphosphorylated β-catenin, a key player in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and this interaction is phosphorylation-independent (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1). The C-terminal domain of FLYWCH1 is crucial for its interaction with β-catenin and its complete nuclear localization (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1).

## Function
The FLYWCH1 gene encodes a zinc finger protein that functions as a nuclear transcription factor, primarily involved in DNA repair and cell signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, FLYWCH1 is implicated in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It colocalizes with γH2AX, a marker for DSBs, and can induce the expression of γH2AX, ATM, and P53 proteins, which are crucial for DNA repair processes (Almozyan2021FLYWCH1). FLYWCH1 can mediate the phosphorylation of H2AX independently of ATM expression, suggesting an ATM-independent role in DDR (Almozyan2021FLYWCH1).

FLYWCH1 also interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, acting as a suppressor of nuclear β-catenin. It competes with TCF4 for binding to β-catenin, thereby inhibiting β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. This interaction affects cell migration and morphology, potentially contributing to tumor suppression by regulating cell adhesion and motility (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1). The protein is localized to nuclear bodies, nucleoplasm, and cytosol, indicating its active role in nuclear functions and cellular homeostasis (Almozyan2021FLYWCH1). Despite these insights, the precise role of FLYWCH1 in healthy human cells remains largely uncharacterized, necessitating further research (Almozyan2021FLYWCH1).

## Clinical Significance
FLYWCH1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), FLYWCH1 acts as a suppressor of nuclear β-catenin, influencing cell migration and morphology. Alterations in FLYWCH1 expression are associated with increased cell motility and invasion, which are critical steps in cancer metastasis. The downregulation of FLYWCH1 correlates with the upregulation of genes like ZEB1 and EPHA4 in advanced tumors, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role for FLYWCH1 (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1). 

FLYWCH1 is also involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. Its overexpression induces the expression of γH2AX, ATM, and P53 proteins, which are crucial for DDR signaling. This suggests that FLYWCH1 may play a role in cancer biology by affecting how cells respond to DNA damage, potentially offering a target for anticancer therapies (Almozyan2021FLYWCH1).

In cardiovascular health, FLYWCH1 has been linked to coronary artery disease (CAD). It is identified as a master regulatory gene associated with coronary atherosclerosis, influencing cholesterol-ester accumulation in foam cells, which are key in atherosclerosis development (Foroughi2015Expression).

## Interactions
FLYWCH1 interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, and plays a significant role in modulating its transcriptional activity. FLYWCH1 competes with TCF4 for binding to β-catenin, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and competitive binding assays. This competition reduces the interaction between β-catenin and TCF4, thereby affecting the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in colorectal cancer (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1). FLYWCH1 also competes with TCF4 for binding to Tcf-DNA binding sites, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, which indicates that FLYWCH1 can modulate transcriptional repression by preventing the association of TCF4/β-catenin to these sites (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1).

The interaction between FLYWCH1 and β-catenin is dependent on the structural integrity of both proteins. The C-terminal deletion of FLYWCH1 results in the loss of interaction with β-catenin, highlighting the importance of the C-terminus for this interaction (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1). FLYWCH1 binds specifically to unphosphorylated β-catenin, and this interaction is stronger with certain β-catenin mutants (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1). The presence of a GSK-3 inhibitor enhances the interaction between FLYWCH1 and β-catenin, suggesting that phosphorylation status influences their binding (Muhammad2018FLYWCH1).
