# ACTA1

## Overview
The ACTA1 gene encodes the skeletal muscle α-actin protein, a highly conserved and essential component of the sarcomeric thin filaments in muscle fibers. This protein plays a pivotal role in muscle contraction by interacting with myosin within the sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of muscle tissue. As a member of the actin protein family, skeletal muscle α-actin is categorized as a structural protein, contributing significantly to the architecture and function of muscle fibers. It is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it constitutes a substantial portion of muscle protein, underscoring its critical role in muscle physiology. Mutations in the ACTA1 gene are associated with various congenital myopathies, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in muscle function and disease (Laing2009Mutations; Nowak2012Skeletal).

## Structure
The ACTA1 gene encodes the skeletal muscle α-actin protein, which is a crucial component of the sarcomeric thin filaments in muscle fibers. The primary structure of the mature skeletal muscle α-actin consists of 375 amino acids, formed by the cleavage of the N-terminal 2 amino acid residues from the precursor protein (Laing2009Mutations; Nowak2012Skeletal). The protein is highly conserved, showing 99% identity with cardiac α-actin and 100% homology with mouse skeletal muscle α-actin (Laing2009Mutations).

The tertiary structure of α-actin is globular, known as G-actin, which polymerizes into filamentous F-actin. This polymerization results in a helical filament where subdomains 3 and 4 are near the axis, and subdomains 1 and 2 are on the outer edge (Laing2009Mutations). The actin monomer is divided into two domains by a cleft containing a bound nucleotide and cation, typically Mg²⁺, which is essential for its function (Laing2009Mutations).

In terms of quaternary structure, F-actin forms the core of the sarcomeric thin filament and interacts with other proteins such as nebulin, tropomyosins, and troponins, facilitating muscle contraction (Laing2009Mutations). The ACTA1 protein's surface is functionally significant due to interactions with over 100 other actin-binding proteins (Nowak2012Skeletal).

## Function
The ACTA1 gene encodes the skeletal muscle α-actin protein, which is a critical component of the thin filaments in muscle fibers. In healthy human cells, α-skeletal actin plays a central role in muscle contraction by interacting with myosin within the sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of muscle tissue. This interaction is essential for generating the force required for muscle movement and contraction (Nowak2012Skeletal; Clarke2007The).

Skeletal muscle α-actin is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it contributes significantly to the structure and function of muscle fibers. It accounts for more than 20% of muscle protein, underscoring its importance in muscle physiology (Nowak2012Skeletal). The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its critical role in muscle function and its interaction with over 100 other actin-binding proteins (Nowak2012Skeletal).

In the sarcomere, α-skeletal actin forms the backbone of the thin filament, facilitating the sliding mechanism with myosin that leads to muscle contraction. This process is regulated by tropomyosin, which controls the exposure of myosin binding sites on actin filaments, depending on calcium ion concentration (Clarke2007The). The precise regulation and interaction of these proteins are vital for maintaining normal muscle function and movement.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTA1 gene, which encodes skeletal muscle alpha-actin, are linked to several congenital myopathies. These include nemaline myopathy, intranuclear rod myopathy, actin filament aggregate myopathy, congenital fiber type disproportion, and myopathy with core-like areas (Laing2009Mutations). Nemaline myopathy, characterized by the presence of nemaline bodies in muscle tissue, can range from severe forms requiring immediate respiratory support at birth to milder forms allowing survival into adulthood (Laing2009Mutations). ACTA1 mutations account for approximately 20% to 30% of nemaline myopathy cases, particularly in severe subtypes (Laing2009Mutations).

The majority of ACTA1 mutations are dominant and often occur de novo, meaning they are not inherited from the parents (Laing2009Mutations). These mutations can lead to abnormal proteins that interfere with normal muscle function, resulting in muscle weakness and structural abnormalities (Nowak2012Skeletal). In some cases, ACTA1 mutations result in recessive diseases, often leading to a total absence or lack of functional ACTA1 protein (Nowak2012Skeletal).

The clinical presentation of ACTA1-related myopathies can vary significantly, even among patients with the same mutation, due to factors such as genetic heterogeneity and incomplete penetrance (Pelin2019Update; Agrawal2004Heterogeneity).

## Interactions
The ACTA1 gene encodes skeletal muscle α-actin, a crucial component of the sarcomeric thin filament involved in muscle contraction. This protein interacts with several other proteins to facilitate its function. Skeletal muscle α-actin interacts with nebulin, tropomyosins, and troponins, which are essential for muscle contraction. When calcium binds to the troponin complex, it causes a conformational change that moves tropomyosin, exposing myosin binding sites on α-actin, allowing actin-myosin interaction and muscle contraction (Laing2009Mutations).

ACTA1 also interacts with proteins in the Z-disc and with myosins in the thick filament, playing a role in the structural integrity of muscle fibers (Laing2009Mutations). Mutations in ACTA1 can disrupt these interactions, leading to various muscle disorders. For instance, the D286G mutation affects the actin-actin interface, impairing myosin binding and contributing to nemaline myopathy (Ochala2012Nemaline; Fan2018Molecular). The A-triad, involving residues K326 and K328, is crucial for electrostatic interactions with tropomyosin, affecting muscle contractility by influencing myosin cross-bridge formation (Schmidt2019The). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions that ACTA1 participates in to regulate muscle function.
