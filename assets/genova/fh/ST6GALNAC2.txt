# ST6GALNAC2

## Overview
ST6GALNAC2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 2, which is a type of glycosyltransferase. This enzyme is primarily involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, a process that adds sialic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine residues. This modification is crucial for various cellular functions, including cell-cell interactions, signaling, and immune responses (Li2018Sialylation). The enzyme operates within the Golgi apparatus and plays a significant role in processes such as cell adhesion and migration, impacting tissue development and immune function (Li2018Sialylation). ST6GALNAC2 is particularly relevant in the context of diseases such as IgA nephropathy and colorectal cancer, where its expression and activity are linked to disease pathogenesis and progression (Li2007Variants; Jia2017miR182). The gene's interactions with various proteins and its regulation by microRNAs underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Ahmad2024Differential; Jia2017miR182).

## Function
ST6GALNAC2 encodes an enzyme that functions as an alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase, which is involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme specifically adds sialic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine residues, a modification that plays a crucial role in cell-cell interactions, signaling, and immune responses (Li2018Sialylation). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences processes such as cell adhesion and migration, impacting tissue development and immune function (Li2018Sialylation).

Sialylation, facilitated by ST6GALNAC2, acts as an anti-adhesive glycotope due to the negative charge of sialic acid, which prevents cell adhesion by causing charge repulsion. This modification also serves as a receptor for specific ligands, such as Siglecs and selectins, facilitating signal transduction between cells (Li2018Sialylation). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining normal cellular processes, including pluripotent cell maintenance and normal embryonic development, as indicated by the lethality observed when sialylation pathways are disrupted (Li2018Sialylation). These functions underscore the importance of ST6GALNAC2 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ST6GALNAC2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In IgAN, a common form of glomerulonephritis, the ADG haplotype in the promoter region of ST6GALNAC2 is associated with increased susceptibility to the disease. This haplotype is more frequent in IgAN patients and correlates with reduced promoter activity, leading to lower levels of a2,6 sialic acid on IgA1 molecules. This deficiency in sialylation is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of IgAN by affecting the biochemical properties of IgA1 (Li2007Variants).

In colorectal cancer, the expression of ST6GALNAC2 is negatively regulated by microRNAs miR-182 and miR-135b. These microRNAs are overexpressed in CRC tissues, leading to decreased levels of ST6GALNAC2, which in turn promotes tumorigenesis and invasiveness. The downregulation of ST6GALNAC2 by these microRNAs enhances the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, a critical pathway in cancer cell proliferation and survival. This regulatory axis suggests that ST6GALNAC2 plays a significant role in CRC progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target (Jia2017miR182).

## Interactions
ST6GALNAC2 is involved in several interactions that are significant in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). It has been shown to interact with proteins such as AHSG, an oncogene linked to metabolic processes in cancer, and EEF1A2, which is involved in protein translation elongation and can regulate signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT and mTOR. These interactions suggest that ST6GALNAC2 may play a role in modulating sialoglycan synthesis and tumor progression (Ahmad2024Differential).

The expression of ST6GALNAC2 is also associated with immune cell infiltration in colon adenocarcinomas, potentially affecting immune tolerance and metastasis. This interaction with the tumor microenvironment may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches (Ahmad2024Differential). The binding of the STn antigen and Siglec-15, driven by ST6GALNAC2 overexpression, is noted to enhance tumor heterogeneity and immune tolerance, indicating a role in immune evasion (Ahmad2024Differential).

ST6GALNAC2's expression is influenced by miRNAs, such as miR-21 and miR-30e, which can lead to gene silencing and affect tumor heterogeneity and treatment resistance (Ahmad2024Differential). These interactions highlight the complex role of ST6GALNAC2 in CRC progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
