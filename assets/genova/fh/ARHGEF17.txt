# ARHGEF17

## Overview
ARHGEF17 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 17, also known as TEM4. This protein is categorized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by activating RhoA, a member of the Rho GTPase family. TEM4 is integral to various cellular processes, including the regulation of the cell cycle, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and maintenance of cell morphology. It is particularly involved in the progression of the G1 phase and mitotic entry, as well as in the spindle assembly checkpoint, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Additionally, TEM4 contributes to cell-cell adhesion and endothelial barrier function, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular structure and signaling pathways (Prifti2024ARHGEF17TEM4; Ngok2013TEM4).

## Structure
The ARHGEF17 protein, also known as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 17, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by several distinct domains. The primary structure includes a Dbl homology (DH) domain, which is crucial for catalyzing GDP/GTP exchange specifically at RhoA, but not at Rac1 or Cdc42 (Lutz2013RhoGEF17). Adjacent to the DH domain is a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which was initially questioned but later confirmed. This PH domain contains a 60 amino acid insertion and may contribute to membrane attachment by binding phospholipids (Lutz2013RhoGEF17).

The protein also features an N-terminal actin-binding domain and a C-terminal seven-blade propeller-like structure formed by WD40 repeats, which are common in protein-protein interactions (Lutz2013RhoGEF17). The presence of several theoretical phosphorylation sites has been identified, with specific phosphorylation by cGKIα enhancing its activity (Lutz2013RhoGEF17). Phosphorylation at sites S43 and S1331 is crucial for activation, with S1331 phosphorylation inducing a conformational change that allows access to S43, relieving autoinhibition (Lutz2013RhoGEF17). The protein's molecular weight is approximately 220 kD, aligning with the theoretical weight of 226.7 kD (Lutz2013RhoGEF17). The context does not provide detailed information on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, nor does it mention splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The ARHGEF17 gene encodes a protein known as TEM4, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specifically for RhoA, a member of the Rho GTPase family. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly in the progression of the G1 phase and entry into mitosis. TEM4 is involved in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell migration, cell-cell junction formation, and maintaining cell morphology (Prifti2024ARHGEF17TEM4; Lutz2013RhoGEF17).

TEM4's activity is regulated by its binding to dynamic F-actin filaments, which is necessary for its subcellular localization and function. It localizes to the actin cytoskeleton during interphase and to the actin cortex during mitosis, where it contributes to cortical functions such as retraction fiber formation and spindle positioning (Prifti2024ARHGEF17TEM4). TEM4 also plays a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) by targeting the checkpoint kinase Mps1 to kinetochores, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Isokane2016ARHGEF17).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, TEM4 is involved in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and endothelial barrier function, associating with the cadherin-catenin complex and cytoskeleton-associated proteins (Ngok2013TEM4). This multifaceted role highlights TEM4's importance in cellular structure and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARHGEF17 gene have been associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Several variants, such as c.4394C>A_p.Ala1465Asp, c.5168G>A_p.Arg1723Gln, and c.5327G>A_p.Cys1776Tyr, have been found to cosegregate with IAs in familial studies. The variant c.3511G>A_p.Ala1171Thr was identified in a Chinese sporadic IA patient, and c.5581C>T_p.Arg1861Cys was found in a French-Canadian family. These findings suggest that ARHGEF17 plays a role in maintaining blood vessel integrity, as its depletion leads to defective endothelial cell junctions (Yang2018Rho).

In addition to its role in vascular conditions, ARHGEF17 mutations have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. A study reported on siblings from a consanguineous Pakistani family with biallelic variants in ARHGEF17, associated with intellectual disability, speech delay, and motor dysfunction. This expands the phenotypic spectrum of ARHGEF17 mutations beyond vascular issues to include neurodevelopmental diseases (Ravindran2022Case).

ARHGEF17 is also essential for the spindle assembly checkpoint during mitosis. Its depletion leads to mitotic errors, which could potentially contribute to cancer progression, although specific diseases related to this function have not been directly addressed (Isokane2016ARHGEF17).

## Interactions
ARHGEF17, also known as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 17, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. During mitosis, ARHGEF17 specifically interacts with the kinase Mps1. This interaction is essential for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) function, as ARHGEF17 targets Mps1 to kinetochores, ensuring proper checkpoint activity. The interaction between ARHGEF17 and Mps1 is regulated by Mps1's kinase activity, with ARHGEF17 serving as a substrate for Mps1, which phosphorylates it at three threonine residues (T119, T312, and T375) (Isokane2016ARHGEF17).

ARHGEF17 also interacts with cGKIα, a cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, in the presence of cGMP. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of ARHGEF17 by cGKIα, which activates RhoA, a member of the RhoGTPase family. The phosphorylation and interaction occur only when cGMP is present, highlighting a specific regulatory mechanism (Lutz2013RhoGEF17).

These interactions underscore ARHGEF17's role in regulating key cellular processes, including mitotic progression and cytoskeletal dynamics, through its interactions with Mps1 and cGKIα.
