# C2orf81

## Overview
C2orf81 is a gene located on chromosome 2 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 81. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, as its specific biological functions and interactions remain largely unexplored. Despite the limited understanding of its role, studies suggest that C2orf81 may be involved in various cellular processes due to its expression in multiple tissues. Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise functions and potential clinical significance of the C2orf81 protein, as well as its interactions with other molecular pathways.
