# F13B

## Overview
The F13B gene encodes the B subunit of coagulation factor XIII, a critical component in the blood coagulation process. Unlike the catalytic A subunit, the B subunit is non-enzymatic and functions primarily as a stabilizer and carrier for the A subunit, facilitating its transport and stability in plasma. The protein encoded by F13B, known as the coagulation factor XIII B chain, is characterized by its structure comprising ten sushi domains, which are essential for its interaction with the A subunit to form the FXIII-A2B2 complex. This complex plays a pivotal role in the cross-linking of fibrin clots, thereby enhancing their stability and contributing to effective wound healing and hemostasis. The F13B gene and its protein product are significant in maintaining the balance between clot formation and dissolution, with implications for various clinical conditions, including thrombosis and myocardial infarction (Ambroziak2019Increased; Deng2020Novel; Darul2024An).

## Structure
The F13B gene encodes the B subunit of coagulation factor XIII, which is a non-catalytic component of the FXIII complex. The FXIII-B protein is composed of 641 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 80 kDa. It is characterized by ten short tandem repeated structures, each consisting of 60 amino acids, known as sushi domains (SD). These domains are held together by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the protein (Darul2024An; Gupta2016Revisiting).

The quaternary structure of FXIII-B involves its existence as a dimer, with the fourth and ninth sushi domains playing a role in the homodimer assembly of FXIII-B2. The interaction between FXIII-A and FXIII-B subunits to form the FXIII-A2B2 complex involves the first sushi domain of FXIII-B. Notably, deglycosylation of FXIII-B does not affect this binding, indicating that carbohydrate chains are not essential for the assembly of the complex (Darul2024An).

The FXIII-B subunit is synthesized by hepatocytes and circulates in excess, forming a complex with the A subunits to stabilize them. This interaction prolongs the half-life of the FXIII-A2B2 tetramer compared to the A2 subunits alone (Darul2024An).

## Function
The F13B gene encodes the B subunit of coagulation factor XIII, which plays a crucial role in the stabilization of blood clots. In healthy human cells, the B subunit acts as a carrier for the catalytic A subunit, facilitating its transport and stabilization in plasma. This interaction is essential for maintaining the proper function of factor XIII in the coagulation process (Ambroziak2019Increased). 

Factor XIII is a plasma protein that, upon activation by thrombin in the presence of calcium, cross-links fibrin clots, thereby enhancing their stability. This cross-linking process is vital for the structural integrity of the clot matrix, contributing to effective wound healing and prevention of excessive bleeding (Deng2020Novel). The B subunit, while lacking enzymatic activity, is thought to stabilize the A subunit in circulation, ensuring its availability and proper function in the coagulation cascade (Ambroziak2019Increased).

The stabilization and transport functions of the B subunit are critical for the overall activity of factor XIII, influencing the balance between thrombus formation and dissolution, which is essential for normal hemostatic processes (Ambroziak2019Increased).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the F13B gene, which encodes the B subunit of coagulation factor XIII, have been associated with various clinical conditions. The His95Arg variant of the F13B gene is linked to increased susceptibility to thrombosis and myocardial infarction, particularly in populations of African origin (Ryan2008Natural). This variant, along with the IntK splice variant, has been associated with modified susceptibility or survivorship in patients with severe atherosclerotic disease and myocardial infarction (Ryan2008Natural). The IntK splice variant is also overrepresented in coronary artery bypass graft patients, suggesting a potential link to ischemic stroke (Ryan2008Natural).

In addition to cardiovascular implications, genetic predispositions in the F13B gene have been linked to abdominal adhesion formation and bowel obstruction. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the F13B gene, such as the H95R variant, are associated with an increased risk of these complications following abdominal surgery (Gemmati2018Inherited). These genetic markers may serve as prognostic indicators for post-surgical complications, with potential gender-specific effects (Gemmati2018Inherited). The presence of these SNPs can significantly affect event-free survival, highlighting their clinical significance in surgical outcomes (Gemmati2018Inherited).

## Interactions
The F13B gene encodes the B subunit of coagulation factor XIII, which plays a crucial role in the stabilization of blood clots. The FXIIIB subunit interacts with the FXIIIA subunit to form a heterotetrameric complex, FXIIIA2B2, which is essential for the proper activation and regulation of FXIII. The FXIIIB subunit has a protective and regulatory role, stabilizing the zymogenic form of FXIII and influencing its activation process. This interaction is mediated through calcium binding, which induces structural changes necessary for the activation of FXIII (Gupta2016Revisiting).

The FXIIIB subunit is composed of ten Sushi domains, which are involved in its interaction with FXIIIA. These interactions are primarily hydrophobic and involve specific residues such as Asn175, Asp297, and Lys677 on the FXIIIA subunit (Gupta2016Revisiting). The dissociation of FXIIIB from FXIIIA, influenced by calcium saturation, exposes the catalytic site of FXIIIA, facilitating its activation (Gupta2016Revisiting).

FXIIIB also interacts with fibrinogen, although differences in the FXIIIB C-terminus do not significantly affect this binding. The dissociation of FXIIIB may expose sites on FXIIIA that are susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, potentially contributing to the down-regulation of FXIIIA activity (Gupta2016Revisiting).
