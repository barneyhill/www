# SMCP

## Overview
The SMCP gene encodes the sperm mitochondria-associated cysteine-rich protein, a crucial component in the structural organization of sperm cells. This protein is primarily involved in the stabilization of the mitochondrial sheath, a structure essential for maintaining the integrity and function of sperm mitochondria, thereby supporting sperm motility and male fertility (Djureinovic2014The). SMCP is categorized as an intrinsically unstructured protein, characterized by its hydrophilic nature and lack of hydrophobic globular domains, which distinguishes it from other proteins in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) gene cluster (Hawthorne2006Comparative). The protein's unique structure, including a central region rich in cysteine, proline, glutamine, and lysine, allows it to form disulfide bridges that provide rigidity to the mitochondrial capsule (Hawthorne2006Comparative). The gene's expression is tightly regulated at the translational level, involving complex interactions with untranslated regions of its mRNA, which are crucial for the timing of protein synthesis during spermatid development (Bagarova2010Identification; Kleene2013Connecting).

## Structure
The SMCP protein is characterized by its tripartite structure, consisting of an amino-terminal segment, a central segment with short tandem repeats, and a C-terminal segment. The amino-terminal segment is consistently 8 amino acids long and includes aspartic acid, lysine, and either cysteine or serine (Hawthorne2006Comparative). The central segment is rich in cysteine, proline, glutamine, and lysine, which are associated with intrinsically unstructured protein segments. This region contains variable tandem repeats that differ in sequence and number across species (Hawthorne2006Comparative). The C-terminal segment, which lacks repeats, varies from 42 to 54 amino acids and contains a conserved C-terminal lysine (Hawthorne2006Comparative).

SMCP is generally hydrophilic, with the most hydrophilic region near the carboxy terminus and a short hydrophobic segment at the junction of the middle and C-terminal segments (Hawthorne2006Comparative). The protein is likely an intrinsically unstructured protein, lacking hydrophobic globular domains (Hawthorne2006Comparative). SMCP is crosslinked by disulfide bridges, which provide stiffness to the mitochondrial capsule of sperm (Hawthorne2006Comparative). No SMCP paralogues have been identified in the genomes of mouse, rat, human, bull, and dog, indicating its unique evolutionary path (Hawthorne2006Comparative).

## Function
The SMCP gene encodes the sperm mitochondria-associated cysteine-rich protein, which plays a critical role in the structural organization and stabilization of the mitochondrial sheath in sperm cells. This protein is expressed in spermatids and localizes to the capsule associated with the mitochondrial outer membranes. It is thought to function in the organization and stabilization of the helical structure of the sperm's mitochondrial sheath, which is crucial for the structural integrity of mitochondria in sperm cells, thereby supporting their function and motility (Djureinovic2014The).

SMCP is part of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) gene cluster and is characterized by a central region with short repeats rich in cysteine, proline, glutamine, and lysine. It is a hydrophilic protein likely belonging to the class of intrinsically unstructured proteins, which lack hydrophobic globular domains. Unlike other EDC proteins, which are crosslinked by transglutaminases, SMCP is crosslinked by disulfide bridges, contributing to its role in sperm motility and male fertility (Hawthorne2006Comparative).

The SMCP protein is involved in enhancing sperm motility, a key factor in male reproductive success, by maintaining the integrity and function of the mitochondrial sheath, which is vital for the proper functioning of spermatozoa (Hawthorne2006Comparative).

## Interactions
The SMCP protein is involved in translational control mechanisms in spermatids, primarily through interactions with untranslated regions (UTRs) of its mRNA. The 3' UTR of Smcp mRNA contains a Y-box recognition sequence (YRS) that is crucial for binding with Y-box proteins, specifically MSY2 and MSY4. This interaction is significant for the formation of heavy, inactive messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs), which are translationally repressed in early spermatids (Bagarova2010Identification). The binding of Y-box proteins to the Smcp mRNA is implicated in its translational repression, highlighting the role of these proteins in regulating the timing of SMCP protein synthesis (Bagarova2010Identification).

The 5' UTR of Smcp mRNA also plays a role in translational repression through upstream open reading frames (uORFs), which can prevent ribosomes from re-initiating translation at the authentic open reading frame downstream. This mechanism involves the release of the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-tRNAiMet) from the 40S ribosomal subunit, contributing to the delayed translation of SMCP protein (Kleene2013Connecting). These interactions underscore the complex regulatory controls involving both UTRs that modulate the timing and extent of SMCP translation in spermatids (Bagarova2010Identification).
