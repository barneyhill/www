# SAG

## Overview
The SAG gene encodes the S-antigen visual arrestin, a critical protein in the phototransduction pathway, which is essential for vision. This protein functions primarily as an arrestin, a category of proteins that regulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activity by binding to phosphorylated receptors, thereby preventing further signaling. S-antigen visual arrestin specifically interacts with phosphorylated rhodopsin, a light-sensitive receptor, to terminate the phototransduction cascade, ensuring proper visual function and preventing overstimulation of photoreceptor cells (Gurevich1997Mechanism; Palczewski1994Structure). Beyond its role in vision, the SAG gene also encodes a protein with antioxidant properties and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, contributing to cellular protection against oxidative stress and regulation of protein degradation (Duan1999SAG; Sun2012Functional). Mutations in the SAG gene are linked to retinal diseases such as Oguchi disease and retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining retinal health (Sergouniotis2011MizuoNakamura; Pappalardo2020Progressive).

## Structure
The SAG gene encodes the S-antigen visual arrestin protein, which is crucial in the phototransduction pathway by deactivating rhodopsin. The primary structure of SAG consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes a combination of alpha helices and beta sheets, with spectroscopic analyses suggesting that arrestin has about 56-63% extended strands, 12-19% turns and bends, and 15% alpha-helices (Palczewski1994Structure). The tertiary structure of arrestin is characterized by a two-lobe, immunoglobulin-like, β-strand sandwich structure, with N- and C-domains connected by a flexible loop (Aubry2009The). This structure is essential for its function in binding to phosphorylated GPCRs.

The quaternary structure of arrestin often involves dimer formation, which is significant for its functional activity. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a regulatory role in arrestin's activity (Burns2006Deactivation). The protein also undergoes N-terminal acetylation and is susceptible to proteolysis and deamination, contributing to its heterogeneity (Palczewski1994Structure). Splice variants of arrestin, such as p44 and p48, exhibit different affinities for rhodopsin and play distinct roles in photoreceptor cell function (Burns2006Deactivation).

## Function
The SAG gene, also known as RBX2, ROC2, or RNF7, encodes a protein that functions as both an antioxidant and an E3 ubiquitin ligase in human cells. As an antioxidant, SAG plays a crucial role in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting cells from oxidative stress. It achieves this by forming disulfide bonds and chelating metals like zinc and copper, which helps prevent radical chain reactions and lipid peroxidation (Duan1999SAG; Sun2012Functional). 

In its role as part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL-F-box Proteins) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, SAG promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of various protein substrates, including c-JUN, DEPTOR, HIF-1α, IκBα, NF1, NOXA, p27, and procaspase-3. This activity is essential for regulating signaling pathways and biological processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and response to stress (Sun2012Functional). 

SAG is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with particularly high expression in the heart, skeletal muscle, and testis, which are organs with high oxygen consumption (Duan1999SAG). The protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating its involvement in multiple cellular functions (Duan1999SAG).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SAG gene, which encodes the S-antigen visual arrestin, are associated with several retinal diseases, most notably Oguchi disease and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Oguchi disease is a rare autosomal recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness characterized by night blindness and a distinctive golden-yellow discoloration of the fundus, which normalizes after dark adaptation, known as the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon (Sergouniotis2011MizuoNakamura; Deng2022A). This condition is linked to various mutations in the SAG gene, including nonsense mutations and splicing alterations (Deng2022A; Tawfik2022Mutation).

Retinitis pigmentosa, on the other hand, can be caused by both recessive and dominant mutations in the SAG gene. Dominant mutations, such as the c.440 G > T mutation, have been identified in families with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), leading to progressive vision loss and retinal degeneration (Pappalardo2020Progressive; Sullivan2017A). These mutations often result in protein misfolding and instability, contributing to photoreceptor cell death (Pappalardo2020Progressive). The phenotypic expression of SAG mutations can vary significantly, with some individuals exhibiting symptoms of both Oguchi disease and RP, suggesting a spectrum of retinal dystrophies associated with this gene (Nishiguchi2019Phenotypic).

## Interactions
The SAG gene encodes S-antigen visual arrestin, a protein that plays a crucial role in the phototransduction pathway by interacting with several key proteins. Arrestin primarily interacts with phosphorylated rhodopsin, a light-sensitive receptor protein, to inhibit its activity and prevent continuous activation of the phototransduction cascade (Gurevich1997Mechanism; Palczewski1994Structure). This interaction is essential for the deactivation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and involves G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and other protein kinases (Palczewski1994Structure).

Arrestin also interacts with transducin, a G protein involved in the visual signal transduction pathway, and phosphodiesterase, which plays a role in the regulation of cyclic GMP levels in photoreceptor cells (Palczewski1994Structure). These interactions are part of arrestin's function in quenching G protein activation and terminating the phototransduction cascade. The protein's ability to bind to ligands such as heparin and inositol phosphates further influences its interaction with rhodopsin, highlighting its regulatory role in visual signal transduction (Palczewski1994Structure). These interactions underscore the importance of arrestin in maintaining visual function and preventing overstimulation of photoreceptor cells.
