# TIMP3

## Overview
TIMP3, or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3, is a gene that encodes the TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 protein, a critical component in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and tissue homeostasis. The TIMP3 protein is categorized as a matricellular protein due to its unique ability to bind to the ECM, distinguishing it from other TIMPs that are soluble in the extracellular milieu (Murphy2011Tissue). This protein plays a vital role in inhibiting a broad spectrum of metalloproteinases, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), ADAMs, and ADAMTSs, which are involved in ECM degradation and remodeling (Scilabra2018Increased). TIMP3 is also involved in regulating ectodomain shedding, angiogenesis, and immune responses, making it essential for maintaining tissue integrity and preventing pathological conditions associated with dysregulated ECM turnover and inflammation (Brew2010The; Spanò2022Tissue). Mutations in the TIMP3 gene have been linked to various diseases, including Sorsby's fundus dystrophy and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Darnton2005Tissue; Clarke2001Clinical).

## Structure
The TIMP3 protein is composed of 211 amino acids, including a secretion signal peptide, followed by the mature protein sequence. The mature TIMP3 protein is approximately 24 kDa, with an N-linked glycosylation site at Asn184, making the glycosylated form about 27 kDa (Fan2020Biology). The protein structure includes an N-terminal domain of about 125 amino acids and a C-terminal domain, each stabilized by three disulfide bonds formed by 12 conserved cysteine residues (Fan2020Biology; Brew2010The). The N-terminal domain has a wedge-like shape and contains an oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding (OB) fold, consisting of five β-pleated strands and both N-terminal and C-terminal α-helices (Fan2020Biology). 

TIMP3 is unique among TIMPs for its ability to bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM) due to a cluster of lysine and arginine residues, which is situated opposite the inhibitory ridge (Spanò2022Tissue). This ECM-binding motif distinguishes TIMP3 from other TIMPs that are soluble in the extracellular milieu. The C-terminal domain of TIMP3 interacts with MMP2 and MMP3, assisting in the MMP-inhibitory effects (Fan2020Biology). TIMP3 can also form a trimolecular complex with proMMP2 and MT3-MMP, enhancing the activation of proMMP2 (Fan2020Biology).

## Function
TIMP3 (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3) is a crucial regulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and tissue homeostasis in healthy human cells. It functions by inhibiting a broad range of metalloproteinases, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), ADAMs, and ADAMTSs, which are involved in ECM degradation and remodeling (Murphy2011Tissue; Scilabra2018Increased). TIMP3 is unique among TIMPs due to its strong binding to the ECM, which is facilitated by charge interactions with sulfated glycosaminoglycans, classifying it as a 'matricellular' protein (Murphy2011Tissue).

In cellular processes, TIMP3 regulates ectodomain shedding, a post-translational modification essential for cell communication, adhesion, and migration (Spanò2022Tissue). It acts as a master regulator of ectodomain shedding by inhibiting sheddases like ADAM17 and ADAM10, impacting processes such as inflammation, cell motility, and neuronal outgrowth (Spanò2022Tissue). TIMP3 also plays a role in angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, contributing to vascular stabilization and preventing excessive angiogenesis (Brew2010The; Spanò2022Tissue).

TIMP3's regulatory functions extend to modulating immune responses and inflammation by controlling the shedding of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and other cell surface proteins, thereby maintaining balanced TNF signaling and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Brew2010The; Spanò2022Tissue). Its activity is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and preventing pathological conditions associated with dysregulated ECM turnover and inflammation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TIMP3 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably Sorsby's fundus dystrophy (SFD), an autosomal dominant retinal disorder. SFD is characterized by the accumulation of protein and lipid deposits under the retinal pigment epithelium, leading to symptoms such as night blindness and progressive vision loss. Mutations in TIMP3, such as the G→T transversion in exon 5 resulting in a premature termination codon (E139X), are linked to severe forms of SFD with geographic macular atrophy and peripheral retinal pigmentary disturbances (Vergaro2024DiseaseCausing; Clarke2001Clinical).

TIMP3 mutations are also implicated in a novel syndrome combining SFD with pulmonary disease, characterized by distal bronchiolar and alveolar dysfunctions, leading to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Meunier2016A). In Turner syndrome, variations in TIMP3 are associated with aortopathy, including bicuspid aortic valve and thoracic aortic aneurysms, due to its role in maintaining aortic integrity (Corbitt2018TIMP3).

Alterations in TIMP3 expression, often due to promoter methylation, are linked to various cancers, including esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer. This methylation leads to reduced TIMP3 expression, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Darnton2005Tissue; Guan2013Promoter).

## Interactions
TIMP3 interacts with a wide range of metalloproteinases, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and members of the ADAM and ADAMTS families. It inhibits all MMPs, several ADAMs such as ADAM10, ADAM12, ADAM17, ADAM28, and ADAM33, and ADAMTS like ADAMTS1, ADAMTS2, ADAMTS4, and ADAMTS5 (Fan2020Biology). The N-terminal domain of TIMP3 is crucial for binding to these metalloproteinases, interacting with the catalytic domain of ADAM17 and enhancing its inhibitory effect through ADAM17 dimerization (Fan2020Biology). TIMP3 also forms stable complexes with ADAMTS-2, inhibiting its activity against procollagen types I, II, and III (Wang2006TIMP3).

TIMP3 binds to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through interactions with glycosaminoglycans, which protect it from degradation and enhance its inhibitory function (Fan2020Biology). It also interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), mediating its endocytosis and degradation (Fan2020Biology). TIMP3's interaction with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) inhibits VEGF-mediated angiogenesis at high concentrations (Fan2020Biology). Additionally, TIMP3 binds to fibulin-3, a matrix structural protein, through its C-domain, which is significant for its ECM binding (Logue2019Thermodynamic).
