# ELOC

## Overview
ELOC is a gene that encodes the protein elongin C, a key component of the Elongin complex involved in transcriptional regulation and protein degradation. Elongin C is categorized as an adapter protein within the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complexes, particularly CRL5, which are integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This protein plays a crucial role in facilitating the assembly and activity of these complexes, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as cytokine signaling and viral replication (Chen2018CRL4). Structurally, elongin C is characterized by a compact fold comprising three β-strands and three α-helices, which are essential for its interactions within the Elongin complex and with other proteins like von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) (Chen2023Structure; Stebbins1999Structure). Clinically, mutations in the ELOC gene have been linked to renal cell carcinoma and other cancers, highlighting its significance in oncogenic pathways and tumorigenesis (Raghavan2023Redefining; Shah2019“Renal).

## Structure
ELOC, or elongin C, is a subunit of the Elongin complex, which plays a role in transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. The protein structure of ELOC includes three β-strands and three α-helices, forming a compact fold that is crucial for its function within the complex (Chen2023Structure). The α3 helix of ELOC is particularly significant as it interacts with the BC box of ELOA, creating a hydrophobic interface of approximately 960 Å², which is essential for the stability of the Elongin complex (Chen2023Structure).

ELOC forms a heterodimeric subcomplex with ELOB, another subunit of the Elongin complex. This interaction is mediated through main chain hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in an interface of about 910 Å², although the atomic details of ELOB are less defined due to lower resolution (Chen2023Structure). ELOC's structure is similar to the SCF ubiquitin ligase subunit Skp1, indicating a conserved role in protein-protein interactions (Chen2023Structure).

ELOC is also involved in forming a ubiquitin ligase complex with CUL5-RBX2, which targets RPB1 in elongation-stalled Pol II, highlighting its role in transcription regulation and protein degradation pathways (Chen2023Structure).

## Function
ELOC, also known as elongin C, is a crucial component of the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complexes, particularly CRL5, which are involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In healthy human cells, ELOC functions as an adapter protein that facilitates the assembly and activity of CRL5 complexes. These complexes play a significant role in protein degradation and are essential for regulating various cellular processes, including cytokine signaling and viral replication (Chen2018CRL4).

ELOC is targeted by the CRL4 AMBRA1 complex for polyubiquitination and degradation, which modulates the activity of CRL5 complexes. This regulation is vital for maintaining the balance of signaling pathways such as interleukin-6/STAT3 and HIV-1 infectivity, which are influenced by CRL5 SOCS3 and CRL5 VIF, respectively (Chen2018CRL4). The degradation of ELOC by CRL4 AMBRA1 is necessary for the disassembly of CRL5 complexes, thereby modulating their activity and ensuring proper cellular function (Chen2018CRL4).

ELOC is also part of the VCB-CR complex, which includes von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and Cullin 2 (CUL2), and is responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of the HIF-1α subunit under normal oxygen conditions. This process helps regulate HIF-1α levels, preventing its accumulation and the activation of hypoxia response elements (ArizmendiIzazaga2024Bioinformatics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELOC gene, which encodes elongin C, have significant clinical implications, particularly in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). ELOC mutations are associated with ELOC-mutated RCC, a subtype that resembles clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) but is characterized by distinct morphological features and immunohistochemical profiles. These mutations disrupt the degradation of HIF1α, leading to its accumulation and the activation of oncogenic pathways, contributing to tumorigenesis (Raghavan2023Redefining). ELOC mutations are also implicated in renal cell carcinoma with leiomyomatous stroma (RCCLMS), where they are often found alongside mutations in TSC1, TSC2, and MTOR genes. This suggests a role in hyperactive mTOR complex activity, distinguishing RCCLMS as a unique RCC subtype (Shah2019“Renal).

In the context of HPV-related cancers, ELOC is involved in the PHD2-VHL-CUL2-ELOC-HIF-1α axis, where HPV 16 oncoproteins E6 and E7 interact with ELOC to prevent HIF-1α degradation. This interaction contributes to metabolic reprogramming and cancer progression by stabilizing HIF-1α, which enhances glycolysis and other metabolic pathways crucial for tumor growth (ArizmendiIzazaga2024Bioinformatics).

## Interactions
ELOC, or elongin C, is a component of the Elongin complex, which includes Elongin A and Elongin B. This complex enhances the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing during transcription elongation (Chen2023Structure; Aso1996The). ELOC forms a heterodimer with Elongin B, which then interacts with Elongin A to stimulate transcription elongation (Chen2023Structure). The Elongin BC complex also interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, forming a ternary complex that is crucial for VHL's tumor suppressor function (Stebbins1999Structure). This interaction involves a hydrophobic interface between the α domain of VHL and ELOC (Stebbins1999Structure).

ELOC is also involved in the formation of a multiprotein complex with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, specifically with the Cul5-Rbx1 module, through its interaction with ASB2 (Heuzé2005ASB2). In Drosophila, ELOC interacts with the chromatin factor Corto, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation and development (Rougeot2013The). These interactions highlight ELOC's multifunctional role in transcription regulation and protein degradation pathways.
