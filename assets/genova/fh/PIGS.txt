# PIGS

## Overview
The PIGS gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class S protein, a critical component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex. This protein is integral to the process of attaching GPI anchors to proteins, a post-translational modification essential for the proper localization and function of various proteins on the cell membrane (Ohishi2001PIGS; Maeda2011Structural). The PIG-S protein, characterized by its transmembrane domains, is involved in the structural and functional integrity of the GPI transamidase complex, interacting with other subunits such as PIGK, PIGT, PIGU, and GAA1 (Ohishi2001PIGS; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). This complex facilitates the transfer of preassembled GPI anchors to substrate proteins, influencing cellular processes like enzymatic activity, cell adhesion, and immune response regulation (Liu2021A; Eisenhaber2003Enzymes). Mutations in the PIGS gene are linked to inherited GPI deficiency syndromes, underscoring its clinical significance in human health and development.

## Structure
The PIGS gene encodes a protein that is a component of the GPI transamidase complex, essential for the attachment of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors to proteins. The human PIG-S protein consists of 555 amino acids and features two transmembrane domains located near the N- and C-termini (Ohishi2001PIGS; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). The N-terminal methionine is absent, suggesting a cytoplasmic orientation for both termini, while the large hydrophilic region is likely oriented towards the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (Eisenhaber2003Enzymes). 

The protein's structure includes a central luminal domain, which may interact with other components of the transamidase complex, such as GAA1 and GPI8 (Ohishi2001PIGS). PIG-S is homologous to proteins found in other species, such as S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, which share similar hydrophobicity profiles, indicating conserved structural features across species (Ohishi2001PIGS). The exact tertiary and quaternary structures of PIG-S are not detailed in the available literature, and there is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms. The protein's role in the GPI transamidase complex suggests it may have a structural or stabilizing function within this essential cellular machinery (Eisenhaber2003Enzymes).

## Function
The PIGS gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is responsible for attaching GPI anchors to proteins. This process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is essential for the proper localization and function of various proteins on the cell membrane (Ohishi2001PIGS; Maeda2011Structural). The GPI transamidase complex consists of several subunits, including PIGS, PIGK, PIGT, PIGU, and GAA1, with PIGK serving as the catalytic subunit (Liu2021A; Maeda2011Structural).

PIGS, along with other components like PIG-T and GAA1, plays a role in recognizing the GPI attachment signal peptide and facilitating the transfer of the preassembled GPI anchor to the carboxyl terminus of substrate proteins (Wu2020The; Ohishi2001PIGS). This attachment is a critical post-translational modification that affects protein localization, cell signaling, and membrane stability (Eisenhaber2003Enzymes). The proper functioning of the GPI transamidase complex, including the activity of PIGS, is essential for the expression of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface, which are involved in various cellular processes such as enzymatic activity, cell adhesion, and immune response regulation (Liu2021A; Wu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGS gene are associated with inherited GPI deficiency (IGD) syndromes. These conditions arise due to deficiencies in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are crucial for attaching proteins to cell membranes. The absence or malfunction of these anchors can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. The PIGS gene plays a vital role in the biosynthesis of GPI anchors, and its mutations disrupt this process, leading to the aforementioned symptoms. Individuals with IGD syndromes may experience varying degrees of severity in their symptoms, depending on the specific nature and location of the mutations within the PIGS gene. The clinical significance of PIGS mutations highlights the importance of GPI anchors in normal cellular function and development. Understanding these mutations can aid in the diagnosis and potential treatment of IGD syndromes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

## Interactions
PIGS is a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is essential for the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins. It interacts with several other proteins within this complex, including PIG-T, GAA1, and GPI8. PIGS, along with PIG-T, forms a complex with GAA1 and GPI8, which is crucial for the GPI anchoring process (Ohishi2001PIGS). PIGS is stable on its own and can associate with other components of the GPI transamidase complex, indicating its role in maintaining the integrity of the complex (Ohishi2001PIGS).

The interaction between PIGS and other components like GPI8 is vital for the formation of a carbonyl intermediate during the transamidation reaction, which is a key step in GPI anchor attachment (Ohishi2001PIGS). PIGS is also suggested to have a structural role in the transamidase complex, potentially contributing to substrate selectivity or maintaining the structural integrity of the complex (Eisenhaber2003Enzymes). The presence of PIGS in the complex has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation studies, which demonstrated its interaction with GAA1, PIG-T, and GPI8 (Vainauskas2002Structural).
