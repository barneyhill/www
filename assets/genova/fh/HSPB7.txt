# HSPB7

## Overview
HSPB7 is a gene that encodes the protein heat shock protein family B (small) member 7, which is part of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family. This protein is characterized by its conserved α-crystallin domain, which is essential for its structural formation and function (Boelens2020Structural). Unlike other sHSPs, HSPB7 does not primarily function as a molecular chaperone for protein refolding but is instead involved in nuclear processes, particularly RNA splicing, due to its unique localization to SC35 splicing speckles (Vos2009HSPB7). HSPB7 also plays a significant role in cardiac protection and the regulation of osteogenic differentiation, highlighting its diverse functional roles in cellular processes (Naderi2018SRARP; Jin2020HSPB7). The gene has been implicated in various cardiac conditions, including idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, through genetic polymorphisms that affect its expression and function (Stark2010Genetic; Matkovich2010Cardiac).

## Structure
HSPB7, also known as cardiovascular heat shock protein, is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family characterized by the conserved α-crystallin domain. This domain is crucial for dimer formation, which serves as the basic building block of its oligomeric structures (Boelens2020Structural). The primary structure of HSPB7 includes a monomeric mass of approximately 18.6 kDa (Boelens2020Structural). The secondary structure of HSPB7 is composed of 33% β-sheet, 18% β-turn, 30.5% random coil, and 18.5% α-helix, as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Zhao2010Molecular).

The tertiary structure of HSPB7 is influenced by temperature, with the tyrosine residue at position 85 being buried, as indicated by intrinsic fluorescence studies (Zhao2010Molecular). The quaternary structure of HSPB7 involves the formation of dimers and larger oligomers, with the ability for subunit exchange, a characteristic feature of sHSPs (Zhao2010Molecular). HSPB7 does not form large oligomers like some other sHSPs, correlating with its lower chaperone activity (Boelens2020Structural). The protein is noted for its unique localization to SC35 splicing speckles, driven by its N-terminal domain, which contains a novel nuclear speckle localization signal (Vos2009HSPB7).

## Function
HSPB7, a member of the small heat shock protein family, is involved in several cellular processes, primarily through its unique localization and interactions. Unlike other heat shock proteins, HSPB7 does not assist in the refolding of heat-denatured proteins. Instead, it is constitutively localized to SC35 splicing speckles in the nucleus, suggesting a role in RNA splicing or other nuclear processes (Vos2009HSPB7). This localization is driven by a specific sequence in its N-terminal domain, which is crucial for its association with these nuclear sub-domains (Vos2009HSPB7).

HSPB7 also plays a role in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells via the ERK signaling pathway. It negatively regulates osteogenesis, as its knockdown enhances osteogenic differentiation, while overexpression suppresses it (Jin2020HSPB7). In cardiac tissue, HSPB7 is highly expressed and contributes to cardiac protection, potentially influencing heart function and muscle maintenance (Naderi2018SRARP). Its interaction with the chaperone protein 14-3-3 suggests that HSPB7 may indirectly affect multiple intracellular processes by competing with various protein targets (Naderi2018SRARP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the HSPB7 gene have been associated with various forms of cardiomyopathy, particularly idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure. A genetic association study identified the HSPB7 gene as a risk factor for idiopathic DCM, highlighting a strong association between a polymorphism in the gene and susceptibility to the disease. This association was consistent across German and French cohorts, suggesting a significant role of HSPB7 in the genetic background of DCM (Stark2010Genetic). The study found that heterozygous carriers of the SNP rs1739843 have a 1.5-fold increased risk, while homozygous carriers have a 2.25-fold increased risk of developing DCM (Stark2010Genetic).

In another study, HSPB7 polymorphisms, specifically the intronic SNP rs1739843, were associated with heart failure. The research identified 39 SNPs in the HSPB7 gene, with 12 being associated with systolic heart failure. These associations were validated in a second heart failure population, although none of the SNPs altered the amino acid sequence of HSPB7, suggesting that the causative genetic event might be in another gene or intergenic region linked to HSPB7 (Matkovich2010Cardiac). The protective role of the rs1739843 T allele in reducing the risk of idiopathic DCM was also noted in a genome-wide association study (Guo2015Small).

## Interactions
HSPB7, a small heat shock protein, is known for its specific interaction with Filamin C (FLNC), particularly under conditions of cardiac stress. Unlike other small heat shock proteins, HSPB7 does not effectively dimerize due to a destabilized pairing of its β6+7 strands. This unique structural feature allows HSPB7 to bind strongly to domain 24 of FLNC (FLNCd24), which is the dimerization interface of FLNC. The binding of HSPB7 to FLNCd24 outcompetes the homo-dimerization of FLNC, forming a strong and specific hetero-dimer with a significantly lower dissociation constant than the FLNCd24 homo-dimer, indicating tighter binding (Wang2024Cardiac).

The interaction between HSPB7 and FLNC is modulated by phosphorylation at specific sites on FLNC, which affects the equilibrium between FLNC homo-dimers and FLNC-HSPB7 hetero-dimers. Phosphorylation at threonine 2677 favors the homo-dimer, while phosphorylation at tyrosine 2683 shifts the balance towards the hetero-dimer (Wang2024Cardiac). This interaction is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting it is an ancient regulated interaction that plays a significant role in cardiac stress responses (Wang2024Cardiac).
