# ZNF283

## Overview
ZNF283 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 283, a member of the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its KRAB domain, which functions as a transcriptional repressor, and multiple C2H2 zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding (Yi2024ZNF283). Zinc finger protein 283 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and antiviral defense. It interacts with viral proteins such as Nsp9 and Nsp10 from the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), inhibiting viral RNA synthesis (Yi2024ZNF283). Additionally, ZNF283 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as glioma and breast cancer, where alterations in its expression or structure may contribute to disease progression (Li2019Classification; Li2018Evaluating). The protein's unique interaction profile within the KRAB zinc finger protein network suggests a specialized role in cellular function and disease (Helleboid2019The).

## Structure
ZNF283, a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger protein, is characterized by its distinct structural domains. The protein comprises a KRAB domain located at amino acids 56-97 and 16 C2H2 zinc finger motifs spanning amino acids 192-663 (Yi2024ZNF283). The KRAB domain is known for its role as a transcriptional repressor, while the C2H2 zinc finger domains are responsible for DNA binding (Yi2024ZNF283). 

The primary structure of ZNF283 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are typical of zinc finger proteins and facilitate the formation of zinc finger motifs. These motifs contribute to the protein's ability to bind DNA. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in zinc finger proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs to create a stable DNA-binding domain. 

ZNF283 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. The presence of splice variant isoforms could result in structural and functional diversity, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context provided. The KRAB domain's interaction with viral proteins Nsp9 and Nsp10 highlights its functional significance in inhibiting viral RNA synthesis (Yi2024ZNF283).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF283 has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the context of glioma, ZNF283 is involved in alternative splicing events related to IDH status, a significant prognostic indicator. Alterations in the zinc finger motif of ZNF283, particularly deletions at the 3' end, have been associated with IDH mutations, potentially contributing to malignant progression in glioma (Li2019Classification).

In breast cancer, ZNF283 has been noted for an excess of missense variants in cases compared to controls, suggesting a potential association with breast cancer risk. Although the difference was not statistically significant, the presence of these variants indicates that ZNF283 may play a role in breast cancer predisposition (Li2018Evaluating).

ZNF283 also plays a role in antiviral defense mechanisms. It inhibits the replication of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) by interacting with viral proteins Nsp9 and Nsp10, which are crucial for viral replication. This interaction suggests that ZNF283 could be targeted for developing antiviral strategies against PRRSV (Yi2024ZNF283).

## Interactions
ZNF283, a Krüppel-associated box zinc finger protein, is known to interact with specific viral proteins from the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). It interacts with the viral non-structural proteins Nsp9 and Nsp10, which are crucial components of the virus's replication machinery. The interaction with Nsp9 involves the KRAB domain of ZNF283 and specific amino acids of Nsp9, while the KRAB domain also facilitates binding with Nsp10 (Yi2024ZNF283). These interactions have been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies, indicating that ZNF283 plays a role in inhibiting viral RNA synthesis by interacting with these proteins (Yi2024ZNF283).

In the context of human protein interactions, ZNF283 is part of a broader network of KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) that interact with various proteins related to nucleosome formation, modification, and cytoplasmic chaperones. However, ZNF283 is noted for its uncommon associations outside the typical KAP1-centered network, suggesting a unique role in protein interactions (Helleboid2019The). Specific interactions of ZNF283 with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available context.
