# GJA9

## Overview
GJA9 is a gene that encodes the gap junction protein alpha 9, also known as connexin 59, which is a member of the connexin family of transmembrane proteins. These proteins are integral to the formation of gap junction channels, facilitating direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting various physiological processes, such as electrical coupling in cardiac and neural tissues (Becker2017A). In humans, GJA9 is expressed in the retina and testes, although its expression in the retina is notably weak, indicating a potentially low abundance (Söhl2010Expression). The gene's absence in the mouse genome suggests a unique evolutionary trajectory in humans (Söhl2010Expression).

## Function
GJA9 encodes connexin 59, a member of the connexin family of proteins that form gap junction channels, which are essential for direct intercellular communication. These channels allow the exchange of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Becker2017A). Connexin 59 oligomerizes to form hemichannels, which dock with hemichannels from neighboring cells to create functional gap junctions. This process is vital for various physiological processes, including electrical coupling in cardiac and neural tissues (Becker2017A).

In humans, GJA9 is expressed in the retina and testes, although its expression in the retina is weak and not well-detected by some methods, suggesting low abundance (Söhl2010Expression). The specific function of GJA9 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, but its role in forming gap junctions indicates its importance in cellular communication and tissue function (Becker2017A). The absence of a GJA9 ortholog in the mouse genome suggests a unique evolutionary path for this gene in humans (Söhl2010Expression).
