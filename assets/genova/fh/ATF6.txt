# ATF6

## Overview
ATF6 is a gene that encodes the activating transcription factor 6, a type II transmembrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein plays a pivotal role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular mechanism that manages ER stress by enhancing the cell's protein-folding capacity. Upon ER stress, ATF6 is transported to the Golgi apparatus, where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage to release a cytoplasmic fragment that acts as a transcription factor in the nucleus. This fragment upregulates genes involved in protein folding, secretion, and degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. ATF6 is also involved in various developmental processes, including mesodermal differentiation and bone formation, and has been implicated in several diseases, particularly those affecting vision and conditions related to ER stress (Kroeger2018The; Haze1999Mammalian; Wu2007ATF6α).

## Structure
ATF6 is a type II transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is initially synthesized as a 90-kDa protein (p90ATF6) and contains a hydrophobic stretch of 21 amino acids (amino acids 378-398) that anchors it in the ER membrane (Haze1999Mammalian). The N-terminal half of ATF6 includes a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and is oriented towards the cytoplasm (Haze1999Mammalian). This domain is involved in the transcriptional activation of ER chaperone genes upon ER stress (Haze1999Mammalian).

ATF6 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, with three potential glycosylation sites identified in its luminal domain (Haze1999Mammalian). Under ER stress conditions, ATF6 is cleaved by proteases S1P and S2P, resulting in a 50-kDa fragment (p50ATF6) that translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription (Haze1999Mammalian; Nadanaka2007Role).

The luminal domain of ATF6 contains disulfide bridges formed between conserved cysteine residues, which are crucial for its function in sensing ER stress (Nadanaka2007Role). These disulfide bonds are reduced under stress conditions, facilitating ATF6's transport to the Golgi apparatus for activation (Nadanaka2007Role).

## Function
ATF6 is a crucial component of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in human cells, primarily involved in managing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. It functions as a type II transmembrane protein that, upon activation by ER stress, is transported to the Golgi apparatus. There, it undergoes proteolytic cleavage to release a cytoplasmic fragment, p50ATF6, which translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, ATF6 acts as a transcription factor, upregulating genes that enhance the cell's protein-folding capacity, including ER chaperones like GRP78 and GRP94, and enzymes involved in protein degradation and trafficking (Haze1999Mammalian; Sharma2019Atf6α).

ATF6 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by optimizing protein folding, secretion, and degradation during ER stress. It is essential for cellular adaptation to both acute and chronic stress conditions, facilitating recovery and enhancing tolerance (Wu2007ATF6α). ATF6 also influences developmental processes, such as mesodermal differentiation, by promoting the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is crucial for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (Kroeger2018The). In addition, ATF6 is involved in the differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts, contributing to bone formation and ocular development (Hillary2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATF6 gene are linked to several diseases, particularly affecting the retina and vision. Loss-of-function mutations in ATF6α are associated with congenital vision disorders such as achromatopsia and cone-rod dystrophy. These conditions result in foveal hypoplasia, leading to impaired vision from infancy (Kroeger2018The; Chiang2016Achromatopsia). Specific mutations, like ATF6[Y567N], impair the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ATF6, reducing its transcriptional activity and affecting the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways (Chiang2016Achromatopsia). 

ATF6 mutations are categorized into three classes based on their impact: Class 1 mutations affect protein trafficking, Class 2 mutations lead to constitutive activation, and Class 3 mutations result in a complete loss of function (Chiang2016Achromatopsia). These mutations disrupt the UPR, increasing susceptibility to ER stress-induced damage, particularly during retinal development (Chiang2016Achromatopsia).

Beyond retinal disorders, ATF6 dysfunction is implicated in diseases related to ER stress, such as hepatic steatosis, obesity, heart ischemia, stroke, diabetes, and neurodegeneration (Kroeger2018The). In ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer, ATF6 expression is linked to cancer development and may serve as a biomarker for early detection of dysplasia (Hanaoka2017Expression).

## Interactions
ATF6 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and other cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the serum response factor (SRF), where ATF6 binds to SRF in vitro, in yeast, and in HeLa cells. This interaction is necessary for the serum-induced expression of the c-fos gene, suggesting that ATF6 may function as a coactivator for SRF (Zhu1997Interaction).

In the context of ER stress, ATF6 interacts with the nuclear transcription factor NF-Y to bind to the endoplasmic reticulum stress element (ERSE). This binding is essential for the transcriptional induction of ER chaperone genes and is facilitated by NF-Y's binding to the CCAAT part of ERSE, allowing ATF6 to bind to the CCACG part (Yoshida2000ATF6).

ATF6 also forms a stable complex with the chaperone protein BiP in the ER. This interaction is sensitive to ER stress, leading to the dissociation of BiP from ATF6, which is crucial for ATF6 activation and subsequent translocation to the Golgi (Shen2005Stable).
