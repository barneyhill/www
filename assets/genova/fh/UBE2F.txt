# UBE2F

## Overview
UBE2F is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 F (putative), which plays a pivotal role in the neddylation pathway, a post-translational modification process. This enzyme is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and is integral to the regulation of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), which are essential for protein degradation, cell cycle control, and signal transduction (Wijk2009The; Zhou2023NEDD8conjugating). UBE2F specifically facilitates the neddylation of RBX2-related CUL5, thereby activating CRL5 complexes in human cells (Zhou2023NEDD8conjugating). The protein operates within both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis by modulating protein stability and function. Its activity is intricately regulated by interactions with other proteins, such as UBE2M, which can target UBE2F for degradation under stress conditions, influencing apoptosis and other cellular processes (Zhou2018UBE2M). UBE2F's involvement in cellular stress responses and its implications in oncogenesis, particularly in lung cancer, underscore its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhou2020Induction; Zhou2017Neddylation).

## Function
UBE2F is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in the neddylation process, a post-translational modification that attaches the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target proteins. This modification is crucial for the regulation of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), which are involved in protein degradation, cell cycle progression, and signal transduction (Wijk2009The; Zhou2023NEDD8conjugating). UBE2F specifically targets the neddylation of RBX2-related CUL5 in healthy human cells, facilitating the activation of CRL5 complexes (Zhou2023NEDD8conjugating).

In the cellular context, UBE2F operates in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the stability and function of proteins through neddylation (Zhou2023NEDD8conjugating). The enzyme's activity is modulated by UBE2M, which can target UBE2F for degradation under stress conditions, thereby influencing the activity of CRL5 and the degradation of specific substrates like NOXA (Zhou2018UBE2M). This regulatory mechanism is essential for controlling apoptosis and other cellular processes, highlighting UBE2F's role in cellular stress responses and its potential implications in oncogenesis (Zhou2017Neddylation; Zhou2018UBE2M).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2F is implicated in the progression of lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Overexpression of UBE2F is associated with poor overall survival in lung cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. High levels of UBE2F promote cancer cell growth and survival by facilitating the degradation of the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA through the neddylation process, which involves the CRL5 E3 complex (Zhou2017Neddylation).

UBE2F's role in chemotherapy resistance is also significant. It is upregulated in response to platinum-based chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, which can lead to chemotherapy insensitivity by protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. This is achieved through the stabilization of UBE2F, which reduces NOXA levels and enhances cell survival (Zhou2020Induction). Knockdown of UBE2F sensitizes lung cancer cells to platinum treatment, indicating that targeting UBE2F could enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy (Zhou2020Induction; Bui2021UbiquitinConjugating). These findings highlight UBE2F as a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer treatment.

## Interactions
UBE2F is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate its function in the neddylation pathway. It physically interacts with UBE2M, a stress-inducible dual E2 enzyme, which promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of UBE2F. This interaction is crucial for regulating UBE2F protein levels, particularly under stress conditions (Zhou2018UBE2M). UBE2F also interacts with CUL3, a cullin protein that facilitates its poly-ubiquitylation and degradation. Keap1, a BTB domain-containing protein, acts as a substrate-specific adaptor for CUL3, binding to UBE2F via a conserved ETGE motif to promote its ubiquitylation (Zhou2018UBE2M).

Under stress conditions, UBE2F forms a complex with DJ-1 and Parkin, which enhances its ubiquitylation and degradation. This complex formation is more effective than the UBE2M-Keap1-CUL3 complex in promoting UBE2F degradation (Zhou2018UBE2M). Additionally, UBE2F interacts with RBX1 and RBX2, components of Cullin-Ring E3 ligases, which regulate its stability. RBX1 promotes UBE2F degradation, while RBX2 has the opposite effect, particularly in the context of platinum-based chemotherapy (Zhou2020Induction). These interactions highlight UBE2F's role in modulating protein stability and function in cellular processes.
