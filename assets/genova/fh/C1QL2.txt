# C1QL2

## Overview
C1QL2 is a gene that encodes the protein complement C1q-like 2, which is a member of the C1q/TNF superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and function, particularly within the central nervous system. C1QL2 is characterized by its globular C1q domain, which contributes to its trimeric quaternary structure, allowing it to form both homomeric and heteromeric complexes. Functionally, C1QL2 is involved in synapse homeostasis, including the formation, maintenance, and elimination of synapses, and it interacts with brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI) G-protein coupled receptors. It is essential for the modulation of kainate receptor functions at mossy fiber to CA3 synapses in the hippocampus, influencing synaptic transmission and plasticity. Alterations in the C1QL2 gene have been linked to various neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining synaptic integrity and function (Matsuda2016Transsynaptic; Bolliger2011The; Ressl2015Structures; Koumoundourou2023Regulation).

## Structure
The C1QL2 protein is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes a globular C1q domain, which is a hallmark of the C1q/TNF superfamily. This domain forms a jelly-roll architecture with ten beta strands, contributing to a trimeric quaternary structure typical of the family (Ressl2015Structures). The protein's primary structure includes an N-terminal signal peptide, a short conserved sequence with two closely spaced cysteine residues, a spacer, a collagen-like sequence, and the C-terminal gC1q domain (Bolliger2011The). 

C1QL2 is known to form trimers via its C-terminal gC1q domain and can assemble into higher-order oligomeric complexes through N-terminal motifs (Iijima2010Distinct). The protein's structure is further stabilized by Ca2+ binding along the trimeric symmetry axis, although C1QL2 was crystallized in an apo form without bound ions, leading to an outward conformation of loop L6 (Ressl2015Structures). The electrostatic potential surface of C1QL2 is less negatively charged compared to C1QL1 and C1QL3, which may influence its specific protein interactions (Ressl2015Structures). C1QL2 is also capable of forming both homomeric and heteromeric complexes, contributing to its structural and functional diversity (Iijima2010Distinct).

## Function
C1QL2 is a protein that plays a significant role in synaptic organization and function within the central nervous system. It is part of the C1q/TNF superfamily and is primarily expressed in the brain, where it is involved in synapse homeostasis, including the formation, maintenance, and elimination of synapses (Ressl2015Structures). C1QL2 interacts with brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI) G-protein coupled receptors, which are linked to synaptic regulation (Ressl2015Structures).

C1QL2 is crucial for the modulation of kainate receptor (KAR) functions at mossy fiber (MF) to CA3 synapses in the hippocampus. It binds to the amino-terminal domains of postsynaptic GluK2 and GluK4 KARs, facilitating their recruitment to postsynaptic sites, which enhances synaptic integration during repetitive MF activities (Matsuda2016Transsynaptic). The absence of C1QL2 leads to a failure in recruiting postsynaptic KARs, resulting in reduced network activities (Matsuda2016Transsynaptic).

C1QL2 also interacts with Nrxn3(25b+), a presynaptic neurexin isoform, which is essential for synaptic vesicle recruitment and the expression of long-term potentiation at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse (Koumoundourou2023Regulation). This interaction underscores its role in maintaining synaptic integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the C1QL2 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. C1QL2 is part of a critical pathway involving Bcl11b and Nrxn3(25b+) that regulates synaptic function at the hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapse. Disruptions in this pathway can lead to synaptic dysfunction, which is associated with conditions such as schizophrenia and cocaine addiction (Koumoundourou2023Regulation). The transcription factor Bcl11b, which regulates C1QL2, is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including learning deficits and autistic features (Koumoundourou2023Regulation). 

Alterations in C1QL2 expression, particularly in Bcl11b mutant mice, result in impaired synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation, although they do not fully restore synaptic structure, indicating that Bcl11b also acts through C1QL2-independent pathways (Koumoundourou2023Regulation). A specific mutation in C1QL2, K262E, disrupts its interaction with Nrxn3(25b+), affecting synaptic vesicle clustering and synapse function, which underscores the importance of C1QL2-Nrxn3(25b+) interaction in maintaining synaptic integrity (Koumoundourou2023Regulation). These findings highlight the potential role of C1QL2 in the pathogenesis of disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction, such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability (Koumoundourou2023Regulation).

## Interactions
C1QL2, a member of the C1q-like protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for synaptic organization and function. It specifically binds to the amino-terminal domains (ATDs) of postsynaptic kainate receptors (KARs), including GluK2 and GluK4, at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus. This interaction is essential for recruiting KARs to postsynaptic sites, influencing synaptic transmission and plasticity (Matsuda2016Transsynaptic).

C1QL2 also interacts with a presynaptic isoform of Neurexin3 (Nrx3) that contains the SS5 25b sequence. This interaction is critical for synaptic vesicle recruitment and the functional control of KARs at synapses (Matsuda2016Transsynaptic; Koumoundourou2023Regulation). The binding affinity between C1QL2 and Nrx3 is enhanced by the presence of the SS5 25b sequence, as demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance assays (Matsuda2016Transsynaptic).

C1QL2 can form both homomeric and heteromeric complexes with other C1ql proteins, although it does not interact with proteins from the Cbln subfamily (Iijima2010Distinct). These interactions highlight the role of C1QL2 as a synaptic organizer, influencing the recruitment and localization of synaptic components.
