# DHX34

## Overview
DHX34 is a gene that encodes the DExH-box helicase 34, a member of the DExH/D family of RNA helicases. This protein is characterized by its ability to unwind RNA duplexes in an NTP-dependent manner, a function critical for various RNA processing activities. DExH-box helicase 34 is involved in essential cellular processes such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and pre-mRNA splicing. It acts as a scaffold for the phosphorylation of UPF1, a key step in the NMD pathway, and associates with the spliceosomal catalytic C complex to regulate alternative splicing events. The protein's interactions with core NMD factors and spliceosomal components underscore its multifaceted role in RNA metabolism. Clinically, mutations in the DHX34 gene have been linked to hematological malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia, and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Hug2022A; Melero2016The; Marques2022Gene).

## Structure
The DHX34 protein is a member of the DExH/D family of RNA helicases, characterized by a helicase core formed by two RecA-like domains, a winged-helix domain (WH), and a helical bundle domain known as the Ratchet domain (Hug2022A). It also contains a carboxy-terminal OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold) domain, which can regulate conformational changes in DEAH box helicases (Hug2022A). These structural features are typical of RNA helicases, which unwind RNA duplexes in an NTP-dependent manner (Hug2022A).

The primary structure of DHX34 includes conserved motifs typical of the DExH/D family, such as GxxGxGKT, TQPRRV, TDGML, DExH, SAT, FLTG, TNIAET, and QRxGRAGR, which are crucial for its classification and function (Suthar2016Identification). However, specific motifs for DHX34 are not detailed in the available excerpts (Suthar2016Identification).

The protein's interactions with other molecules suggest a role in various RNA processing activities, including pre-mRNA splicing and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), but specific details on its tertiary or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context (Hug2022A). Information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms is also not detailed in the provided excerpts.

## Function
DHX34 (DExH-box helicase 34) is an RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism, particularly in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and pre-mRNA splicing in healthy human cells. It functions as a scaffold for SMG1-mediated phosphorylation of UPF1, a key step in the NMD pathway, which is essential for the degradation of mRNAs containing premature termination codons (Melero2016The). DHX34 interacts with core NMD factors such as UPF1 and SMG1, facilitating the transition to a decay-inducing complex and promoting mRNP remodeling (Melero2016The; Hug2022A).

In addition to its role in NMD, DHX34 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing by associating with the spliceosomal catalytic C complex. It predominantly binds to pre-RNA near intron-exon junctions, regulating alternative splicing events (Hug2022A). This dual role in NMD and splicing is critical for maintaining cellular function and preventing disease, as it influences the expression and processing of a large number of genes (Hug2022A).

DHX34 is also implicated in hematopoietic differentiation, particularly in erythropoiesis, where its down-regulation is linked to ineffective erythropoiesis, a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Hug2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DHX34 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly hematological malignancies and neurodevelopmental disorders. Germline mutations in DHX34 are associated with familial myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations disrupt the gene's role in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), contributing to the development of these conditions (LópezPerrote2020Regulation; Hug2022A). In sporadic AML cases, DHX34 undergoes alternative splicing, leading to decreased mRNA levels and impaired function, which affects the AML transcriptome (Hug2022A).

In hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, DHX34 knockdown impairs differentiation into erythroid and myeloid lineages, a characteristic of AML (Hug2022A). The gene also regulates the splicing of pre-mRNAs associated with AML/MDS predisposition (Hug2022A).

Beyond hematological disorders, DHX34 variants have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Genetic studies have identified single nucleotide variants and copy number variants in DHX34 among ASD patients, suggesting a potential role in the disorder's pathophysiology (Marques2022Gene). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DHX34 in both cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
DHX34, a DExH-box RNA helicase, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing activities such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with core NMD factors, including UPF1 and SMG1, forming a tripartite complex that facilitates UPF1 phosphorylation, a crucial step in NMD. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of DHX34 is essential for binding to SMG1, while the helicase core interacts with UPF1 (Melero2016The).

DHX34 also interacts with components of the spliceosome, particularly the late spliceosomal complex C, and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It binds to U5 snRNA and interacts with spliceosomal proteins such as PRPF8, indicating a role in regulating U5 snRNP (Hug2022Aa; Hug2022A). The protein's activity is modulated by interactions with G-patch proteins, which enhance its function in splicing (Hug2022Aa).

Additionally, DHX34 forms a stable complex with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases, influencing ATP hydrolysis and potentially regulating NMD (LópezPerrote2020Regulation). These interactions highlight DHX34's multifaceted role in RNA biogenesis and surveillance pathways.
