# MAP3K21

## Overview
MAP3K21 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 21, which is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family. This protein plays a crucial role in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and stress response. As a kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 21 is responsible for phosphorylating downstream targets, thereby modulating their activity and influencing cellular outcomes. The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in several signaling pathways, such as the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant in cellular development and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and regulation of MAP3K21 is essential for elucidating its role in health and disease.
