# SPACA5

## Overview
SPACA5, or sperm acrosome-associated protein 5, is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes a protein integral to the acrosome reaction during fertilization. This protein is categorized as an acrosomal protein, playing a crucial role in sperm-egg recognition and binding, which are essential processes for successful fertilization and embryonic development (da2016Transcriptome). The SPACA5 gene is part of a gene pair with SPACA5B, both of which are embedded within long repeated DNA sequences, suggesting their origin from recent segmental duplications (Irwin2011Evolution). In humans, SPACA5 has undergone a unique duplication event, resulting in two identical protein sequences, which may have occurred after the divergence from chimpanzees (Irwin2011Evolution). The gene is also associated with male fertility traits and has been implicated in conditions such as azoospermia, highlighting its significance in reproductive biology and potential clinical relevance (Lopes2013Human; de2015Nonsynonymous).

## Function
SPACA5, also known as sperm acrosome-associated protein 5, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the acrosome reaction, a critical process in fertilization. This protein is primarily active in the acrosome of sperm cells, where it plays a role in sperm-egg recognition and binding, essential for successful fertilization and subsequent embryonic development (da2016Transcriptome). 

The SPACA5 gene is located on the X chromosome and is part of a gene pair with SPACA5B, which are separated by about 120 kb and embedded within long repeated DNA sequences with high sequence identity. This suggests that SPACA5 and SPACA5B originated from recent segmental duplications, a common form of gene duplication in mammals (Irwin2011Evolution). 

In humans, SPACA5 has undergone a unique duplication, resulting in two identical protein sequences, SPACA5 and SPACA5B, which may have occurred after the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. The perfect identity of the protein sequences suggests a recent duplication event, although concerted evolution between the two genes cannot be ruled out (Irwin2011Evolution). 

SPACA5 is also associated with male fertility traits, as evidenced by studies in livestock, indicating its potential role in reproductive biology (de2015Nonsynonymous).

## Clinical Significance
The SPACA5 gene has been implicated in human spermatogenic failure, particularly in cases of azoospermia, a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in semen. Research has identified recurrent deletions in a 100 kb segment on chromosome Xp11.23, which includes the SPACA5 gene. These deletions are associated with an increased risk of infertility due to non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) events. In a study, 9 deletions of this locus were found in patient cohorts compared to 8 in controls, suggesting a significant association with azoospermia, with an odds ratio of 3.96, indicating a higher frequency of deletions in affected individuals (Lopes2013Human). 

The study also highlights the potential genetic basis for increased birth defects in children conceived via in vitro fertilization, as men with poor sperm production may have an enrichment of rare deleterious mutations, including those affecting SPACA5 (Lopes2013Human). While the clinical significance of SPACA5 mutations, expression alterations, or interaction changes is not fully detailed, the gene's involvement in spermatogenic failure underscores its importance in reproductive health (Lopes2013Human). Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which SPACA5 mutations contribute to infertility.
