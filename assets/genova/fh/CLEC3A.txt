# CLEC3A

## Overview
CLEC3A is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain family 3 member A, which is part of the C-type lectin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), enabling it to bind carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner, although the CRD can also serve as a structural motif in some contexts (YANG2021CLEC3A). CLEC3A is primarily expressed in cartilage and plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and immune response. It is involved in the plasminogen activation system, which is crucial for cell invasion and tissue remodeling (YANG2021CLEC3A). The protein interacts with components of the extracellular matrix, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and is a substrate for matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), which modulates its activity and interactions (Tsunezumi2009Matrilysin). CLEC3A's expression and activity have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and osteoarthritis, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Ankney2019Novel; Karlsson2010Genome-wide).

## Structure
The CLEC3A protein, encoded by the CLEC3A gene, is a member of the C-type lectin domain family and consists of 197 amino acids with a molecular weight of 23 kDa (Woggon2023Antimicrobial). The protein is encoded by three exons: exon 1 encodes a signal peptide and a cationic protein segment, exon 2 encodes an alpha-helical oligomerization domain, and exon 3 encodes a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (YANG2021CLEC3A; Woggon2023Antimicrobial). The CRD is a characteristic feature of C-type lectins, allowing the protein to recognize or bind carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner (YANG2021CLEC3A).

CLEC3A is structurally related to tetranectin, another C-type lectin, and exhibits strong heparin-binding activity, which is disrupted by cleavage with matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) (Tsunezumi2009Matrilysin). The protein forms a homodimer, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, although it is unclear if it forms a homotrimer like tetranectin (Tsunezumi2009Matrilysin). The protein's domains, including CLEC3A Ex23 and CLEC3A Ex3, have been shown to possess antimicrobial activity (Woggon2023Antimicrobial). However, detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of CLEC3A is not provided in the available context.

## Function
CLEC3A, a member of the C-type lectin superfamily, is primarily expressed in cartilage and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and immune response. The protein contains a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and is known for its ability to bind carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner, although in some cases, the CRD serves as a structural motif rather than a binding site (YANG2021CLEC3A). CLEC3A is also associated with the plasminogen activation system, which plays a significant role in cell invasion and tissue remodeling by enhancing tissue plasminogen activator activity (YANG2021CLEC3A).

In healthy cells, CLEC3A is found in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces, where it interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, such as syndecans and glypican, suggesting a role in modulating cell adhesion (Tsunezumi2009Matrilysin). The protein's interaction with the extracellular matrix components, like laminin-332 and fibronectin, enhances cell adhesion, although CLEC3A alone does not significantly promote this activity (Tsunezumi2009Matrilysin). CLEC3A's presence in cartilage and its susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage suggest it may also contribute to the innate immune response by releasing antimicrobial peptides upon interaction with pathogens (Elezagic2019Antimicrobial).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC3A has been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer, where its expression is associated with tumor adhesion and metastasis. The gene is co-overexpressed with other secretome-encoding genes such as ALDOA, EEA1, and FKBP4, which correlates with a worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. This co-overexpression pattern is significant in identifying high-risk subpopulations among luminal-A or luminal-B breast cancer patients, although CLEC3A's individual overexpression does not provide subtype-specific prognostic value (Ankney2019Novel).

CLEC3A is also a substrate for matrilysin (MMP-7), which cleaves it on the tumor cell surface, affecting its cell adhesion activity. This cleavage disrupts CLEC3A's heparin-binding activity, potentially facilitating tumor cell migration and metastasis (Tsunezumi2009Matrilysin). In osteoarthritis, CLEC3A shows increased expression in affected cartilage, suggesting a role in bone differentiation and cartilage degeneration (Karlsson2010Genome-wide).

Despite its involvement in these conditions, a study found no significant association between CLEC3A polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk in a northwestern Chinese population, indicating that its role may vary across different types of cancer (YANG2021CLEC3A).

## Interactions
CLEC3A, a member of the C-type lectin superfamily, is known to interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface, such as syndecans and glypican. This interaction is facilitated by a region rich in basic amino acids in the NH2-terminal sequence of CLEC3A, which likely aids in its binding to these proteoglycans on the cell membrane and extracellular matrix (Tsunezumi2009Matrilysin). CLEC3A is also identified as a substrate for matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), which cleaves CLEC3A on the tumor cell surface, affecting its heparin-binding activity and modulating its cell adhesion properties (Tsunezumi2009Matrilysin). The cleavage by MMP-7 results in the loss of CLEC3A's ability to bind heparin, which is crucial for its interaction with the cell surface (Tsunezumi2009Matrilysin).

In osteosarcoma cells, CLEC3A is involved in the AKT1/mTOR/HIF1α signaling pathway, where its expression is positively correlated with AKT1. Knockdown of CLEC3A leads to decreased expression of AKT1, mTOR, and HIF1α, suggesting a regulatory role in this pathway, which is significant for cancer cell proliferation and drug resistance (Ren2020Suppression).
