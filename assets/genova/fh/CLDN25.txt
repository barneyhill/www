# CLDN25

## Overview
The CLDN25 gene encodes claudin 25, a member of the claudin family of proteins, which are integral components of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudin 25 is characterized by its tetraspan transmembrane structure, which includes four transmembrane domains that are essential for its role in maintaining the paracellular barrier (Mineta2011Predicted). Although claudin 25 is highly expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), it does not independently form tight junction strands but instead interacts with other proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) to support the structural integrity of tight junctions (Berndt2019Tight). The protein's involvement in these interactions underscores its importance in maintaining the morphology of tight junction strands, although it does not directly influence barrier permeability (Berndt2019Tight). Alterations in CLDN25 expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular integrity and barrier function.

## Structure
Claudin 25 (CLDN25) is a member of the claudin family, characterized by its tetraspan transmembrane structure. The protein is predicted to have four transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-terminal tails facing the cytoplasm, a common feature among claudins (Mineta2011Predicted). These transmembrane domains are crucial for the protein's role in forming tight junctions, which are essential for maintaining the paracellular barrier in epithelial and endothelial cells (Mineta2011Predicted).

The primary structure of CLDN25 includes a motif near the first extracellular loop, which is characteristic of claudins, although it does not exactly match the known PROSITE motif (Mineta2011Predicted). The first extracellular loop is larger than the second, a typical feature of claudin proteins, which contributes to their function in tight junctions (Mineta2011Predicted).

While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of CLDN25 are not provided, claudins generally form extended strands through homophilic or heterophilic interactions within the same membrane or across adjacent membranes (Heinemann2019Structural). These interactions are vital for the structural integrity and function of tight junctions.

## Function
Claudin 25 (CLDN25) is a tight junction protein expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), where it plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of tight junctions. Although CLDN25 is highly abundant in vitro, similar to CLDN12 or occludin, it cannot form tight junction strands on its own. Instead, it contributes indirectly to tight junction formation by trans-interacting with occludin and potentially binding to zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) through its C-terminus, which helps recruit other tight junction proteins (Berndt2019Tight). 

In brain endothelial cells, the knock-down of CLDN25 does not affect the permeability of the BBB but results in a less pronounced tight junction strand network, indicating its role in maintaining proper tight junction strand morphology (Berndt2019Tight). CLDN25 is localized within cerebral microvessel junctions, where it shares similarities with CLDN12. Despite its abundance, CLDN25 does not directly influence barrier tightness but is crucial for the structural integrity of the tight junctions at the BBB (Berndt2019Tight).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CLDN25 gene can significantly impact the barrier function of epithelial and endothelial cells, potentially contributing to various diseases. Changes in CLDN25 expression have been implicated in the development and progression of certain cancers. The disruption of tight junctions, where claudins play a critical role, can lead to increased permeability and facilitate the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. This suggests that CLDN25 may have a role in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing tumorigenesis.

In addition to cancer, alterations in CLDN25 expression or function may be associated with inflammatory conditions. Tight junctions are essential for maintaining the selective permeability of epithelial and endothelial barriers, and their dysfunction can lead to increased susceptibility to inflammation. This can result in a compromised barrier function, allowing for the infiltration of pathogens and immune cells, which may exacerbate inflammatory responses.

Overall, the clinical significance of CLDN25 lies in its role in maintaining tight junction integrity. Disruptions in its expression or function can contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by compromised barrier function, such as cancer and inflammatory disorders.

## Interactions
Claudin 25 (CLDN25) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, contributing to the structure and function of tight junctions at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). CLDN25 is known to trans-interact with occludin (Ocln), a key tight junction protein, but does not show homophilic transinteraction with other claudins tested (Berndt2019Tight). This interaction with occludin suggests that CLDN25 plays a role in the formation and modulation of tight junctions, although it cannot form tight junction strands on its own (Berndt2019Tight).

Preliminary data indicate that the C-terminus of CLDN25 may directly bind to the junctional protein ZO-1, which is crucial for recruiting occludin and other tight junction proteins to the junctional complex (Berndt2019Tight). Despite its involvement in these interactions, CLDN25 does not alter the permeability of the BBB when knocked down, indicating its role is more structural, affecting the morphology of the tight junction strand network rather than its barrier function (Berndt2019Tight). There is no specific information available on interactions of CLDN25 with nucleic acids.
