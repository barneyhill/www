# PLSCR5

## Overview
PLSCR5 is a gene that encodes the protein phospholipid scramblase family member 5, which is part of the phospholipid scramblase family. This family of proteins is involved in the transbilayer movement of phospholipids across cellular membranes, a process crucial for various cellular functions, including apoptosis and blood coagulation. The PLSCR5 protein is categorized as a scramblase, which facilitates the bidirectional movement of phospholipids between the inner and outer leaflets of the lipid bilayer, thereby contributing to membrane dynamics and signaling pathways. While the specific biological roles of PLSCR5 are still being elucidated, it is believed to play a role in cellular processes that are essential for maintaining membrane integrity and function. Further research is needed to fully understand the interactions and clinical significance of PLSCR5, as well as its potential implications in human health and disease.
