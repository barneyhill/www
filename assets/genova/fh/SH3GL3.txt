# SH3GL3

## Overview
SH3GL3 is a gene that encodes the protein SH3 domain containing GRB2 like 3, also known as endophilin A3. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in facilitating protein-protein interactions through its SH3 domain. Endophilin A3 is primarily involved in endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, processes essential for neurotransmitter release and synaptic function, particularly in the brain and testis (Lin2021SH3GL3). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as STAT3 and huntingtin, highlight its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease mechanisms, including cancer and neurological disorders (Davranche2011Huntingtin; Nie2021SH3GL3). The gene's expression and function underscore its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in various clinical contexts (Yang2023The; Lin2021SH3GL3).

## Function
SH3GL3, also known as endophilin A3, is a protein involved in endocytosis, a critical cellular process where cells internalize molecules and particles from their surroundings. This protein contains an SH3 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for its function in synaptic vesicle recycling. This process is crucial for neurotransmitter release and synaptic function, impacting communication between neurons (Lin2021SH3GL3).

In healthy human cells, SH3GL3 is predominantly expressed in the brain and testis, indicating its significant role in these tissues. The SH3 domain of SH3GL3 is vital for its function, as it is involved in signal transduction and various biological processes (Lin2021SH3GL3). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm is crucial for maintaining synaptic vesicle dynamics, which are essential for proper neuronal signaling and function.

SH3GL3's involvement in endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient neurotransmission. Its role in these processes underscores its potential impact on organismal outcomes, particularly in the nervous system, where precise synaptic function is necessary for normal cognitive and motor activities (Lin2021SH3GL3).

## Clinical Significance
The SH3GL3 gene, also known as endophilin A3, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in neurological conditions. In lung cancer, SH3GL3 functions as a potent tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly reduced in lung cancer tissues compared to noncancerous tissues, and this low expression is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Overexpression of SH3GL3 in lung cancer cell lines inhibits cell growth, migration, and tumor sphere formation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2021SH3GL3).

In glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, SH3GL3 also acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumorigenesis and the self-renewal of glioblastoma stem cells. Low expression of SH3GL3 is linked to worse survival outcomes in glioma patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Nie2021SH3GL3).

Additionally, SH3GL3 is involved in neurological diseases through its fusion with ADAMTSL3, forming a hereditary fusion gene detected in conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. This fusion gene suggests a shared pathophysiological mechanism among these diseases (Yang2023The).

## Interactions
SH3GL3, also known as endophilin A3, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the STAT3 protein, inhibiting its nuclear localization and reducing its transcriptional activity. This interaction leads to the downregulation of STAT3 target genes such as IL-6 and CD274, which are involved in glioblastoma stem cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Nie2021SH3GL3). The interaction between SH3GL3 and STAT3 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating a direct physical interaction that impacts STAT3 signaling pathways (Nie2021SH3GL3).

In the context of Huntington's disease, SH3GL3 interacts with the huntingtin protein (Htt), particularly with its N-terminal region. This interaction is significant in the presence of mutant huntingtin (mHtt), where SH3GL3 is implicated in accelerating mHtt aggregation. This aggregation may contribute to neuronal dysfunction by affecting endocytosis and vesicle trafficking (Davranche2011Huntingtin). The interaction between SH3GL3 and Htt is not influenced by the polyglutamine length in Htt, suggesting that aggregation, rather than polyQ length, triggers aberrant interactions (Davranche2011Huntingtin). These interactions highlight SH3GL3's role in modulating protein functions and its potential impact on disease mechanisms.
