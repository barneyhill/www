# BDKRB1

## Overview
The BDKRB1 gene encodes the bradykinin receptor B1, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is distinct from the bradykinin B2 receptor, sharing only 36% identity at the amino acid level, and is primarily involved in mediating inflammatory responses. Unlike the B2 receptor, the B1 receptor is not constitutively expressed but is induced in response to tissue injury or inflammation. It is activated by kinin metabolites such as des-Arg9-bradykinin, leading to the activation of signaling pathways that result in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and pain sensation. The B1 receptor's unique lack of desensitization allows it to sustain prolonged signaling, making it a significant player in chronic inflammatory conditions (LeebLundberg2005International; Marceau2020Bradykinin; Menke1994Expression).

## Structure
The BDKRB1 gene encodes the bradykinin receptor B1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which is typical of GPCRs (Bachvarov1996Structure; Menke1994Expression). The primary structure of the B1 receptor shares 36% identity with the B2 receptor at the amino acid level (Bachvarov1996Structure; Menke1994Expression). The receptor's secondary structure includes these transmembrane helices, which are integral to its function within the cell membrane (Menke1994Expression).

The B1 receptor's tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices, facilitating its role in ligand binding and signal transduction. Specific residues, such as Lys 118 in transmembrane region 3, are crucial for peptide ligand binding (LeebLundberg2005International). The receptor also contains a Zn2+ binding motif, which may influence receptor activation (LeebLundberg2005International).

Post-translational modifications of the B1 receptor include potential N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, which are important for receptor function and signaling (Menke1994Expression). These modifications can affect the receptor's surface expression and interaction with ligands. The B1 receptor does not undergo typical desensitization processes seen in other GPCRs, such as phosphorylation-induced internalization (Marceau2020Bradykinin).

## Function
The BDKRB1 gene encodes the bradykinin B1 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that is primarily involved in inflammatory responses. In healthy human cells, the B1 receptor is expressed at very low levels and is not constitutively active. Its expression is typically induced in response to tissue injury or inflammation, where it plays a significant role in mediating inflammatory processes (LeebLundberg2005International; Marceau2020Bradykinin).

The B1 receptor is activated by specific kinin metabolites, such as des-Arg9-bradykinin, which are generated by the action of carboxypeptidases on bradykinin. Upon activation, the B1 receptor interacts with G proteins, particularly Gαq and Gαi, to initiate signaling pathways that lead to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, intracellular calcium mobilization, and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. These pathways contribute to various cellular responses, including vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and pain sensation (LeebLundberg2005International).

In terms of cellular localization, the B1 receptor is active at the cell membrane and is involved in prolonged signaling due to its lack of desensitization mechanisms, unlike the B2 receptor. This characteristic allows the B1 receptor to sustain its activity in response to inflammatory stimuli (Marceau2020Bradykinin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BDKRB1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor, the bradykinin-BDKRB1 axis is crucial for the regulation of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) gene expression, which enhances the migration and invasion of malignant glioblastoma cells. This suggests that targeting the BDKRB1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma treatment (Sun2020The; Stadnicka2024Kinin).

In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, BDKRB1 expression has been associated with a better prognosis. It is suggested that BDKRB1 could serve as a prognostic marker, potentially identifying subgroups of patients with ER-negative tumors who may have a more favorable outcome (Esseghir2006Identification).

In the context of Wolfram syndrome, a rare neurodegenerative disorder, BDKRB1 expression is downregulated in a rat model, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's pathophysiology. This downregulation is observed alongside alterations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and bradykinin pathways, which are crucial for blood pressure regulation and inflammatory responses (Punapart2021The).

## Interactions
The BDKRB1 gene encodes the bradykinin B1 receptor (B1R), a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation and pain response. B1R interacts with G proteins, primarily coupling with the Gq protein, which activates phospholipase C-β. This activation leads to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol, resulting in the activation of protein kinase C and the MEK/ERK MAP kinases (Marceau2020Bradykinin).

B1R is also involved in the formation of homooligomers, which are necessary for its maturation and surface expression. This receptor can form heterodimers with the B2 bradykinin receptor (B2R), leading to selective degradation of B2R (Marceau2020Bradykinin). Unlike B2R, B1R does not undergo typical GPCR desensitization and is associated with caveolae, lipid rafts near the plasma membrane, facilitating prolonged signaling (Marceau2020Bradykinin).

In the context of glioblastoma, the bradykinin-BDKRB1 axis regulates the expression of the aquaporin 4 (AQP4) gene, influencing cell migration and invasion. This regulation involves a signaling cascade that includes the activation of MEK1, ERK1/2, and NF-κB, highlighting the receptor's role in cancer cell dynamics (Sun2020The).
