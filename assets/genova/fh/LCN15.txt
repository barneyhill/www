# LCN15

## Overview
LCN15 is a gene that encodes the protein lipocalin 15, a member of the lipocalin family, which is known for its role in binding and transporting small hydrophobic molecules. Lipocalin 15 is characterized by its conserved eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel structure, typical of the lipocalin family, which facilitates its function in ligand binding and transport (Du2015A; Charkoftaki2019Update). This protein is predominantly found in the olfactory mucus, secreted by Bowman's glands, and is thought to play a crucial role in the olfactory system, potentially involved in odorant transport and protection of olfactory cilia (Ijichi2022Lipocalin). Additionally, lipocalin 15 exhibits bacteriostatic properties, suggesting a protective role against infections in the olfactory mucosa (Ijichi2022Lipocalin). While the gene is present in terrestrial vertebrates, its absence in certain species like the crocodile C. porosus indicates possible evolutionary gene loss events (DiezHermano2021An).

## Structure
Lipocalin 15 (LCN15) is a member of the lipocalin protein family, characterized by a conserved eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel structure. This β-barrel forms a cylindrically closed β-sheet, which is a hallmark of the lipocalin family, providing a stable framework for binding small hydrophobic molecules (Du2015A; Charkoftaki2019Update). The β-barrel structure is crucial for the protein's function, allowing it to bind and transport various ligands, including lipids and retinoids (Du2015A).

LCN15 is identified as a novel lipocalin in terrestrial vertebrates, although it is absent in certain species like the crocodile C. porosus, indicating possible gene loss events (DiezHermano2021An). While specific details about the primary sequence or post-translational modifications of LCN15 are not provided, lipocalins in general may undergo modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect their stability and function (Charkoftaki2019Update).

LCN15 is notably concentrated in human olfactory mucus, where it is secreted by Bowman's glands, suggesting a specialized role in olfactory processes (Ijichi2022Lipocalin). However, detailed information on any specific domains or isoforms of LCN15 is not available in the provided context.

## Function
Lipocalin 15 (LCN15) is a protein primarily found in the olfactory mucus, where it plays a significant role in the olfactory system. It is localized in the Bowman's glands of the olfactory cleft mucosa, which are responsible for producing olfactory mucus. LCN15 is abundant in the olfactory mucus but not in respiratory mucus, indicating its specific function in the olfactory system (Ijichi2022Lipocalin). The protein is associated with the activity of Bowman's glands and may serve as a biomarker for their activity, as its presence correlates with neuron-specific Protein-Gene Product 9.5 (PGP9.5) immunoreactivity, suggesting production in non-degenerated areas of the olfactory neuroepithelium (Ijichi2022Lipocalin).

LCN15 is also involved in the protection of the olfactory cilia and may play a role in odorant transport. It has been shown to have bacteriostatic effects, inhibiting the growth of E. coli under iron-limiting conditions, which suggests a role in preventing infections in the olfactory mucosa (Ijichi2022Lipocalin). However, the full effects of LCN15 expression on olfactory function and its specific molecular activities in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Ijichi2022Lipocalin).

## Interactions
LCN15, a member of the lipocalin protein family, is involved in various interactions that influence its function and regulation. Although specific protein interactions of LCN15 are not extensively detailed, it is known to co-express with other lipocalin proteins such as LCN1 and PAEP in esophageal carcinoma, suggesting potential synergistic interactions in certain biological functions (Yang2020Immunerelated). 

LCN15 is also implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism in enterocytes, where it may interact with high glucose conditions, potentially communicating with endocrine cells in the intestine or peripheral tissues (Boztepe2018Investigation). This suggests a role in metabolic processes, although specific protein partners in these interactions are not identified.

In the context of olfactory cleft mucus, LCN15 is enriched and may play a role in human olfaction, although specific interaction partners in this environment are not detailed (Yoshikawa2018The). The evolutionary analysis of the lipocalin family indicates that LCN15, along with other lipocalins, may have undergone functional divergence, potentially involving protein-protein interactions that are yet to be fully elucidated (DiezHermano2021An).
