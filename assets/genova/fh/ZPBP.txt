# ZPBP

## Overview
The ZPBP gene encodes the zona pellucida binding protein, which is a crucial component in the reproductive process, specifically in sperm-egg interactions. This protein is primarily located in the acrosome of sperm cells, where it plays a significant role in acrosome biogenesis and sperm morphogenesis. The ZPBP protein is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like domain and a cysteine-rich region, which are essential for its structural integrity and function. It is involved in the binding and penetration of the zona pellucida, the glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte, thereby facilitating fertilization. The protein is part of a larger complex that includes interactions with other proteins such as testisin and zonadhesin, which are vital for successful sperm-oocyte fusion. Mutations in the ZPBP1 gene have been linked to male infertility conditions, such as globozoospermia, due to their impact on sperm morphology and acrosome formation (Lin2007Loss; Yatsenko2011Association).

## Structure
The ZPBP (zona pellucida binding protein) gene encodes proteins that are integral to sperm-egg interactions, specifically in the acrosome of spermatids and spermatozoa. The molecular structure of ZPBP proteins includes an N-terminal signal peptide, an immunoglobulin-like domain, a C-terminal cysteine-rich region, and several predicted N-glycosylation sites. These proteins contain 15 conserved cysteine residues outside of the signal peptide region, which are crucial for their conformation due to conserved disulfide bonds (Lin2007Loss).

ZPBP proteins undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation. For instance, deglycosylation studies have shown that the 38-kDa ZPBP1 band collapses to 34 kDa, indicating the presence of glycosylation (Lin2007Loss). The proteins are expressed as splice variant isoforms, contributing to their functional diversity. In pigs, two mRNA variants of the ZPBP2 gene result from alternative splicing, encoding precursor peptides of different lengths (Song2010Molecular).

The ZPBP proteins are conserved across various species, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, but are absent in teleost fish, highlighting their evolutionary significance (Lin2007Loss). These structural features and modifications are essential for their role in acrosome biogenesis and sperm morphogenesis.

## Function
ZPBP (zona pellucida binding protein) plays a critical role in sperm-egg interactions during fertilization. It is primarily active in the acrosome of sperm cells, a specialized organelle that facilitates the penetration of the zona pellucida, the glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte. ZPBP is involved in acrosome biogenesis and sperm morphogenesis, contributing to the structural integrity of the acrosome, which is essential for successful fertilization (Lin2007Loss).

ZPBP1 and its paralog ZPBP2 are integral components of the acrosomal matrix. ZPBP1 is crucial for maintaining acrosome integrity, as its absence leads to acrosome fragmentation and impaired sperm morphology, resulting in infertility (Lin2007Loss). ZPBP2, on the other hand, is involved in acrosome compaction and structure maintenance, with its absence leading to reduced fertility due to subtle sperm deformities and delayed fertilization (Lin2007Loss).

ZPBP2 has also been suggested to have potential hyaluronic acid (HA) binding properties, which may play a role in sperm-oocyte interactions by binding to HA in the extracellular matrix of the cumulus-oophorus complex (Torabi2017Zona). This interaction is crucial for the fertilization process, highlighting the importance of ZPBP proteins in reproductive success.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZPBP1 gene are associated with male infertility, particularly conditions affecting sperm morphology such as globozoospermia and teratozoospermia. Globozoospermia is characterized by round-headed spermatozoa lacking acrosomes, leading to infertility. Specific mutations in ZPBP1, including missense and splicing mutations, have been identified in men with abnormal sperm head morphology, which were absent in control groups, suggesting a significant role in these conditions (Jiao2020Molecular; Yatsenko2011Association). 

In knockout mice, the absence of ZPBP1 results in severe sperm deformities, including globozoospermia, characterized by round-headed sperm with coiled tails and malformed acrosomes, which mirrors the phenotype observed in humans with ZPBP1 mutations (Lin2007Loss). A specific nonsense mutation, c.931C>T; p.(Gln311Ter), has been identified in a patient with globozoospermia, leading to a truncated protein and disrupted acrosome formation (Oud2020Exome). 

These mutations are hypothesized to exert a dominant-negative effect by altering ZPBP1 protein folding and interactions in the acrosome, contributing to the dysmorphic shape of the sperm head and infertility (Yatsenko2011Association).

## Interactions
ZPBP (zona pellucida binding protein) is involved in several interactions crucial for sperm function and fertilization. It is a component of the acrosomal matrix and plays a significant role in sperm-zona pellucida interactions. ZPBP1, a variant of ZPBP, interacts with ZP2, a zona pellucida protein, suggesting its involvement in sperm penetration of the zona pellucida (Lin2007Loss). ZPBP1 is also associated with the acrosomal matrix over the inner acrosomal membrane, and its interaction with the zona pellucida is essential for successful fertilization (Lin2007Loss).

ZPBP forms part of multiprotein complexes during sperm capacitation and acrosomal exocytosis. It interacts with proteins such as testisin, zonadhesin, and heat-shock proteins, which are involved in sperm-oocyte interaction (Swegen2018The). These interactions suggest that ZPBP is part of a larger zona-binding complex, facilitating the proteolytic events necessary for sperm binding and penetration of the zona pellucida (Swegen2018The).

Mutations in the ZPBP1 gene have been associated with abnormal sperm head morphology, indicating its critical role in acrosome formation and sperm morphogenesis (Yatsenko2011Association).
