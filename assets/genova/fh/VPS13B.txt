# VPS13B

## Overview
VPS13B is a gene located on chromosome 8q22.2 that encodes the vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog B, a large and complex protein involved in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. This protein is primarily localized in the Golgi complex and plays a crucial role in maintaining Golgi structure and function, which is essential for proper protein glycosylation and sorting. VPS13B is characterized by its involvement in vesicle-mediated transport and membrane trafficking, and it is implicated in the regulation of autophagy and lipid transport between organelles. Mutations in the VPS13B gene are associated with Cohen syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder with a wide range of clinical features, including developmental delay and intellectual disability (Seifert2015Cohen; Lee2020Autophagy; Ugur2020Role).

## Structure
The VPS13B protein is a large, complex protein encoded by the VPS13B gene, which spans approximately 864 kb of genomic DNA and consists of 66 exons (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis). The protein is approximately 450 kDa in size and plays a crucial role in maintaining Golgi structure and function (Zorn2022Disease). VPS13B is characterized by its involvement in vesicle-mediated transport and membrane trafficking, with localization primarily in the Golgi complex (Ugur2020Role).

The molecular structure of VPS13B includes several conserved domains, such as the leucine zipper, peroxisomal targeting signals, vacuolar-targeting motif, and ER membrane retention signal. It also contains 10 transmembrane regions, although the prediction of these regions varies with different software tools (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis). The protein's sequence shows the least conservation among the VPS13 homologous genes, particularly at the N- and C-termini (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis).

Alternative splicing of the VPS13B gene results in multiple transcript variants, including variants 1A and 2A, which differ in their inclusion of exons 28 and 28b (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis). These splice variants contribute to the functional diversity of the protein, although their specific functional roles require further investigation (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis).

## Function
The VPS13B gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics, particularly within the Golgi complex. In healthy human cells, VPS13B is crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for proper protein glycosylation and sorting (Ugur2020Role; Rzepnikowska2017Yeast). The protein is involved in vesicle-mediated protein sorting and transport, contributing to the maintenance of Golgi structure and function (Lee2020Autophagy).

VPS13B is also implicated in the regulation of autophagy, a cellular degradation and recycling system. Mutations in VPS13B can lead to the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, indicating its role in normal autophagic processes, which are vital for cellular homeostasis, particularly in neurons (Lee2020Autophagy). Additionally, VPS13B is involved in lipid transport between organelles, a process crucial for maintaining organelle lipid homeostasis and membrane dynamics (Dziurdzik2021The; Leonzino2021Insights).

The protein's activity is localized to the Golgi complex, endosomes, and acrosome, suggesting its involvement in membrane expansion and organelle biogenesis (Dziurdzik2021The; Leonzino2021Insights). These functions are essential for normal cellular operations and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS13B gene are primarily associated with Cohen syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by a range of clinical features including developmental delay, microcephaly, intellectual disability, distinct facial features, progressive retinal dystrophy, and intermittent neutropenia (Kang2023Deletion; Seifert2015Cohen; Koehler2019A). The gene is located on chromosome 8q22.2 and encodes a protein involved in transmembrane transport and Golgi integrity, which is crucial for neuronal outgrowth and glycosylation (Karimzadeh2021A).

Cohen syndrome exhibits significant phenotypic variability, with some patients presenting additional features such as obesity, short stature, muscular hypotonia, scoliosis, and narrow hands and feet (Koehler2019A). Over 200 mutations in the VPS13B gene have been reported, including missense/nonsense variants, small deletions/insertions, and gross deletions/insertions (Kang2023Deletion). These mutations can disrupt the normal function of the Golgi complex, leading to impaired neurite outgrowth and contributing to the neurological impairments observed in patients (Seifert2015Cohen).

The genetic and phenotypic variability of Cohen syndrome underscores the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and management (Koehler2019A).

## Interactions
VPS13B is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. It is localized at the cis-trans Golgi complex interface and functions as a tether between Golgi membranes. VPS13B is a functional partner of FAM177A1, a protein also localized in the Golgi complex. Although direct interaction evidence is lacking, FAM177A1 may assist VPS13B in its tethering function or in lipid extraction and delivery (Ugur2023VPS13B).

VPS13B interacts with Rab GTPases, specifically Rab6 and Rab14, which are involved in vesicular trafficking pathways. It acts as an effector of Rab6, influencing Golgi stack integrity and vesicle targeting. VPS13B's interaction with Rab14 is consistent regardless of Rab14's activation state (Koike2019SNAREs). The protein also binds to phosphoinositides, such as PtdIns(3)P, which is important for its role in endosomal trafficking (Koike2019SNAREs).

VPS13B is involved in the transferrin receptor (TfnR) recycling pathway, where it interacts with SNARE proteins Stx6 and Stx13. It binds to liposomes containing both SNAREs, but not to those with either SNARE alone, indicating a specific interaction necessary for vesicle targeting (Koike2019SNAREs). These interactions highlight VPS13B's multifunctional role in cellular processes.
