# TNFSF14

## Overview
TNFSF14 is a gene that encodes the protein TNF superfamily member 14, commonly referred to as LIGHT. This protein is a type II transmembrane cytokine and a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in immune system regulation and inflammation. LIGHT is primarily expressed in immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DCs), where it influences immune responses through interactions with receptors like the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) (Wu2022Molecular; Holmes2014Licensed). These interactions are crucial for processes such as T cell activation, immune modulation, and inflammation. The gene's involvement in various cellular processes, including myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle regeneration, underscores its significance in both normal physiological and pathological conditions (WaldemerStreyer2015Myocytederived). Additionally, TNFSF14 has been implicated in several diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Han2022Comprehensive; Torre‐Fuentes2020Variants).

## Structure
The TNFSF14 protein, also known as LIGHT, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and is characterized by its type II transmembrane structure. The primary structure of TNFSF14 consists of a polypeptide chain that includes a transmembrane domain and a conserved TNF homology domain (THD) (Wu2022Molecular). The THD is located in the extracellular region and is composed of 10 β-strands, which facilitate the formation of homotrimers, a common quaternary structure in TNF superfamily members (Wu2022Molecular).

In terms of secondary structure, the TNFSF14 protein includes a transmembrane domain of 23 amino acids and a THD of 43 amino acids (Wu2022Molecular). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional conformation, which is crucial for its interaction with receptors. The TNFSF14 protein in spotted gar, a model organism, shares 37.7% sequence similarity with its human counterpart, indicating some degree of structural conservation (Wu2022Molecular).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, although specific modifications for TNFSF14 are not detailed in the provided context. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional properties.

## Function
TNFSF14, also known as LIGHT, is a cytokine involved in various cellular processes, primarily within the immune system. It is expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DCs), where it plays a crucial role in immune modulation. TNFSF14 expression is induced by cytokines such as IL-15 and IL-2, and it can be released from the cell surface through proteolytic cleavage. This release is stimulated by IL-2 or IL-15, facilitating interactions between TNFSF14-expressing NK cells and immature DCs, promoting DC maturation. This maturation is characterized by increased expression of CD40, CD86, and HLA-DR, which are essential for adaptive immunity (Holmes2014Licensed).

TNFSF14 also influences myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle regeneration. It acts as a survival factor necessary for these processes, with its effects mediated by receptors HVEM and LTβR in an Akt-dependent manner. TNFSF14 supports myoblast survival, ensuring a sufficient number of cells for fusion during differentiation, and its knockdown impairs muscle regeneration (WaldemerStreyer2015Myocytederived).

In addition, TNFSF14 promotes the differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells, activating the STAT3 and STAT5 signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell differentiation and division (Heo2023LIGHT).

## Clinical Significance
The TNFSF14 gene, also known as LIGHT, has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In the context of autoimmune diseases, TNFSF14 has been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Overexpression of its membrane-bound form in T cells can lead to autoimmunity, while its soluble form inhibits activation. Reduced expression of TNFSF14 mRNA and protein has been observed in MS patients, and the rs6684865 variant of its receptor, TNFRSF14, predisposes individuals to MS, particularly in those positive for herpesvirus (Torre‐Fuentes2020Variants).

In cancer, particularly gliomas, TNFSF14 expression is elevated in aggressive forms such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Higher expression levels correlate with poorer prognosis and shorter survival in glioma patients. TNFSF14 is involved in immune responses and is linked to immune checkpoint molecules, suggesting its role as an immune suppressor in gliomas (Yang2021Molecular; Han2022Comprehensive).

TNFSF14 has also been identified as a potential biomarker in Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), where it is significantly up-regulated in patients, indicating its involvement in immune system responses (Raposo2015Novel). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TNFSF14 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
TNFSF14, also known as LIGHT, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and interacts with several receptors, including the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR). These interactions play significant roles in immune regulation and inflammation. LIGHT binds to HVEM, facilitating the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways, which are crucial for immune responses (Mauri1998LIGHT; Holmes2014Licensed). The interaction with HVEM is also implicated in exacerbating T cell activation, contributing to severe intestinal inflammation in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (Steinberg2011The).

LIGHT also interacts with LTβR, which is involved in proinflammatory and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. This interaction is significant for the regulation of immune responses and has been shown to promote the proliferation of lung fibroblasts, highlighting its role in lung inflammation and remodeling (da2018TNFSF14). LIGHT's interaction with LTβR is crucial for its protective role against colitis, as demonstrated in mouse models where LTβR deficiency led to more severe disease symptoms (Giles2018The).

Additionally, LIGHT can be modulated by decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), which competes with HVEM and LTβR for binding, thereby influencing its bioavailability and signaling potential (Steinberg2011The). These interactions underscore the complex regulatory network in which LIGHT participates, affecting various immune and inflammatory processes.
