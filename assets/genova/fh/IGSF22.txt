# IGSF22

## Overview
The IGSF22 gene encodes the protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 22, which is a part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, a large group of proteins involved in the recognition, binding, or adhesion processes of cells. This protein is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains, which are typically involved in immune system functions, although the specific role of IGSF22 in immune response or other physiological processes remains to be fully elucidated. IGSF22 is implicated in various cellular interactions and may play a role in cell signaling pathways, although detailed mechanisms are still under investigation. Understanding the function and interactions of IGSF22 could provide insights into its potential involvement in disease processes and therapeutic applications (Qiu2020aarFDC).
