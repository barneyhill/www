# MYO9B

## Overview
MYO9B is a gene that encodes the protein myosin IXB, a unique member of the myosin superfamily characterized by its single-headed, processive motor function and a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain. Myosin IXB plays a critical role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cellular signaling, particularly in the regulation of actin polymerization and cell migration. The protein is involved in maintaining intestinal barrier function and modulating tight junction permeability through Rho-dependent mechanisms, which are essential for processes such as wound repair and epithelial restitution. MYO9B's interactions with other proteins, such as BIG1 and ROBO1, further underscore its regulatory role in cellular signaling pathways. Mutations and altered expression of MYO9B have been associated with various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases and celiac disease, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining intestinal integrity and its potential contribution to disease pathogenesis (Wang2016MYO9B; Hegan2016Mice; van2007The).

## Structure
The MYO9B protein is a motor protein that features a complex molecular structure, including a motor domain, a tail region, and a RhoGAP domain. The motor domain is essential for ATP hydrolysis and actin binding, facilitating the protein's movement along actin filaments. This domain contains a large insertion at loop 2, which is critical for its processive movement and actin affinity (van2007The). The tail region includes regulatory domains and is involved in the localization of MYO9B to specific cellular sites, such as the tips of filopodia and retraction fibers (van2007The).

The RhoGAP domain of MYO9B is particularly notable for its role in signaling. It contains a central 4-helix bundle, a common structural element among RhoGAP family members, and features three distinct patches that form a potential binding surface for RhoA interaction (Kong2015Myo9b). Patch II, enriched with positively charged residues, specifically recognizes the negatively charged A3 helix of RhoA, which is crucial for its RhoA-specific GAP activity (Kong2015Myo9b). Mutations in this patch can impair the protein's ability to inactivate RhoA (Kong2015Myo9b).

MYO9B may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has splice variant isoforms that result in different functional forms of the protein. These structural features and modifications contribute to MYO9B's role in cellular processes like vesicle transport and cell motility.

## Function
Myosin IXB (Myo9b) is a single-headed, processive motor protein that plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cellular signaling. It is involved in intracellular transport and cell shape maintenance by moving toward the plus end of actin filaments (Liao2010Head). Myo9b contains a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain in its tail, which is essential for modulating Rho-dependent signaling pathways. This activity is particularly important in regions of active actin polymerization, such as lamellipodia and filopodia, where Myo9b helps regulate actin dynamics and cell migration (van2007The).

In healthy human cells, Myo9b is involved in maintaining intestinal barrier function by regulating tight junction permeability through Rho-dependent mechanisms. It influences the contractility of junctional cellular perimeters and is crucial for wound repair and epithelial restitution after mucosal damage (Hegan2016Mice). Myo9b's motor activity targets its RhoGAP domain to sites of actin polymerization, suggesting a role in the spatial regulation of Rho signaling, which is vital for maintaining cell polarization and facilitating cell migration (van2007The). The protein's interaction with actin is characterized by high affinity binding, even in the ATP-bound state, which supports its processive movement along actin filaments (Liao2010Head).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MYO9B gene have been implicated in several autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within MYO9B, such as rs2305767, have shown a significant association with CD, indicating a strong genetic link to this condition (Cooney2009Association). Other SNPs, like rs962917, rs1457092, and rs2305764, have been associated with an increased risk of IBD, CD, and UC, particularly in Caucasian populations (Wang2016MYO9B).

MYO9B is also linked to celiac disease and type 1 diabetes, with studies suggesting its role in intestinal permeability due to its involvement in Rho GTPase signaling pathways (Wang2016MYO9B). In mice, the absence of MYO9B results in impaired intestinal barrier function and increased intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, which are characteristics of IBD (Hegan2016Mice). These findings highlight the gene's importance in maintaining intestinal integrity and its potential contribution to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which MYO9B influences these conditions.

## Interactions
MYO9B, a motor protein, engages in several interactions with other proteins that influence its function and cellular processes. It interacts with BIG1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which regulates MYO9B's Rho-GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity. BIG1 binds to the zinc finger/GAP domain of MYO9B, inhibiting its GAP activity and competing with RhoA for binding, suggesting a regulatory role in cellular signaling pathways (Saeki2005BIG1).

MYO9B also interacts with the intracellular domain of ROBO1, a component of the SLIT/ROBO signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the SLIT2-induced inhibition of cell migration and RhoA activation, highlighting MYO9B's role in lung cancer cell migration and tumor suppression (Kong2015Myo9b).

Additionally, MYO9B is phosphorylated by cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, enhancing its GAP function and reducing RhoA-GTP levels, which is significant for platelet function (Comer2020The). MYO9B also interacts with kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B), suggesting a role in coordinating microtubule- and actin-based vesicle transport (Seog2011Direct).
