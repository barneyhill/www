# HEXB

## Overview
The HEXB gene encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase, a crucial lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of GM2 gangliosides and other glycosphingolipids. This enzyme is categorized as a hydrolase, which functions by cleaving terminal N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues from glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. The beta subunit, encoded by HEXB, is essential for the formation of both hexosaminidase A (Hex A) and hexosaminidase B (Hex B) isoenzymes, which are vital for normal cellular function and prevention of neurodegenerative disorders such as Sandhoff disease (Mark2003Crystal; NEOTE1988Characterization). Mutations in the HEXB gene can lead to deficient enzyme activity, resulting in the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides and subsequent cellular dysfunction (Zampieri2012Sequence). The gene is located on chromosome 5q13 and is subject to various mutations that can cause a spectrum of clinical manifestations, primarily associated with Sandhoff disease (Zampieri2008Molecular; Rahmani2020Novel).

## Structure
The HEXB gene encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase, which is crucial for the degradation of GM2 gangliosides. The primary structure of the HEXB protein consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the beta subunit. This subunit undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are essential for its proper folding and function (Neote1990Translation).

The secondary structure of the HEXB protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is critical for its enzymatic activity. The quaternary structure of beta-hexosaminidase involves the assembly of the beta subunit with the alpha subunit to form a functional heterodimeric enzyme (Yasui2013Molecular).

Mutations in the HEXB gene can affect the protein's structure and function. For example, the p.Arg505Gln mutation disrupts hydrogen bonds and affects the dimerization of the subunits, impacting the enzyme's stability and catalytic ability (Yasui2013Molecular). These structural insights are important for understanding the molecular pathology of Sandhoff disease, a condition associated with HEXB mutations.

## Function
The HEXB gene encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase, which is crucial for the degradation of GM2 gangliosides and other glycosphingolipids in lysosomes. In healthy human cells, this enzyme exists in two major forms: hexosaminidase A (Hex A), composed of one alpha and one beta subunit, and hexosaminidase B (Hex B), composed of two beta subunits (George1977Regional; NEOTE1988Characterization). Hex A is responsible for the degradation of GM2 ganglioside by removing a terminal N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (β-GalNAc) residue, a process that requires the GM2 activator protein to solubilize the ganglioside for presentation to Hex A (Mark2003Crystal). The beta subunit, encoded by HEXB, is essential for the formation of both Hex A and Hex B, and is necessary for the binding of the GM2-activator complex to Hex A (Mark2003Crystal).

The enzyme's activity is particularly high in the kidney, brain, and liver, reflecting its importance in these tissues (NEOTE1988Characterization). Proper function of HEXB is essential for preventing the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in lysosomes, which is critical for normal cellular function and preventing neurodegenerative disorders such as Sandhoff disease (Zampieri2012Sequence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HEXB gene are primarily associated with Sandhoff disease, a severe neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder. This condition results from the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides due to deficient activity of hexosaminidase A and B enzymes, which are crucial for ganglioside degradation (Zampieri2012Sequence; Rahmani2020Novel). Sandhoff disease manifests in various forms, including infantile, juvenile, and adult-onset, each with differing severity and age of onset. Symptoms include motor weakness, developmental delay, macrocephaly, and progressive neurological deterioration (Rahmani2020Novel; Khan2019Homozygous).

The HEXB gene is located on chromosome 5q13 and contains 14 exons. Mutations in this gene include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations, as well as large deletions such as a common 16 kb deletion affecting exons 1-5 and the promoter region (Zampieri2008Molecular; Rahmani2020Novel). These genetic alterations lead to reduced or absent enzyme activity, contributing to the clinical manifestations of Sandhoff disease (Zampieri2008Molecular; Zampieri2012Sequence). The severity of the disease correlates with the residual enzyme activity, which is influenced by the specific mutations present in the HEXB gene (Zampieri2008Molecular).

## Interactions
The HEXB gene encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme β-hexosaminidase, which forms a heterodimer with the alpha subunit encoded by the HEXA gene. This dimerization is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity, as it allows the degradation of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans by removing terminal β-glycosidically linked residues (Maier2003The). The β-hexosaminidase B (HexB) enzyme, specifically, is involved in the hydrolysis of neutral substrates, while the α-subunit can cleave negatively charged substrates. The hydrolysis of ganglioside GM2 by HexA requires coactivation by the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which presents the gangliosides to the enzyme (Maier2003The).

In the context of GM2 gangliosidoses, a modified version of HexB, composed of homodimeric altered β-subunits, has been developed to enhance substrate recognition and interaction with GM2A. This modified HexB, when combined with recombinant GM2A, significantly reduces GM2 accumulation in fibroblasts derived from patients with Tay-Sachs disease, indicating a potential combinational replacement therapy (Kitakaze2016Combined). The interaction between the modified HexB and GM2A is crucial for the degradation of GM2 gangliosides, suggesting a physical interaction that enhances the enzyme's activity (Kitakaze2016Combined).
