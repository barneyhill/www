# VCX2

## Overview
The VCX2 gene is a member of the VCX/Y gene family, which is located on the X chromosome and is known for its role in encoding proteins with variable charge. The protein encoded by VCX2, known as variable charge X-linked 2, is characterized by its unique charge properties, which are thought to be involved in cellular processes such as chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. Although the precise biological functions of the VCX2 protein remain to be fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to play a role in the regulation of gene expression, potentially influencing cognitive function and development. The VCX2 gene and its protein product are of particular interest in the study of X-linked genetic disorders, where alterations in their expression or function may contribute to disease phenotypes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
