# TESK1

## Overview
TESK1 is a gene that encodes the protein testis associated actin remodelling kinase 1, a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as movement, adhesion, and morphogenesis by phosphorylating cofilin, thereby inhibiting its actin-binding and depolymerizing activities (Toshima2001Cofilin). Unlike LIM kinases, TESK1 is activated through integrin-mediated signaling pathways rather than the Rho-ROCK pathway, highlighting its unique regulatory mechanism (Toshima2001Cofilin). TESK1 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the testis, and is involved in interactions with focal adhesion proteins, influencing actin dynamics and cell adhesion (Toshima2001Cofilin). Its clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, melanoma, and glomerular diseases, where it affects cellular integrity and cytoskeletal dynamics (Wang2018Regulation; RodiñoJaneiro2018Decreased; Kim2015Actina).

## Structure
TESK1 is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by a unique molecular structure comprising an N-terminal protein kinase domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain. The protein kinase domain shares approximately 50% amino acid identity with those of LIM-kinases, indicating a close structural relationship, although their overall domain structures differ (Toshima2001Cofilin). The C-terminal region of TESK1 is rich in proline residues and contains Pro-X-X-Pro motifs, which are recognized by SH3 domains, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions at cell adhesion sites (Toshima2001Cofilin).

TESK1 phosphorylates cofilin at Ser-3, a modification that inhibits cofilin's actin-binding and depolymerizing activity, thus playing a crucial role in actin cytoskeletal dynamics (Toshima2001Cofilin). TESK1's kinase activity is specifically upregulated by integrin-mediated signaling, unlike LIM-kinases, which are activated by Rho-ROCK and Rac-Pak pathways (Toshima2001Cofilin). The protein is expressed widely across various cell lines, with a major immunoreactive band observed at approximately 68 kDa, consistent with its calculated mass (Toshima2001Cofilin). TESK1 may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which could affect its function and localization. However, specific details on its tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TESK1 (testis associated actin remodelling kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics by phosphorylating cofilin at Ser-3. This phosphorylation inhibits cofilin's actin-binding and depolymerizing activity, which is essential for actin filament dynamics and cellular processes such as movement, adhesion, and morphogenesis (Toshima2001Cofilin). TESK1 is involved in integrin-mediated signaling pathways, where it enhances the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, structures important for cell spreading and movement (Toshima2001Cofilin).

TESK1's kinase activity is independent of the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway, distinguishing it from LIM kinases, which are activated by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) (Toshima2001Cofilin). TESK1 is thought to localize at adhesion sites, potentially interacting with SH3 domain-containing focal adhesion proteins, and may phosphorylate focal adhesion proteins like CAS and paxillin, contributing to actin reorganization (Toshima2001Cofilin). TESK1 is expressed in various tissues, indicating its general cellular functions beyond its higher expression in the testis (Toshima2001Cofilin).

## Clinical Significance
TESK1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in actin cytoskeleton regulation. In diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), decreased TESK1 expression correlates with reduced phosphorylation of cofilin 1 (CFL1), leading to actin depolymerization and compromised intestinal epithelial integrity. This disruption is particularly noted in female patients, suggesting a sex-specific mechanism in IBS-D pathophysiology (RodiñoJaneiro2018Decreased).

In melanoma, TESK1 is identified as a potential target in cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors. Its knockdown reduces actin stress fiber formation and YAP/TAZ activity, which are crucial for cell survival in resistant melanoma cells. This suggests that TESK1 inhibition could be a strategy to overcome drug resistance (Kim2015Actina).

TESK1 also plays a role in glomerular diseases. In podocytes, TESK1 regulates cofilin phosphorylation, which is essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier. TESK1 knockout affects podocyte motility and cytoskeletal dynamics, indicating its importance in glomerular disease processes (Wang2018Regulation).

These findings highlight TESK1's clinical significance in various conditions, particularly those involving cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular integrity.

## Interactions
TESK1 (testis associated actin remodelling kinase 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in actin cytoskeleton regulation. One of its primary interactions is with actopaxin, a focal adhesion protein. TESK1 binds specifically to the carboxyl-terminal region of actopaxin, an interaction that is crucial for modulating actin dynamics and cell spreading on fibronectin (LaLonde2005Actopaxin). This interaction negatively regulates TESK1's kinase activity, which is essential for the phosphorylation of cofilin, a protein involved in actin filament dynamics (LaLonde2005Actopaxin). 

TESK1 also phosphorylates cofilin at Ser-3, inhibiting its actin-binding and depolymerizing activity, which is critical for actin reorganization and focal adhesion formation (Toshima2001Cofilin). This phosphorylation is similar to the action of LIM-kinases, although TESK1 operates independently of the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway (Toshima2001Cofilin). TESK1's interaction with actopaxin and its role in cofilin phosphorylation highlight its importance in cellular processes such as cell spreading and morphology (LaLonde2005Actopaxin). These interactions suggest that TESK1 is a key player in integrin-mediated signaling pathways, influencing actin dynamics and cell adhesion (Toshima2001Cofilin).
