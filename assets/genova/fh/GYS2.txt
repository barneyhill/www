# GYS2

## Overview
The GYS2 gene encodes glycogen synthase 2, a liver-specific enzyme that plays a pivotal role in glycogen synthesis. This enzyme is categorized as a glycogen synthase and is essential for the conversion of glucose to glycogen, a critical process for maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body. Glycogen synthase 2 is primarily active in the liver, where it facilitates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen, thus regulating blood glucose levels, particularly during fasting periods (von2013Glucose6Phosphate–Mediated). The activity of the enzyme is modulated by phosphorylation and allosteric effectors, with glucose-6-phosphate serving as a significant activator (DİLMEC2009Characterization). Mutations in the GYS2 gene can lead to glycogen storage disease type 0 (GSD-0), characterized by impaired glycogen synthesis and associated metabolic disturbances (Orho1998Mutations). Additionally, GYS2 has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma, where its interactions with proteins such as p53 and HBx suggest a role in tumor suppression and potential as a therapeutic target (Li2022Dysregulation; Chen2018A).

## Structure
The GYS2 gene encodes the liver glycogen synthase enzyme, which is crucial for glycogen synthesis. The primary structure of the GYS2 protein consists of a polypeptide chain encoded by 16 exons, resulting in a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 80,957 Da (DİLMEC2009Characterization). The protein includes a highly conserved Glycogen_syn domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and is conserved across various species (DİLMEC2009Characterization).

The regulation of GYS2 involves phosphorylation, which modulates its activity. Phosphorylation typically inactivates glycogen synthase, while dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activates it, facilitating glycogen synthesis (Pederson2019Structure). The enzyme is also regulated by allosteric effectors such as glucose 6-phosphate, which can enhance its activity (DİLMEC2009Characterization).

Mutations in the GYS2 gene can lead to glycogen storage disease type 0, characterized by impaired glycogen synthase activity. These mutations include nonsense and missense mutations that affect the protein's structure and function, potentially altering critical catalytic and allosteric sites (Orho1998Mutations). The study of these mutations provides insights into the functional aspects of the GYS2 protein (Orho1998Mutations).

## Function
The GYS2 gene encodes glycogen synthase 2, an enzyme that plays a critical role in glycogen synthesis in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of glucose units from uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucose to a growing glycogen chain, a key step in glucose storage (von2013Glucose6Phosphate–Mediated). Glycogen synthase 2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm of liver cells, where it is regulated by phosphorylation and allosteric effectors, with glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) being a significant activator (von2013Glucose6Phosphate–Mediated; DİLMEC2009Characterization).

The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining blood glucose levels, especially during fasting, by converting excess glucose into glycogen for storage (Orho1998Mutations). In healthy human cells, GYS2 ensures proper glycogen storage, which is essential for energy homeostasis and glucose regulation (Orho1998Mutations). Mutations in the GYS2 gene can lead to glycogen storage disease type 0 (GSD-0), characterized by fasting hypoglycemia and low liver glycogen content, highlighting the gene's importance in glucose homeostasis (Orho1998Mutations). The enzyme's function is vital for the liver's ability to manage glucose levels in response to dietary intake and energy demands (von2013Glucose6Phosphate–Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GYS2 gene, which encodes the liver-specific isoform of glycogen synthase, are linked to Glycogen Storage Disease type 0 (GSD 0). This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by fasting ketotic hypoglycemia, postprandial hyperglycemia, and hyperlactatemia due to the inability to synthesize glycogen effectively in the liver (Hannah2023Glycogen; Massese2022Glycogen). Clinical symptoms often manifest before the age of 3.5 years and can include pallor, sweating, lethargy, and seizures during hypoglycemic episodes (Massese2022Glycogen). 

Several mutations in the GYS2 gene have been identified, including missense mutations such as Ala339Pro and His446Asp, as well as a premature stop codon in exon 5 (Orho1998Mutations). These mutations result in reduced glycogen synthase activity, leading to the clinical manifestations of GSD 0 (Orho1998Mutations). 

Alterations in GYS2 expression are also implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where low GYS2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Li2022Dysregulation). GYS2 expression levels are linked to immune cell infiltration and may influence the tumor immune microenvironment, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Li2022Dysregulation).

## Interactions
Glycogen synthase 2 (GYS2) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in its function and regulation, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). GYS2 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, forming a complex that stabilizes p53 by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation mediated by MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction is significant in the negative feedback loop that restricts tumor growth in HBV-related HCC. GYS2 binds directly to p53, primarily in the cytoplasm, and this interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull down assays. The binding domains are identified as regions 1-101 amino acids of p53 and 1-500 amino acids of GYS2 (Chen2018A).

GYS2 also interacts with the HBx protein from the hepatitis B virus, which, along with HDAC1, forms a repressive complex that binds to the GYS2 promoter. This complex inhibits GYS2 expression and reduces glycogen content, highlighting a regulatory network involving GYS2, p53, HBx, and HDAC1 in HBV-positive HCC (Chen2018A). These interactions underscore the role of GYS2 as a tumor suppressor and its potential as a therapeutic target in HCC management.
