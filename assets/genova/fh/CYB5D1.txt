# CYB5D1

## Overview
CYB5D1 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome b5 domain containing 1, which is part of the cytochrome b5 family known for their role in electron transfer processes. This protein is categorized as an electron transfer protein and is implicated in oxidation-reduction reactions that are crucial for various metabolic pathways, including lipid and drug metabolism. The CYB5D1 protein facilitates the transfer of electrons, a key step in enzymatic reactions that modify lipids and metabolize drugs, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and metabolic regulation. While specific details about its cellular localization are not fully elucidated, proteins with cytochrome b5 domains are typically found in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, suggesting a similar localization for CYB5D1 (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
CYB5D1 (cytochrome b5 domain containing 1) encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in electron transfer processes within human cells. Proteins with cytochrome b5 domains, such as CYB5D1, are typically involved in oxidation-reduction reactions. These reactions are essential for various metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism and drug metabolism. The CYB5D1 protein likely contributes to these processes by facilitating the transfer of electrons, which is a critical step in the enzymatic reactions that modify lipids and metabolize drugs. This function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating metabolic activities.

In terms of cellular localization, proteins with cytochrome b5 domains are often found in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where they participate in the electron transport chain and other metabolic processes. Although specific details about the exact cellular location of CYB5D1 are not provided, it is reasonable to infer that it may operate in similar cellular environments, given its domain characteristics and functional roles. Through its involvement in these molecular processes, CYB5D1 contributes to the overall metabolic regulation and homeostasis in human cells, impacting organismal health and function.
