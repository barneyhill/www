# AKR1C3

## Overview
AKR1C3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3, a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones and prostaglandins, playing a significant role in the reduction of carbonyl groups on these substrates (Rižner2014Role; PENNING2000Human). Structurally, the AKR1C3 protein is characterized by an (α/β)8 barrel configuration, which facilitates its broad substrate specificity and interaction with various ligands, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Flanagan2012Crystal; Komoto2004Crystal). Functionally, AKR1C3 is crucial in the conversion of androgens and estrogens, impacting hormonal balance and receptor activity in tissues such as the prostate, mammary gland, and brain (PENNING2000Human). The enzyme's interactions with the androgen receptor and other cellular components underscore its role in cancer progression, particularly in prostate and breast cancers, where it is associated with drug resistance and disease progression (Yepuru2013Steroidogenic; Penning2019AKR1C3). Additionally, AKR1C3 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including castration-resistant prostate cancer, breast cancer, and endometriosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Penning2019AKR1C3; Penning2021AldoKeto).

## Structure
The AKR1C3 protein, also known as aldo-keto reductase 1C3, is characterized by an (α/β)8 barrel structure, a common fold within the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. This structure consists of a cylindrical core of eight β-strands surrounded by eight α-helices, forming a β-barrel at the core of the protein (Penning2019AKR1C3; Komoto2004Crystal). The active site of AKR1C3 is large and flexible, allowing it to accommodate a variety of substrates and inhibitors. It includes a conserved catalytic tetrad composed of Tyr55, Asp50, His117, and Lys84, with Tyr55 acting as a general acid-base (Penning2019AKR1C3; Flanagan2012Crystal).

The enzyme binds the cofactor NADP+ deeply within its active site, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Flanagan2012Crystal; Komoto2004Crystal). The active site also features sub-pockets SP1, SP2, and SP3, which contribute to its broad substrate specificity (Flanagan2012Crystal). The protein functions as a monomer, indicating its quaternary structure (Penning2004Structure–function).

AKR1C3 is involved in the reduction of carbonyl groups on steroids and prostaglandins, playing a significant role in hormone metabolism and cancer proliferation (Jackson2012Structure). The enzyme's structure allows for the binding of various ligands, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act as potent inhibitors (Flanagan2012Crystal).

## Function
AKR1C3, a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, plays a crucial role in steroid hormone metabolism in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a 17-ketosteroid reductase, catalyzing the conversion of Δ4-androstene-3,17-dione to testosterone, a key step in androgen metabolism (Rižner2014Role; PENNING2000Human). AKR1C3 also reduces 5α-androstane-3,17-dione to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), bypassing testosterone in the 'alternative pathway' of androgen synthesis (Rižner2014Role). In estrogen metabolism, AKR1C3 converts estrone to the more potent estrogen 17β-estradiol, influencing estrogen receptor activity (Rižner2014Role).

The enzyme is active in various tissues, including the prostate, mammary gland, and brain, where it modulates the levels of active androgens and estrogens, impacting receptor occupancy and hormonal balance (PENNING2000Human). In the prostate, AKR1C3 contributes to the regulation of androgen receptor activity by converting potent androgens to less active forms, potentially protecting against androgen excess (PENNING2000Human). Its activity in the brain suggests a role in producing neuroactive steroids that may influence the GABA A receptor (PENNING2000Human). These functions highlight AKR1C3's importance in maintaining hormonal homeostasis and influencing cellular differentiation and growth.

## Clinical Significance
The AKR1C3 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In prostate cancer, AKR1C3 is repressed by androgens but upregulated by androgen deprivation therapy, enabling tumors to produce their own androgens, which contributes to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and drug resistance against treatments like abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide (Penning2019AKR1C3; Penning2021AldoKeto). In breast cancer, AKR1C3 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and contributes to drug resistance, particularly to doxorubicin, through the loss of PTEN and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Byrns2010Aldoketo; Zhong2015Aldoketo).

Mutations in AKR1C3, such as c-71A > G and c-210A > C, are linked to 21-hydroxylase deficiency and external genital virilization in females due to increased fetal androgen biosynthesis (Penning2019AKR1C3). The intron variant rs1937845 is associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in Chinese women, potentially due to increased androgen production (Penning2019AKR1C3). In endometriosis, elevated AKR1C3 expression contributes to inflammation and prostaglandin synthesis, with synthetic progestins shown to reduce its expression (Penning2019AKR1C3). AKR1C3 is also involved in acute myeloid leukemia, where its inhibition has been explored as a therapeutic strategy (Penning2019AKR1C3; Penning2021AldoKeto).

## Interactions
AKR1C3 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) as a coactivator, enhancing AR-mediated signaling, which is crucial for prostate cancer progression. This interaction is ligand-dependent and involves the translocation of both AKR1C3 and AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon binding of AR ligands (Yepuru2013Steroidogenic). AKR1C3 is recruited to androgen-responsive elements (ARE) on gene promoters, facilitating AR transactivation by converting androstenedione to testosterone, a more potent AR ligand (Yepuru2013Steroidogenic). The interaction between AKR1C3 and AR is robust even in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), suggesting a magnified response due to coactivation (Yepuru2013Steroidogenic).

AKR1C3 also interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Siah2, enhancing its stability and promoting prostate cancer cell growth. This interaction does not require AKR1C3's enzymatic activity (Penning2019AKR1C3). Additionally, AKR1C3 is involved in chromatin remodeling, affecting the expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other coactivators, although it is unclear if its enzymatic activity is necessary for this role (Penning2019AKR1C3). AKR1C3's interaction with ZHX1, a corepressor that recruits HDACs, suggests a role in chromatin condensation and gene silencing, indicating a functional link between AKR1C3 and epigenetic regulation (Doig2016Knockdown).
