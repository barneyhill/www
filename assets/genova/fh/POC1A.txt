# POC1A

## Overview
POC1A is a gene that encodes the POC1 centriolar protein A, a crucial component involved in centriole biogenesis and stability. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, contributing to the formation of a beta-propeller structure. POC1A plays a significant role in cell division and ciliogenesis by localizing to centrioles and participating in their duplication and function. It is essential for maintaining centriole integrity and ensuring proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation, which are vital for cellular organization and tissue development (Keller2009Molecular). Mutations in the POC1A gene are linked to SOFT syndrome, a rare form of primordial dwarfism, and other metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2021Identification; Barraza‐García2015Two).

## Structure
POC1A is a protein characterized by the presence of seven WD40 repeats in its N-terminal half, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to the formation of a beta-propeller structure (Keller2009Molecular). The WD40 domain is crucial for the localization of POC1A to centrioles, although the conserved POC1 domain consensus sequence is not necessary for this localization, suggesting a role in protein interactions (Keller2009Molecular). The last 50 amino acids of POC1A form a coiled coil, as predicted by the COILS server, which may play a role in its structural stability or interactions (Keller2009Molecular).

A novel mutation in the POC1A gene, specifically a p.T120A homozygous missense mutation, has been identified in the WD40 domain. This mutation results in a threonine to alanine substitution, leading to a misfolded protein structure and affecting its function in centriole biogenesis (Koparir2015NovelPOC1Amutation). The mutation occurs in a highly conserved region, indicating its potential impact on the protein's structural integrity and interactions (Koparir2015NovelPOC1Amutation). The WD40 domain's role as a scaffold in multi-protein complexes highlights its importance in maintaining proper protein interactions (Koparir2015NovelPOC1Amutation).

## Function
POC1A (POC1 centriolar protein A) is a crucial component in centriole biogenesis and stability, playing a significant role in cell division and ciliogenesis. It is a conserved WD40 domain protein that localizes to centrioles, contributing to their duplication and function. POC1A is involved in the early steps of centriole duplication and later in centriole length control, ensuring proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation, which are vital for cellular organization and tissue development (Keller2009Molecular).

In human cells, POC1A localizes along the entire length of the centriole structure, indicating its role in maintaining centriole integrity and function. It is present in both mature mother centrioles and newly forming daughter centrioles, suggesting its involvement in early centriole assembly steps (Keller2009Molecular). The protein's WD40 domain is crucial for its localization to centrioles, while the POC1 domain may interact with other proteins, although its exact role in centriole localization is not fully understood (Keller2009Molecular).

POC1A's function is essential for the proper formation and function of centrioles, which are critical for cell division and the formation of cilia, impacting overall cellular and organismal health (Keller2009Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POC1A gene are associated with SOFT syndrome, a rare form of primordial dwarfism characterized by severe growth failure, facial dysmorphism, onychodysplasia, and hypotrichosis. This condition is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in POC1A, which disrupt normal centriole and cilia formation, leading to significant clinical manifestations (Li2021Identification; Barraza‐García2015Two). Patients with SOFT syndrome often exhibit severe insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, liver steatosis, and central fat distribution, indicating a complex metabolic phenotype (Perge2024Ciliopathy).

The POC1A gene mutations can also lead to variant POC1A-related (vPOC1A) syndrome, which includes symptoms such as severe dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans (Majore2021Clinical). Cellular studies have shown that the absence of POC1A protein expression impairs ciliogenesis and adipocyte differentiation, induces cellular senescence, and leads to resistance to insulin and IGF-1 (Perge2024Ciliopathy). These findings suggest that POC1A deficiency affects cellular processes related to cilia function, impacting insulin and IGF1 signaling pathways and contributing to the metabolic and growth-related disorders observed in these syndromes (Perge2024Ciliopathy; Chen2015Truncation).

## Interactions
POC1A interacts with several proteins that are crucial for centriole and spindle pole functions. A notable interaction is with p80-katanin, a centrosome-associated WD repeat protein involved in microtubule severing and regulation. The p.T120A mutation in POC1A affects this interaction, leading to changes in p80-katanin levels and suggesting a functional relationship between these proteins (Koparir2015NovelPOC1Amutation).

POC1A is also part of a complex network of interactions within the centriole structure. It is involved in centriole duplication and length control, interacting with other centriolar proteins such as POC1B. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and stability of centrioles, as POC1A localizes to both mature and newly forming centrioles, indicating its role in centriole assembly (Keller2009Molecular).

The WD40 domain of POC1A is crucial for its localization to centrioles and may facilitate interactions with other proteins involved in centriole and basal body stability. This domain is sufficient for targeting POC1A to centrioles, highlighting its importance in protein-protein interactions within the centriole complex (Keller2009Molecular).
