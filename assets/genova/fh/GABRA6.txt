# GABRA6

## Overview
The GABRA6 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit alpha6, a critical component of the GABA A receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission within the central nervous system. This receptor is part of the Cys-loop ion channel superfamily and is primarily expressed in the cerebellum, where it plays a significant role in modulating neuronal excitability by facilitating chloride ion influx, leading to neuronal hyperpolarization and reduced firing rates (Sjöstedt2020An). The alpha6 subunit is notable for its high potency for GABA, underscoring its importance in cerebellar GABAergic signaling (Sjöstedt2020An). Variations in the GABRA6 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy and stress-related psychopathologies, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Gonda2017A; Mohammadpour2023A).

## Structure
The GABRA6 gene encodes the alpha-6 subunit of the GABA A receptor, which is part of the Cys-loop ion channel superfamily. This receptor is a pentameric structure composed of five subunits, typically including two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit, forming a central pore (Mullins2010Fine). The primary structure of the GABRA6 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, including a conserved extracellular NH2-terminal domain, three transmembrane (TM) domains, a cytoplasmic loop, and a COOH-terminal sequence (Mullins2010Fine).

The secondary structure of the GABRA6 protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets. The transmembrane domains are primarily composed of alpha helices, with TM2 lining the pore and TM4 interacting with the lipid bilayer (Mullins2010Fine). The extracellular domain forms a beta-barrel structure, and the Cys-loop is a conserved feature within this family of receptors (Mullins2010Fine).

The tertiary structure of the GABRA6 protein is implied through 3D modeling and domain analysis, although specific details are not provided in the context (Mohammadpour2023A). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the alpha-6 subunit with other subunits to form a functional GABA A receptor (Mullins2010Fine). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are typical for proteins in this family.

## Function
The GABRA6 gene encodes the alpha6 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor is primarily expressed in the cerebellum, where it plays a crucial role in modulating neuronal excitability by allowing chloride ions to enter the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal firing (Sjöstedt2020An). The GABA-A receptor, including the alpha6 subunit, is involved in brain-level stress control by inhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis via GABA-A receptors in CRH neurons in the hypothalamus, thereby attenuating the stress response (Gonda2017A).

The GABRA6 subunit has the highest potency for GABA among its counterparts, indicating its significant role in GABAergic signaling within the cerebellum (Sjöstedt2020An). This subunit's expression is influenced by micro-RNAs, which regulate gene expression levels and are involved in brain development and stress response (Gonda2017A). The GABRA6 gene's involvement in inhibitory neurotransmission and stress response suggests its potential impact on mood regulation and mental health, with variations in this gene linked to stress-induced psychopathology, including depression and anxiety (Gonda2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GABRA6 gene, which encodes the alpha-6 subunit of the GABA A receptor, have been associated with several genetic epilepsy disorders. Notably, variations in this gene are linked to childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), autosomal dominant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and infantile spasms (ISs) (Mohammadpour2023A). Specific mutations, such as Arg46Trp, have been identified in association with CAE, leading to neuronal disinhibition and an increased predisposition to generalized seizures. This mutation is located in a region homologous to the γ2 subunit mutation (Arg82Gln), which is also associated with febrile seizures and CAE (Mohammadpour2023A).

The study identified three missense nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in the GABRA6 gene—W87S, W112R, and C310R—that have pathogenic effects on the protein's structure and function, potentially contributing to epilepsy or other neuropsychiatric disorders (Mohammadpour2023A). These SNPs were found to be disease-related and have damaging effects on protein structure, with the C310R variant increasing the aggregation tendency of the protein and decreasing its amyloid propensity (Mohammadpour2023A). These findings suggest that these genetic variations could serve as potential diagnostic markers and drug targets for related conditions (Mohammadpour2023A).

## Interactions
The GABRA6 gene encodes the α6 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is involved in forming pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission. This subunit participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, contributing to the complexity and diversity of GABA-A receptor subtypes.

The α6 subunit is known to co-assemble with other subunits such as α1, β1, β2, β3, γ2, and δ within the GABA-A receptor complex. These interactions suggest the existence of multiple receptor subtypes containing the α6 subunit, particularly in the cerebellum (Jechlinger1998Subunit). The α6 subunit can also interact with Neuroligin-2, a synaptic protein, indicating its role in synaptic localization and function (Chen2023Blue; Chen2024Proteome).

In some receptor complexes, the α6 subunit is associated with the γ2 subunit, forming distinct populations with specific pharmacological profiles, such as diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive receptors (Scholze2020Two). The α6 subunit's interactions with other proteins, such as gephyrin, are less prominent, as gephyrin was not detected in certain experimental setups, suggesting a weaker or distinct interaction (Chen2024Proteome). These interactions highlight the α6 subunit's role in modulating receptor composition and function.
