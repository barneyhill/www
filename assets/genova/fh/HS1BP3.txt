# HS1BP3

## Overview
HS1BP3 is a human gene that encodes the HCLS1 binding protein 3, a protein involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy and immune signaling. The protein is characterized by its phosphoinositide-binding PX domain, which plays a crucial role in lipid regulation and membrane dynamics. HS1BP3 functions as a negative regulator of autophagy by modulating phosphatidic acid levels, thereby influencing autophagosome formation and cellular homeostasis (Holland2016HS1BP3). Additionally, HS1BP3 interacts with the SH3 domain of HS1, a protein involved in T- and B-cell activation, highlighting its role in immune signaling (Takemoto1999Isolation). The gene has clinical significance, as mutations in HS1BP3 have been associated with familial essential tremor, a neurological disorder (Higgins2005A). Through its involvement in autophagy and immune processes, HS1BP3 is implicated in the regulation of cellular signaling and metabolic pathways.

## Structure
The HS1BP3 protein is encoded by a cDNA of 1393 base pairs, with an open reading frame of 1188 base pairs, resulting in a protein composed of 396 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 44 kDa (Takemoto1999Isolation). The protein structure includes several distinct domains and motifs. It features an N-terminal PX domain, which is known for its lipid-binding specificity, particularly to phosphatidic acid and certain phosphoinositides (Holland2016HS1BP3). This domain shows sequence homology with proteins such as yeast VPS5 and human SNX1 (Takemoto1999Isolation).

The protein also contains proline-rich regions that serve as potential SH3 binding domains, which are typical for proteins involved in signal transduction pathways (Takemoto1999Isolation). Additionally, HS1BP3 includes a leucine zipper, which may play a role in protein-protein interactions (Takemoto1999Isolation). The presence of ITIM-like sequences suggests a role in immunoreceptor signaling (Takemoto1999Isolation).

HS1BP3 is involved in cellular processes such as autophagy, where it acts as a negative regulator by modulating phosphatidic acid levels, affecting membrane trafficking and biogenesis (Holland2016HS1BP3). The protein's interaction with lipids and its localization to specific cellular membranes are crucial for its function (Holland2016HS1BP3).

## Function
The human gene HS1BP3 encodes a PX domain protein that functions as a negative regulator of autophagy, a cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. In healthy human cells, HS1BP3 modulates the levels of phosphatidic acid (PA), a lipid crucial for autophagosome formation. It binds to PA through its PX domain, localizing to autophagosome precursor membranes that are positive for ATG16L1 and ATG9 (Holland2016HS1BP3). HS1BP3 regulates autophagy by controlling the activity and localization of phospholipase D1 (PLD1), which is involved in PA synthesis. By inhibiting PLD1, HS1BP3 reduces PA levels, thereby suppressing autophagosome formation (Holland2016HS1BP3; Yin2017HS1BP3).

HS1BP3's role in autophagy is independent of its interaction with cortactin, a protein involved in actin dynamics, suggesting that its primary function is related to lipid regulation rather than cytoskeletal interactions (Yin2017HS1BP3). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly on recycling endosome-derived membranes, where it competes with PLD1 for binding to lipids, thus influencing membrane dynamics and autophagosome biogenesis (Holland2016HS1BP3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HS1BP3 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders, most notably familial essential tremor (ET). A specific missense mutation, 828C→G, in the HS1BP3 gene has been associated with ET, a common movement disorder characterized by tremors in the hands, head, or voice. This variant was found in approximately 10% of US families with ET but was absent in Singaporean cases, suggesting a potential mutation role in ET pathogenesis (Higgins2005A). The HS1BP3 gene is located within the ETM2 candidate interval on chromosome 2p, and its protein product may interact with the 14-3-3 family of proteins, which are involved in catecholamine and serotonin regulation, potentially contributing to tremor pathogenesis (Higgins2005A).

In addition to its role in ET, HS1BP3 is also involved in the regulation of autophagy, a cellular process crucial for maintaining cellular quality control. Alterations in HS1BP3 expression can lead to dysregulation of autophagy, which is linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. HS1BP3 acts as a negative regulator of autophagy by modulating phosphatidic acid levels, and its depletion results in increased autophagosome formation (Holland2016HS1BP3).

## Interactions
HS1BP3 is known to interact specifically with the SH3 domain of HS1, a protein involved in T- and B-cell activation. This interaction is facilitated by the proline-rich regions of HS1BP3, which are typical SH3 binding domains (Takemoto1999Isolation). The binding of HS1BP3 to HS1 is selective, as it does not significantly interact with other SH3 domains such as those of Lck, Grb2NTSH3, and Grb2CTSH3 (Takemoto1999Isolation). 

HS1BP3 also contains a PX domain, which is implicated in its role in T-cell activation. The PX domain is a phosphoinositide-binding motif that may help target HS1BP3 to the membrane for interaction with antigen receptors and/or tyrosine kinases in T- and B-cells (XU2001The). This domain is known to interact with phosphoinositides, which are crucial for membrane targeting and regulation of functional activities (XU2001The).

In addition to its role in immune signaling, HS1BP3 is involved in mitochondrial processes. It localizes to mitochondria and is associated with autophagy by inhibiting phospholipase D, with its overexpression leading to apoptosis (LudwigSłomczyńska2020Mitochondrial). These interactions suggest that HS1BP3 plays a significant role in cellular signaling and metabolic regulation.
