# TRIM73

## Overview
TRIM73 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 73, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family. This family is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are integral to its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (Langevin2019Fish; Han2011Identification). The TRIM73 protein is part of a clade that includes TRIM50 and TRIM74, and it is located on chromosome 7, having emerged after the divergence of great apes and Old World monkeys (Han2011Identification). Although the specific biological functions of TRIM73 are not fully characterized, its structural similarities to TRIM50 suggest a potential role in ubiquitination processes (Micale2008Williams–Beuren).

## Structure
TRIM73 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These domains are crucial for the protein's function, particularly in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (Langevin2019Fish; Han2011Identification). The RING domain is known for its role in ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, which is essential for post-translational modification of proteins (Langevin2019Fish). The B30.2 domain, often found in TRIM proteins, is involved in protein-protein interactions and RNA-binding, although specific details about its presence in TRIM73 are not provided (Han2011Identification).

TRIM73 is part of a clade that includes TRIM50 and TRIM74, which have undergone segmental duplications in primate genomes. This clade is located on chromosome 7, and TRIM73 emerged after the divergence of great apes and Old World monkeys (Han2011Identification). While the specific biological functions of TRIM73 remain uncharacterized, it is suggested to have structural similarities to TRIM50, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Micale2008Williams–Beuren). The protein's structure and function may be influenced by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, common in TRIM family proteins (Langevin2019Fish).
