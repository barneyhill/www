# C14orf132

## Overview
C14orf132 is a gene located on chromosome 14 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 14 open reading frame 132. This protein is currently not well-characterized in terms of its specific biological functions or classification into known protein families such as kinases or receptors. However, emerging research suggests that it may play a role in various physiological and pathological processes. The gene's expression levels have been linked to clinical conditions such as extremely low birth weight in newborns and have shown prognostic significance in lung adenocarcinoma, where its expression correlates with patient survival outcomes (Tiirats2016C14orf132; Wang2020A). Despite these associations, further studies are needed to elucidate the precise biological functions and mechanisms of action of the protein encoded by C14orf132.

## Clinical Significance
The C14orf132 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In the context of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) in newborns, a study identified significantly lower transcript levels of C14orf132 in affected children from a specific family, suggesting a potential link between the gene's expression and the ELBW phenotype. However, no pathogenic copy number variants were found in the C14orf132 region, indicating that the gene's role in ELBW may be related to its expression rather than structural genomic changes (Tiirats2016C14orf132).

In cancer research, C14orf132 has been associated with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) prognosis. Downregulation of C14orf132 was significantly correlated with reduced survival time in LUAD patients, while higher expression levels were linked to improved survival rates, suggesting that C14orf132 acts as a protective factor in this context (Wang2020A). The gene is also mentioned in relation to colorectal cancer prognosis, although specific details on its role are less clear (Wang2020A). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of C14orf132 in both developmental and oncological conditions, though its exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
