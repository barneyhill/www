# SERP1

## Overview
The SERP1 gene encodes the stress associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1, which plays a pivotal role in the cellular stress response, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis by stabilizing nascent proteins during their translocation into the ER lumen, thereby preventing their degradation under stress conditions (Fan2021Low). As a regulatory protein, SERP1 is involved in the modulation of the γ-secretase complex, influencing its activity and substrate specificity, which is significant under metabolic stress (Jung2020SERP1). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions are essential for proper protein folding, quality control, and cellular processes that involve protein processing and stress responses. Additionally, SERP1 has clinical significance, with its expression levels being implicated in various diseases, including cancers and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Fan2021Low; Ma2017SERP1; Jung2020SERP1).

## Function
SERP1 (stress associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1) is involved in the cellular stress response, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In healthy human cells, SERP1 plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis by stabilizing newly synthesized proteins during their translocation into the ER lumen, preventing their degradation under stress conditions (Fan2021Low). This function is essential for proper protein folding and quality control, helping to prevent protein aggregation and degradation, which are critical for normal cellular function and survival (Fan2021Low).

SERP1 is also associated with the regulation of the γ-secretase complex, an enzyme complex involved in the cleavage of various substrates, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch. SERP1 increases the formation of the γ-secretase complex by stabilizing the APH1A/NCT subcomplex, which enhances the complex's activity and influences its substrate specificity (Jung2020SERP1). This regulation is particularly significant under metabolic stress conditions, where SERP1 modulates the interaction of γ-secretase with its substrates, favoring the cleavage of APP over Notch (Jung2020SERP1). These activities suggest that SERP1 is integral to cellular processes that involve protein processing and stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SERP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), SERP1 is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. High SERP1 expression is associated with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as an independent prognostic marker. The gene's upregulation may contribute to its anti-apoptotic role, as downregulation of SERP1 in vitro promotes apoptosis in PDAC cells (Ma2017SERP1).

In skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), low expression of SERP1 is linked to poor prognosis and reduced survival rates. It is associated with immune infiltration and is considered an independent risk factor for poor outcomes. SERP1 expression correlates with various immune cell markers, indicating its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and potentially influencing immunotherapeutic responses (Fan2021Low).

In Alzheimer's disease, SERP1 is identified as an activator of γ-secretase, enhancing its activity under endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions, which leads to increased production of β-amyloid peptides. This suggests a potential link between SERP1 expression and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (Jung2020SERP1).

## Interactions
SERP1 interacts with the γ-secretase complex, particularly through the APH1A/NCT subcomplex. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and regulation of the γ-secretase complex, especially under metabolic stress conditions. The C-terminal region of SERP1 is important for its interaction with nicastrin (NCT), a component of the γ-secretase complex. The SERP1ΔC mutant, which lacks the C-terminal four residues, shows reduced interaction with NCT, indicating the significance of this region for binding (Jung2020SERP1).

SERP1 also affects the docking of γ-secretase with its substrates. It enhances the colocalization of SC100-GFP with APH1A-RFP, a component of the γ-secretase complex, while reducing the colocalization of NotchΔE-GFP with APH1A-RFP. This suggests that SERP1 may preferentially enhance the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) over Notch by γ-secretase (Jung2020SERP1).

Under endoplasmic reticulum stress, SERP1 expression is upregulated, which enhances γ-secretase activity and amyloid-beta (Aβ) production. This process is impaired in SERP1-knockdown cells, highlighting the role of SERP1 in mediating ER stress-dependent γ-secretase activation (Jung2020SERP1).
