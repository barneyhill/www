# IRX1

## Overview
IRX1, or iroquois homeobox 1, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the TALE class of homeodomain proteins. This protein is characterized by a conserved homeodomain that facilitates DNA binding, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression during developmental processes. The IRX1 protein is involved in various cellular differentiation pathways, particularly in tissues such as the brain, lung, kidney, and developing teeth, where it influences the differentiation of specific cell types (Yu2017Irx1). Additionally, IRX1 is part of a gene complex located on chromosome 5p15 in humans, which includes IRX2 and IRX4, and is subject to regulation by DNA methylation, impacting its expression in certain cancers (Nagel2023The). The gene's role as a tumor suppressor is highlighted by its frequent epigenetic inactivation in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, where its silencing is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis (Küster2020Epigenetic).

## Structure
The IRX1 protein is a member of the TALE class of homeodomain transcription factors, characterized by a conserved 180 bp homeobox that encodes a 60 amino acid homeodomain. This domain forms a helix-turn-helix structure, with helix 3 fitting into the major groove of DNA for sequence-specific interactions, while helices 1 and 2 stabilize the structure and facilitate additional DNA contacts (Nagel2023The). The IRX1 protein also contains a distinct 13 amino acid domain known as the Iro box, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Catela2024TheIroquois(IroIrx) page 0 of 6).

The primary structure of IRX1 includes a highly conserved homeodomain sequence, which shows significant similarity across species, including humans and mice (Bosse1997Identification). The secondary structure is likely to include alpha helices, typical of DNA-binding proteins, although specific details on the tertiary or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

IRX1 is part of a gene complex that includes IRX2 and IRX4, located on chromosome 5p15 in humans, and is involved in tissue-specific developmental processes (Nagel2023The). The gene's expression is regulated by DNA methylation, which can lead to its suppression in certain cancers (Nagel2023The).

## Function
IRX1 (iroquois homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various developmental processes and cellular differentiation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation during development. IRX1 is highly expressed in several tissues, including the brain, lung, kidney, and developing teeth, where it influences the differentiation of specific cell types (Yu2017Irx1).

In the hematopoietic system, IRX1 is specifically expressed in megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), where it contributes to the differentiation of megakaryocytes and erythrocytes. It activates key transcription factors such as KLF1 and TAL1, which are essential for erythroid development and act as suppressors of megakaryopoiesis (Nagel2022The).

IRX1 also plays a crucial role in lung development, particularly in alveolar type II cells, which are vital for surfactant production. The absence of IRX1 leads to respiratory issues due to impaired lung maturation and surfactant protein secretion (Yu2017Irx1).

In dental development, IRX1 is expressed in the outer enamel epithelium and is essential for the differentiation of dental epithelial cells, influencing the growth and morphogenesis of teeth (Yu2017Irx1).

## Clinical Significance
The IRX1 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In lung adenocarcinoma, a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), IRX1 is frequently epigenetically inactivated through promoter hypermethylation. This silencing is associated with advanced disease stages and poorer prognosis for patients. The hypermethylation of IRX1 is more pronounced in lung adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell carcinoma, another NSCLC subtype (Küster2020Epigenetic). The loss of IRX1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma correlates with reduced survival rates, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Küster2020Epigenetic).

IRX1's role extends to other cancers, such as gastric cancer and head and neck squamous carcinoma, where its hypermethylation and silencing have also been observed, indicating a broader role in cancer pathogenesis (Küster2020Epigenetic). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IRX1 shows aberrant expression, particularly in megakaryoblastic AML, suggesting a potential oncogenic role. This aberrant expression is linked to specific karyotypes and gene mutations, contributing to the complexity of AML pathogenesis (Nagel2022The). The regulatory network involving IRX1 and its interactions with other genes like GATA1 and GATA2 further underscores its significance in myeloid malignancies (Nagel2022The).

## Interactions
IRX1 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in cellular processes. In the context of cellulose synthesis, IRX1 interacts with other CesA proteins, specifically IRX3 and IRX5, forming a protein complex essential for this process. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that antibodies specific to IRX1 can coprecipitate IRX3 and IRX5, indicating their association within the same complex. The absence of IRX5 disrupts the interaction between IRX1 and IRX3, highlighting the importance of IRX5 in maintaining this complex (Taylor2003Interactions).

In osteosarcoma, IRX1 interacts with the CXCL14 gene and the NF-κB signaling pathway. IRX1 binds to specific DNA sequences in the CXCL14 promoter, directly activating its transcription. This interaction enhances the metastatic ability of osteosarcoma cells, with CXCL14 acting in an autocrine manner to promote metastasis. IRX1 overexpression also leads to increased degradation of IκBα, a key inhibitor of NF-κB, thereby activating the NF-κB pathway (Lu2015IRX1).

IRX1 also plays a role in neural patterning, where it interacts with other genes such as Arx and Fezf. Arx acts as a repressor of IRX1 expression, while IRX1 can repress Arx expression, suggesting a mutual antagonism in defining neural territories (RodríguezSeguel2009The).
