# CARD10

## Overview
CARD10 is a gene that encodes the protein caspase recruitment domain family member 10, also known as CARMA3, which is a crucial component in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a scaffold protein and is part of the CARD-CC family, which includes other members such as CARD9, CARD11, and CARD14. CARD10 plays a significant role in the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor, a key regulator of immune responses and inflammation. It achieves this by facilitating the assembly of the CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signaling complex, which transmits signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. The protein's function is modulated by interactions with protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, which phosphorylate CARD10, thereby influencing NF-κB signaling. CARD10 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, kidney, and liver, and is implicated in inflammatory pathways and diseases such as primary open-angle glaucoma and inflammatory bowel disease (YamamotoFurusho2018Caspase; Staal2020Defining; Israël2021CARD10).

## Structure
CARD10 is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in cellular signaling. It contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which facilitates protein-protein interactions, particularly with BCL10 and MALT1, forming a complex crucial for NF-κB pathway activation (Yang2020Mutant; Israël2021CARD10). The coiled-coil (CC) domain is essential for oligomerization and structural stability, and a novel homozygous missense mutation in this domain has been associated with altered hydrophobicity and stability, potentially impacting the protein's secondary structure (Yang2020Mutant).

CARD10 also features a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) domain, which is important for membrane localization and signaling functions (Israël2021CARD10). The protein is unique among the CARD-CC family due to its cleavage by the MALT1 protease at the R587 site, located in the linker region between the CC and MAGUK domains. This cleavage results in the release of an N-terminal fragment that resembles CARD9, which naturally lacks the MAGUK domain (Israël2021CARD10).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate CARD10's activity, influencing its role in signaling pathways (Israël2021CARD10). The protein's quaternary structure involves interactions within the CARD10-BCL10-MALT1 complex, which is critical for its function in immune response regulation (Yang2020Mutant).

## Function
CARD10, also known as caspase recruitment domain family member 10, is a protein that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor. This protein is part of the CARD-CC family, which includes CARD9, CARD11, and CARD14, and functions as a molecular scaffold. CARD10 facilitates the assembly of the CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signaling complex, which is essential for transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus, thereby activating NF-κB-dependent gene expression. This process is vital for immune responses and maintaining immune system balance (Yang2020Mutant; Staal2020Defining).

CARD10 is activated by protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation and interacts with various PKC isozymes, including atypical PKCs like PKCζ and PKCι. These interactions are important for modulating NF-κB signaling in response to external stimuli, which is crucial for immune cell activation and other cellular processes (Staal2020Defining). CARD10 is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the heart, kidney, and liver, and is involved in inflammatory pathways, such as those activated by platelet-activating factor in intestinal epithelial cells (YamamotoFurusho2018Caspase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CARD10 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Rare variants in CARD10 are enriched in individuals with POAG, suggesting a significant genetic contribution to the disease. These variants are associated with changes in optic disc morphology and may disrupt gene function, increasing the risk of glaucoma. The presence of CARD10 mutations is more common in individuals with high-tension glaucoma compared to those with normal-tension glaucoma, indicating a potential link between CARD10 and intraocular pressure (Zhou2016Rare).

CARD10 is also involved in inflammatory processes, as evidenced by its increased expression in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in ulcerative colitis. The gene functions as a molecular scaffold in the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for immune responses. Altered CARD10 expression in IBD suggests its role in the pathophysiology of the disease, although specific clinical characteristics associated with CARD10 expression levels have not been clearly defined (YamamotoFurusho2018Caspase).

Overall, CARD10's involvement in NF-κB signaling and its genetic variations contribute to its clinical significance in diseases like POAG and IBD.

## Interactions
CARD10, also known as CARMA3, is a scaffold protein involved in various protein interactions crucial for NF-κB activation and immune signaling. It interacts with NOD2, a Nod-like receptor, through its CARD domain, forming a complex with NOD2's CARD1-CARD2 domains. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells, suggesting a role in recognizing bacterial components and activating NF-κB (Zhou2021A).

CARD10 is also part of the CARD-CC/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) signaling complex, which is activated by phosphorylation through protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes. This activation leads to the recruitment of downstream proteins like TRAF6, facilitating NF-κB-dependent gene expression. CARD10 forms heterocomplexes with other CARD-CC family members, such as CARD14 and CARD11, but not with CARD9, influencing NF-κB signaling pathways (Staal2020Defining).

The interactions of CARD10 with deubiquitinating enzymes like A20 and CYLD further modulate its role in signaling pathways related to cell death and inflammation. These interactions are significant in understanding the mechanisms underlying immunodeficiency and inflammatory diseases (Zhou2021A).
