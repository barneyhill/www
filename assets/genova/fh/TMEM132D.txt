# TMEM132D

## Overview
TMEM132D is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 132D, a member of the TMEM132 protein family, which is characterized by its role in cellular adhesion and signaling. The protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, particularly within the cortical regions of the human brain (Naik2018Polymorphism). It features a domain architecture that includes three tandem immunoglobulin domains and a cohesin domain, which facilitate its function in connecting the extracellular matrix with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton (Wang2020TheC.; Wang2021The). TMEM132D is involved in regulating neuronal morphogenesis and cell motility through its interaction with the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), impacting actin nucleation and cellular dynamics (Wang2021The). The gene has been implicated in psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety-related conditions, with certain genetic variants associated with increased risk for these disorders (Erhardt2010TMEM132D).

## Structure
TMEM132D is a member of the TMEM132 protein family, characterized by its involvement in cellular adhesion and signaling. The protein contains three tandem immunoglobulin domains and a cohesin domain, which are implicated in its cellular adhesion function by connecting the extracellular matrix with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton (Wang2020TheC.; Wang2021The). The C-terminal region of TMEM132D is crucial for its function, as it binds to and sequesters components of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), such as NAP1, leading to disintegration and decreased activity of WRC components like ABI1 and WAVE2 (Wang2020TheC.; Wang2021The). This interaction is essential for regulating actin nucleation and maintaining cellular and neuronal morphological plasticity (Wang2021The).

TMEM132D is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately 130 kDa (Naik2018Polymorphism). It is expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, particularly in the cortical regions of the human brain (Naik2018Polymorphism). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a role in modulating neuronal morphogenesis and actin cytoskeletal dynamics, which are critical for its function in the nervous system (Wang2020TheC.; Wang2021The).

## Function
TMEM132D is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the brain. The protein is part of the TMEM132 family, which includes cell adhesion molecules with a domain architecture featuring three tandem immunoglobulin domains and a cohesin domain homologue. These proteins are expressed in the brain and play a role in connecting the extracellular matrix with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell adhesion and signaling (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:).

TMEM132D is involved in regulating neuronal morphogenesis and cell motility by interacting with the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). It binds to and sequesters NAP1, a component of the WRC, leading to decreased activity of WRC components such as ABI1 and WAVE2, and reduced actin nucleation. This regulation is crucial for maintaining restricted cell motility and neuronal morphology, particularly in areas associated with long-range connectivity and complex morphology, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (Wang2020TheC.; Wang2021The).

In healthy human cells, TMEM132D's expression is linked to anxiety-related behaviors and structural changes in key brain regions like the amygdala and hippocampus. Non-coding variants of TMEM132D are associated with higher anxiety scores and larger brain region volumes, suggesting a role in neural adhesion and signaling that may influence anxiety and stress responses (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:).

## Clinical Significance
The TMEM132D gene is implicated in several psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety-related conditions such as panic disorder (PD) and major depressive disorder. Genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TMEM132D that are associated with increased risk for these disorders. For instance, the SNP rs7309727 in TMEM132D has been linked to PD, with the T allele identified as a risk allele, showing significant associations in multiple study stages (Erhardt2010TMEM132D). Another SNP, rs11060369, also shows a trend for association with anxiety disorders (Erhardt2010TMEM132D).

Alterations in TMEM132D expression levels have been observed in anxiety phenotypes. Higher expression of TMEM132D mRNA in the frontal cortex is associated with risk genotypes for PD, suggesting a functional role in anxiety pathophysiology (Erhardt2010TMEM132D). In animal models, increased TMEM132D expression in the anterior cingulate cortex correlates with heightened anxiety-related behavior (Naik2018Polymorphism).

TMEM132D also interacts with the WAVE regulatory complex, affecting neuronal morphogenesis and cell motility. Disruptions in this interaction can lead to abnormal neuronal structures, potentially contributing to psychiatric disorders (Wang2021The). These findings highlight TMEM132D's role in the pathophysiology of anxiety and related disorders.

## Interactions
TMEM132D, a transmembrane protein, is involved in several interactions with components of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeletal dynamics. TMEM132D interacts with NAP1, a component of the WRC, through its C-terminal domain. This interaction has been confirmed in both human and C. elegans systems, indicating evolutionary conservation (Wang2020TheC.; Wang2021The). TMEM132D sequesters NAP1 and SRA1, leading to the disintegration of the WRC and decreased activity, which in turn reduces actin nucleation and cell motility (Wang2020TheC.; Wang2021The).

In C. elegans, the homolog TMEM-132 interacts with GEX-3, the ortholog of NAP1, and this interaction is crucial for regulating neuronal morphology (Wang2020TheC.; Wang2021The). Mutations in TMEM132D that disrupt its interaction with NAP1 lead to morphological defects, highlighting the importance of this interaction in maintaining proper neuronal structure (Wang2020TheC.). These interactions suggest that TMEM132D plays a role in modulating the activity of the WRC, impacting cytoskeletal and morphological changes in cells.
