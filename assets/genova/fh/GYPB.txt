# GYPB

## Overview
The GYPB gene encodes glycophorin B, a transmembrane sialoglycoprotein that is a critical component of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane and plays a significant role in the MNS blood group system. Glycophorin B is characterized by its extracellular, membrane-spanning, and cytoplasmic domains, contributing to the structural integrity and functionality of RBCs. It is involved in maintaining the negative charge of the RBC membrane, which is essential for preventing cell aggregation and facilitating smooth blood flow. Additionally, glycophorin B serves as a receptor for pathogens, such as Plasmodium falciparum, implicating it in infectious disease susceptibility. Variations in the GYPB gene, including deletions and hybrid gene formations, are clinically significant due to their association with blood group phenotypes and potential implications in transfusion medicine and disease susceptibility (Gassner2020Two; Palacajornsuk2006Review:; Hollox2022Genetic).

## Structure
Glycophorin B (GYPB) is a sialoglycoprotein located on the red blood cell membrane, consisting of 72 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE (Palacajornsuk2006Review:). The protein is organized into three distinct domains: an extracellular N-terminal domain of 44 amino acids, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain of 20 amino acids, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 8 amino acids (Palacajornsuk2006Review:). The extracellular domain is rich in sialic acid, contributing to the protein's negative charge and its role in the MNS blood group system.

GYPB shares structural similarities with Glycophorin A (GPA) but is present in fewer copies on the red blood cell membrane, with an estimated 2 × 10^5 copies (Palacajornsuk2006Review:). It is resistant to trypsin cleavage but sensitive to α-chymotrypsin at amino acid residue 32, a feature utilized in laboratory testing for identifying antibodies in the MNS blood group system (Palacajornsuk2006Review:). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of GYPB are not provided, the primary structure includes a defined sequence of amino acids, and the secondary structure likely involves local folding patterns such as alpha-helices (Palacajornsuk2006Review:).

## Function
The GYPB gene encodes glycophorin B (GPB), a sialoglycoprotein located on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). GPB is involved in the MNS blood group system, carrying the S and s antigens, and contributes to the carbohydrate content on the RBC membrane (Santos2019“Molecular; Palacajornsuk2006Review:). The protein is organized into three domains: an extracellular N-terminal domain, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Palacajornsuk2006Review:).

Glycophorin B, along with glycophorin A, plays a role in maintaining the net negative charge of the RBC membrane. This negative charge is crucial for preventing RBCs from adhering to each other and to the endothelial cells of blood vessels, thus facilitating smooth circulation (Palacajornsuk2006Review:; Hollox2022Genetic). The negative charge also provides a protective barrier against bacterial and pathogen invasion (Palacajornsuk2006Review:).

Despite its presence, individuals lacking glycophorin B (S-s-U-) are generally healthy, indicating that its precise function in healthy human cells remains somewhat unclear (Hollox2022Genetic). However, GPB's interaction with pathogens, such as the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, suggests a role in infectious disease susceptibility (Hollox2022Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deletions in the GYPB gene are clinically significant due to their association with the MNS blood group system, particularly the S-s-U- phenotype. This phenotype results from the absence of glycophorin B (GPB) on red blood cells, which can lead to severe hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn in individuals with antibodies against S, s, or U antigens (Gassner2020Two). Two prevalent deletions, 110-kb and 103-kb, have been identified in the GYPB gene among Black Africans, contributing to the S-s-U- phenotype. These deletions are more frequent in certain African populations, such as the Biaka and Mbuti pygmy people, and are significant for blood transfusion compatibility (Gassner2020Two).

The GYPB gene is also involved in the formation of hybrid glycophorin genes through crossover or conversion events with GYPA, leading to variant phenotypes that express low prevalence antigens. These variants can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, particularly in East and Southeast Asian populations (Hassan2019Molecular). Additionally, structural variations in the GYPB gene, such as the DUP4 variant, have been associated with altered susceptibility to malaria, although the protective effects are not definitively proven (Louzada2020Structural; Hollox2022Genetic).

## Interactions
Glycophorin B (GYPB) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of erythrocyte function and pathogen invasion. GYPB is part of the AE1-associated protein complexes on the erythrocyte membrane, although it does not directly interact with AE1, as demonstrated by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM-FRET) (Hsu2022A). Instead, GYPB is hypothesized to interact indirectly with AE1 through glycophorin A (GPA) (Hsu2022A). 

GYPB also plays a role in the invasion of red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum, the malaria parasite. It serves as a receptor for the parasite's erythrocyte-binding ligand-1 (EBL-1), facilitating the parasite's entry into the cells. This interaction is crucial for the parasite's invasion process, with the binding site for EBL-1 located within a specific segment of the F2 domain of the ligand (Jaskiewicz2019Erythrocyte). The presence of the S allele, which encodes the S antigen in GYPB, is associated with infection rates, highlighting its role as a key receptor in certain regions (Jaskiewicz2019Erythrocyte).
