# FAM187A

## Overview
FAM187A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 187 member A. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM187A is implicated in various cellular processes, potentially including signal transduction and cellular communication, given its structural features. The protein encoded by FAM187A is not currently categorized under well-known protein classes such as kinases or receptors, indicating that it may have a unique or specialized role within the cell. Further research is necessary to determine its precise functions and interactions within biological systems.
