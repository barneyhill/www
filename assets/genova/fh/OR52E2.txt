# OR52E2

## Overview
The OR52E2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily E member 2, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules and the initiation of olfactory signal transduction. Olfactory receptors, including OR52E2, are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The OR52E2 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity of odorant recognition and the perception of smell. The study of OR52E2 and its encoded protein is significant for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying olfaction and its potential implications in sensory disorders.
