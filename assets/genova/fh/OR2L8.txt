# OR2L8

## Overview
The OR2L8 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily L member 8, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Kim2013Aqueous). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR2L8 is implicated in various physiological processes, including intestinal physiology and metabolic regulation, where it may influence energy sourcing and immune signaling (Meijerink2021The). The gene's expression and mutations have been associated with several clinical conditions, such as non-small cell lung cancer, autism spectrum disorder, and esophageal squamous cell cancer, indicating its potential significance in human health and disease (Gong2021Neoantigen; Li2022Integrated; Talli2022Novel).

## Function
The OR2L8 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Kim2013Aqueous). In addition to its role in olfaction, OR2L8 has been implicated in various physiological processes beyond the nasal cavity. For instance, it is involved in intestinal physiology, where it may detect fatty acids from microbial or dietary origins, contributing to energy sourcing and immune signaling (Meijerink2021The). 

The expression of OR2L8 can be influenced by environmental factors such as diet and weight changes, as evidenced by its downregulation in the duodenum following weight loss in morbidly obese individuals (Meijerink2021The). Furthermore, OR2L8 has been associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in enteroendocrine cells, indicating its potential role in metabolic regulation (Kim2013Aqueous). These findings suggest that OR2L8 may have broader implications in human health, particularly in metabolism and immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OR2L8 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly adenocarcinoma (ADC), mutations in OR2L8 are linked to better disease-free survival (DFS), suggesting a potential protective role in this cancer subtype (Gong2021Neoantigen). In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), high mutation rates of OR2L8 are observed in patients with elevated PDL1 expression, indicating a possible involvement in immune regulation pathways and the effectiveness of immunotherapy (Hu2020Analyses).

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), OR2L8 is identified as one of the informative genes associated with mild autism, being common across all mild sub-phenotypes such as IQ, memory, attention, and verbal ability (Talli2022Novel). This suggests a potential role in the genetic background of ASD, although further research is needed to confirm its diagnostic significance.

In esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC), OR2L8 is noted as a mutational hotspot, although its specific role in disease progression or prognosis is not detailed (Li2022Integrated). These findings highlight the diverse implications of OR2L8 mutations across different diseases.
