# CDY2B

## Overview
CDY2B (chromodomain Y-linked 2B) is a gene located on the Y chromosome that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling, a process essential for regulating gene expression. The CDY2B protein, characterized by its chromodomain, is implicated in binding to methylated histones, thereby influencing transcriptional activity. It plays a critical role in spermatogenesis, the development of sperm cells, and is essential for normal male fertility. The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it participates in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, particularly within the male germline (NavarroCosta2012Sex; Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics). CDY2B is part of the crotonase-like superfamily, exhibiting a crotonase-like fold, and is structurally distinct from known histone acetyltransferases (Wu2009Crystal). Its location in the AZFb region of the Y chromosome, a critical area for spermatogenesis, underscores its importance in male reproductive health, with alterations in the gene linked to conditions such as nonobstructive azoospermia (Stahl2012Deletion).

## Structure
The CDY2B protein exhibits a crotonase-like fold, which is a common structural motif within its family. Its crystal structure has been refined to a resolution of 2.20 Å, revealing a dimer of trimers arrangement. Each trimer shows significant structural similarity to those of CDY1 and CDYL, with monomers being virtually superimposable, having a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.355 Å compared to CDY1 (Wu2009Crystal).

The primary structure of CDY2B includes a chromo domain and a catalytic domain, typical of the CDY protein family. The secondary structure features an α/β fold, with the N-terminal portion containing a core of 4 β-β-α structure elements, flanked by two β-strands (β1 and β11). The strands form two β-sheets oriented almost perpendicularly to each other. The C-terminal structure is mainly helical, consisting of helices α8-α11, which wrap around the core β-sheet pair (Wu2009Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, the trimeric association of CDY2B monomers results from extensive interfaces between subunits, with about 16-17% of each monomer's surface buried through trimerization. CDY2B does not show structural similarity to known histone acetyltransferases but resembles the crotonase-like superfamily (Wu2009Crystal).

## Function
CDY2B (chromodomain Y-linked 2B) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling, a crucial process for regulating gene expression. The protein contains a chromodomain, which suggests its role in binding to methylated histones, thereby influencing transcriptional activity (Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics). CDY2B is primarily active in the nucleus, where it participates in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, particularly in the male germline (NavarroCosta2012Sex).

The CDY2B protein is implicated in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development, and is essential for normal male fertility. It is involved in cell cycle regulation, the notch signaling pathway, and mRNA transcription and processing, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics). The gene is located in the AZFb region of the Y chromosome, an area critical for spermatogenesis, and its underexpression is associated with maturation arrest in men with nonobstructive azoospermia (Stahl2012Deletion).

In healthy human cells, CDY2B's function in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation is vital for the proper development and maturation of sperm cells, underscoring its importance in male reproductive health (NavarroCosta2012Sex).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CDY2B gene are associated with male infertility, particularly affecting spermatogenesis. Deletions or underexpression of CDY2B, located in the AZFb region of the Y chromosome, are linked to testicular maturation arrest, a condition where the development of sperm cells is halted (Halder2017Genomics; Omolaoye2022Omics). This gene is part of the CDY family, which plays a role in chromatin organization and gene regulation, and its disruption can lead to spermatogenic failure (NavarroCosta2012Sex).

The AZFb region, where CDY2B is located, is crucial for spermatogenesis, and its deletion is associated with severe oligozoospermia and non-obstructive azoospermia, conditions characterized by low sperm count and absence of sperm in the ejaculate, respectively (Omolaoye2022Omics). The genetic complexity of male infertility is further emphasized by studies identifying chromosomal aberrations and monogenic variants in patients with these conditions (Omolaoye2022Omics).

While the specific role of CDY2B in disease is not fully detailed, its involvement in the broader context of Y chromosome microdeletions and their impact on male reproductive health is significant (Kothandaraman2016Pathogenic).

## Interactions
The CDY2B gene, located on the human Y chromosome, encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. CDY2B is known to interact with other Y chromosome-encoded proteins, such as SRY, ZFY, and DAZ1, as revealed by STRING database analysis. These interactions are crucial for biological processes like spermatogenesis and male sex determination (Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics). CDY2B is also implicated in histone hyperacetylation, which can lead to chromatin decondensation and affect DNA condensation during meiosis, suggesting potential interactions with chromatin or histone proteins (Adriano2024Cytogenetics; Adriano2023Cytogenomic).

While specific physical interactions of CDY2B with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is suggested that CDY2B may participate in co-occurrence, co-expression, co-function, and co-regulation mechanisms, facilitating its interactions with other proteins (Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics). The gene is also noted for its potential role in cell cycle regulation, the notch signaling pathway, and mRNA transcription and processing, indicating possible interactions with proteins involved in these pathways (Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics). However, the exact nature of these interactions remains to be fully elucidated.
