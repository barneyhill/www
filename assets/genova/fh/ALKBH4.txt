# ALKBH4

## Overview
ALKBH4 is a gene that encodes the protein alkB homolog 4, lysine demethylase, which is a member of the ALKBH family of proteins. This protein functions as a lysine demethylase, specifically targeting monomethylated lysine residues on actin, and plays a crucial role in regulating actomyosin dynamics, which are essential for cellular processes such as cytokinesis and cell migration (Li2013ALKBH4dependent). The ALKBH4 protein is characterized by its dioxygenase activity, facilitated by a catalytic domain with Fe2+-binding and α-ketoglutarate-binding sites, and a unique structural configuration that includes a cysteine-rich motif and specific loop structures that contribute to its substrate specificity (Xu2020Multisubstrate; Bjørnstad2011Spectroscopic). ALKBH4's involvement in protein interactions and chromatin dynamics underscores its significance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, such as cancer, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the context (Shen2020ALKBH4; Jingushi2021ALKBH4).

## Structure
The ALKBH4 protein is a member of the ALKBH family, characterized by a catalytic domain with Fe2+-binding and α-ketoglutarate-binding sites essential for its dioxygenase activity (Xu2020Multisubstrate). The catalytic domain features a conserved double-stranded β-helix domain, known as a 'jellyroll' fold, which forms the metal and cofactor-binding pocket (Xu2020Multisubstrate). Unlike other ALKBH family members, ALKBH4 lacks the L1 and L2 loops, which form a 'nucleotide recognition lid' in other proteins. Instead, it has L3 and L4 loops that create an open cleft for substrate binding, contributing to its unique substrate specificity (Xu2020Multisubstrate).

ALKBH4 contains a unique cysteine-rich motif near its N-terminus, conserved across various species, which may serve as a complementary Fe-S binding site (Bjørnstad2011Spectroscopic). The protein's active site includes residues His169, Asp171, and His254, which coordinate the Fe center (Bjørnstad2011Spectroscopic). The absence of detailed structural data, such as resolved crystal structures, limits the understanding of its complete molecular structure, including primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures (Xu2020Multisubstrate). However, the structural adaptations, such as the absence of key loops, are significant for its function as a lysine demethylase, specifically targeting actin Lys-84 (Xu2020Multisubstrate).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ALKBH4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, demonstrating its clinical significance. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ALKBH4 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its low expression is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. ALKBH4 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis by interacting with WDR5, a methyltransferase, to decrease histone H3K4me3 modification, which is linked to transcription initiation. This suggests that ALKBH4 suppresses cancer progression by modulating epigenetic changes (Shen2020ALKBH4).

Conversely, in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ALKBH4 is highly expressed and functions as a tumor promoter. Its knockdown leads to reduced cell proliferation and downregulation of E2F1, a key regulator of the cell cycle. High ALKBH4 expression correlates with poor prognosis, indicating its role in promoting tumorigenesis (Jingushi2021ALKBH4).

In gastric cancer, ALKBH4 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It negatively regulates GSDME, a key target in the pyroptosis pathway, by inhibiting its transcriptional activation through demethylation of histone modifications, thereby affecting cancer progression (Jiang2024ALKBH4). These findings highlight the dual role of ALKBH4 in cancer, acting as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
ALKBH4 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its biological functions. It interacts with actin, specifically demethylating monomethylated lysine-84 on actin, which is essential for actomyosin dynamics. This interaction facilitates the binding of non-muscle myosin II (NM II) to F-actin, playing a significant role in cytokinesis and cell migration (Li2013ALKBH4dependent). The interaction between ALKBH4 and NM II is mediated by actin, as demonstrated by the prevention of co-precipitation of NM II with ALKBH4 in the presence of magnesium and ATP (Li2013ALKBH4dependent).

In the context of colorectal cancer, ALKBH4 interacts with WDR5, a component of the histone methyltransferase complex. This interaction is competitive and leads to decreased H3K4me3 histone modification, thereby suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in colorectal cancer cells (Shen2020ALKBH4). Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the physical interaction between ALKBH4 and WDR5 in HCT116 cells (Shen2020ALKBH4). These interactions highlight ALKBH4's role in modulating protein-protein interactions and chromatin dynamics, which are crucial for its function in cellular processes and cancer suppression.
