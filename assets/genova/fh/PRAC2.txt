# PRAC2

## Overview
PRAC2 is a gene located on chromosome 17q21.3, encoding the PRAC2 small nuclear protein. This protein is primarily expressed in the prostate, rectum, and colon, with lesser expression in the testis and placenta, indicating a potential tissue-specific role. The PRAC2 protein, with a molecular mass of 10.5 kDa, is predominantly localized in the nucleus, suggesting its involvement in nuclear processes such as chromatin organization and gene expression regulation. The gene's proximity to Hoxb-13, a gene implicated in tissue differentiation, hints at a possible role in prostate growth and development. While the precise biological functions of PRAC2 remain to be fully elucidated, its expression pattern and nuclear localization underscore its potential significance in maintaining normal cellular function and tissue homeostasis (Olsson2003PRAC2:).

## Structure


## Function
PRAC2 is a small nuclear protein primarily expressed in the prostate, rectum, and colon, with weaker expression in other tissues such as the testis and placenta (Olsson2003PRAC2:). The protein is encoded by a 564 nucleotide RNA and has a molecular mass of 10.5 kDa (Olsson2003PRAC2:). Cellular fractionation experiments and immunofluorescence studies indicate that PRAC2 is predominantly located in the nucleus, suggesting a role in nuclear processes (Olsson2003PRAC2:).

The gene is situated between the Hoxb-13 and PRAC genes on chromosome 17q21.3, which implies a potential involvement in prostate growth and development due to its proximity to Hoxb-13, a gene known for its role in tissue differentiation (Olsson2003PRAC2:). Although the exact function of PRAC2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its nuclear localization and expression pattern suggest it may be involved in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation, contributing to normal cellular function and tissue homeostasis (Olsson2003PRAC2:). The presence of PRAC2 in specific tissues indicates a tissue-specific role, possibly related to cellular functions in these organs (Olsson2003PRAC2:).
