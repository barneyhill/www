# ATOSA

## Overview
The ATOSA gene encodes the protein atos homolog A, which is a member of the kinase family. Kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy donor molecules, such as ATP, to specific substrates, a process that is critical in regulating various cellular activities. The atos homolog A protein is involved in several signaling pathways and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Its function and interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and dysregulation of this gene has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer (Qiu2020aarFDC).
