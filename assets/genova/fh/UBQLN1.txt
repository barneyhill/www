# UBQLN1

## Overview
UBQLN1 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquilin 1, which is a multi-domain protein involved in the regulation of protein quality control within cells. Ubiquilin 1 is categorized as a chaperone-like protein due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), where it facilitates the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins by shuttling them to the proteasome. The protein is characterized by its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, and STI chaperone-like regions, which enable it to interact with various cellular proteins and complexes. Ubiquilin 1 is implicated in several cellular processes, including mitochondrial function and telomere maintenance, and is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Zhao2024UBQLN1; Bertram2005FamilyBased; Kurlawala2024UBQLN1).

## Structure
UBQLN1 (ubiquilin 1) is a multi-domain protein that plays a significant role in protein quality control. It is approximately 63 kDa and consists of three main domains: an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, and STI chaperone-like regions in the middle (Kurlawala2024UBQLN1). The UBL domain is involved in shuttling substrates to the proteasome and interacts with the proteasomal cap, while the UBA domain binds to polyubiquitin chains, facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated substrates (Seok2004Ubiquilin; Kurlawala2024UBQLN1). The STI domains mediate hydrophobic interactions and act as co-chaperones, playing a role in the primary association with transmembrane proteins (Kurlawala2024UBQLN1).

UBQLN1 is highly disordered, with a mean percentage of predicted intrinsic disorder (PPID) of 87.10%, and contains multiple short and long disorder-based binding regions (Gadhave2020Unstructured). It has eight phosphorylation sites and four ubiquitylation sites, all located in the intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR) (Gadhave2020Unstructured). The protein can form dimers via its STI-4 domain, which is active in its dimerized state (Kurlawala2024UBQLN1).

## Function
UBQLN1, a multi-domain protein, plays a crucial role in maintaining protein quality control and degradation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), where it facilitates the delivery of ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation. This process is essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis and preventing the accumulation of misfolded or damaged proteins (Lin2021UBQLN; Kurlawala2024UBQLN1). UBQLN1 contains three functional domains: a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA), and STI chaperone-like regions. These domains enable UBQLN1 to bind poly-ubiquitin chains and shuttle substrates to the proteasome (Kurlawala2024UBQLN1).

UBQLN1 is also involved in mitochondrial function and telomere maintenance. It helps maintain mitochondrial integrity by preventing the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins that can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. UBQLN1 deficiency results in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and telomere shortening, indicating its role in protecting telomeres from oxidative damage (Zhao2024UBQLN1). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is associated with various cellular compartments, excluding the nucleus and vacuolar compartments (Kurlawala2024UBQLN1).

## Clinical Significance
UBQLN1 (ubiquilin 1) is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, primarily Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In Alzheimer's disease, genetic variants in UBQLN1, such as the UBQ-8i polymorphism, have been associated with increased disease risk. This polymorphism affects the interaction of UBQLN1 with presenilin proteins, leading to amyloid aggregation, a hallmark of AD pathology (Bertram2005FamilyBased; Kurlawala2024UBQLN1). Alterations in UBQLN1 expression can also influence amyloid-beta levels, with overexpression reducing these levels, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for AD (Zhang2022Association).

In ALS, UBQLN1 is involved in protein homeostasis pathways, and its dysregulation can contribute to disease progression. The interaction between UBQLN1 and long non-coding RNA lnc-ABCA12-3 affects protein homeostasis pathways, influencing ALS pathogenesis (Yu2024Downregulation). Overexpression of UBQLN1 has been shown to reduce neuropathology in mouse models of ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), indicating its neuroprotective role and potential as a therapeutic strategy (Wang2020Overexpression). These findings underscore the clinical significance of UBQLN1 in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its role in maintaining protein homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
UBQLN1, also known as ubiquilin 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the proteins Ubqln4 and LC3, where Ubqln4 acts as an adaptor protein recruiting UBQLN1 to the autophagy machinery, specifically to autophagosomes. This interaction is mediated by the UBA domain of UBQLN1 and the UBL domain of Ubqln4, facilitating UBQLN1's role in autophagy (Yun2013Ubiquilin4).

UBQLN1 also interacts with the Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R), where its STI1 and STI2 domains are crucial for this interaction. It binds to both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of IGF1R, playing a role in the receptor's stabilization and activity regulation (Kurlawala2024UBQLN1).

In the context of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, UBQLN1's UBA domain binds ubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains, showing a lack of selectivity between different polyubiquitin linkages (Zhang2008Affinity). It also forms a complex with erasin and p97/VCP, which is involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD), highlighting its role in protein homeostasis and degradation of misfolded proteins (Lim2009Ubiquilin).
