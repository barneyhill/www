# C2CD5

## Overview
C2CD5 is a gene that encodes the protein C2 calcium-dependent domain containing 5, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in the context of mitochondrial dynamics and energy homeostasis. The protein is categorized as a calcium-dependent domain-containing protein and is primarily involved in mitochondrial trafficking and function within hypothalamic neurons. It plays a significant role in the retrograde transport of mitochondria and lysosomes, contributing to the formation of mitochondria-autophagosome-lysosome complexes necessary for mitophagy (Gavini2021Loss). Additionally, C2CD5 is crucial for the trafficking of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the hypothalamus, influencing energy balance by regulating food intake and energy expenditure (Gavini2019Hypothalamic). Beyond its neurological functions, C2CD5 is also implicated in GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes, affecting insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis (Gavini2019Hypothalamic). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and fibroblast growth factor binding protein (FIBP), underscore its multifaceted role in cellular growth, migration, and membrane trafficking (Xu2014Proteomic).

## Function
The C2CD5 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial trafficking, structure, and function within hypothalamic neurons. It is involved in maintaining mitochondrial dynamics, which are essential for energy homeostasis and cellular signaling. The protein is associated with mitochondrial membranes and is implicated in intracellular organelle trafficking, particularly in the retrograde transport of mitochondria and lysosomes by interacting with dynein complexes. This interaction is vital for the formation of mitochondria-autophagosome-lysosome complexes, which are crucial for the degradation of nonfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy (Gavini2021Loss).

C2CD5 is also involved in the trafficking of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the hypothalamus, which is important for regulating energy balance, including food intake and energy expenditure. The protein affects the internalization and recycling of MC4R, which is essential for its signaling function. Disruption of C2CD5 function can lead to increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure, contributing to obesity (Gavini2019Hypothalamic).

In addition to its role in the hypothalamus, C2CD5 has been associated with GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes, influencing insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis (Gavini2019Hypothalamic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the C2CD5 gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders, particularly obesity and type 2 diabetes. C2CD5 is involved in the trafficking of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the hypothalamus, which is crucial for regulating energy balance and food intake. Disruption of MC4R activity due to C2CD5 dysfunction can lead to obesity, characterized by increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure (Gavini2019Hypothalamic). 

In C2CD5 knockout mice, the absence of this gene results in significant changes in hypothalamic mitochondrial structure and function, contributing to obesity through mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress (Gavini2021Loss). These mitochondrial abnormalities are associated with impaired MC4R receptor endocytosis, linking mitochondrial dysfunction to metabolic diseases (Gavini2021Loss).

C2CD5 expression is also nutritionally regulated, with decreased levels observed in diet-induced obesity models, suggesting its role in response to dietary fat challenges (Gavini2019Hypothalamic). The gene's involvement in MC4R trafficking and energy balance regulation makes it a potential target for anti-obesity treatments (Gavini2019Hypothalamic).

## Interactions
C2CD5, also known as KIAA0528 or CDP138, is involved in several protein-protein interactions. It forms a stable protein complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and fibroblast growth factor binding protein (FIBP). This complex has been identified and validated in HEK293T and MCF10A cell lines, with coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirming strong binding interactions, particularly in HEK293T cells. The C-terminal region of C2CD5 is responsible for its binding to CDK5 and FIBP, while the N-terminal region of FIBP is required for its interaction with C2CD5. These interactions suggest a role in stabilizing each other within cells (Xu2014Proteomic).

C2CD5 also interacts with CDK5 to regulate lipid droplet transport in COS-1 cells and is involved with the endocytosis machinery in the rat hypothalamus (Feresten2022ccd5). Additionally, C2CD5 has been shown to bind to inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) through its C2 domain, indicating a potential role in inositol pyrophosphate-protein interactions (Richter2024Proteomewide). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of C2CD5 in cellular processes, including cell growth, migration, and membrane trafficking.
