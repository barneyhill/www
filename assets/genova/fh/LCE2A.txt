# LCE2A

## Overview
LCE2A is a gene that encodes the late cornified envelope 2A protein, which is a crucial component of the epidermal differentiation complex. This protein is primarily involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a critical structure for maintaining the skin's barrier function. LCE2A is expressed predominantly in the skin, particularly in the granular layer and corneocytes of the stratum corneum, where it contributes to the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. This process is essential for the skin's protective capabilities, including its roles in preventing dehydration and pathogen entry. The expression of LCE2A is regulated by environmental factors through the AhR/ARNT system, which influences epidermal differentiation and ceramide biosynthesis, both vital for skin barrier integrity (Niehues2016Late; Furue2014Role). Alterations in LCE2A expression have been linked to various skin conditions, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and may also play a role in cancer biology (Nygaard2017The; Fang2022Identification).

## Function
LCE2A, a member of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene family, plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified envelope, which is essential for skin barrier function. This protein is involved in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, contributing to the integrity and protective capabilities of the skin. LCE2A is typically expressed in the granular layer and corneocytes of the stratum corneum, suggesting its involvement in maintaining the skin barrier and possibly providing antibacterial or antioxidant functions (Niehues2016Late; Bergboer2014Analysis).

In healthy human cells, LCE2A is part of the epidermal differentiation complex located on chromosome 1q21. Its expression is regulated by the AhR/ARNT system, which is activated by environmental factors like TCDD, leading to enhanced epidermal differentiation and ceramide biosynthesis, both of which are vital for skin barrier function (Furue2014Role). The protein's expression is typically restricted to the skin, where it contributes to the formation of the cornified envelope, a structure that prevents dehydration and pathogen entry, thereby maintaining skin homeostasis (Smirnov2023Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCE2A gene have been associated with various skin conditions. In psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, LCE2A expression is often unchanged or decreased, contrasting with the increased expression of other LCE proteins like LCE3, which are linked to the disease's pathology (Niehues2016Late). This suggests that while LCE2A may not be directly implicated in psoriasis, its expression pattern could still play a role in the disease's complex genetic landscape.

In atopic dermatitis, another inflammatory skin condition, LCE2A expression is downregulated by cytokines such as IL-33 and HMGB1, which are known to impair skin barrier function and epidermal growth (Nygaard2017The). This downregulation may contribute to the compromised skin barrier observed in atopic dermatitis, highlighting the potential impact of LCE2A expression levels on skin health.

Additionally, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, LCE2A has been identified as a key gene in the protein-protein interaction network related to alpha linolenic acid metabolism, which is downregulated in tumor tissues. This suggests a potential role for LCE2A in cancer biology, although its specific contributions require further investigation (Fang2022Identification).
