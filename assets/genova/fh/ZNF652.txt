# ZNF652

## Overview
ZNF652 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 652, a transcription factor characterized by its multiple C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are integral to the protein's ability to bind specific DNA sequences, thereby playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 652 functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, forming a corepressor complex with CBFA2T3 to modulate gene expression. This protein is predominantly active in the nucleus and is involved in regulating genes essential for cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. ZNF652 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in mammary tissue, and is implicated in breast tumor suppression, highlighting its potential role in oncogenesis prevention (Kumar2010CBFA2T3–ZNF651; Kumar2006ZNF652). Additionally, alterations in ZNF652 expression and genetic variants have been associated with increased risks of prostate and breast cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Laitinen2014Fine‐mapping; Callen2010Coexpression).

## Structure
ZNF652 is a transcription factor characterized by the presence of multiple C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. These zinc finger domains contribute significantly to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, allowing it to interact with specific DNA sequences effectively. The C2H2-type zinc fingers are a common motif in transcription factors, facilitating the formation of stable protein-DNA complexes.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in ZNF652, potentially influencing its activity and interactions with other proteins. These modifications can alter the protein's conformation and functional properties, impacting its role in gene regulation.

Alternative splicing of the ZNF652 gene can result in different isoforms of the protein. These isoforms may vary in their functional domains, affecting the protein's ability to bind DNA or interact with other molecular partners. The presence of multiple isoforms suggests a level of regulatory complexity, allowing ZNF652 to participate in diverse cellular processes by modulating its structural and functional attributes.

## Function
ZNF652 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor in healthy human cells. It interacts with the CBFA2T3 protein to form a corepressor complex that regulates gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. This complex is particularly involved in the repression of the HEB gene, where ZNF652 binds to a recognition element within the HEB promoter, and its repressive activity is enhanced by CBFA2T3 (Kumar2008CBFA2T3ZNF652). The interaction between ZNF652 and CBFA2T3 is mediated through a proline-rich region in ZNF652, which is crucial for its binding with CBFA2T3, although not necessary for DNA binding (Kumar2008CBFA2T3ZNF652).

ZNF652 is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in mammary tissue, suggesting a role in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. It is implicated in breast tumor suppression, indicating its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing oncogenesis (Kumar2010CBFA2T3–ZNF651). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the expression of genes critical for cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Kumar2006ZNF652).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF652 has been implicated in various cancers, including prostate and breast cancer, due to alterations in its expression levels and genetic variants. In prostate cancer, high expression levels of ZNF652, when co-expressed with the androgen receptor (AR), are associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse. This combined expression is linked to a 2.7-fold increased risk of relapse, independent of preoperative PSA levels and seminal vesicle involvement, but not independent of Gleason score or surgical margins (Callen2010Coexpression).

Genetic variants in ZNF652, such as rs116890317 and rs79670217, have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. These variants are particularly significant in familial cases, suggesting a role in genetic predisposition to the disease (Laitinen2014Fine‐mapping).

In breast cancer, ZNF652 is part of a prognostic index that includes other transcription factors. It is associated with better outcomes in terms of disease-free survival, particularly in basal-like breast cancer, where it is lowly expressed (Liu2021Identification). The gene's reduced expression in breast tumors suggests a potential tumor suppressive role (Kumar2006ZNF652).

## Interactions
ZNF652 is known to interact with the CBFA2T3 protein, forming a corepressor complex that plays a significant role in transcriptional repression. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal region of ZNF652, specifically involving a proline-rich stretch (amino acids 565-574), which is crucial for binding to the NHR3-NHR4 domain of CBFA2T3 (Kumar2008CBFA2T3ZNF652). Mutations in this proline-rich region disrupt the interaction, highlighting its importance for the protein-protein interaction (Kumar2008CBFA2T3ZNF652).

The ZNF652-CBFA2T3 complex is involved in the repression of the HEB gene, where ZNF652 binds to a specific recognition element within the HEB promoter. The presence of CBFA2T3 enhances the repression effect mediated by ZNF652 (Kumar2008CBFA2T3ZNF652). This interaction is specific, as ZNF652 does not significantly interact with other ETO family members like CBFA2T1 and CBFA2T2 (Kumar2006ZNF652).

ZNF652's interaction with CBFA2T3 is also functionally significant in breast cancer cell lines, where it contributes to transcriptional repression and potentially acts as a tumor suppressor (Kumar2006ZNF652). The interaction between ZNF652 and CBFA2T3 is specific and does not extend to other related proteins, underscoring the unique role of this complex in gene regulation (Kumar2006ZNF652).
