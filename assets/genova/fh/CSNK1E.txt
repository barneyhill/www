# CSNK1E

## Overview
The CSNK1E gene encodes the protein casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε), a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of circadian rhythms. CK1ε is involved in the phosphorylation of key circadian clock proteins, thereby influencing their stability and activity, which in turn affects the period of circadian rhythms (Guo2019Autokinase). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting processes such as cell cycle progression and cellular responses to external signals (Guo2019Autokinase). Beyond its role in circadian regulation, CK1ε is implicated in signal transduction pathways and has been associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and epileptic encephalopathies (Chen2018A; Pinacho2016Altered). The kinase's interactions with proteins involved in the Wnt signaling pathway and its influence on tumor cell proliferation further underscore its significance in cellular signaling and disease (Seok2008Inhibition; Chen2018A).

## Structure
The CSNK1E gene encodes the protein casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε), a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of CK1ε is highly similar to its homolog CK1δ, with a 98% similarity in their catalytic domains (Yang2017Molecular). The secondary structure of CK1ε includes an N-terminal lobe and an α-helical C-terminal lobe, with the catalytic center located in the cleft region between these lobes (Yang2017Molecular). The glycine-rich P-loop and residues such as Lys38, Lys130, and Asp149 are crucial for ATP binding and catalytic activity (Yang2017Molecular).

The tertiary structure involves interactions of these residues with ATP, and the DFG motif plays a role in orienting the phosphate for transfer (Yang2017Molecular). CK1ε can exist in different conformations depending on its phosphorylation state, which influences its function and interaction with other molecules (Guo2019Autokinase). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but CK1δ, a homolog, can form a homo-dimer (Yang2017Molecular).

CK1ε undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and conformation (Guo2019Autokinase). These modifications can affect the protein's autokinase activity and its role in circadian rhythm regulation (Guo2019Autokinase).

## Function
CSNK1E, or casein kinase 1 epsilon, is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms in healthy human cells. It is involved in the phosphorylation of key proteins within the circadian clock, influencing their stability and activity, which in turn affects the period of circadian rhythms (Guo2019Autokinase). CSNK1E is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it impacts various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and cellular responses to external signals (Guo2019Autokinase).

The protein's autokinase activity is essential for maintaining the circadian clock's speed, as it modulates the phosphorylation of clock proteins such as mPER2, which affects the circadian period (Guo2019Autokinase). CSNK1E's role in circadian rhythm regulation is highlighted by its ability to phosphorylate substrates of the PERIOD protein family, which is crucial for determining the pace of the circadian clock (Guo2019Autokinase).

In addition to its role in circadian rhythms, CSNK1E is implicated in signal transduction pathways related to the circadian molecular clock, which are often disrupted in conditions like schizophrenia, suggesting its importance in maintaining normal cognitive functions and circadian rhythms (Pinacho2016Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CSNK1E gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. A de novo mutation in CSNK1E has been associated with epileptic encephalopathies, specifically West syndrome. This mutation leads to a splicing error that disrupts the protein kinase domain, suggesting a critical role for CSNK1E in brain function and development (Chen2018A). 

CSNK1E is also involved in the pathology of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS). The gene's expression is correlated with the phosphorylation status of TDP-43, a protein linked to ALS. Altered CSNK1E expression affects TDP-43 phosphorylation, indicating a potential therapeutic target for modulating this process in sALS (Krach2018Transcriptome–pathology).

In psychiatric disorders, CSNK1E has been studied for its role in circadian rhythm regulation, which is linked to mood disorders. Although no significant association was found between CSNK1E polymorphisms and major psychiatric disorders in some studies, certain variants have been associated with schizophrenia susceptibility in specific populations (Matsunaga2012An). Additionally, CSNK1E mutations in mice have been shown to affect anxiety, fear, and depressive-like behaviors, highlighting its potential role in affective disorders (Zhou2020Altered).

## Interactions
CSNK1E, or casein kinase 1 epsilon, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It is known to phosphorylate clock proteins such as PERIOD2, which leads to its degradation via the proteasome. This interaction is crucial for regulating circadian rhythms and has implications in tumor cell growth, as PERIOD2 exerts anti-tumor effects (Seok2008Inhibition). CSNK1E also interacts with proteins involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, such as DVL2 and DVL3, which are important for neuropsychiatric conditions and cellular signaling (Chen2018A).

In the context of cancer, CSNK1E's kinase activity is essential for tumor cell proliferation, as it phosphorylates key proteins like p53 and β-catenin, although the specific significance of these interactions in carcinogenesis is not fully understood (Seok2008Inhibition). The gene's interaction with PERIOD2 is particularly significant in cancer, as it modulates tumor cell growth by affecting PERIOD2's function (Seok2008Inhibition).

CSNK1E is also involved in the regulation of affective behaviors, potentially through interactions with Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B), which is involved in mood regulation (Zhou2020Altered). These interactions highlight CSNK1E's role in both circadian rhythm regulation and broader cellular signaling pathways.
