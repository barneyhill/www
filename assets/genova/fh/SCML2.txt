# SCML2

## Overview
SCML2 is a gene that encodes the Scm polycomb group protein like 2, a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which are involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The SCML2 protein is characterized by its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression, primarily through its interaction with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). It contains several functional domains, including malignant brain tumor (MBT) repeats, a DUF3588 domain, and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate its binding to chromatin and interaction with other proteins. SCML2 exists in two isoforms, SCML2A and SCML2B, which differ in their domain composition and subcellular localization. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and male meiosis, and has been linked to several clinical conditions, such as neurodevelopmental syndromes and Nance-Horan syndrome (loche2015epigenetic; Bonasio2014Interactions; Lecona2013Polycomb).

## Structure
The SCML2 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in chromatin modification and gene regulation. It contains two N-terminal malignant brain tumor (MBT) repeats, which are involved in recognizing methylated lysines on histones. Each MBT repeat consists of an extended arm and a β-barrel core, with the arm of one repeat packing against the core of the next, forming an inter-linked structural unit (Sathyamurthy2003Crystal). The MBT domains are crucial for chromatin binding and interact with histone marks (Bonasio2014Interactions).

SCML2 also includes a DUF3588 domain, known for its DNA-binding capability, and a C-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which mediates interactions with the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (Luo2015Polycomb). The SAM domain facilitates SCML2's recruitment to PRC1, contributing to its role in transcriptional repression (Sathyamurthy2003Crystal).

SCML2 exists in two isoforms, SCML2A and SCML2B, generated by alternative splicing. SCML2A is the full-length version, enriched in the chromatin fraction, while SCML2B lacks the SPM domain and is found in the soluble nuclear fraction (Bonasio2014Interactions). The protein also features a novel RNA-binding region (RBR) that is essential for its interaction with RNA and chromatin localization (Bonasio2014Interactions).

## Function
The SCML2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. SCML2 is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins and is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene repression. It interacts with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) to repress transcription by contributing to the localization of PRC1 on chromatin and directly repressing certain target genes (Bonasio2014Interactions). SCML2A, one of its isoforms, binds to PRC1 through its SPM domain and interacts with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) via a novel RNA-binding region (RBR), which is crucial for its recruitment to chromatin (Bonasio2014Interactions).

SCML2 is enriched at Polycomb target sites, particularly near transcription start sites of protein-coding genes, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation, development, and differentiation (Bonasio2014Interactions). It can enforce gene repression independently of PRC1, potentially through mechanisms such as chromatin compaction mediated by its MBT domain, which binds to methylated histone tails (Bonasio2014Interactions). SCML2's interactions with ncRNAs are important for its localization and stabilization on chromatin, influencing its function and distribution across the genome (Bonasio2014Interactions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCML2 gene have been linked to a novel X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental syndrome. Affected individuals, primarily males, exhibit symptoms such as multiple joint contractures, club feet, clenched fists, hypogonadism, intellectual disability, and frequent tonic fits. In one Italian family, a missense mutation within the conserved MBT1 domain of SCML2, specifically a c.349C>A substitution (p.Pro117Thr), was identified. This mutation is believed to disrupt protein function by affecting hydrophobic stacking interactions (loche2015epigenetic).

SCML2 mutations are also associated with a neurological syndrome characterized by hyperexcitability of cortical and spinal neurons, leading to increased seizure susceptibility. A mouse model with targeted inactivation of Scml2 displayed morphological and functional alterations in inhibitory synapses, resulting in increased excitability and seizure susceptibility. This suggests that SCML2 plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain, with implications for epileptogenesis (loche2015epigenetic).

Additionally, SCML2 has been implicated in Nance-Horan syndrome, where a hemizygous deletion encompassing SCML2 was identified in a patient with developmental delays and dysmorphic features (Guven2023NanceHoran).

## Interactions
SCML2, particularly its isoform SCML2B, participates in several critical interactions with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. SCML2B forms a stable complex with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins, specifically interacting with CDK2/CYCE and CDK2/CYCA complexes. It also interacts with the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27, enhancing their inhibitory effects on CDK activity. These interactions are crucial for modulating the G1/S checkpoint, as SCML2B stabilizes p21, promoting its interaction with CDK2/CYCE, which results in decreased kinase activity and inhibited progression through G1 (Lecona2013Polycomb).

SCML2B's interaction with CDK2/CYCE is cooperative with p21 and p27, and the presence of these inhibitors is necessary to stabilize the interaction. The binding of SCML2B to CDK2/CYCE is enhanced by substoichiometric amounts of p21 but inhibited by excess p21 (Lecona2013Polycomb). SCML2B also interacts with CDK1/CYCB complexes and is subject to phosphorylation by CDK1 and CDK2, which affects its interactions and function in cell cycle regulation (Lecona2013Polycomb).

In the context of male meiosis, SCML2 forms a complex with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7, which is crucial for the localization of USP7 to the XY body in spermatocytes. This interaction is important for counteracting histone H2A ubiquitination in the XY chromatin (Luo2015Polycomb).
