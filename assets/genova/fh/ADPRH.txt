# ADPRH

## Overview
The ADPRH gene encodes the enzyme ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase, which is a critical component of the cellular machinery involved in the reversible post-translational modification process known as ADP-ribosylation. This enzyme functions as a hydrolase, specifically targeting and cleaving the ADP-ribose moiety from arginine residues in proteins, a modification that is initially catalyzed by ADP-ribosyltransferases (Kato2007Enhanced; Kernstock2009Cloning). ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the levels of ADP-ribosylated proteins, thereby preventing their accumulation and potential disruption of cellular processes (Kato2007Enhanced). The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and protein function regulation (Aoki2005Genomic). Its activity is particularly significant in counteracting the effects of bacterial toxins, such as cholera toxin, by removing ADP-ribose from modified proteins, thus mitigating the toxin's impact on cellular signaling pathways (Kato2007Enhanced).

## Function
The ADPRH gene encodes the enzyme ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase, which plays a crucial role in the reversible post-translational modification process known as ADP-ribosylation. This enzyme specifically cleaves the ADP-ribose moiety from arginine residues in proteins, a modification initially catalyzed by ADP-ribosyltransferases (Kato2007Enhanced; Kernstock2009Cloning). In healthy human cells, ADPRH is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the levels of ADP-ribosylated proteins, thus preventing their accumulation and potential disruption of cellular processes (Kato2007Enhanced).

ADPRH activity is particularly important in counteracting the effects of bacterial toxins, such as cholera toxin, which utilize ADP-ribosylation to alter cellular signaling pathways. By removing ADP-ribose from the modified Gsα protein, ADPRH mitigates the toxin's impact on fluid accumulation and cellular signaling (Kato2007Enhanced). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and protein function regulation (Aoki2005Genomic). The absence of ADPRH activity can lead to increased sensitivity to bacterial toxins and altered cellular responses, highlighting its protective role in cellular detoxification (Kato2007Enhanced).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADPRH gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In low-grade glioma (LGG), a type of brain tumor, ADPRH is significantly upregulated compared to non-tumor brain samples. This overexpression is associated with poor overall survival and progression-free survival in LGG patients, making it an independent prognostic factor for these outcomes (Zhang2021ADPRH). The gene's expression is linked to the upregulation of several signaling pathways, including P53, KRAS, IL6/JAK-STAT3, and TNF-beta, which are involved in cancer proliferation and immunosuppression (Zhang2021ADPRH).

ADPRH expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration in tumors, showing significant associations with various immune cells such as CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This suggests a role in modulating immune responses in cancer (Zhang2021ADPRH). In colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, ADPRH is upregulated in regulatory T lymphocytes, indicating its involvement in lymphocyte activation (Zhang2021ADPRH).

In addition to cancer, ADPRH deficiency has been studied in the context of cholera toxin sensitivity. Mice lacking ADPRH exhibit enhanced sensitivity to cholera toxin, highlighting the gene's role in modulating cellular responses to bacterial toxins (Kato2007Enhanced).
