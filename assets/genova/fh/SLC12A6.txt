# SLC12A6

## Overview
The SLC12A6 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 12 member 6, commonly known as the potassium-chloride cotransporter 3 (KCC3). This protein is a transmembrane transporter that plays a critical role in the electroneutral transport of potassium and chloride ions across cell membranes, which is essential for maintaining ion homeostasis and cell volume regulation in various tissues, including the nervous system, kidneys, and heart (Race1999Molecular; Howard2002The). KCC3 is particularly significant in the nervous system, where it contributes to neuronal function, myelin compaction, and protection against osmotic stress (Howard2002The). Mutations in the SLC12A6 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, including Andermann syndrome and certain forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, highlighting its clinical importance (Howard2002The; Park2019De).

## Structure
The SLC12A6 gene encodes the KCC3 protein, a potassium-chloride cotransporter involved in ion transport across cell membranes. The protein typically features 12 transmembrane helices, which are characteristic of its secondary structure and facilitate its role in transporting ions (Howard2002The). KCC3 exists in two isoforms, KCC3a and KCC3b, resulting from alternative splicing. KCC3a is 1,150 amino acids long and contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C, which are absent in the shorter KCC3b isoform, consisting of 1,099 amino acids (Howard2002The; Hebert2004Molecular).

The primary structure of KCC3 includes specific mutations that can lead to frameshifts and premature stop codons, resulting in truncated proteins that affect its function (Howard2002The). These mutations are associated with conditions such as agenesis of the corpus callosum and peripheral neuropathy (ACCPN) (Howard2002The). The protein's ability to homodimerize is noted, although the functional relevance of this property is not fully understood (Howard2002The). The extreme C terminus of KCC proteins is highly conserved across species, and truncations in this region can abolish function (Howard2002The).

## Function
The SLC12A6 gene encodes the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC3, which is involved in the electroneutral transport of potassium and chloride ions across cell membranes. This function is crucial for maintaining ion balance and cell volume regulation in various tissues, including the kidney, heart, and brain (Race1999Molecular). KCC3 is particularly important in the nervous system, where it plays a role in the development and maintenance of neuronal function. It is expressed in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells, contributing to processes such as myelin compaction and protection against osmotic stress (Howard2002The).

KCC3 activity is stimulated by cell swelling and specific chemical treatments, indicating its role in cell volume regulation (Race1999Molecular). In the central nervous system, KCC3 is involved in axonal migration, which is essential for proper brain development (Howard2002The). The cotransporter is also implicated in cellular proliferation and survival, affecting the development and function of the central and peripheral nervous systems (Howard2002The). In healthy human cells, KCC3's function is vital for maintaining normal cellular physiology, particularly in the nervous system and kidneys (Howard2002The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC12A6 gene, which encodes the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC3, are associated with several neurological disorders. One of the most severe conditions linked to SLC12A6 mutations is Andermann syndrome, also known as agenesis of the corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy (ACCPN). This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by progressive sensorimotor neuropathy, mental retardation, dysmorphic features, and complete or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. It is particularly prevalent in the Charlevoix and Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean regions of Quebec, Canada, due to a founder effect (Howard2002The).

In addition to Andermann syndrome, de novo variants in SLC12A6 have been identified in patients with a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a genetically heterogeneous disorder affecting the peripheral nervous system. These variants result in early-onset progressive sensorimotor neuropathy without intellectual disability, contrasting with the severe phenotype seen in recessive cases (Park2019De).

A late-onset autosomal-dominant hereditary polyneuropathy has also been linked to a heterozygous variant in SLC12A6, expanding the spectrum of SLC12A6-related disorders. This condition is characterized by axonal neuropathy with predominant sensory deficits and lacks central nervous system manifestations (Løseth2022Lateonset).
