# KIR2DS4

## Overview
KIR2DS4 is a gene that encodes the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, two Ig domains and short cytoplasmic tail 4, a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system. This receptor is part of the larger KIR family, which is primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cell subsets. KIR2DS4 is an activating receptor that interacts with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, such as HLA-C and HLA-A*11, to modulate immune responses. The protein's unique structural features, including its two immunoglobulin-like domains and short cytoplasmic tail, contribute to its specific ligand-binding capabilities and functional roles in immune surveillance and reproductive success (Graef2009KIR2DS4; Katz2001Recognition). Variations in the KIR2DS4 gene, including polymorphisms and expression levels, have been associated with various clinical outcomes, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Barani2020Positive; BorreroPalacios2019Combination).

## Structure
The KIR2DS4 protein is a member of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, characterized by its two immunoglobulin-like domains and a short cytoplasmic tail. The protein's structure is similar to other KIRs, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) ranging from 1.04 Å to 2.37 Å when compared to other KIR proteins (Graef2009KIR2DS4). The hinge angle between the D1 and D2 domains is 69°, which is comparable to that of KIR2DL1 when bound to HLA-C*04 (Graef2009KIR2DS4).

KIR2DS4 has unique structural features that influence its ligand binding. The Pro71-Val72 motif in the D1 domain is crucial for the recognition of HLA-A*11, replacing the Gln71-Asp72 motif found in other lineage III KIRs (Graef2009KIR2DS4). The protein also contains a distinctive alanine substitution at position 184, which disrupts the typical electronegative binding surface seen in KIR2DL proteins (Graef2009KIR2DS4).

The KIR2DS4 gene has several alleles, including a deletion variant, KIR2DS4*003, which results in a truncated protein lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, potentially leading to a soluble form (Middleton2007Studies). This variant is prevalent in certain populations, such as those in Northern Ireland (Middleton2007Studies).

## Function
KIR2DS4 is an activating receptor expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, playing a significant role in immune responses by interacting with specific HLA class I molecules. It is involved in recognizing and binding to HLA-Cw4, but not HLA-Cw6, with the binding being dependent on the presence of the W14 residue in HLA-Cw4 (Katz2001Recognition). This interaction is crucial for modulating NK cell activity, as it can inhibit the lysis of target cells expressing HLA-Cw4, thereby influencing immune surveillance and cytotoxic responses (Katz2001Recognition).

In the context of pregnancy, KIR2DS4 is expressed by uterine NK (uNK) cells and contributes to successful pregnancy outcomes. It promotes placental trophoblast invasion by activating uNK cells, leading to the secretion of cytokines such as GM-CSF, XCL1, and CCL1, which facilitate trophoblast migration and arterial transformation (Kennedy2016Activating). The presence of KIR2DS4, particularly in combination with KIR2DS1, is associated with a lower risk of pregnancy disorders, suggesting a protective role in placental development (Kennedy2016Activating). KIR2DS4's function in healthy human cells is thus integral to both immune defense mechanisms and reproductive success.

## Clinical Significance
The KIR2DS4 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its polymorphisms and expression levels. In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with KRAS mutations treated with cetuximab, the absence of a functional KIR2DS4 receptor is associated with longer overall survival. This suggests that the non-functional variant may serve as a favorable prognostic biomarker in these patients (BorreroPalacios2019Combination). Conversely, the full-length KIR2DS4 variant has been linked to a higher risk of developing meningioma, indicating a predisposing role in this condition (Barani2020Positive).

In the context of hematopoietic cell transplantation, KIR2DS4 expression is upregulated in recipients, particularly in those with cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. This suggests a potential role in CMV reactivation, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (GallezHawkins2011Expression). The gene's expression levels are influenced by methylation patterns, with unmethylated CpG sites in the promoter region correlating with higher expression levels (GallezHawkins2012KIR2DS2).

KIR2DS4 polymorphisms also appear to influence the response to anti-IgG1 therapies, highlighting the gene's potential impact on immune response and disease progression (BorreroPalacios2019Combination).

## Interactions
KIR2DS4 is an activating receptor that interacts with various HLA class I molecules, including HLA-C and HLA-A*11. The interaction with HLA-C is characterized by low avidity, influenced by specific amino acid substitutions in the KIR2DS4 protein, such as the Pro71-Val72 motif, which affects its binding specificity and avidity (Graef2009KIR2DS4). KIR2DS4 has a unique specificity for HLA-A*11, which is attributed to gene conversion with KIR3DL2, introducing specific amino acid changes that enhance its interaction with HLA-A*11 while reducing its affinity for HLA-C (Graef2009KIR2DS4).

KIR2DS4 also interacts with non-class I MHC proteins, as demonstrated by its binding to melanoma cell lines such as 1106mel, which lack MHC class I molecules. This suggests the presence of additional ligands for KIR2DS4 beyond the known HLA-Cw4, indicating a broader range of interactions (Katz2004MHC). The binding of KIR2DS4 to these cells is functional, as it enhances NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, highlighting its role in immune responses (Katz2004MHC). These interactions suggest that KIR2DS4 plays a significant role in modulating NK cell activity through its diverse binding capabilities.
