# C3

## Overview
The C3 gene encodes the complement component C3 protein, a central and versatile player in the immune system, particularly within the complement cascade. Located on chromosome 19 at locus p13.3, the C3 gene gives rise to a complex glycoprotein that is crucial for both innate and adaptive immune responses (Ricklin2016Complement). The complement C3 protein is categorized as a key component of the complement system, functioning primarily as an opsonin and an anaphylatoxin. Upon activation, C3 is cleaved into C3a and C3b fragments, each mediating distinct immune functions such as inflammation and pathogen clearance (Lubbers2017Production; Ricklin2016Complement). The protein's ability to interact with various receptors and regulatory proteins underscores its importance in immune regulation and homeostasis (Ricklin2016Complement). Mutations and polymorphisms in the C3 gene are linked to several diseases, including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and dense deposit disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Schramm2015Mapping; MartínezBarricarte2010Human).

## Structure
The human complement C3 protein is a complex glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 185 kDa, encoded by the C3 gene located on chromosome 19 at locus p13.3. It is initially synthesized as a prepro-protein consisting of 1663 amino acids, which includes a 22-amino acid signal peptide. Post-translational processing results in the formation of a β-chain (75 kDa) and an α-chain (110 kDa), linked by a disulfide bridge (Ricklin2016Complement).

The C3 protein is composed of 13 domains, including eight macroglobulin (MG) domains that form a key ring structure. The α-chain contains an anaphylatoxin (ANA) domain and a thioester-containing domain (TED), which is crucial for covalent binding to surfaces. The TED is initially shielded but becomes exposed upon activation, facilitating its role in host defense (Ricklin2016Complement; Nishida2006Structural).

C3 undergoes significant conformational changes upon activation to C3b, which involves the movement of the TED and CUB domains. This structural rearrangement is essential for interactions with complement factor H and other regulators (Rodriguez2014New). The protein also features glycosylation at Asn-917 on the α-chain and Asn-63 on the β-chain, with high-mannose carbohydrate moieties attached (Ricklin2016Complement).

## Function
Complement component C3 is a pivotal protein in the immune system, acting as a central player in both innate and adaptive immunity. In healthy human cells, C3 is primarily synthesized in the liver but is also produced by various other cells, including monocytes, astrocytes, and B lymphocytes, allowing for localized immune responses (Lambris1988The; Ricklin2016Complement). C3 is cleaved into two fragments, C3a and C3b, each with distinct functions. C3b acts as an opsonin, binding covalently to pathogens and facilitating their clearance through phagocytosis. It also plays a role in the formation of C5 convertase, which is crucial for the generation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that can lyse target cells (Lubbers2017Production; Ricklin2016Complement).

C3a functions as an anaphylatoxin, promoting inflammation by acting as a chemoattractant for immune cells (Ricklin2016Complement). C3 also influences T cell responses, modulating both paracrine and autocrine activation pathways, which are essential for T cell proliferation and differentiation (Reis2019New). The protein's interactions with various receptors, such as CR1, CR2, CR3, and CR4, are critical for immune regulation and pathogen clearance (Ricklin2016Complement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the C3 gene are associated with several diseases due to their impact on complement system regulation. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is linked to C3 mutations that result in impaired regulation by factor H (FH) and membrane cofactor protein (MCP), leading to excessive C3b deposition and complement activation (Schramm2015Mapping; Roumenina2012A). These mutations often cluster around FH binding sites, causing inefficient dissociation of the C3 convertase and contributing to endothelial damage and thrombosis (Schramm2015Mapping).

Dense deposit disease (DDD) is associated with specific C3 mutations, such as C3 923ΔDG, which lead to complement dysregulation by making the C3 convertase resistant to inactivation by FH (MartínezBarricarte2010Human). This mutation results in constitutive activation of the complement system, contributing to the pathogenesis of DDD (MartínezBarricarte2010Human).

In metabolic syndrome, elevated plasma C3 concentrations are linked to insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity, with specific C3 gene variants influencing disease risk (Delanghe2014Complement). Additionally, C3 polymorphisms are implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Crohn's disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, highlighting the gene's broad clinical significance (Delanghe2014Complement).

## Interactions
Complement component C3 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the immune response. The C3b fragment of C3 is central to these interactions. It binds to factor B, forming the C3 convertase complex, which is essential for the amplification of the complement cascade (Ross1983Generation). Specific residues within the 727–767 segment of the C3b α-chain are critical for interactions with factor H and complement receptor 1 (CR1). Glutamic acid residues Glu-736 and Glu-737 are important for binding to factor B and CR1, while Glu-744 and Glu-747 are crucial for factor H interaction (Oran1999Identification).

C3b also interacts with membrane cofactor protein (MCP), although this interaction is distinct from those with factor H and CR1 (Oran1999Identification). The binding of C3b to these regulatory proteins is influenced by ionic strength, suggesting that ionic bonds are significant in these interactions (Oran1999Identification).

Mutations in C3 can affect its binding to regulatory proteins, as seen in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), where mutations often lead to decreased binding affinity to factor H and MCP, resulting in impaired regulation of the complement system (Schramm2015Mapping).
