# EPS15L1

## Overview
EPS15L1, or Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Pathway Substrate 15-Like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in endocytosis and intracellular signaling. The protein, also referred to as EPS15L1, is an endocytic adaptor protein that plays a pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), facilitating the internalization of receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the transferrin receptor (TfR) (Milesi2019Redundant; lucano2015novel). Structurally, EPS15L1 is characterized by its modular composition, including EH domains, a coiled-coil domain, and ubiquitin-interacting motifs, which enable it to interact with various proteins and participate in complex cellular processes (milesi2017redundant; lucano2015novel). Functionally, EPS15L1 is critical in the nervous system, where its absence can lead to neurological deficits and perinatal lethality, underscoring its importance in synaptic vesicle recycling and synaptic function (Milesi2019Redundant). Additionally, mutations in the EPS15L1 gene have been linked to developmental disorders such as split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM), highlighting its clinical significance (Umair2018First).

## Structure
EPS15L1 is a protein involved in endocytosis and intracellular signaling, characterized by a modular structure with distinct domains. The protein is approximately 125 kDa and consists of 907 amino acids (milesi2017redundant; lucano2015novel). The N-terminal region contains three EH (Eps15 homology) domains, which are crucial for binding to NPF-containing proteins such as Epsin and Numb (milesi2017redundant; lucano2015novel). The central region features an α-helical coiled-coil domain composed of 24 heptad repeats, serving as a dimerization interface (milesi2017redundant). The C-terminal region includes a proline-rich area with several DPF repeats, facilitating interactions with proteins like Crk, Grb2, and AP-2, as well as two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that allow binding to ubiquitinated receptors (milesi2017redundant; lucano2015novel).

EPS15L1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including tyrosine phosphorylation and mono-ubiquitination, which are essential for its function in endocytosis (Milesi2019Redundant). The protein may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its function and interactions.

## Function
EPS15L1 is an endocytic adaptor protein involved in the regulation of endocytosis, particularly clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). It plays a crucial role in the internalization of receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the transferrin receptor (TfR), which are essential for cellular signaling and iron homeostasis, respectively (Milesi2019Redundant; lucano2015novel). EPS15L1 is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the assembly of endocytic complexes by interacting with other proteins like Epsin, Numb, and Synaptojanin (lucano2015novel).

In the nervous system, EPS15L1 has a nonredundant role, as its absence leads to neurological deficits and perinatal lethality in mice, indicating its critical function in synaptic vesicle recycling and synaptic function (Milesi2019Redundant). EPS15L1 is enriched in the synaptosomal fraction of the brain, suggesting its involvement in maintaining synaptic vesicle numbers and function (Milesi2019Redundant).

EPS15L1 also participates in the regulation of Notch signaling, a pathway important for cell differentiation and development. Its role in this pathway is highlighted by the downregulation of Notch target genes in EPS15L1-deficient models (lucano2015novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EPS15L1 gene have been associated with split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM), a developmental limb disorder characterized by the absence of one or more digits on the hands or feet. A study identified a homozygous loss-of-function variant in the EPS15L1 gene, specifically a frameshift deletion (c.409delA, p.Ser137Alafs*19), in individuals with SHFM, suggesting that mutations in this gene can lead to the condition (Umair2018First).

EPS15L1 also plays a critical role in the nervous system. In mice, the absence of EPS15L1 results in severe neurological defects and perinatal lethality, indicating its essential function in neuronal development and survival. These defects include reduced synaptic vesicles and impaired synaptic function, which may contribute to neurological deficits (Milesi2019Redundant).

In zebrafish, EPS15L1 is crucial for T lymphocyte development, with its disruption leading to impaired T cell development. This suggests a potential role in immune system function, although specific diseases related to EPS15L1 mutations in humans are not directly identified (Seiler2015Mutagenesis).

Alterations in EPS15L1 expression or function may also impact erythrocyte maturation and iron metabolism, as evidenced by studies showing its involvement in transferrin receptor internalization and red blood cell development (Milesi2019Redundant).

## Interactions
EPS15L1 is an endocytic adaptor protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions crucial for endocytosis and intracellular signaling. It shares significant sequence similarity with its homolog EPS15 and interacts with many of the same binding partners, including the adaptor protein complex AP2, which is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (Milesi2019Redundant). EPS15L1 contains EH domains that bind to NPF-containing endocytic proteins such as Epsin, Numb, Hrb, Synaptojanin, and Stonin, facilitating the assembly of endocytic complexes (lucano2015novel).

The central α-helical coiled-coil domain of EPS15L1 allows for dimerization and interaction with other adaptors like Hrs and Intersectin (lucano2015novel). In the nervous system, EPS15L1 interacts with intersectin-1, and its absence in Eps15L1-KO mice leads to a significant reduction in intersectin-1 levels, suggesting a stabilizing role for EPS15L1 in this interaction (Milesi2019Redundant).

EPS15L1 also contains ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that enable it to bind ubiquitinated proteins, directing them towards lysosomal degradation pathways (lucano2015novel). These interactions highlight the role of EPS15L1 in both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytic pathways, as well as its involvement in receptor tyrosine kinase endocytosis and signaling.
