# POC1B

## Overview
POC1B is a gene that encodes the POC1 centriolar protein B, a crucial component of the centriole and basal body structures in eukaryotic cells. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeat domains and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and structural stability (Pearson2009Basal; Keller2009Molecular). POC1 centriolar protein B is integral to centriole assembly, stability, and ciliogenesis, particularly in the formation and maintenance of primary cilia and photoreceptor sensory cilia in the retina (Pearson2009Basal; Kominami2017Case). Mutations in the POC1B gene are associated with inherited retinal dystrophies, such as cone dystrophy and cone-rod dystrophy, underscoring its clinical significance in visual function and its potential involvement in broader ciliopathies (Kominami2017Case; Weisschuh2021Clinical).

## Structure
POC1B is a protein characterized by the presence of WD40 repeat domains, which are crucial for its function and localization. These domains are typically involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to the structural stability of the protein (Pearson2009Basal; Keller2009Molecular). The WD40 domain is located in the N-terminal half of the protein and is essential for targeting POC1B to centrioles (Keller2009Molecular). The C-terminal region of POC1B contains a coiled-coil domain, known as the POC1 domain, which is involved in protein interactions but is not necessary for centriole localization (Jo2019Poc1B; Keller2009Molecular).

POC1B is involved in centriole and cilia function, and its structure allows it to incorporate into multiple domains of the basal body, including the cartwheel and cylinder walls (Pearson2009Basal). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Pearson2009Basal). POC1B's role in centriole stability and ciliogenesis is conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary importance (Pearson2009Basal).

## Function
POC1B is a crucial component of the centriole and basal body, playing a significant role in centriole assembly, stability, and ciliogenesis in healthy human cells. It localizes to key domains within the basal body structure, including the cartwheel, cylinder walls, and the site of nascent basal body assembly, which are essential for the formation and maintenance of cilia (Pearson2009Basal). POC1B is specifically required for primary cilia formation and ciliary length, indicating its distinct function in ciliogenesis compared to its paralog, POC1A (Pearson2009Basal).

In the retina, POC1B is predominantly expressed in the ciliary region of photoreceptor cells, where it is essential for the proper formation of photoreceptor sensory cilia, critical for visual function (Kominami2017Case). Knockdown studies in zebrafish have shown that reduced POC1B expression leads to impaired visual function, characterized by abnormal optokinetic responses and shortened or absent outer segments of photoreceptors (Kominami2017Case).

POC1B's role in maintaining basal body stability is crucial for normal ciliogenesis, and its depletion can lead to defects associated with ciliopathies, such as shorter and disorganized cilia, impacting various developmental and physiological processes (Pearson2009Basal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POC1B gene are linked to inherited retinal dystrophies, including cone dystrophy (CD) and cone-rod dystrophy (CORD). These conditions are characterized by symptoms such as decreased visual acuity, photophobia, and color vision disturbances. The POC1B gene is crucial for maintaining the structure of photoreceptor cilia, and its dysfunction leads to retinal degeneration (Kominami2017Case; Weisschuh2021Clinical). 

Pathogenic variants in POC1B include frameshift, splice site, and missense mutations, which can result in truncated proteins or aberrant splicing, contributing to the disease phenotype (Weisschuh2021Clinical). For instance, a frameshift duplication variant leads to a premature termination codon, while a splice site variant causes partial exon skipping (Weisschuh2021Clinical). 

The clinical presentation of POC1B-associated retinopathy can be misdiagnosed as achromatopsia or occult macular dystrophy due to its slow progression and normal fundus appearance in early stages (Weisschuh2021Clinical). Genetic testing is essential for accurate diagnosis, as POC1B variants can also be associated with other conditions like Leber congenital amaurosis and syndromic ciliopathies (Peturson2021A; Kominami2017Case).

## Interactions
POC1B interacts with several proteins that are crucial for centriole formation and stability. It has a conserved coiled coil domain at the C-terminus, which is essential for its interaction with Sas-6, a protein involved in centriole assembly. This interaction is critical for the formation of pericentriolar material-like (PCL) structures, as demonstrated by the failure of a Poc1B truncation construct lacking the C-terminus to form ectopic particles when co-overexpressed with Sas-6 (Jo2019Poc1B). POC1B is also involved in the centriole-to-centrosome conversion process, interacting with CEP44. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of pericentriolar material proteins like γ-tubulin and CEP192 to centrioles. POC1B depletion results in a phenotype similar to CEP44 loss, indicating its role in this conversion process (Atorino2020CEP44).

POC1B's interaction with Sas-6 is important during the initial stages of PCL formation, and this interaction can induce PCL-like structures without recruiting Ana2 (Jo2019Poc1B). The localization of POC1B to the PCL is dependent on Sas-6, and both proteins colocalize in the PCL/centriole core, suggesting a functional interaction during PCL formation (Jo2019Poc1B).
