# C14orf93

## Overview
C14orf93, also known as RTFC, is a gene located on chromosome 14 that encodes the protein chromosome 14 open reading frame 93. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. Notably, C14orf93 has been associated with oncogenic activities, particularly in the context of thyroid cancer. Mutations in this gene, such as V205M, R115Q, and G209D, have been linked to familial and sporadic nonmedullary thyroid cancer, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Liu2017C14orf93). The protein encoded by C14orf93 may influence cell survival, migration, and colony formation, contributing to cancer progression (Liu2017C14orf93). Additionally, its recognition by patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas hints at a broader involvement in oncological conditions (Liu2017C14orf93).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C14orf93 gene, also known as RTFC, have been implicated in familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC). The V205M mutation in C14orf93 is associated with increased cell survival, migration, and colony formation in papillary thyroid cancer cell lines, indicating its oncogenic potential (Liu2017C14orf93). This mutation was not found in 518 unaffected control individuals, suggesting its specificity to FNMTC (Liu2017C14orf93). Other mutations, such as R115Q and G209D, have been identified in sporadic nonmedullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) patients, further supporting the gene's role in thyroid carcinogenesis (Liu2017C14orf93).

Research has shown that RTFC mutations can enhance the pro-tumorigenic function of the gene, promoting tumor formation and increasing the colony-forming capacity of thyroid cancer cells (Liu2017C14orf93). The V205M and G209D variants, in particular, have been shown to transform normal thyroid cells, increasing their foci formation capacity (Liu2017C14orf93). These findings suggest that C14orf93 mutations contribute to the progression of thyroid cancer and may serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The gene is also recognized by patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas, indicating a possible involvement in these conditions (Liu2017C14orf93).
