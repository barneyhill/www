# ADGRE3

## Overview
ADGRE3 is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E3, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the immune system, where it plays a significant role in cell signaling and immune response regulation. As a transmembrane receptor, adhesion GPCRs like ADGRE3 are characterized by their ability to mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which are crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to inflammatory stimuli. The ADGRE3 gene's expression and function are of particular interest in the context of immune system disorders and cancer, where its dysregulation may contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the ADGRE3 gene have been implicated in various immune system disorders and inflammatory conditions. The gene encodes a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor family, which plays a crucial role in cell signaling and immune response. Disruptions in ADGRE3 function can lead to dysregulation of immune processes, potentially contributing to the development of autoimmune diseases. Research is ongoing to fully elucidate the specific mechanisms by which ADGRE3 mutations or expression changes influence these conditions.

There is also emerging evidence suggesting a potential link between ADGRE3 and cancer. Altered expression of ADGRE3 may affect tumor microenvironments or immune surveillance, thereby influencing cancer progression or metastasis. However, the exact role of ADGRE3 in cancer remains under investigation, and further studies are needed to clarify its contributions to oncogenesis and tumor biology.

Overall, while the clinical significance of ADGRE3 is still being explored, its involvement in immune and inflammatory pathways highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in related diseases. Understanding the precise impact of ADGRE3 alterations could lead to novel strategies for managing immune-related disorders and certain cancers.
