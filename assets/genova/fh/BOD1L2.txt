# BOD1L2

## Overview
The BOD1L2 gene encodes the protein known as biorientation of chromosomes in cell division 1 like 2, which is involved in the regulation of chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division. This protein plays a critical role in ensuring proper biorientation of chromosomes, a process essential for accurate chromosome segregation and genomic stability. BOD1L2 is categorized as a regulatory protein, and its function is crucial for maintaining the fidelity of cell division. Disruptions in the expression or function of BOD1L2 can lead to cell cycle dysregulation, contributing to genomic instability and potentially leading to oncogenesis. The gene's role in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, particularly those involving aberrant cell division (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the BOD1L2 gene can significantly impact genomic stability, which may contribute to the development of cancer. The gene plays a crucial role in chromosome biorientation during cell division, and disruptions in its normal function can lead to cell cycle dysregulation. This dysregulation is a known factor in the pathogenesis of various cancers, as it can result in improper chromosome segregation and aneuploidy, conditions that are often associated with tumorigenesis.

In addition to its implications in cancer, alterations in BOD1L2's expression or its interactions may be linked to other diseases characterized by cell cycle abnormalities. While the specific diseases are not fully detailed, the gene's involvement in maintaining genomic stability suggests that its dysfunction could contribute to a range of disorders where cell division is affected. The precise clinical implications of BOD1L2 mutations or expression changes are still under investigation, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate its role in disease mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target.
