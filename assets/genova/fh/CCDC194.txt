# CCDC194

## Overview
CCDC194 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 194, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC194 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific biological functions of CCDC194 are not fully understood, its expression has been linked to several physiological and pathological conditions. Notably, alterations in CCDC194 expression have been observed in Alzheimer's disease, where it is upregulated in the frontal white matter, and in response to environmental stressors such as bisphenol contaminants in marine mammals (Kashiwabara2023Effects; Malla2024Molecular). Additionally, CCDC194 expression is significantly increased following traumatic brain injury, indicating a potential role in the brain's response to injury (Rai2024Transcriptional). Further research is required to fully elucidate the functional roles and clinical significance of the CCDC194 protein.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the CCDC194 gene is currently under investigation, with studies indicating its involvement in various conditions through alterations in its expression. In Alzheimer's disease, CCDC194 is among the upregulated genes in the frontal white matter, associated with biological processes such as DNA damage response and regulation of Hippo-signaling pathways (Malla2024Molecular). This suggests a potential role in the disease's pathology, particularly in the context of white matter changes.

In marine mammals, CCDC194 expression is affected by bisphenol contaminants, specifically BPS, where it is downregulated. This downregulation occurs in conjunction with epinephrine, impacting gene expression related to critical cellular functions such as inflammation and DNA damage (Kashiwabara2023Effects). Although the exact function of CCDC194 in this context is unknown, its altered expression indicates a possible role in stress responses and environmental contaminant effects.

Following traumatic brain injury in Yucatan miniswine, CCDC194 is significantly upregulated, suggesting its involvement in the brain's response to injury. However, the specific clinical implications of this upregulation remain unclear, as the study focuses more on the general response to brain injury (Rai2024Transcriptional). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise clinical significance of CCDC194 in these and other conditions.
