# RMND5B

## Overview
RMND5B is a gene that encodes the protein required for meiotic nuclear division 5 homolog B, which is a crucial component of the human GID/CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression through its role in the ubiquitination and degradation of specific target proteins, such as the transcription factor Hbp1. RMND5B, along with its paralog RMND5A, forms part of the catalytic core of the complex, which is essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Lampert2018The). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (Maitland2022Structural). RMND5B's interactions with various ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes suggest its specificity in influencing polyubiquitin chain formation, which is vital for maintaining normal cell proliferation rates (Maitland2022Structural).

## Function
RMND5B is a component of the human GID/CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of specific proteins, such as the transcription factor Hbp1, which is a negative regulator of pro-proliferative genes. By targeting Hbp1 for degradation, the GID/CTLH complex prevents cell cycle exit in the G1 phase, thereby promoting cell proliferation (Lampert2018The).

The GID/CTLH complex, including RMND5B, is evolutionarily conserved and possesses inherent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. It uses Ube2H as its cognate E2 enzyme to facilitate the ubiquitination process (Lampert2018The). RMND5B, along with RMND5A, forms part of the catalytic core of the complex, which is essential for normal complex formation and catalysis (Lampert2018The).

RMND5B is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability and cellular homeostasis. The complex's activity is critical for maintaining normal cell proliferation rates, and its disruption can lead to deregulation of cell cycle markers and impaired cell proliferation (Maitland2022Structural; Lampert2018The).

## Interactions
RMND5B is a component of the human GID/CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in protein ubiquitination and degradation. Within this complex, RMND5B interacts with several other proteins, forming a stable and soluble heterodecameric unit with E3 ligase activity. RMND5B is part of the catalytic core of the complex, which includes RING proteins such as MAEA and either RMND5A or its paralog RMND5B. These proteins are essential for the normal formation and catalytic function of the complex (Lampert2018The).

RMND5B has been shown to interact with various ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), including UBE2D2, UBE2D3, UBE2D4, UBE2E1, UBE2E3, and UBE2W, but not with UBE2H. This suggests that RMND5B may have specific interactions with certain E2 enzymes, influencing the type of polyubiquitin chains generated by the complex (Maitland2022Structural).

The GID/CTLH complex, including RMND5B, is involved in targeting the transcription factor HBP1 for degradation, which is crucial for cell proliferation. The complex's interaction with HBP1 is regulated and involves other subunits such as RanBP9 and MAEA (Lampert2018The). RMND5B's role in these interactions highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein stability.
