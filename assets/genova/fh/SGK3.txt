# SGK3

## Overview
SGK3, or serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase family member 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various cellular processes. The SGK3 protein is a member of the AGC kinase family and is characterized by a conserved catalytic domain and a phox homology (PX) domain, which is essential for its localization and activation through phosphoinositide binding (Pokorny2021In). This kinase plays a crucial role in regulating cell survival, growth, proliferation, and migration by participating in signaling pathways activated by insulin and growth factors (Liao2022Contributions). SGK3 is involved in the regulation of ion channels and transporters, impacting cardiac function, neuronal excitability, and mineral homeostasis (Liao2022Contributions). Additionally, SGK3 has been implicated in cancer biology, where it can substitute for Akt in certain pathways, influencing tumor growth and survival (Bago2016The). Its interactions with various proteins and its role in endosomal trafficking underscore its significance in cellular signaling and potential as a therapeutic target (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics).

## Structure
SGK3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that shares structural similarities with other AGC kinases, featuring a conserved catalytic domain. The protein includes a phox homology (PX) domain, which is crucial for phosphoinositide binding, particularly phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). This domain influences SGK3's localization to PI3P-containing endosomes, which is essential for its activation (Pokorny2021In).

The PX domain of SGK3 is involved in allosteric regulation, where PI3P binding induces conformational changes necessary for activation. These changes are particularly significant in the PX domain, which interacts intramolecularly with the kinase domain (Pokorny2021In). The protein's autoinhibited state is characterized by a closed conformation, with the PI3P-binding site sequestered by intramolecular interactions (Pokorny2021In).

SGK3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific threonine and serine residues, which are critical for its activation. Phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is a key regulatory mechanism, although SGK3 requires both PI3P binding and phosphorylation for full activation (Pokorny2021In; KOBAYASHI1999Characterization).

## Function
SGK3 (serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase family member 3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell survival, growth, proliferation, and migration. It is activated by insulin and growth factors through signaling pathways involving phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) (Liao2022Contributions). SGK3 plays a significant role in regulating ion channels and transporters, such as enhancing the activity of potassium channels like Kir2.1 and hERG, which are crucial for cardiac function and neuronal excitability (Liao2022Contributions).

SGK3 also influences calcium and phosphate metabolism by regulating the expression of calcium channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 in the kidney, and phosphate transport proteins like Npt2a and Npt2b, which are essential for maintaining mineral homeostasis (Liao2022Contributions). In the context of cancer, SGK3 can substitute for Akt in phosphorylating TSC2, leading to mTORC1 activation, which is important for cell growth and proliferation (Bago2016The). SGK3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and endosomes, where it regulates endosomal trafficking and cellular stress responses (Basnet2021Mechanisms).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SGK3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, SGK3 is overexpressed, contributing to tumor survival, proliferation, and invasion. This overexpression is linked to increased levels of apoptosis-related gene bcl-xl and invasion-related genes mmp2 and mmp9, while decreasing the anti-apoptosis gene bad, suggesting its role in tumor development and aggression (SUN2016Serum).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SGK3 gene, such as rs77572541, rs11994200, and rs78158330, are associated with increased risk. These SNPs affect microRNA binding sites, potentially altering SGK3 expression and contributing to NPC development (Zheng2020Risk).

SGK3 mutations are also linked to autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, a condition characterized by renal phosphate wasting. A specific mutation, c.979-96T>A, leads to exon 13 skipping, resulting in a non-functional protein and contributing to the disease phenotype (Cebeci2019Mutation).

In prostate cancer, SGK3 is involved in cell survival pathways regulated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK1), highlighting its role in cancer cell viability (Nalairndran2020Phosphoinositide‐dependent).

## Interactions
SGK3 (serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase family member 3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It phosphorylates endosomal proteins such as Syntaxin-7 (STX7), Syntaxin-12 (STX12), RFIP4, and WDR44, enhancing their interactions with SNARE complexes and promoting plasma membrane localization (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics). SGK3 specifically phosphorylates STX7 at Ser126 and STX12 at Ser139, facilitating their binding to SNARE partners and impacting membrane fusion processes (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics).

SGK3 also interacts with the protein NEDD4-2, regulating its activity through phosphorylation. This interaction affects the activity of sodium-dependent phosphate transporters, enhancing phosphate absorption (Liao2022Contributions). Additionally, SGK3 phosphorylates WDR44 at Ser344, influencing its interaction with Rab11 and affecting ciliogenesis (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics).

SGK3 is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), which binds to its phox homology domain, leading to conformational changes necessary for its activation. This interaction is crucial for SGK3's role in cellular signaling pathways (Pokorny2021In). These interactions highlight SGK3's role in regulating various cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer.
