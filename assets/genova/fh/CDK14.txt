# CDK14

## Overview
CDK14, or cyclin-dependent kinase 14, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and Wnt signaling. The CDK14 protein, also referred to as cyclin-dependent kinase 14, is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in cell division and transcriptional regulation. It is ubiquitously expressed, with particularly high levels in the brain and testis, and is active during the G2-M phase of the cell cycle. CDK14 interacts with cyclins, such as Cyclin Y and Cyclin D3, to regulate the phosphorylation of key proteins involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby influencing cellular proliferation and differentiation. The kinase's involvement in both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways underscores its importance in developmental processes and disease pathogenesis, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Mikolcevic2012Orphan; Malumbres2014Cyclin-dependent; Ferguson2019Discovery).

## Function
CDK14 (cyclin-dependent kinase 14) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in cell cycle regulation and Wnt signaling. In healthy human cells, CDK14 is activated at the plasma membrane by Cyclin Y, which is N-myristoylated, facilitating its recruitment and activation. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of the Wnt co-receptor LRP5/LRP6, playing a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for transcription control, centrosome and kinetochore localization, mitotic spindle formation, and chromosome segregation (Mikolcevic2012Orphan; Malumbres2014Cyclin-dependent).

CDK14 is expressed ubiquitously, with high levels in the brain and testis, and is involved in regulating the cell cycle through interactions with Cyclin D3 and Cyclin Y. It is particularly active during the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, where it contributes to cell division processes (Mikolcevic2012Orphan; Pollack2015CDK14). The kinase is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating its involvement in various cellular signaling pathways and its potential role in tissue development and homeostasis (Mikolcevic2012Orphan; Ferguson2019Discovery).

## Clinical Significance
CDK14 (cyclin-dependent kinase 14) has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer, CDK14 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it phosphorylates LRP6, stabilizing β-catenin and promoting cancer progression (Ferguson2019Discovery). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), CDK14 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor survival outcomes. It promotes cell cycle progression and interacts with the CDK7/CCNH complex, enhancing cell proliferation and chemoresistance (Chen2019CDK14).

CDK14 also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). It is involved in the spread of α-Synuclein (α-Syn), a protein linked to synucleinopathy. Inhibition of CDK14 reduces α-Syn levels and pathology in human neurons and rodent models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for PD (Rousseaux2023Genetic; Parmasad2022Genetic). These findings highlight CDK14's significance in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
CDK14, also known as cyclin-dependent kinase 14, participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Cyclin Y to form a complex that phosphorylates LRP6, a transmembrane receptor involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. This phosphorylation occurs during the G2/M transition and primes LRP6 for further phosphorylation by GSK3 and CK1, stabilizing cytoplasmic β-catenin and activating Wnt signaling (Ferguson2019Discovery).

In the context of axon regeneration, CDK14 interacts with MIG-5/Disheveled (Dsh) and EPHX-1, a Rho-type GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). These interactions are part of a noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway that promotes axon regeneration. CDK14 activates EPHX-1 in a kinase-independent manner, which functions as a GEF for the CDC-42 GTPase, inhibiting myosin phosphatase and maintaining MLC-4 phosphorylation, crucial for axon regeneration (Hisamoto2021CDK14).

CDK14 also interacts with the SH3-containing domain of EPHX-1, disrupting its intramolecular binding and activating it. This interaction facilitates axon regeneration by modulating EPHX-1's interaction with CDC-42 (Hisamoto2021CDK14). Additionally, CDK14 is involved in the HYPAL/miR-431-5p/CDK14 axis in gastric cancer, where it is upregulated by HYPAL, promoting proliferation through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Piao2021Hypoxia).
