# PRR36

## Overview
PRR36 is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 36, which is characterized by a high content of proline residues. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. The proline-rich nature of the protein suggests a role in protein-protein interactions, potentially influencing cellular signaling pathways and structural configurations. While the precise biological roles and mechanisms of action of proline-rich protein 36 remain under investigation, it is hypothesized to participate in the regulation of cellular dynamics and may be implicated in certain pathological conditions. Further research is necessary to fully understand the implications of PRR36 expression and its potential interactions within the cellular environment.
