# ADSS2

## Overview
ADSS2, or adenylosuccinate synthase 2, is a gene that encodes the enzyme adenylosuccinate synthase 2, which is a key player in the purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a synthase and is primarily involved in the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to adenylosuccinate (S-AMP), a critical step in the synthesis of adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The activity of adenylosuccinate synthase 2 is essential for maintaining nucleotide homeostasis and energy metabolism within cells. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the purine nucleotide cycle, a vital pathway for nucleotide synthesis required for various cellular functions (Gooding2015Adenylosuccinate).

## Function
ADSS2 (adenylosuccinate synthase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in purine nucleotide biosynthesis, specifically catalyzing the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to adenylosuccinate (S-AMP). This reaction is a key step in the synthesis of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is essential for maintaining nucleotide homeostasis and energy metabolism in cells (Gooding2015Adenylosuccinate). ADSS2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm of cells, where it contributes to the purine nucleotide cycle, a crucial pathway for the synthesis of nucleotides required for various cellular processes (Gooding2015Adenylosuccinate).

In pancreatic beta cells, ADSS2 is involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The enzyme's activity leads to increased levels of S-AMP, which acts as an insulin secretagogue, enhancing insulin granule exocytosis. This suggests that ADSS2 plays a significant role in regulating insulin secretion in response to glucose, serving as a glucose-induced amplifying signal for insulin secretion (Gooding2015Adenylosuccinate). The suppression of ADSS2 can impair GSIS, but this effect can be reversed by adenine supplementation, which restores S-AMP, ADP, and ATP levels, highlighting its importance in maintaining adenine nucleotide pools (Gooding2015Adenylosuccinate).
