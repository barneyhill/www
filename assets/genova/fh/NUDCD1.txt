# NUDCD1

## Overview
NUDCD1 (NudC domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the NudC protein family, which is characterized by a conserved p23 domain known for its chaperone activity. The protein encoded by NUDCD1, also referred to as CML66 or OVA66, plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, cell migration, and intracellular transport. It is involved in the stabilization of microtubules, which is crucial for proper mitotic spindle function and accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Fu2016Emerging; AsselinMullen2017Protein). NUDCD1 is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with its expression being limited in normal tissues but notably upregulated in various cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression (He2020NudCD1; Feng2022NudCD1). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct subcellular localizations and interaction partners, which may contribute to its diverse roles in cellular processes (AsselinMullen2017Protein).

## Structure
The NUDCD1 protein, also known as NudCD1, CML66, or OVA66, is part of the NudC protein family, which includes NudC, NudCL, NudCL2, and NudCD1. These proteins share a conserved p23 domain that provides chaperone activity (AsselinMullen2017Protein). The NUDCD1 gene consists of 12 exons and undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in three isoforms with a common C-terminus of 492 amino acids and isoform-specific N-termini (AsselinMullen2017Protein). 

Isoform 1 includes exons 1 and 3, isoform 2 includes exons 2 and 3, and isoform 3 includes exons 1, 3, and 4, with a unique start site in exon 4 (AsselinMullen2017Protein). These isoforms exhibit distinct subcellular localizations: isoform 1 is nuclear, isoform 2 is both cytoplasmic and nuclear, and isoform 3 is predominantly cytoplasmic (AsselinMullen2017Protein). A nuclear localization signal (NLS) is present in isoform 1, and its mutation results in cytoplasmic localization, confirming its role in nuclear targeting (AsselinMullen2017Protein).

The protein interacts with β-propeller fold proteins, including COPI complex proteins and DEAD/DEAH box helicases, which are involved in cellular trafficking and nucleic acid transactions (AsselinMullen2017Protein). The expression and stability of these isoforms can be influenced by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting differences in stability and degradation (AsselinMullen2017Protein).

## Function
NUDCD1 (NudC domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, NUDCD1 is part of the NudC protein family, which includes proteins that share a conserved p23 domain with chaperone activity. This family is involved in various cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation, cell migration, and intracellular transport (Fu2016Emerging).

NUDCD1 is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its protein product is associated with the regulation of the mitotic spindle, playing a role in stabilizing microtubules. This stabilization is crucial for proper cell cycle progression and mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (AsselinMullen2017Protein). The protein's involvement in these processes is supported by its interaction with other proteins related to mRNA processing and intracellular processes, highlighting its multifaceted role in cell biology (AsselinMullen2017Protein).

The gene's expression is limited in normal tissues, primarily found in the heart and testis, suggesting a specialized function in these organs. The alternative splicing of NUDCD1 results in different isoforms, each with distinct subcellular localizations and interaction partners, which may imply diverse roles in cellular processes (AsselinMullen2017Protein).

## Clinical Significance
NUDCD1 (NudC domain containing 1) is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high NUDCD1 expression correlates with shorter survival times, with patients exhibiting high expression having a mean survival time of 13.8 months compared to 22.9 months for those with low expression. This suggests that NUDCD1 may promote CRC progression by upregulating pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA replication (Feng2022NudCD1).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NUDCD1 is significantly upregulated and associated with advanced T stage and lymph node metastasis. Its overexpression activates the IGF1R-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, promoting proliferation and metastasis, while knockdown of NUDCD1 inhibits these processes (He2020NudCD1).

NUDCD1 is also linked to poor survival outcomes in tongue cancer, particularly in advanced stages and in patients with perineural invasion. It is associated with overall and disease-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker in this cancer type (Reddy2019Molecular).

The gene's expression is further associated with immune infiltration and drug sensitivity in various cancers, suggesting its role in influencing treatment responses (Han2022Identifying).

## Interactions
NUDCD1, also known as CML66 or OVA66, is a protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, influencing several cellular processes. It is part of the NudC protein family and is overexpressed in several cancers, where it is associated with the Insulin Growth Factor -1 Receptor (IGF-1R) pathway (AsselinMullen2017Protein). NUDCD1 can be alternatively spliced into three isoforms, each with distinct interaction partners and subcellular localizations. Isoform 1, which is primarily nuclear, interacts strongly with DHX15, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This interaction was validated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (AsselinMullen2017Protein).

NUDCD1 proteins are also associated with proteins involved in the dissociation of U snRNPs from the lariat-intron complex, such as hPrp43 and TFIP11, which are post-splicing factors (AsselinMullen2017Protein). The NudC family proteins, including NUDCD1, specifically associate with β-propeller fold proteins, such as Coat Protein I (COPI) complex proteins and DEAD/DEAH box helicases, which are involved in cellular trafficking, autophagy, cell death, and nucleic acid transactions (AsselinMullen2017Protein). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of NUDCD1 in cellular processes and its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy.
