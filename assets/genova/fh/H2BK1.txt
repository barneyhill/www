# H2BK1

## Overview
H2BK1 is a gene that encodes the H2B.K variant histone 1 protein, which is integral to chromatin structure and function. As a variant histone, H2B.K is involved in the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, thereby influencing chromatin organization and impacting key cellular processes such as gene expression regulation, DNA repair, and replication (Seal2022A). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in chromatin dynamics, affecting cell cycle progression and differentiation. Despite its critical functions, the specific molecular activities of the H2B.K protein variant remain to be fully elucidated (Seal2022A). The evolutionary conservation of the H2BK1 gene across a wide range of species, including mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles, underscores its biological significance (Seal2022A). Additionally, H2BK1 has been identified as a potential biomarker in bladder cancer, highlighting its clinical relevance (Rimmer2021Extracellular).

## Function
The H2BK1 gene encodes a variant histone protein that plays a significant role in chromatin structure and function. This protein is involved in the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, which are the fundamental units of chromatin. By influencing the organization of chromatin, H2BK1 impacts gene expression regulation, DNA repair, and replication processes (Seal2022A). The H2BK1 protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to chromatin dynamics, affecting cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. The gene is composed of two exons, with the coding sequence for the histone fold domain split by an intron, a structure similar to that of the H2BN1 gene, although phylogenetic analysis does not support a common origin for these two variants (Seal2022A).

Despite its importance in chromatin-related functions, the specific protein variant H2B.K encoded by H2BK1 has not been experimentally determined, and its precise molecular activities remain to be fully elucidated (Seal2022A). The gene is present in a wide range of species, including mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles, indicating its evolutionary conservation and potential significance across different organisms (Seal2022A).

## Clinical Significance
H2BK1 has been identified as a potential biomarker in bladder cancer. It is found within extracellular vesicles (EVs) and has shown promise in both prognostic and diagnostic applications. Specifically, the presence of H2BK1 in combination with alpha 1-antitrypsin in EVs can distinguish bladder cancer patients from controls with a sensitivity of 62.7% and specificity of 87.59% (Rimmer2021Extracellular). This suggests that alterations in the expression of H2BK1 may be significant in the context of bladder cancer, potentially impacting disease diagnosis and progression.

While the context does not provide specific information on mutations in H2BK1, its role in cancer suggests that changes in its expression or interactions could influence chromatin dynamics and cellular processes such as DNA repair and transcription. These alterations may contribute to cancer progression by affecting cellular checkpoints and enabling tumor cells to evade normal regulatory mechanisms (Rimmer2021Extracellular). The study of H2BK1 in EVs highlights its potential as a target for developing diagnostic panels and understanding the mechanisms underlying bladder cancer. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance and potential therapeutic applications.
