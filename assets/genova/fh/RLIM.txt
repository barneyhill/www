# RLIM

## Overview
The RLIM gene, also known as RNF12, encodes the RING finger protein, LIM domain interacting, which is a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, RLIM is involved in tagging specific proteins for degradation, thereby regulating various cellular processes, including transcription factor modulation, signaling pathways, and chromatin dynamics. It is particularly significant in processes such as X-chromosome inactivation and telomere length regulation. Mutations in the RLIM gene have been linked to Tonne-Kalscheuer Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, underscoring its importance in normal cognitive and developmental functions (Frints2018Pathogenic; EspejoSerrano2023Specific; Cuinat2024Extending).

## Function
The RLIM gene, also known as RNF12, encodes a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, RLIM is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of transcription factors and signaling pathways. It targets proteins such as SMAD7, a negative regulator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, for ubiquitination, thereby influencing embryonic stem cell fate and morphogenesis (Frints2018Pathogenic).

RLIM is also implicated in X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by targeting the XCI inhibitor REX1 for degradation, which is crucial for the initiation of XCI (Frints2018Pathogenic; EspejoSerrano2023Specific). It regulates telomere length homeostasis by promoting the ubiquitination of TRF1 and influences cell proliferation through the degradation of stathmin (Frints2018Pathogenic). RLIM's activity is significant in the nucleus, where it targets nuclear proteins for ubiquitination, often leading to their degradation by the 26S proteasome (Wang2019RlimRnf12). These functions highlight RLIM's role in normal development, cognition, behavior, and various cellular processes in healthy human cells (Frints2018Pathogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RLIM gene, also known as RNF12, are associated with Tonne-Kalscheuer Syndrome (TOKAS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and congenital anomalies such as diaphragmatic hernia and disorders of sexual development (Bustos2021A; Cuinat2024Extending). Specific missense variants, such as p.(Arg611Cys) and p.(Tyr421Cys), have been identified as pathogenic, disrupting the gene's ubiquitin ligase activity, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation (Bustos2021A; Cuinat2024Extending). These variants can lead to severe phenotypes, including perinatal lethality in some cases (Bustos2021A).

RLIM is also considered a dosage-sensitive gene, with duplications in the Xq13 region linked to mild intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and distinct facial features in hemizygous males (Palmer2020RLIM). Increased RLIM expression due to gene duplications can result in neurocognitive abnormalities, while missense variants may lead to reduced protein levels and altered ubiquitin ligase activity (Palmer2020RLIM). These findings highlight the gene's critical role in neurodevelopment and its potential impact on various developmental disorders.

## Interactions
RLIM, also known as RNF12, is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. It interacts with the pluripotency factor Rex1, leading to its polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, which is essential for the activation of Xist transcription and initiation of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) (Wang2019RlimRnf12). RLIM also targets several nuclear proteins for degradation, including transcriptional coregulators and other E3 ligases like Mdm2 (Wang2019RlimRnf12).

RLIM interacts with LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription factors and their cofactors, such as CLIM, by recruiting the Sin3A/histone deacetylase corepressor complex or targeting cofactors for degradation (Frints2018Pathogenic). It is involved in the proteasomal degradation of the CLIM protein through polyubiquitination, although this interaction can be inhibited by SSDP1, which protects CLIM from degradation (Güngör2007Proteasomal).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, RLIM is crucial for the ubiquitylation of REX1 on chromatin, with its catalytic activity being necessary for this process. The basic region (BR) of RLIM is important for its chromatin recruitment, while the N-terminal region negatively regulates this association (EspejoSerrano2024Chromatin).
