# PSMD12

## Overview
PSMD12 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 12, a crucial component of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome complex. This protein is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for the targeted degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis within eukaryotic cells. As a non-ATPase subunit, PSMD12 plays a pivotal role in the recognition and processing of substrates, facilitating their unfolding and translocation into the 20S core for degradation. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis, by ensuring the removal of damaged or unnecessary proteins (Xuan2021Prognostic; Du2020PSMD12). PSMD12's function is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is implicated in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, where its expression levels can significantly impact disease progression and prognosis (Larsson2022Pancancer; Küry2017De).

## Function
The PSMD12 gene encodes a non-ATPase subunit of the 19S regulator of the 26S proteasome complex, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis in eukaryotic cells. This complex is responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process crucial for regulating the cell cycle, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis (Du2020PSMD12). PSMD12 is involved in the regulatory complex of the proteasome, contributing to the unfolding and translocation of substrates into the 20S core for degradation (Xuan2021Prognostic). 

In healthy human cells, PSMD12 plays a significant role in cellular processes by ensuring the degradation of proteins that are no longer needed or are potentially harmful, thus maintaining cellular proteostasis (Du2020PSMD12). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cellular functions and organismal health by ensuring proper protein degradation and recycling. This activity is vital for various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and stress responses (Larsson2022Pancancer). The proteasome, including PSMD12, is crucial for the regulation of protein turnover, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PSMD12 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. In neurodevelopmental disorders, PSMD12 mutations, including de novo nonsense mutations, have been linked to intellectual disability, congenital malformations, and features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Khalil2018PSMD12; Küry2017De). These mutations often result in reduced PSMD12 protein levels, leading to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, although the proteasome's catalytic activity remains unaffected (Küry2017De). The gene's haploinsufficiency is a likely pathogenic mechanism, as a single functional copy is insufficient for normal function (Küry2017De).

In cancer, PSMD12 is frequently overexpressed in various types, including breast cancer, where its high expression is associated with poor prognosis (Larsson2022Pancancer; Du2020PSMD12). PSMD12 promotes cancer growth by inhibiting the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, thereby reducing apoptosis and enhancing cell proliferation and migration (Du2020PSMD12). Its expression patterns serve as important prognostic indicators in cancer, affecting overall survival and progression-free intervals in multiple cancer types (Larsson2022Pancancer). These findings highlight the critical role of PSMD12 in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer pathogenesis.

## Interactions
PSMD12, a non-ATPase subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome, plays a crucial role in protein degradation by interacting with other proteasome subunits. It is involved in the assembly and structural integrity of the proteasome complex, particularly in substrate recognition and deubiquitination processes (Küry2017De). PSMD12 is integrated into the proteasome and the COP9 signalosome (CSN) through its C-terminal portion of the PCI domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions (Küry2017De).

The protein is part of a network of interactions within the 19S regulatory particle, which includes other non-ATPase subunits. These interactions are critical for the proteasome's function in recognizing and processing ubiquitinated proteins (Davy2001A). Although specific interaction partners of PSMD12 are not detailed in the provided context, its role within the proteasome complex suggests it interacts with various subunits to facilitate the degradation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins (Küry2017De).

PSMD12's involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system highlights its importance in maintaining protein homeostasis, which is crucial for cellular regulation and signaling (Khalil2018PSMD12).
