# CGB7

## Overview
The CGB7 gene encodes the chorionic gonadotropin subunit beta 7, a component of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, which is a glycoprotein crucial for reproductive processes. This gene is part of a family of genes that encode the beta subunits of hCG, with CGB7 being distinguished by its unique amino acid sequence and glycosylation patterns. The protein product of CGB7, when combined with the common alpha subunit, forms a heterodimeric hormone that plays a vital role in early pregnancy by supporting the corpus luteum and promoting progesterone production. CGB7 is specifically expressed in the secretory endometrium, contributing to endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation. Its expression is regulated by transcription factors such as p53, linking it to broader physiological processes beyond pregnancy, including potential roles in immune modulation and angiogenesis (Biskup2020N; Zimmermann2012Expression; Sohr2011The).

## Structure
The CGB7 gene encodes a variant of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a glycoprotein hormone. The primary structure of the CGB7 protein is characterized by a specific amino acid sequence that is largely similar to those encoded by the CGB3, CGB5, and CGB8 genes, with CGB7 differing by three amino acids (Biskup2020N). The secondary structure of hCG beta subunits typically includes alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details for CGB7 are not provided in the available context.

The tertiary structure of the hCG beta subunit involves the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide chain, which is stabilized by disulfide bonds. These structural features are crucial for the proper folding and function of the hormone. The quaternary structure of hCG involves the association of the beta subunit with the common alpha subunit to form the active heterodimeric hormone (Nagirnaja2012Structural).

Post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation, play a significant role in the stability and function of the CGB7 protein. The glycosylation patterns of CGB7 include N- and O-glycans, with CGB7 exhibiting slightly more core 1-type O-glycans and less core 2-type O-glycans compared to CGB3/5/8 (Biskup2020N).

## Function
The CGB7 gene encodes a subunit of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, which plays a crucial role in human reproduction. hCG is essential for the establishment and maintenance of early pregnancy, supporting the survival of the corpus luteum and promoting progesterone production. CGB7 is specifically expressed in the secretory endometrium, where it contributes to the preparation of the endometrium for embryo implantation, indicating its role in endometrial receptivity (Zimmermann2012Expression; Sohr2011The).

CGB7 expression is regulated by several transcription factors, including p53, which directly induces its expression. This regulation suggests a link between p53 activity and human reproduction, highlighting CGB7's involvement in hCG function during early pregnancy (Sohr2011The). The CGB7 subunit is also involved in the production of a unique heterodimeric hCG molecule in the endometrium, distinct from placental hCG, and may play a role in immune modulation and angiogenesis at the implantation site (Zimmermann2012Expression).

CGB7's expression in non-trophoblastic tissues, such as the breast, lung, and prostate, suggests its broader role beyond pregnancy, potentially influencing other physiological processes (Zimmermann2012Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CGB7 gene have been implicated in various reproductive disorders and conditions. The CGB7 subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is crucial for preparing the endometrium for embryo implantation, and its expression is specifically induced by the tumor suppressor p53. This regulation suggests a potential link between CGB7 expression and fertility, as variations in the p53 pathway have been associated with reduced fertility (Sohr2011The). 

The differential regulation of CGB7 compared to other CGB isoforms may indicate functional differences that could impact reproductive health. For instance, CGB7 is uniquely expressed in the secretory endometrium, unlike other CGB genes, which are more commonly associated with placental tissues (Zimmermann2012Expression). This specific expression pattern suggests that CGB7 could serve as a marker for endometrial receptivity and implantation success, potentially aiding in the diagnosis of fertility issues (Zimmermann2012Expression).

Additionally, the unique glycosylation patterns and regulatory mechanisms of CGB7, particularly its induction by p53, may influence its role in certain tissues or conditions, although the exact clinical implications require further investigation (Biskup2020N).

## Interactions
The CGB7 protein, a subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), is involved in forming heterodimeric hCG by non-covalently interacting with the alpha subunit (CGA) (Biskup2020N; Zimmermann2012Expression). This interaction is crucial for the biological activity of hCG, which is essential for pregnancy maintenance. The CGB7 subunit, when combined with CGA, activates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway via the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR), indicating its role in signal transduction (Biskup2020N).

CGB7 expression is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, which binds to specific response elements in the CGB7 promoter, a feature not shared with other CGB variants (Biskup2020N; Sohr2011The). This regulation suggests a unique transcriptional control mechanism for CGB7, potentially influencing its expression in various tissues, including the endometrium and decidua (Biskup2020N). Despite these insights, specific physical interactions of the CGB7 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its role in forming heterodimeric hCG are not detailed in the available literature (Zimmermann2012Expression).
