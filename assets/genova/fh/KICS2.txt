# KICS2

## Overview
KICS2 is a gene that encodes the KICSTOR subunit 2, a component of the KICSTOR complex, which plays a critical role in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. The KICSTOR subunit 2 protein is involved in cellular processes such as growth, metabolism, and proliferation by modulating mTORC1 activity. As a regulatory protein, it is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to nutrient availability. Dysregulation of KICS2 can lead to significant clinical implications, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and metabolic diseases, due to its impact on mTORC1 signaling (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation in the KICS2 gene, which encodes the KICSTOR subunit 2, can significantly impact mTORC1 signaling. This pathway is crucial for regulating cell growth and metabolism. Alterations in KICS2 expression or function can lead to various pathological conditions. For instance, dysregulation of mTORC1 activity due to KICS2 mutations may contribute to the development of cancer by promoting uncontrolled cellular growth and proliferation. Additionally, neurodevelopmental disorders may arise from impaired mTORC1 signaling, as this pathway is essential for proper brain development and function. Metabolic diseases are also potential outcomes of KICS2 dysregulation, given the role of mTORC1 in cellular metabolism. These conditions highlight the clinical significance of maintaining proper KICS2 function to ensure normal cellular processes and prevent disease.
