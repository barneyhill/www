# UCK2

## Overview
Uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme uridine-cytidine kinase 2, a crucial component of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. This enzyme is classified as a kinase due to its role in catalyzing the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to their respective monophosphate forms, utilizing ATP as a phosphate donor. UCK2 is predominantly expressed in the placenta and testis, but its expression is notably upregulated in various cancer types, where it contributes to the activation of nucleoside analogs used in chemotherapy. The enzyme's structure includes a homotetrameric assembly essential for its function, with a well-defined active site that facilitates substrate specificity and catalysis. UCK2's interactions with key signaling pathways, such as mTOR and STAT3, underscore its involvement in both metabolic and non-metabolic cellular processes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Van2001Phosphorylation; Fu2022The; Wu2019Uridine‐cytidine).

## Structure
Uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) is a key enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, responsible for phosphorylating uridine and cytidine to their respective monophosphates. The primary structure of UCK2 consists of a sequence of 261 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 29 kDa (Van2001Phosphorylation). The secondary structure includes a core five-stranded parallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices, with additional alpha-helices capping the structure. A large beta-hairpin loop is also present near the active site (Fu2022The).

The tertiary structure of UCK2 features an active site located between these structural elements, with key residues such as His117 and Tyr112 playing crucial roles in nucleoside binding specificity. His117 is particularly important for uridine phosphorylation, while Asp84 and Arg166 ensure ribonucleoside selectivity through hydrogen bonding with the ribose moiety (Fu2022The). A magnesium ion, coordinated by Asp62, Ser34, and Glu135, acts as a cofactor in the active site (Fu2022The).

UCK2 functions as a homotetramer, indicating a quaternary structure composed of four identical subunits (van2016The). This multimeric assembly is essential for its enzymatic activity and regulation. UCK2 is subject to feedback inhibition by UTP and CTP, which modulate its activity in response to cellular nucleotide levels (Fu2022The).

## Function
UCK2 (uridine-cytidine kinase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, which is an energy-efficient method for nucleotide synthesis. It catalyzes the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to their respective monophosphate forms, using ATP as the phosphate donor. This reaction is essential for the production of pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates, which are necessary for RNA and DNA synthesis during gene replication (Tomoike2017Indispensable; Yu2018UCK2).

UCK2 is primarily expressed in the placenta and testis in normal human tissues, indicating a specialized role in these tissues (Van2001Phosphorylation; Wu2019Uridine‐cytidine). The enzyme is located in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to nucleotide metabolism and supports cell proliferation and growth (van2016The). UCK2's activity is particularly significant in the context of cancer, as it is often overexpressed in tumor cells, enhancing the activation of nucleoside analogs used in chemotherapy (van2016The; Wu2019Uridine‐cytidine). This overexpression in cancer cells suggests that UCK2 may be a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Clinical Significance
UCK2 (uridine-cytidine kinase 2) is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its role in the pyrimidine salvage pathway. Overexpression of UCK2 is observed in several cancer types, including lung, breast, ovarian, colorectal, neuroblastoma, pancreatic, and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), as well as Burkitt lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Fu2022The). In lung cancer, UCK2 is notably overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is associated with poorer overall survival, particularly in smokers (Wu2019Uridine‐cytidine). In HCC, UCK2 upregulation correlates with poor prognosis and aggressive clinicopathological features, serving as an independent prognostic marker for overall survival and recurrence-free survival (Cai2020Nonmetabolic; Yu2018UCK2).

UCK2 also plays a role in breast cancer, where its overexpression is linked to negative estrogen receptor status and advanced tumor grade, correlating with poor overall survival and disease-free survival (Shen2017Overexpression). The gene's overexpression is associated with the activation of oncogenic pathways such as STAT3 and EGFR-AKT, promoting tumor progression and metastasis (Fu2022The). Targeting UCK2 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy, with inhibitors like WP1066, erlotinib, and gefitinib showing promise in cancer treatment (Fu2022The).

## Interactions
UCK2 (uridine-cytidine kinase 2) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cellular processes. UCK2 directly interacts with mTOR, a key component of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, as confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation studies. This interaction is significant for promoting cell cycle progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Wu2022Targeting). UCK2 also maintains the stability of PDPK1 mRNA, which is involved in the AKT signaling pathway, highlighting its role as an RNA-binding protein and its involvement in post-transcriptional regulation (Wu2022Targeting).

In the context of cancer progression, UCK2 interacts with the STAT3 signaling pathway. It upregulates phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), which is associated with increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP9) and changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, facilitating cancer cell migration and invasion (Zhou2018Uridinecytidine). UCK2 also interacts with EGFR, preventing EGF-induced EGFR ubiquitination and degradation, thereby activating the EGFR-AKT pathway and promoting tumor progression (Fu2022The).

These interactions underscore UCK2's role in both metabolic and non-metabolic pathways, contributing to its oncogenic functions and potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
