# NXPE3

## Overview
NXPE3 is a gene that encodes the protein neurexophilin and PC-esterase domain family member 3, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system. The protein is categorized as a member of the neurexophilin and PC-esterase domain family and plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, especially in neural contexts. It interacts with α-neurexins to facilitate adhesion between dendrites and axons, which is vital for neural development and repair mechanisms (Gong2022Spatiotemporal). Additionally, NXPE3 is implicated in oncogenic processes, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, where it participates in enhancer-promoter loops that regulate gene expression (Zhang2020Integrative). The gene's expression levels have prognostic significance in multiple myeloma, suggesting its potential as a biomarker in cancer (Kumari2021Prognostic). Furthermore, NXPE3 is involved in neurodevelopmental processes, with its expression potentially influenced by environmental factors such as nicotine and alcohol exposure during the perinatal period (Kazemi2020Investigating).

## Clinical Significance
NXPE3 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although its specific role in disease remains under investigation. In multiple myeloma, low expression of NXPE3 is associated with a poorer prognosis, with patients exhibiting lower expression levels having a median overall survival of 76 months compared to 96 months for those with higher expression levels (Kumari2021Prognostic). This suggests that NXPE3 expression levels could serve as a prognostic marker in this type of cancer.

In lung adenocarcinoma, NXPE3 is involved in structural variations, particularly enhancer-promoter loops on chromosome 3, which are significant in tumor development. These structural variations are associated with tumor-related pathways, including cell proliferation and transcription regulation (Zhang2020Integrative). The gene's location on chromosome 3, frequently altered in lung cancer, further supports its potential involvement in cancer-associated functions.

NXPE3 is also linked to neurodevelopmental processes. Alterations in its expression, particularly in the context of nicotine-alcohol exposure during the perinatal period, may affect neural migration and connectivity, potentially leading to neuropsychiatric conditions (Kazemi2020Investigating). These findings highlight the gene's potential impact on brain development and its association with neurological disorders.

## Interactions
NXPE3, a member of the neurexophilin and PC-esterase domain family, is involved in various cellular interactions, particularly in cell adhesion processes. It is known to bind α-neurexins, which are crucial for promoting adhesion between dendrites and axons. This interaction is significant in the context of neural development and repair, as it facilitates the formation of temporary bridges between injury sites, such as those observed in spinal cord injuries (Gong2022Spatiotemporal). 

In the context of perinatal nicotine and alcohol exposure, NXPE3 is predicted to be targeted by miR-26b, a microRNA that influences genetic profiles in dopaminergic neurons. This interaction suggests a role for NXPE3 in neural migration and connections during neurodevelopmental processes, potentially affecting brain structure and function (Kazemi2020Investigating).

Additionally, NXPE3 is implicated in structural variations within lung adenocarcinoma tissues, where it is part of enhancer-promoter loops on chromosome 3. These loops are important for gene regulation in cancer, indicating that NXPE3 may play a role in oncogenic processes through its involvement in chromatin loop structures (Zhang2020Integrative). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving NXPE3 in these contexts are not detailed in the available literature.
