# FLOT2

## Overview
FLOT2 is a gene that encodes the protein flotillin 2, a membrane-associated protein involved in the formation of lipid rafts, which are specialized microdomains within the plasma membrane. Flotillin 2 is categorized as a scaffolding protein and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization (Sasaki2008Identification; GauthierRouvière2020Flotillin). The protein is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wei2013Flotillin2). Flotillin 2 is known to form heterodimers with flotillin 1, and these complexes are involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis and other cellular functions (Singh2022Crosslinking). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it is often upregulated and associated with poor prognosis (Wen2015Flot2; GauthierRouvière2020Flotillin).

## Structure
Flotillin 2 (FLOT2) is a membrane-associated protein characterized by its involvement in forming microdomains within the cell membrane. The molecular structure of FLOT2 includes a cluster of beta-sheets at the N-terminus, an extended α-helical region in the middle, and a C-terminal coiled-coil structure (Singh2022Crosslinkinga; Singh2022Crosslinking). The N-terminal region contains SPFH domains, which consist of antiparallel β-sheets and partially exposed α-helices, forming a globular domain (Singh2022Crosslinking). 

FLOT2 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including S-palmitoylation and N-myristoylation, which are crucial for its membrane association. Tyrosine phosphorylation sites are also present, playing a significant role in endocytosis and protein interactions (Singh2022Crosslinkinga). 

In terms of quaternary structure, FLOT2 forms heterodimers with flotillin 1 (FLOT1) in a 1:1 stoichiometry, and these heterodimers can assemble into higher-order structures, such as tetramers and larger oligomers exceeding 1 MDa (Singh2022Crosslinkinga; Singh2022Crosslinking). These assemblies are involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis and are localized at the plasma membrane and lysosomes (Singh2022Crosslinking).

## Function
Flotillin 2 (FLOT2) is a protein that plays a significant role in the formation and function of lipid rafts, which are specialized microdomains in the plasma membrane. These lipid rafts are involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization (Sasaki2008Identification; GauthierRouvière2020Flotillin). FLOT2 is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in cellular functions (Wei2013Flotillin2).

In healthy human cells, FLOT2 is involved in modulating apoptosis, particularly by interacting with the Fas signaling pathway. It prevents the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and suppresses caspase-8 mediated extrinsic apoptosis, thereby conferring cytoprotection (Wei2013Flotillin2). FLOT2 also regulates mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis by controlling the Bcl-2 family and inhibiting cytochrome C release from mitochondria (Wei2013Flotillin2).

FLOT2 is active in various cellular locations, including the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. It forms hetero-oligomers with flotillin 1, creating flotillin platforms distinct from those scaffolded by caveolins (GauthierRouvière2020Flotillin). These platforms are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating processes like endocytosis and signal transduction (GauthierRouvière2020Flotillin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FLOT2 gene, which encodes the protein Flotillin-2, have been implicated in various cancers. Flotillin-2 is frequently upregulated in several types of cancer, including breast, cervical, gastric, and non-small-cell lung cancers, and this overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Wen2015Flot2; GauthierRouvière2020Flotillin). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, high Flotillin-2 expression is significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for metastatic progression (Wen2014Increased).

In gastric cancer, Flotillin-2 plays a crucial role in the transport of Wnt3 via cytonemes, which are essential for cancer cell proliferation and the maintenance of cancer stem cells. This mechanism is linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis, indicating that Flotillin-2 is a key player in the dissemination of Wnt signaling molecules in tumor tissues (Routledge2022The).

Flotillin-2 also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, influencing EGFR activation and degradation. Alterations in Flotillin-2 expression can impact EGFR-related signaling pathways, which are often implicated in cancer progression (Wisniewski2022Flotillin2).

## Interactions
Flotillin 2 (FLOT2) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, FLOT2 interacts with several proteins at the plasma membrane, including plasma membrane ATPase 1 (AHA1), early-responsive to dehydration stress protein 4 (ERD4), hypersensitive-induced response protein 2 (HIR2), harpin-induced protein-like 3 (NHL3), and syntaxin-71 (SYP71). These interactions suggest FLOT2's involvement in plant defense mechanisms and responses to environmental stresses (Junková2018Mapping).

In human cells, FLOT2 interacts with EphA2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, in gliomas. This interaction stabilizes EphA2, promoting tumor growth and invasion by inhibiting apoptosis and inducing cell cycle progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The interaction between FLOT2 and EphA2 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting its role in maintaining EphA2 stability and contributing to the malignant characteristics of glioma cells (Song2021FLOT2).

FLOT2 also forms heterooligomers with FLOT1, and these complexes interact with GNB4, indicating the presence of interaction hotspots within specific regions of the proteins (Singh2022Crosslinkinga). These interactions underscore FLOT2's role in various cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.
