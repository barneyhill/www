# CCDC117

## Overview
CCDC117 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 117 protein, which is involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA metabolism and cell proliferation. The protein is characterized by a coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and is highly conserved among placental mammals, underscoring its potential biological significance (Horton2019Nkx2–5). CCDC117 interacts with components of the MMS19 cellular iron-sulfur cluster assembly targeting complex, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of DNA synthesis and repair (Horton2019Nkx2–5). The gene is also a target of the cardiac transcription factor Nkx2-5, implicating it in heart development, particularly in the outflow tract and right ventricle (Horton2019Nkx2–5). Additionally, alterations in CCDC117 expression have been associated with epithelial ovarian cancer, suggesting its involvement in oncogenic processes (Lawrenson2015Common). Despite these insights, further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific mechanisms and clinical implications of CCDC117.

## Structure
The CCDC117 protein is predicted to be composed of 277 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 30.4 kDa. It is strongly conserved among placental mammals, indicating its potential importance in these species (Horton2019Nkx2–5). The primary structure of CCDC117 does not contain any recognizable conserved functional domains, except for a region between amino acids 141-170 in mice, which is highly likely to form a coiled-coil structure. Coiled-coil domains are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role for CCDC117 in such interactions (Horton2019Nkx2–5).

The protein has been shown to interact with several other proteins involved in various cellular processes, including nuclear and mitotic spindle localization, metal binding, and mitochondrial activity. Notably, CCDC117 interacts with MIP18/Fam96B/CIA2B, a component of the MMS19 cellular iron-sulfur cluster assembly targeting complex, indicating its involvement in DNA metabolism and cell proliferation (Horton2019Nkx2–5). Despite these functional insights, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CCDC117 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
CCDC117 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in DNA metabolism and cell proliferation. The protein is a target of the cardiac transcription factor Nkx2-5, which is crucial for heart development, particularly in the outflow tract and right ventricle (Horton2019Nkx2–5). CCDC117 interacts with the MMS19 complex, which is involved in the cytosolic transport and transfer of iron-sulfur clusters, essential cofactors for enzymes regulating DNA synthesis and repair (Horton2019Nkx2–5). This interaction suggests that CCDC117 plays a critical role in maintaining DNA synthesis and repair, as well as cell cycle progression (Horton2019Nkx2–5).

In HeLa cells, knockdown of CCDC117 expression results in decreased S-phase DNA synthesis, increased DNA damage, and inhibition of cell cycle progression, leading to reduced cell proliferation (Horton2019Nkx2–5). The protein localizes to the mitotic spindle during M-phase and to nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments during interphase, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation (Horton2019Nkx2–5). The loss of CCDC117 expression can lead to cell cycle delays and increased apoptosis, highlighting its importance in cellular processes related to DNA metabolism and proliferation (Horton2019Nkx2–5).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC117 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations or alterations are not well-documented. Alterations in CCDC117 expression have been associated with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Increased expression of CCDC117, along with other genes, has been observed in ovarian epithelial cells undergoing early-stage neoplastic transformation, suggesting its potential role in the early development of EOC (Lawrenson2015Common). Additionally, eQTL analyses have identified associations between specific SNPs and CCDC117 expression, indicating that genetic variants may influence its expression and contribute to EOC risk (Lawrenson2015Common).

In the context of heart development, CCDC117 is a target of the Nkx2-5 transcription factor, which is crucial for cardiac morphogenesis. Alterations in CCDC117 expression, particularly in Nkx2-5 knockout models, lead to defects in DNA metabolism and cell cycle regulation, contributing to morphogenic defects in the heart's outflow tract and right ventricle (Horton2019Nkx2–5). While these findings suggest a role for CCDC117 in developmental processes, specific diseases linked to its mutations remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
CCDC117 is a protein that participates in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the context of DNA metabolism and cell proliferation. It is known to interact with MIP18/Fam96B/CIA2B, a component of the MMS19 cellular iron-sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) targeting complex. This complex, which includes MMS19, CIA2B, and CIAO1, is involved in the cytosolic transport and transfer of iron-sulfur clusters, crucial for DNA synthesis and repair. CCDC117 localizes to the mitotic spindle during M-phase and is found in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments during interphase, similar to other members of the MMS19 complex (Horton2019Nkx2–5).

Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the physical interaction between CCDC117 and CIA2B in HeLa cell extracts, suggesting a functional role for CCDC117 in the MMS19 complex. This interaction is significant for the regulation of DNA synthesis and repair, as knockdown of CCDC117 leads to decreased DNA synthesis rates, increased DNA damage, and inhibited cell cycle progression, particularly at the G1/S transition (Horton2019Nkx2–5). These findings highlight the importance of CCDC117 in maintaining cellular processes related to DNA metabolism and cell proliferation through its interactions with the MMS19 complex.
