# SCGB1D1

## Overview
SCGB1D1 is a gene that encodes the protein secretoglobin family 1D member 1, also known as lipophilin A. This protein is a member of the secretoglobin family, which is characterized by small, secreted proteins involved in various cellular processes, particularly within epithelial tissues. SCGB1D1 is predominantly expressed in the respiratory and reproductive systems, where it is implicated in mucosal immunity and cellular signaling. The protein is known for its ability to form heterodimers with SCGB2A proteins, which can further assemble into tetramers, indicating a complex role in protein interactions and extracellular matrix functions. SCGB1D1 has been identified as a potential biomarker in prostate and ovarian cancers, with its expression levels serving as a prognostic and diagnostic marker. Despite its recognized roles, the full spectrum of SCGB1D1's physiological and pathophysiological functions remains to be elucidated (Sokhangouy2023The; Jackson2011Update).

## Function
SCGB1D1, a member of the secretoglobin family, is a small, secreted protein involved in various cellular processes. It is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues, including the respiratory and reproductive systems, where it may play roles in mucosal immunity and cellular signaling (Jackson2011Update). SCGB1D1 is known to form heterodimers with SCGB2A proteins, which further associate to form tetramers, suggesting a complex role in protein interactions (Jackson2011Update).

The protein is associated with protein binding as a molecular function and is part of the extracellular matrix in the cellular component category. This suggests that SCGB1D1 may play a role in the binding of proteins and possibly in the concentration of certain drugs within the extracellular matrix, which could be relevant in both healthy and cancerous cells (Sokhangouy2023The). In the lacrimal gland, SCGB1D1 is enriched in certain clusters of acinar cells and is present in human tears, indicating a potential role in tear production or function (BannierHélaouët2021Exploring). Despite these insights, the specific physiological and pathophysiological roles of SCGB1D1 in healthy human cells remain to be fully defined (Jackson2011Update).

## Clinical Significance
The SCGB1D1 gene has been identified as a potential biomarker in prostate cancer (PCa), with its expression levels showing significant alterations in the disease. It is considered a valuable prognostic and diagnostic marker, offering higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional markers like PSA. SCGB1D1 is part of the lipophilin protein subfamily and may be regulated by steroid hormones, potentially binding to and concentrating estramustine, a chemotherapeutic drug used in PCa treatment (Sokhangouy2023The). The gene's expression is downregulated in several datasets, but in some cases, it is upregulated in androgen-dependent primary and metastatic PCa, indicating its role in disease stratification (Sokhangouy2023The).

SCGB1D1 has also been detected as a prognostic marker in ovarian cancer, suggesting its broader relevance in oncology (Sokhangouy2023The). Despite its significance in expression alterations, no mutations in SCGB1D1 were observed in the studied PCa patients, highlighting its role primarily in expression changes rather than genetic mutations (Sokhangouy2023The). The gene's presence in extracellular exosomes suggests potential for non-invasive diagnostic methods, as it may be detectable in body fluids (Sokhangouy2023The).

## Interactions
SCGB1D1, also known as lipophilin A, is involved in several protein-protein interactions. It forms heterodimers with SCGB2A proteins, such as SCGB2A1, and these heterodimers can further associate to form tetramers (Heinonen2015Identification; Jackson2011Update). In the context of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, SCGB1D1 interacts with eight proteins, including LCN1, PIP, LYZ, KERA, CST4, LTF, SCGB2A1, and LACRT, within a protein-protein interaction network for down-regulated proteins (Wu2020Integrative).

SCGB1D1 is also associated with the extracellular matrix and is involved in protein binding molecular functions, suggesting its role in forming or modulating protein complexes (Sokhangouy2023The). Despite these interactions, the specific functions of SCGB1D1 and its interactions with nucleic acids remain largely unknown. The protein's potential immunological functions, such as regulating chemotactic migration and invasion, have been noted, but detailed mechanisms of these interactions are not well-documented (Jackson2011Update). Overall, SCGB1D1's interactions highlight its potential role in various biological processes, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its functions.
