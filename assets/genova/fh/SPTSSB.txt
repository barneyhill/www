# SPTSSB

## Overview
SPTSSB is a gene that encodes the serine palmitoyltransferase small subunit B, a component of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex. This protein is integral to the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, a class of lipids that play critical roles in cellular structure and signaling. As a small subunit, SPTSSB enhances the activity of the SPT complex, which catalyzes the initial step in sphingolipid production by facilitating the condensation of L-serine with acyl-CoA thioesters. The protein is particularly influential in determining the chain length of sphingoid bases, favoring the production of longer chain sphingolipids, especially in neural tissues (Mohassel2024Serine; Hoch2020Combined). SPTSSB's expression is tissue-specific, with notable presence in the brain, spinal cord, and other tissues, suggesting its specialized roles in these areas (Hoch2020Combined). The gene's dysregulation has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (CostaPinheiro2020Role; Mohassel2024Serine).

## Function
SPTSSB is a small subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex, which plays a crucial role in sphingolipid biosynthesis. SPT catalyzes the first step in the production of sphingolipids by facilitating the Claisen-type condensation between L-serine and acyl-CoA thioester substrates. This process is essential for the synthesis of sphingosine species, particularly C18 and C20, which are important components of sphingolipids (Hoch2020Combined). SPTSSB enhances the activity of the SPT complex, thereby influencing the levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid mediator involved in various signaling pathways (Hoch2020Combined).

SPTSSB is expressed in specific tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, skin, kidney, and urinary bladder, suggesting its role in these tissues (Hoch2020Combined). It is also expressed in neurons of the brain and spinal cord, where it contributes to the preference for forming longer chain-length sphingoid bases by SPT (Mohassel2024Serine). Although SPTSSB is not essential for normal embryonic development, it plays a role in enhancing SPT activity and possibly influences sphingolipid biosynthesis in neural tissues (Mohassel2024Serine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SPTSSB gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In prostate cancer, SPTSSB expression is upregulated in aggressive tumors, especially those treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This upregulation is associated with advanced prostate cancer cases and may serve as a biomarker for aggressive disease progression (CostaPinheiro2020Role). The gene's expression is also linked to resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibition, suggesting its role in treatment resistance (CostaPinheiro2020Role).

In neurodegenerative diseases, although no human diseases have been directly linked to SPTSSB variants, a mouse model with an Sptssb H56L substitution exhibits a neurodegenerative phenotype, including early-onset ataxia and premature death. This model shows an accumulation of specific sphingolipids in the nervous system, indicating the gene's role in neurodegeneration (Mohassel2024Serine). The SPTSSB gene's involvement in sphingolipid metabolism suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to metabolic diseases and conditions characterized by altered lipid metabolism (Hoch2020Combined).

## Interactions
SPTSSB is a small subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex, which is essential for sphingolipid biosynthesis. It interacts with the large subunits SPTLC1 and either SPTLC2 or SPTLC3 to form the functional SPT complex. This interaction enhances the catalytic activity of the enzyme, influencing the production of sphingoid bases (Mohassel2024Serine; Dingjan2021The). SPTSSB, unlike the ubiquitously expressed SPTSSA, has a more limited tissue distribution and is expressed in neurons of the brain and spinal cord (Mohassel2024Serine).

SPTSSB also plays a role in determining the substrate specificity of the SPT complex. Its presence increases the enzyme's affinity for C18 acyl-CoA substrates and significantly elevates C20 long-chain base production, particularly in the brain and eye (Glueck2024Atypical). The subunit composition of SPT, including the presence of SPTSSB, influences the fatty acyl CoA substrates utilized by the enzyme, affecting the production of sphingoid bases (Glueck2024Atypical).

SPTSSB is part of the protein-protein interaction network involving SPTLC1, suggesting its involvement in broader regulatory processes within sphingolipid metabolism (Zhu2019Decreased).
