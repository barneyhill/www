# COL28A1

## Overview
The COL28A1 gene encodes the collagen type XXVIII alpha 1 chain, a structural protein that plays a crucial role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of various tissues. This protein is characterized by its unique composition, which includes von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domains and a collagenous domain, facilitating its involvement in protein-protein interactions and structural integrity. Collagen type XXVIII is primarily expressed in peripheral nerves, particularly within the basement membranes surrounding Schwann cells, where it contributes to the maintenance of myelinated nerve integrity. The protein's involvement in ECM integrity and cell adhesion underscores its significance in tissue development, repair, and disease processes, including its potential role in conditions such as aortic dissection and glioblastoma (Yang2019A; Veit2006Collagen).

## Structure
The COL28A1 gene encodes collagen type XXVIII alpha 1 chain, a protein characterized by a unique structure that includes von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domains and a collagenous domain. The primary structure of collagen XXVIII features Gly-X-Y repeats, with 16 imperfections distributed along the sequence, including 12 GXG and four GXXXXG motifs, which contribute to the protein's unique properties (Veit2006Collagen). The collagenous domain is rich in lysine, enhancing the stability of the triple helix, and contains motifs like CXC for disulfide bond formation and RGD at the C-terminal end (Veit2006Collagen).

The protein's structure includes an N-terminal VWA domain, a collagenous domain, and a C-terminal VWA domain followed by a Kunitz domain. The VWA domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and show homology to those in other collagens and matrilins, with the VWA2 domain conserving the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (Veit2006Collagen). Alternative splicing of the COL28A1 gene results in splice variants that may lack certain domains, such as the second VWA domain and the Kunitz domain (Veit2006Collagen).

The quaternary structure of collagen XXVIII includes a homotrimeric form, as observed in non-reducing SDS-PAGE, indicating the presence of disulfide-linked homotrimeric molecules (Veit2006Collagen). The protein is primarily expressed in peripheral nerves, particularly in Schwann cells, and is a component of the basement membranes around these cells (Veit2006Collagen).

## Function
Collagen type XXVIII alpha 1 chain, encoded by the COL28A1 gene, is a structural protein involved in maintaining the integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in various tissues. It is characterized by the presence of von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its function in the peripheral nervous system (Veit2006Collagen). In healthy human cells, collagen XXVIII is primarily active in the extracellular space, contributing to cell adhesion and signaling pathways. It is notably expressed in peripheral nerves, particularly in the basement membranes surrounding Schwann cells, which are crucial for the integrity of myelinated nerves (Veit2006Collagen).

The protein's molecular structure includes a collagenous domain with several imperfections, which may influence its interaction with other ECM components. These interactions are vital for maintaining ECM integrity and facilitating structural support and flexibility, particularly in tissues like the sciatic nerve (Li2016Variants; Veit2006Collagen). Collagen XXVIII is also involved in tissue development and repair, with its expression observed in transitional fibroblasts during lung injury, indicating a role in fibrogenesis (Mayr2024Sfrp1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the COL28A1 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. In the context of preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (PPROM) and spontaneous preterm labor (sPTL), copy number variations (CNVs) in COL28A1, including duplications and deletions, have been identified. These genetic variations are associated with the degradation of fetal membranes, which is a critical factor in these conditions (Zhao2017UbiquitinProteasomeCollagen).

In aortic dissection (AD), a novel frameshift deletion variant in COL28A1 was identified, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition to this condition. Although large deletions were not found in the study, the presence of loss-of-function variants in collagen genes, including COL28A1, indicates a significant association with AD (Li2016Variants).

In glioblastoma (GBM), COL28A1 is one of the prognostic feature genes identified to predict the prognosis of the disease. Its involvement in collagen biosynthesis pathways suggests a role in tumor progression and invasion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in neuro-oncology (Yang2019A).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of COL28A1 in various pathological conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to fully understand its role in disease mechanisms.

## Interactions
Collagen type XXVIII alpha 1 chain, encoded by the COL28A1 gene, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for tissue integrity, particularly in the peripheral nervous system (Veit2006Collagen). The VWA domains in collagen XXVIII are structurally related to those in collagen VI, suggesting potential interactions with other collagens, such as collagen I, through cation-dependent binding sites (Veit2006Collagen). 

Collagen XXVIII is expressed in the basement membrane of Schwann cells in peripheral nerves, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity of myelinated nerves (Veit2006Collagen). The protein is also part of a highly connected cluster of collagens, including network-forming collagens and FACITs, suggesting it may interact with other collagens in this network (Wesp2024Constructing). 

In the context of glioblastoma, COL28A1 is enriched in pathways related to collagen biosynthesis and modifying enzymes, implying its involvement in cellular interactions that may influence tumor progression (Yang2019A). However, specific protein interactions involving COL28A1 in this context are not detailed.
