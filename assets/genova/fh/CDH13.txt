# CDH13

## Overview
CDH13, also known as T-cadherin, is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin-13, a member of the cadherin superfamily. Unlike classical cadherins, cadherin-13 is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety, rather than a transmembrane domain, which classifies it as a GPI-anchored protein (Andreeva2010Cadherin; Sotomayor2014Sorting). This unique structural feature allows cadherin-13 to function primarily in signaling rather than cell adhesion, playing significant roles in the nervous and cardiovascular systems. In the nervous system, it is involved in axon growth, synapse development, and the regulation of excitatory and inhibitory signals, while in the cardiovascular system, it influences cell proliferation and survival (Rivero2013Impact; Mossink2020Cadherin13). CDH13 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, where its expression and methylation status serve as potential biomarkers for disease prognosis (Rivero2015Cadherin13; Wang2011CDH13).

## Structure
CDH13, also known as T-cadherin, is a unique member of the cadherin family due to its lack of a transmembrane domain. Instead, it is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety (Andreeva2010Cadherin; Sotomayor2014Sorting). The protein consists of five extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, which are involved in calcium-dependent interactions crucial for its adhesive functions (Hulpiau2009Molecular; Sotomayor2014Sorting).

The primary structure of CDH13 includes a 713-amino acid polypeptide, with two major mRNA transcripts identified (Andreeva2010Cadherin). The secondary structure of its EC1 domain is characterized by seven β-strands forming two sheets, typical of cadherin domains (Ciatto2010Tcadherin). Unlike classical cadherins, CDH13 lacks the tryptophan residues necessary for strand-swapping interactions, instead featuring an isoleucine at position 2, which contributes to its monomeric state (Hulpiau2009Molecular).

CDH13 forms a unique X-dimer conformation involving its EC1 and EC2 domains, which is crucial for its adhesive properties (Ciatto2010Tcadherin; Sotomayor2014Sorting). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common and influence the protein's stability and function (Andreeva2010Cadherin).

## Function
Cadherin-13 (CDH13) is a unique member of the cadherin superfamily, characterized by its anchorage to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, rather than a transmembrane domain. This structure allows CDH13 to function primarily as a signaling molecule rather than a traditional adhesion protein (Rivero2013Impact; Mossink2020Cadherin13). 

In the nervous system, CDH13 is involved in various processes such as axon growth, guidance, and synapse development. It plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in neuronal networks, particularly through its regulation of GABAergic synapses (Rivero2013Impact; Mossink2020Cadherin13). CDH13 interacts with integrins ITGβ1 and ITGβ3, which are important for synaptic stability and function (Mossink2020Cadherin13).

In vascular cells, CDH13 influences cell proliferation, migration, and survival. It is involved in signaling pathways such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, which are crucial for cell survival and morphology (Rivero2013Impact). CDH13 also acts as a receptor for adiponectin, potentially mediating protective effects in the cardiovascular system (Rivero2013Impact).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CDH13 gene have been implicated in a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. CDH13 is identified as a risk gene for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, depression, substance abuse, and violent behavior. It plays a critical role in modulating synaptic function, particularly in GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus, which are crucial for inhibitory synaptic transmission. Disruptions in CDH13 expression can lead to an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory signals, contributing to the pathophysiology of these disorders (Rivero2015Cadherin13).

In cancer, CDH13 methylation is frequently observed and is associated with poor prognosis in several types, including colorectal and cervical cancers. In colorectal cancer, CDH13 methylation is linked to advanced disease stages and poorer overall survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Wang2011CDH13). In cervical cancer, CDH13 methylation correlates with reduced disease-free survival, indicating a potential for relapse (Widschwendter2003CDH1). CDH13 methylation is also observed in ovarian cancer, although its clinical significance in distinguishing between cancerous and benign conditions remains unclear (Xia2019Clinical).

## Interactions
CDH13, also known as T-cadherin, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that interacts with adiponectin, particularly the hexameric and high molecular weight isoforms. This interaction is significant in the context of allergic airway responses, where CDH13 binds adiponectin to the endothelium and heart, affecting serum adiponectin levels and modulating immune responses (Williams2012Role).

CDH13 also plays a role in maintaining synaptic structures in the central nervous system. It acts as a transsynaptic anchor in the retinotectal pathway, facilitating neuron type-specific wiring between the retina and the superior colliculus. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mature dendritic spine density in wide-field neurons, suggesting that CDH13 is involved in cell-cell recognition essential for synaptic maintenance (Matcham2023Cadherin13).

In the context of metabolic signaling, CDH13 is described as a potential signaling receptor for adiponectin, transmitting metabolic signals and participating in cell adhesion processes. This interaction is supported by experimental and literature evidence, highlighting its role in glucose and lipid metabolic processes (Bag2014Revealing).
