# LARS2

## Overview
The LARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme leucyl-tRNA synthetase 2, which is crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs, a fundamental step in the translation process. LARS2 specifically catalyzes the attachment of leucine to its tRNA, playing a vital role in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins that are essential for the mitochondrial respiratory chain and energy production (Pierce2013Mutations; Riley2015LARS2). The protein is localized in the mitochondria and consists of several domains, including a catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain, which are essential for its function and interaction with tRNA (Buonfiglio2022Predicting; Bullard2000Expression). Mutations in the LARS2 gene have been linked to Perrault syndrome, characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and ovarian dysfunction, highlighting its clinical significance (Pierce2013Mutations; Neyroud2022LARS2).

## Structure
The LARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, a protein crucial for attaching leucine to its corresponding tRNA, a key step in mitochondrial protein synthesis. The protein consists of 903 amino acids and is localized in the mitochondria (Bullard2000Expression). The primary structure of LARS2 includes several important domains: a catalytic domain, an editing domain, a leucine-specific (LS) domain, an anticodon-recognition domain, and a C-terminal domain (Riley2015LARS2; Buonfiglio2022Predicting). The catalytic domain is responsible for binding ATP, leucine, and the 3' extremity of tRNA Leu, facilitating the release of Leu-tRNA Leu after catalysis (Riley2015LARS2).

The secondary structure of LARS2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its three-dimensional tertiary structure. This structure is essential for its function, as it allows the protein to interact with tRNA and other mitochondrial components. The C-terminal domain plays a crucial role in stabilizing the tRNA structure, which is important for efficient aminoacylation (Hornig‐Do2014Human).

LARS2 may also have quaternary structure interactions with other mitochondrial proteins, although specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context. The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Pierce2013Mutations).

## Function
The LARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the attachment of leucine to its corresponding tRNA, a critical step in the translation of proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome (Pierce2013Mutations; CarminhoRodrigues2020LARS2Perrault). LARS2 is exclusively localized to mitochondria, highlighting its specific role in mitochondrial function (Li2010Human). 

In healthy human cells, LARS2 ensures the proper synthesis of leucyl-tRNA, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. This process is crucial for the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits, which are integral to the mitochondrial respiratory chain and energy production (Riley2015LARS2). The enzyme's activity is particularly important in tissues with high metabolic rates, such as skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney, where it supports cellular energy metabolism (Li2010Human).

LARS2 also plays a role in stabilizing non-cognate mitochondrial tRNAs, which may help suppress pathogenic mutations, indicating a broader function in maintaining mitochondrial health (Hornig‐Do2014Human). This multifaceted role underscores the enzyme's importance in cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LARS2 gene are associated with Perrault syndrome, a condition characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and ovarian dysfunction, specifically premature ovarian failure (POF) or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) (Pierce2013Mutations; Neyroud2022LARS2). The syndrome can present with a range of symptoms, from isolated POI to more severe forms with neurological symptoms (Neyroud2022LARS2). The LARS2 variant c.1565C>A (p.Thr522Asn) is frequently identified in individuals with Perrault syndrome and is considered a hotspot mutation due to its prevalence in affected families (CarminhoRodrigues2020LARS2Perrault; Demain2016Expanding).

In some cases, LARS2 mutations can lead to isolated POI without overt hearing loss, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of LARS2-related conditions (Neyroud2022LARS2). The severity of hearing loss can vary, and in some instances, it may be under-recognized or develop later in life (Neyroud2022LARS2). Additionally, LARS2 mutations have been linked to more severe phenotypes, including multisystem disorders characterized by hydrops, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia, particularly when associated with other pathogenic variants (Riley2015LARS2; Demain2016Expanding). These findings highlight the genetic heterogeneity and variable expressivity associated with LARS2 mutations.

## Interactions
LARS2, the human mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in several interactions with nucleic acids and potentially with other proteins. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of leucine to its corresponding tRNA. LARS2 can suppress non-cognate pathogenic mitochondrial tRNA mutations by binding to non-cognate mt-tRNAs, such as mt-tRNA val, albeit with weaker affinity compared to its cognate mt-tRNA leuUUR and mt-tRNA leuCUN. This binding is detectable through cross-linking and immunoprecipitation techniques (Hornig‐Do2014Human).

A C-terminal fragment of LARS2, consisting of 67 residues, is capable of binding to mt-tRNA in intact cells. This fragment alone can suppress respiratory defects caused by mutations in yeast mt-tRNAs Leu, Val, or Ile. The C-terminal region folds into a compact domain that recognizes the mt-tRNA elbow shape rather than specific sequences, indicating a structural rather than sequence-specific interaction (Hornig‐Do2014Human).

The study also suggests that other mitochondrial aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, like VARS2, may have similar non-cognate tRNA stabilizing functions, indicating a broader role for these enzymes in maintaining mitochondrial function (Hornig‐Do2014Human).
