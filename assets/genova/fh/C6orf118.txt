# C6orf118

## Overview
C6orf118 is a gene located on chromosome 6 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 6 open reading frame 118. This protein is currently not categorized into a specific functional class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological role remains to be fully characterized. The gene has garnered attention due to its involvement in chromosomal deletions and copy number alterations, which have been linked to a variety of developmental and neurological disorders, as well as congenital anomalies (Xie2022Genotype–Phenotype). Additionally, C6orf118 is implicated in cancer research, particularly in esophageal adenocarcinoma, where it is found within regions of recurrent copy number alterations, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Wang2015Copy). Despite these associations, the specific functions and mechanisms of action of the C6orf118 protein in both normal physiology and disease states remain subjects of ongoing research.

## Clinical Significance
The gene C6orf118, located on chromosome 6, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its involvement in chromosomal deletions and copy number alterations. Deletions in the 6q26-q27 region, which include C6orf118, have been associated with a range of developmental and neurological disorders. Patients with such deletions may exhibit intellectual disability, seizures, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and sleep disturbances. These deletions are also linked to congenital anomalies such as myelomeningocele, spina bifida, and congenital heart defects like ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (Xie2022Genotype–Phenotype).

In the context of cancer, C6orf118 has been identified within regions of recurrent copy number alterations in esophageal adenocarcinoma. This suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis, although the specific contribution of C6orf118 to cancer development remains to be fully elucidated (Wang2015Copy).

The clinical significance of C6orf118 is still under investigation, and its precise role in these conditions is not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to clarify its involvement in disease mechanisms and its potential as a therapeutic target.
