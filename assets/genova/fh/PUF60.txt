# PUF60

## Overview
PUF60 is a gene that encodes the poly(U) binding splicing factor 60, a protein integral to the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor and is involved in the recognition and processing of 3' splice sites, particularly in introns with weak splice signals. PUF60 enhances the binding of splicing factors to RNA substrates, facilitating early spliceosome assembly and influencing the efficiency and accuracy of splicing. It also plays a role in modulating alternative splicing, contributing to protein diversity across different tissues. The protein's structure includes two RNA recognition motifs and a U2AF-homology motif, which are essential for its interactions with other splicing factors and nucleic acids. Mutations in the PUF60 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including Verheij syndrome, characterized by developmental and multi-system anomalies. The gene's involvement in spliceosome assembly and its interactions with spliceosomal proteins underscore its significance in cellular differentiation and development (Královičová2018PUF60activated; Hastings2007Control; Grimes2023PUF60‐related).

## Structure
PUF60 is a splicing factor with a complex molecular structure that includes two central RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal U2AF-homology motif (UHM) (Královičová2018PUF60activated). The RRMs, specifically RRM1 and RRM2, are crucial for its function, with RRM1 binding to single-stranded DNA and RRM2 involved in interdomain contacts (Královičová2018PUF60activated). The UHM of PUF60 does not bind nucleic acids but interacts with tryptophan-containing ULMs in proteins such as SF3B1 (Loerch2016Unmasking).

The protein's structure is characterized by its ability to form flexible contacts with SF3B1-ULM and U-rich pre-mRNAs, facilitated by the longest linker among UHM-containing proteins (Královičová2018PUF60activated). PUF60's interaction with SF3B1 is supported by its preference for binding to the first ULM of SF3B1, as indicated by ITC and NMR data (Loerch2016Unmasking).

PUF60 also exists in splice variant isoforms, which can influence splice site selection and the use of cryptic splice sites, adding to its functional diversity (Královičová2018PUF60activated). These structural features and interactions highlight PUF60's role in splicing regulation and its importance in RNA processing.

## Function
PUF60 (poly(U) binding splicing factor 60) is a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a critical step in gene expression. It plays a significant role in the recognition and processing of 3' splice sites, particularly in introns with weak splice signals. PUF60 interacts with the U2AF65/35 heterodimer, enhancing the binding of these splicing factors to RNA substrates, which is crucial for early spliceosome assembly (Hastings2007Control). This interaction is essential for the cooperative binding that stabilizes the 3' splice site, influencing the efficiency and accuracy of splicing (Hastings2007Control).

PUF60 is also involved in modulating alternative splicing, which allows for the generation of multiple mRNA variants from a single gene, contributing to protein diversity. This modulation is tissue-specific, affecting splicing patterns in different cell types, such as HeLa and neuronal-like cells (Hastings2007Control). In addition to its role in splicing, PUF60 is implicated in transcription regulation by interacting with spliceosomal proteins and recruiting snRNPs to the intron, facilitating the association of U2 snRNP with pre-mRNA (Grimes2023PUF60‐related). These functions underscore PUF60's importance in cellular differentiation and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PUF60 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, most notably Verheij syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by developmental delays, craniofacial dysmorphia, short stature, and various congenital anomalies affecting the heart, kidneys, and skeletal system (Low2017PUF60; Grimes2023PUF60‐related). Patients with PUF60-related disorders often exhibit intellectual disabilities, behavioral difficulties, and ocular abnormalities such as coloboma (Grimes2023PUF60‐related). 

Recent studies have expanded the phenotypic spectrum of PUF60-related disorders, identifying additional features such as movement disorders, immunological abnormalities, and skin conditions (Baum2024Novel). These findings suggest a reclassification of these conditions as PUF60-related neurodevelopmental disorders with multi-system involvement, as some patients exhibit milder phenotypes than classical Verheij syndrome (Baum2024Novel). 

PUF60 mutations can lead to aberrant RNA splicing, contributing to the diverse phenotypes observed in these disorders (TOADER2021Identification). The gene's role in spliceosome assembly and its interactions with spliceosomal proteins are crucial for effective splice site recognition, and its dysregulation can result in various monogenic disorders (Grimes2023PUF60‐related). Animal models have shown similar phenotypes, including immunodeficiency, which was not previously associated with human PUF60-related disorders (Baum2024Novel).

## Interactions
PUF60 is a splicing factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing. It is known to associate with several splicing factors, particularly those involved in early spliceosome assembly, such as nine SR proteins and U1 and U2 snRNP-associated proteins (Hastings2007Control). PUF60 shares structural and functional similarities with U2AF65, suggesting potential redundancy and synergy in their roles in splicing (Hastings2007Control). 

PUF60 interacts with U2AF65/35, cooperating in RNA binding and splicing activation, especially in introns with weak 3' splice sites (Hastings2007Control). This interaction is crucial for the splicing process, as PUF60 and U2AF65/35 may bind sequentially to RNA, with U2AF65/35 initially binding and potentially recruiting PUF60 (Hastings2007Control). PUF60 also interacts with SF3b155, a component of the U2 snRNP, which suggests its role in stabilizing U2 snRNP binding during early spliceosome assembly (Hastings2007Control).

In addition to its role in splicing, PUF60 colocalizes with PABPC1 in cytoplasmic granules, likely P-bodies, which are involved in mRNA decay. This interaction is essential for P-body formation, as PUF60 knockdown reduces P-bodies, while overexpression increases them (Zhang2023Targeting).
