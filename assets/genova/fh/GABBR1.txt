# GABBR1

## Overview
The GABBR1 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1, a critical component of the GABA_B receptor, which is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. This receptor subunit is integral to the formation of a functional heterodimer with the GABA-B2 subunit, facilitating the modulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability through the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and regulation of ion channels (Rachdi2020Regulated; Vangeel2017Newborn). Beyond its neurological roles, GABBR1 is also expressed in pancreatic beta cells, where it influences insulin secretion, highlighting its involvement in both neuronal and metabolic processes (Rachdi2020Regulated). The protein's structure is characterized by typical GPCR features, including transmembrane domains and regions for heterodimerization, and it undergoes various post-translational modifications (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). GABBR1's significance extends to clinical contexts, where mutations and expression alterations have been linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy and schizophrenia, underscoring its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Watanabe2023A; Fatemi2011Deficits).

## Structure
The GABBR1 protein, encoded by the GABBR1 gene, is a component of the heterodimeric G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It features a domain organization typical of GPCR family members. The protein includes an N-terminal domain (residues 15-591) with Sushi-1 and Sushi-2 domains (residues 30-96 and 98-159, respectively), and a ligand-binding domain (residues 160-591) with a known 3D structure (residues 165-576, PDB ID: 4MS4) (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The 7TM domain spans residues 592-854, and the cytoplasmic domain extends from residues 855-961, with a coiled-coil region responsible for heterodimerization (residues 879-919, PDB ID: 4PAS) (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

GABBR1 is predicted to have 24% disordered residues, with two long intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) at residues 414-465 and 864-961. The protein undergoes multiple post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, and contains four molecular recognition features (MoRFs), one within the Sushi-2 domain and others in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). Alternative splicing generates multiple isoforms of GABBR1, ranging from 578 to 931 residues, characterized by variations in the N-terminal or C-terminal elements (Peters1998Mapping; Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Function
The GABBR1 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1, which is a component of the GABA_B receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. This receptor functions by forming a heterodimer with the GABA-B2 subunit, creating a receptor complex that modulates synaptic transmission through the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, leading to reduced levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the regulation of ion channels (Rachdi2020Regulated; Vangeel2017Newborn). In the central nervous system, the GABA_B receptor plays a crucial role in reducing neuronal excitability, which is essential for maintaining synaptic balance and preventing excessive neuronal firing (Vangeel2017Newborn).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, GABBR1 is expressed in human pancreatic beta cells, where it is involved in modulating insulin secretion. Activation of the GABA_B receptor in these cells inhibits cAMP signaling, which decreases the expression of beta cell-specific genes and reduces insulin secretion, indicating a feedback mechanism that regulates beta cell function (Rachdi2020Regulated). This highlights the receptor's involvement in both neuronal and metabolic processes, underscoring its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GABBR1 gene have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. The gene encodes a subunit of the GABA_B receptor, which plays a crucial role in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Variants in GABBR1 have been associated with epilepsy, particularly temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and infantile spasms. A specific GABBR1 variant, c.1042G>C, p.(Ala348Pro), has been classified as 'likely pathogenic' in a patient with infantile spasms, contributing to the understanding of GABBR1's role in epilepsy (Watanabe2023A). The G1465A polymorphism in GABBR1 has shown a significant association with TLE, suggesting a genetic predisposition to this form of epilepsy (Xi2011GABBR1).

Alterations in GABBR1 expression have also been linked to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. Studies have found significant reductions in GABBR1 protein levels in the brains of individuals with these conditions, indicating a dysfunction in the GABAergic system (Fatemi2011Deficits). Additionally, GABBR1 has been investigated as a susceptibility factor for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with certain polymorphisms showing potential associations with the disorder (Zai2005Evidence). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GABBR1 in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
GABBR1, a subunit of the GABA_B receptor, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It forms a heterodimeric complex with GABBR2, which is essential for coupling to G proteins and facilitating cell surface expression by masking GABBR1's endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. The N-terminal ectodomain of GABBR2 directly interacts with the ligand-binding ectodomain of GABBR1, enhancing agonist affinity and receptor activation (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

In the context of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, GABBR1 interacts with the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to form a heteromeric complex. This interaction modulates the signaling pathways of CaSR, particularly in response to GABBR1 agonists like baclofen, which can suppress the maximal activation of Gq and Gi proteins mediated by CaSR (Chang2020PTH). The formation of this heterocomplex is significant in hyperparathyroidism, where it plays a role in PTH hypersecretion (Chang2020PTH).

GABBR1 is also implicated in schizophrenia, where it is regulated by microRNAs and interacts with proteins such as HTR1A, a serotonin receptor. These interactions are part of a network involving differentially methylated genes associated with schizophrenia (Gumerov2015MicroRNAderived).
