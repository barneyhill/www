# SPATC1

## Overview
The SPATC1 gene encodes the protein spermatogenesis and centriole associated 1, commonly referred to as speriolin, which plays a crucial role in the development of sperm cells, or spermatogenesis. This testis-specific protein is primarily associated with the centrosome, a key cellular structure involved in cell division, and is expressed in both meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells. Speriolin is characterized by its involvement in the assembly of the centrosome and spindle apparatus, essential for successful fertilization and embryo development. It contains distinct domains that facilitate its interaction with other proteins and cellular structures, such as γ-tubulin and Cdc20, indicating its role in centrosomal targeting and spindle checkpoint regulation. The SPATC1 gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest in reproductive biology and have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including reproductive disorders and cancer (Denu2020Analysis; Goto2010Speriolin; Nagirnaja2014Structural).

## Function
The SPATC1 gene encodes the protein speriolin, which is involved in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. Speriolin is a novel protein associated with the sperm centrosome in both human and mouse spermatogenic cells. It co-localizes with the centrosomal protein pericentrin in mouse spermatocytes and is present in the centrosome of round spermatids (Goto2010Speriolin). In humans, speriolin is associated with the proximal centriole in sperm, which retains its structural organization, unlike in mice where both centrioles degenerate (Goto2010Speriolin). The protein is testis-specific and expressed in meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells (Goto2010Speriolin).

Speriolin is believed to play a role in nucleating the assembly of the centrosome and spindle apparatus in the zygote, which is critical for successful fertilization and embryo development in humans (Goto2010Speriolin). The N-terminal region of speriolin contains a leucine-zipper domain crucial for centrosome targeting, while the central region interacts with γ-tubulin, and the C-terminal region is required for Cdc20 binding (Goto2010Speriolin). This suggests that speriolin may be involved in centrosomal targeting and spindle checkpoint regulation, contributing to the proper formation and function of sperm cells, impacting male fertility (Goto2010Speriolin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPATC1 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of idiopathic recurrent miscarriage (RM), a study identified heterozygous deletions of SPATC1 in a male patient, RM-M45, which were associated with an increased risk of RM. These deletions were linked to genes involved in spermatogenesis and immune function during pregnancy, suggesting a potential role for SPATC1 mutations in reproductive disorders (Nagirnaja2014Structural).

In cancer research, SPATC1 has been associated with centrosome amplification (CA), a condition linked to aggressive cancer features. A study suggested that gain-of-function alterations in SPATC1 could contribute to CA, which is often observed in various human cancers and is associated with poorer prognosis (Denu2020Analysis). The co-occurrence of genomic amplifications of SPATC1 with other genes on chromosome 8q, such as NDRG1 and PTK2, further supports its potential role in cancer pathogenesis (Denu2020Analysis).

Additionally, SPATC1 expression is affected by environmental factors such as cigarette smoking, which has been shown to down-regulate its expression in sperm, potentially leading to reduced sperm fertility and impaired motility (Chen2015Alteration).
