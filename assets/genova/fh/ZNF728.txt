# ZNF728

## Overview
ZNF728 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 728, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of C2H2 type zinc-finger domains. These domains facilitate DNA binding, allowing the protein to function primarily as a transcriptional repressor. The protein is involved in modulating the transcription of specific gene sets transcribed by RNA polymerase II, playing a crucial role in early human development and the regulation of transcriptional networks through interaction with LTR12/ERV9 elements (Iouranova2022KRAB; Girard2022Naive). ZNF728 is expressed at varying levels during different stages of embryonic development and is notably enriched in naive pluripotent stem cells. Its expression and mutations have been implicated in various diseases, including lung adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the gallbladder, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Liu2021Wholeexome; Liu2019Prognosis).

## Structure
ZNF728 is a classical C2H2 type zinc-finger protein, characterized by the presence of zinc-finger domains. These domains are short motifs that make tandem contacts with target molecules and are stabilized by zinc ions (Girard2022Naive). The primary structure of ZNF728 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are crucial for coordinating zinc ions. The secondary structure typically includes beta sheets and alpha helices, which contribute to the stability and functionality of the zinc-finger motifs.

ZNF728 contains a Krüppel associated box (KRAB) domain, which is commonly found in transcription repressors. This domain is involved in modulating the transcription of specific gene sets transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Girard2022Naive). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs into a stable three-dimensional shape, allowing the protein to interact with DNA and other molecules effectively.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination may occur, influencing the protein's function and interactions. ZNF728 is predicted to be a DNA-binding transcription factor, and its expression is notably high at the transcriptomic level in naive pluripotent stem cells (hNPSCs) (Girard2022Naive). The presence of splice variant isoforms could further affect its functional diversity.

## Function
ZNF728 is a KRAB zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in human cells. It contains zinc-finger domains that facilitate DNA binding, suggesting its role as a DNA-binding transcription factor. ZNF728 is involved in modulating the transcription of specific gene sets transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Girard2022Naive). The protein is enriched over the 5' untranslated region of ERV9-int sequences and acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting KAP1, a co-repressor, to its target sites. This repression is crucial for silencing lentivector-borne PGK-GFP reporter cassettes juxtaposed to LTR12 or HERV9-derived targets (Iouranova2022KRAB).

ZNF728 is expressed at low levels in oocytes and zygotes, increases during zygotic genome activation, and decreases in blastocysts. It is more expressed in naïve than in primed human embryonic stem cells, indicating its role in early development (Iouranova2022KRAB). The protein is hominoid-specific and has evolved to potentially repress the transcriptional activity of certain regulatory sequences active during gametogenesis and early development (Girard2022Naive). ZNF728's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in regulating transcriptional networks through interaction with LTR12/ERV9 elements (Iouranova2022KRAB).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF728 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression. In lung adenocarcinoma, low expression of ZNF728 is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential clinical significance in this type of cancer (Liu2019Prognosis). In neuroendocrine carcinomas of the gallbladder (GB-NECs), ZNF728 is one of the genes mutated specifically in the N1/N2 group, although its precise role in these tumors requires further investigation (Liu2021Wholeexome). 

The gene is also mentioned in the context of mutational hotspots in cancer, indicating that it could be a potential target for future studies due to its multiple mutations (GonzalezCárdenas2024The). Additionally, ZNF728 is part of the KRAB-ZNF class of zinc-finger genes, which are involved in local adaptation and have been linked to various diseases, although specific clinical implications for ZNF728 itself are not detailed (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic). These findings highlight the need for further research to fully understand the clinical significance of ZNF728 mutations and expression changes in different diseases.
