# THSD8

## Overview
Thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 8 (THSD8) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is part of the thrombospondin family. This family is characterized by the presence of thrombospondin type 1 repeats, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix communication. The THSD8 protein is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein, playing a role in tissue remodeling and repair. It is implicated in several biological pathways and may have a role in modulating cellular adhesion and migration. The expression and function of THSD8 are of particular interest in the context of developmental biology and disease pathogenesis, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Qiu2020aarFDC).
