# CCDC80

## Overview
CCDC80, or coiled-coil domain containing 80, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein involved in various biological processes, including adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and energy homeostasis. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is predominantly expressed in white adipose tissue. CCDC80 plays a crucial role in regulating key transcription factors and signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin and ERK1/2 pathways, impacting adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism (Tremblay2009Bidirectional; Gong2019Coiledcoil). Clinically, CCDC80 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular and metabolic homeostasis (Sasagawa2016Comparative; Tremblay2012Loss; Leone2015The).

## Structure
CCDC80, encoded by the CCDC80 gene in humans, is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of CCDC80 is defined by its specific amino acid sequence, which dictates the formation of these coiled-coil domains. In terms of secondary structure, CCDC80 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation.

The tertiary structure of CCDC80 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is crucial for its biological activity and interaction with other proteins. This structure is stabilized by various interactions among the amino acids, including hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of multiple protein subunits, although specific details about the quaternary structure of CCDC80 are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications can influence the function and localization of CCDC80, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of CCDC80 may exist, potentially affecting its functional diversity and role in cellular processes. These structural features and modifications are essential for the protein's role in human biology.

## Function
The CCDC80 gene encodes a secreted protein that plays a significant role in adipogenesis, the process by which preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes, or fat cells. CCDC80 is highly expressed in white adipose tissue and is involved in the regulation of key transcription factors such as C/EBPα and PPARγ, which are essential for adipocyte differentiation (Tremblay2009Bidirectional). The protein is secreted in both full-length and cleaved forms, suggesting its involvement in extracellular signaling or interactions (Tremblay2009Bidirectional).

CCDC80 modulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a pathway crucial for adipocyte differentiation. It represses TCF-mediated transcriptional activity, which is necessary for the activation of adipogenic markers (Tremblay2009Bidirectional). This repression is critical for the proper development of adipocytes, as evidenced by the impaired differentiation observed when CCDC80 expression is silenced (Tremblay2009Bidirectional).

In addition to its role in adipogenesis, CCDC80 influences lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. It has been implicated in the regulation of lipid profiles, particularly affecting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and certain lipid pathways in mice (Li2020Multiomics). These functions highlight CCDC80's importance in maintaining metabolic balance and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC80 gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in CCDC80 expression are associated with several types of cancer. In thyroid and ovarian neoplasias, CCDC80 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation linked to increased tumor development in cl2/ccdc80 null mice (Leone2015The). In gastric cancer, high CCDC80 expression correlates with poor prognosis and increased immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Yu2024Silencing). 

CCDC80 is also associated with metabolic disorders. In mice, the absence of CCDC80 leads to increased sensitivity to diet-induced obesity, hyperglycemia, and glucose intolerance, indicating its role in glucose and energy homeostasis (Tremblay2012Loss). 

In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), CCDC80 is identified as a novel gene associated with the disease, potentially regulating pulmonary artery tone through interactions with other genes involved in PAH pathophysiology (Sasagawa2016Comparative). 

Additionally, a specific SNP in CCDC80 is linked to atopic dermatitis and possibly asthma, suggesting its involvement in allergic responses (Tanaka2021Eight).

## Interactions
CCDC80, also known as coiled-coil domain containing 80, participates in several interactions that influence its role in various biological processes. It interacts with the extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway, where it inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This interaction is crucial for regulating lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression, affecting lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis development (Gong2019Coiledcoil). CCDC80 also influences the expression of Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) by decreasing ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which impacts the methylation status of the LPL promoter (Gong2019Coiledcoil).

In the context of colorectal cancer, CCDC80 interacts with the ERK1/2 pathway, potentially through the G protein-coupled receptor GPR30, which is activated by nonylphenol (NP). This interaction is significant in modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wang2021CoiledCoil). CCDC80 is also involved in the regulation of endothelin-1 and collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1) expression, suggesting a role in vascular remodeling and pulmonary arterial hypertension (Sasagawa2016Comparative). These interactions highlight CCDC80's involvement in key signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
