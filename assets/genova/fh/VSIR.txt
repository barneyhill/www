# VSIR

## Overview
The VSIR gene encodes the V-set immunoregulatory receptor, commonly referred to as VISTA, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in immune regulation. As a member of the B7 family of proteins, VISTA functions as an inhibitory immune-checkpoint molecule, modulating immune responses by suppressing T cell activation and proliferation. It is constitutively expressed on various immune cells, including myeloid dendritic cells and regulatory T cells, and is involved in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. VISTA's interactions within the immune system, particularly its role in promoting immune tolerance and influencing inflammation, underscore its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis. Clinically, alterations in VSIR expression are associated with various diseases, notably cancer, where it contributes to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, highlighting its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy (Xu2019ImmuneCheckpoint; Li2017Immunecheckpoint; Hosseinkhani2021The).

## Structure
The VISTA protein, encoded by the VSIR gene, is a type I transmembrane protein composed of 309 amino acids. Its structure includes an extracellular domain with a single Ig-V domain consisting of 136 amino acids, a 23-amino acid stalk region, a 21-residue transmembrane segment, and a 97-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (Xu2018The). The Ig-V domain is a characteristic feature of the B7 family of ligands and receptors, to which VISTA is aligned. However, VISTA is distinguished by additional cysteines within the Ig-V domain and a unique loop insertion between the C″ and D strands, which are invariant among VISTA orthologs but absent in other Ig superfamily members (Xu2018The).

The cytoplasmic domain of VISTA lacks ITAM, ITIM, or ITSM motifs but contains putative protein kinase C binding sites and proline-rich regions, whose functions are not yet characterized (Xu2018The). VISTA is highly conserved across species, with significant similarity between murine and human orthologs (Xu2018The). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in immune modulation, although specific details on secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The VSIR gene encodes the V-domain Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA), a protein that plays a crucial role in immune regulation. VISTA is an inhibitory immune-checkpoint molecule that is part of the B7 family of proteins. It is constitutively expressed on various immune cells, including CD11b+ myeloid dendritic cells, naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T cells (Xu2019ImmuneCheckpoint; Li2017Immunecheckpoint). In healthy human cells, VISTA functions by inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune reactions (Hosseinkhani2021The).

VISTA modulates immune responses by regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. It inhibits the activation of MAP kinases (MAPKs) and NF-κB signaling pathways, which are essential for the expression of inflammatory cytokines (Xu2019ImmuneCheckpoint). VISTA also plays a role in regulating TLR signaling in myeloid cells, contributing to the quiescence of naïve T cells and the regulation of inflammatory functions of macrophages (Hosseinkhani2021The). The protein's expression can be influenced by the TGF-β1 – Smad3 signaling pathway, which modulates its levels in different cell types (Schlichtner2022Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VSIR gene, also known as VISTA, have significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly in cancer and immune-related conditions. In cancer, VSIR is often overexpressed in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This overexpression is observed in several cancers, including gastrointestinal, pancreatic, colorectal, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and acute myeloid leukemia (Hosseinkhani2021The). In glioblastoma, VSIR expression in microglia and macrophages inhibits T cell proliferation, while in acute myeloid leukemia, its blockade enhances CD8+ T cell proliferation (Hosseinkhani2021The).

VSIR expression is also linked to poor prognosis in certain cancers, such as glioblastoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, where high levels are associated with shorter overall survival (Liu2022Identify). In melanoma, VISTA expression on tumor-infiltrating inflammatory cells correlates with poor disease-specific survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Kuklinski2018VISTA). Additionally, VSIR expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint pathways, influencing tumor immunity and patient outcomes (Liu2022Identify). These findings highlight the potential of targeting VSIR in cancer immunotherapy, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatments (Le2014VISTA).

## Interactions
VSIR, also known as VISTA, is involved in various interactions within the immune system. It functions as a ligand that can suppress T cell proliferation and cytokine production by interacting with a co-inhibitory receptor on T cells, inhibiting the phosphorylation of key TCR signaling molecules and upregulating activation markers (Xu2018The). VISTA also promotes the conversion of CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the presence of TGF-β, contributing to its inhibitory role (Xu2018The).

VISTA is expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as A20 B lymphoma cells and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), where it reduces T cell proliferation and cytokine production (Xu2018The). The protein is also involved in the regulation of immune responses through interactions with non-classical MHC molecules HLA-E and HLA-F, which have been identified as endogenous non-tumor ligands for VISTA (Shilts2022A).

The exact counter-receptor for VISTA remains unidentified, though it may interact with itself or with VSIG3 (IGSF11) (Xu2018The). These interactions highlight VISTA's role in modulating both innate and adaptive immunity, influencing immune tolerance and inflammation.
