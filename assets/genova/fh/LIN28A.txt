# LIN28A

## Overview
LIN28A is a gene that encodes the lin-28 homolog A protein, a highly conserved RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of developmental timing and maintenance of pluripotency. The lin-28 homolog A protein is characterized by its cold-shock domain (CSD) and CCHC-type zinc finger domains (ZKD), which facilitate its binding to RNA, particularly the terminal loops of pre-let-7 microRNAs, thereby inhibiting their maturation (Loughlin2011Structural; Hafner2013Identification). This protein plays a pivotal role in post-transcriptional regulation by interacting with various RNA molecules and proteins, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism (Faunes2020Role; Shyh-Chang2013Lin28). LIN28A's dysregulation is implicated in several cancers and neurological disorders, making it a significant focus of clinical research (Chang2019LIN; Wang2015Aberrant).

## Structure
LIN28A is a highly conserved RNA-binding protein characterized by two main domains: a cold-shock domain (CSD) and a pair of CCHC-type zinc finger domains (ZKD) (Hafner2013Identification). The CSD is involved in binding single-stranded RNA, particularly uridine-rich elements flanked by guanosines, and is common among RNA-binding proteins (Hafner2013Identification). The ZKD, consisting of two CCHC-type zinc fingers, interacts with guanosines downstream from the CSD-binding region, contributing to the protein's specificity in RNA recognition (Hafner2013Identification).

The structure of LIN28A allows it to bind to the terminal loops of pre-let-7 miRNA, inhibiting their processing and maturation. This interaction is facilitated by the zinc finger domains, which recognize specific RNA sequences and structures (Loughlin2011Structural). The protein's ability to bind diverse RNA targets is enhanced by the flexibility of the linker between the CSD and ZKD, which lacks secondary structure and allows for dynamic interactions with RNA (Nam2011Molecular).

LIN28A undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Hafner2013Identification).

## Function
LIN28A is a highly conserved RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in regulating developmental timing and maintaining pluripotency in human cells. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it binds to single-stranded RNA, particularly uridine-rich elements with flanking guanosines, and disrupts base-pairing to access these elements (Hafner2013Identification). LIN28A stabilizes target mRNAs and increases protein abundance, influencing gene expression during development and stem cell reprogramming (Hafner2013Identification).

One of LIN28A's key functions is its interaction with the let-7 microRNA family. LIN28A binds to the precursors of let-7 miRNAs, inhibiting their processing and maturation, which affects cell proliferation and differentiation (Hafner2013Identification). This regulation is crucial for maintaining a progenitor-like state in various tissues, including neural progenitor cells, where LIN28A influences cell cycle dynamics and differentiation timing (Faunes2020Role).

LIN28A also plays a role in enhancing tissue repair by reprogramming cellular metabolism. It promotes oxidative metabolism, including glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, by binding to mRNAs of metabolic enzymes and enhancing their translation. This activity supports cell migration and proliferation, essential for tissue repair processes (Shyh-Chang2013Lin28).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LIN28A gene are associated with various cancers. LIN28A is frequently up-regulated in human malignant tumors, contributing to cancer hallmarks such as increased cellular proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. This overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in cancers like colon, lung, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Wang2015Aberrant). In breast cancer, genetic variants affecting the let-7/LIN28 feedback loop, such as the rs3811463-C allele, lead to increased LIN28 expression and decreased let-7 levels, heightening cancer susceptibility (Chen2011Germline).

In brain tumors, LIN28A serves as a diagnostic marker for embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR), where it is highly upregulated compared to other brain tumors. Its expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes, making it a specific biomarker for ETMR (Korshunov2012LIN28A).

LIN28A mutations are also implicated in Parkinson's disease. The R192G variant of LIN28A is associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease, leading to developmental defects and PD-related phenotypes in neuronal cells. Correcting this variant in patient-derived cells has shown potential in improving disease symptoms, highlighting its significance in personalized medicine (Chang2019LIN).

## Interactions
LIN28A is an RNA-binding protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in post-transcriptional regulation. It is known to bind to let-7 microRNA precursors, inhibiting their maturation by recruiting the TUTase ZCCHC11, which adds uridines to pre-let-7, marking it for degradation (Piskounova2011Lin28A). This interaction is RNA-dependent and specific to LIN28A, as LIN28B does not interact with ZCCHC11 (Piskounova2011Lin28A).

LIN28A also forms complexes with other RNA-binding proteins, such as DDX3X, HNRNPH1, HNRNPU, and SYNCRIP, which are necessary for its function in regulating mRNA translation, including that of DNMT3A mRNA (Parisi2021Identification). These interactions suggest that LIN28A is part of larger ribonucleoprotein complexes that modulate mRNA translation (Parisi2021Identification).

In cancer cells, LIN28A interacts with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP28, which stabilizes LIN28A by reversing its ubiquitination, thereby enhancing its protein stability and oncogenic function (Haq2019The). This interaction is crucial for LIN28A's role in promoting cell viability and tumor progression (Haq2019The).
