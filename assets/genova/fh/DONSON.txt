# DONSON

## Overview
The DONSON gene encodes the DNA replication fork stabilization factor DONSON, a protein integral to the process of DNA replication and cell cycle progression. This protein is categorized as a replication factor due to its role in maintaining the stability of replication forks, which is crucial for ensuring accurate DNA synthesis and preserving genomic integrity. DONSON is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with various components of the DNA replication machinery, including TopBP1, GINS, and Cdc45, to facilitate the initiation and progression of DNA replication (Kingsley2023DONSON). Mutations in the DONSON gene are linked to several genetic disorders, such as Meier-Gorlin syndrome and microcephalic primordial dwarfism, underscoring its importance in normal growth and development (Matsuhashi2020DONSON; Knapp2019Linkedread). The protein's structural features, including a conserved globular core and flexible regions, enable its interactions with other replication factors, highlighting its essential role in maintaining genome stability (Kingsley2023DONSON).

## Structure
The DONSON protein is involved in DNA replication initiation and stabilization. Its structure, as predicted by AlphaFold, includes a long, mostly unstructured N-terminus (D1), a highly conserved folded globular core, and a flexible loop (D3) (Kingsley2023DONSON). The globular core is crucial for its function, as mutations in this region are linked to microcephalic primordial dwarfism and Meier-Gorlin syndrome, indicating its evolutionary conservation and functional importance (Kingsley2023DONSON). 

The N-terminus, although not conserved, and the flexible loop are essential for DONSON's role in DNA replication, as mutants lacking these regions fail to rescue DNA synthesis in DONSON-depleted extracts (Kingsley2023DONSON). The protein interacts with TopBP1, a master regulator of replication initiation, through a CDK-dependent mechanism, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions necessary for replication initiation (Kingsley2023DONSON). 

While specific details on secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of a globular core and flexible regions suggests a complex structure that facilitates its interactions with other replication factors. The structural integrity of DONSON is crucial for its function in DNA replication (Kingsley2023DONSON).

## Function
The DONSON gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA replication and cell cycle progression. It is involved in maintaining the stability of replication forks, which is essential for proper DNA synthesis and genome integrity. DONSON is highly co-expressed with genes involved in DNA replication complexes, such as DNA polymerase subunits and components of the DNA replication pre-initiation and replication fork complexes (Evrony2017Integrated). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it helps prevent replication stress and potential genomic instability, which are critical for normal cell division and development (Karaca2019Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, DONSON is essential for the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, a critical stage for cell division. Its function is linked to cell cycle progression, and its impairment leads to reduced cellular proliferation and growth, especially in organs like the brain that require high progenitor cell mitoses (Evrony2017Integrated). The gene's expression peaks in late G1 and S-phase, coinciding with the assembly of replication origins and genome replication (Evrony2017Integrated). This highlights its importance in maintaining proper cell division and growth, underscoring its vital role in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DONSON gene are associated with several genetic disorders, primarily characterized by growth and developmental abnormalities. Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGORS) is one such condition linked to biallelic pathogenic variants in DONSON. Individuals with MGORS typically present with short stature, microtia, and patella hypo/aplasia, and these variants disrupt DNA replication initiation, leading to growth deficiencies and skeletal anomalies (Knapp2019Linkedread).

DONSON mutations are also implicated in microcephaly-micromelia syndrome (MIMIS), a perinatal lethal condition characterized by severe microcephaly and limb anomalies. This syndrome has been observed in a First Nations community, highlighting the gene's role in brain and limb development (Evrony2017Integrated; Knapp2019Linkedread).

Microcephalic primordial dwarfism (MPD) is another disorder associated with DONSON mutations, where affected individuals exhibit microcephaly and short stature. These mutations lead to defects in centriole duplication and centrosome regulation, resulting in abnormal spindle formation and chromosomal segregation errors, which contribute to neurodevelopmental issues (Matsuhashi2020DONSON).

The clinical spectrum of conditions associated with DONSON mutations also includes cases with intellectual disability, hearing impairment, and skeletal abnormalities, as seen in patients with the p.Arg211Cys variant (Karaca2019Biallelic).

## Interactions
The DONSON protein is involved in several critical interactions during DNA replication. It interacts with terminated replisomes, suggesting a role in replisome disassembly. DONSON binds to chromatin during active DNA replication and co-immunoprecipitates with replisome components such as GINS and Cdc45, confirming its association with the replisome (Kingsley2023DONSON). It is essential for the initiation of DNA replication, facilitating the loading of Cdc45 and GINS onto the Mcm2-7 hexamer, which is crucial for the activation of the replicative helicase (Kingsley2023DONSON).

DONSON also interacts with other replication initiation factors, including TopBP1, RecQ4, and Treslin/MTBP, as shown through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (Kingsley2023DONSON). The interaction between DONSON and TopBP1 is significant and dependent on CDK activity, suggesting that DONSON may act as a functional homologue of Sld2 in higher eukaryotes (Kingsley2023DONSON). Additionally, DONSON is implicated in the ATR-dependent replication stress response and may function as a recruitment platform for factors that stabilize replication forks, such as SMARCAL1 and ZRANB3 (Zhang2020DONSON). These interactions highlight DONSON's role in maintaining genome stability and facilitating DNA replication.
