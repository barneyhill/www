# IL18

## Overview
Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a cytokine encoded by the IL18 gene, which plays a pivotal role in immune regulation and inflammatory responses. The IL18 gene is responsible for the production of the IL-18 protein, a member of the IL-1 cytokine family, characterized by its β-trefoil fold structure. This cytokine is synthesized as an inactive precursor and requires cleavage by caspase-1 to become active, facilitating its involvement in immune signaling pathways. IL-18 is primarily produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, and it exerts its effects by binding to the IL-18 receptor complex, triggering downstream signaling cascades that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The activity of IL-18 is tightly regulated by the IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), which acts as a decoy receptor to prevent excessive inflammation. Dysregulation of IL-18 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in disease pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Kaplanski2017Interleukin‐18:; Dinarello2013Interleukin-18; Trøseid2010The).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the human interleukin-18 (IL-18) protein is characterized by a β-trefoil fold, a common feature among IL-1 family cytokines. This structure consists of 12 β-strands forming three twisted four-stranded β-sheets, accompanied by one short α-helix and one 3_10-helix, which together create the β-trefoil architecture (Krumm2008Structural; Kato2003The). Despite a moderate sequence identity with IL-1β, IL-18 maintains a similar overall architecture, with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.60 Å for 70 Cα atoms in secondary structure elements (Kato2003The).

The IL-18 protein also features a flexible loop between residues 34 and 42, which is significant for its interaction with binding proteins and receptors (Krumm2008Structural). The interaction with IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) involves an induced-fit mechanism, where IL-18BP binds to the β-barrel of IL-18, forming extensive hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Krumm2008Structural).

IL-18 is synthesized as an inactive precursor and is cleaved by caspase-1 to become active. This processing is crucial for its role in immune responses (Dinarello2013Interleukin-18). The protein does not typically form quaternary structures, and its activity is modulated by IL-18BP, which acts as a negative feedback inhibitor (Krumm2014Structural).

## Function
Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in immune regulation and inflammatory responses in healthy human cells. It is primarily produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer (NK) cells as an inactive precursor, which is then activated by caspase-1 (Wawrocki2016Interleukin; Dinarello2013Interleukin-18). Once activated, IL-18 binds to its receptor, IL-18R, forming a signaling complex that recruits MyD88 and other molecules, leading to the activation of NF-κB and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kaplanski2017Interleukin‐18:; Dinarello2013Interleukin-18).

IL-18 is crucial for the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) from T-helper 1 (Th1) cells and NK cells, contributing to the Th1 immune response (Dinarello2013Interleukin-18; Novick2013Interleukin18). It also influences Th2 and Th17 cell responses, depending on the presence of other cytokines like IL-12 and IL-15 (Wawrocki2016Interleukin). In healthy cells, IL-18 is constitutively expressed in various tissues, including blood monocytes, epithelial cells, and keratinocytes, and is involved in maintaining immune homeostasis (Dinarello2001Novel; Novick2013Interleukin18). Its activity is regulated by IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), which prevents excessive inflammation by binding IL-18 with high affinity (Dinarello2007Interleukin18).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL18 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. Elevated IL-18 levels have been linked to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, contributing to obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. High IL-18 levels are consistently reported in patients with type 2 diabetes and are associated with complications such as nephropathy (Trøseid2010The). In cardiovascular diseases, IL-18 plays a significant role, with elevated levels predicting cardiovascular mortality and contributing to atherosclerosis and plaque instability (Tiret2005Genetic; Thompson2007Interleukin18).

IL-18 is also implicated in autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease, where it is associated with elevated IFNγ levels and Th1 and Th2 immune responses (Dinarello2013Interleukin-18). In inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn's disease, IL-18 facilitates the passage of macrophages into tissues, suggesting that blocking IL-18 could reduce inflammation (Dinarello2013Interleukin-18).

Genetic variations in the IL18 gene, such as those in the promoter region, can affect transcriptional activity and are associated with diseases like atherosclerosis and type I diabetes (Thompson2007Interleukin18). These variations may influence IL-18 serum levels and disease susceptibility (Tiret2005Genetic).

## Interactions
Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a cytokine that interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in immune signaling. IL-18 primarily binds to the IL-18 receptor complex, which consists of IL-18Rα and IL-18Rβ chains. This binding initiates signaling pathways that activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Rex2019A). The IL-18 receptor complex recruits MyD88, IRAK4, and IRAK1/2, forming the Myddosome complex, which then recruits TRAF6 to activate NF-κB and MAPK pathways (Rex2019A).

IL-18 also interacts with IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), which acts as a high-affinity decoy receptor, inhibiting IL-18's activity by preventing its interaction with IL-18Rα. This interaction suppresses the Th-1 response and regulates IFN-γ signaling (Rex2019A; Zhou2020IL18BP). IL-18BP binds IL-18 with higher affinity than IL-18Rα, forming a complex that blocks IL-18's receptor-binding site (Krumm2012A). The interaction between IL-18 and IL-18BP involves hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, with specific residues contributing to the binding affinity and stability of the complex (Krumm2012A).
