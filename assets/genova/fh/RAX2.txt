# RAX2

## Overview
The RAX2 gene encodes the retina and anterior neural fold homeobox 2 protein, a homeobox-containing transcription factor that is integral to retinal development and function. This protein is primarily expressed in the outer and inner nuclear layers of the retina, where it acts as a transcriptional coactivator. It plays a pivotal role in the differentiation and maintenance of photoreceptor cells by interacting with other transcription factors, such as CRX and NRL, forming complexes that regulate the expression of photoreceptor-specific genes. These interactions are crucial for the proper development and function of the retina, and disruptions can lead to inherited retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa and cone-rod dystrophy (Markitantova2020Inherited; Van2019Biallelic). The ongoing expression of RAX2 in adult cone photoreceptors underscores its importance in maintaining normal retinal function (Markitantova2020Inherited).

## Function
The RAX2 gene encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and function of the human retina. It is primarily expressed in the outer and inner nuclear layers of the retina, where it functions as a transcriptional coactivator. RAX2 synergistically enhances the transactivation activity of photoreceptor-specific transcription factors through physical interaction with CRX, a key regulator of photoreceptor gene expression (Van2019Biallelic). This interaction is essential for the regulation of spatial expression of photoreceptor-specific genes during late retinogenesis, which is critical for cell proliferation and differentiation within the retina (Markitantova2020Inherited).

RAX2 is involved in the differentiation of cone photoreceptor cells, although it is not sufficient to promote photoreceptor cell fate choice on its own (Markitantova2020Inherited). It forms a heterotrimeric complex with other transcription factors such as CRX and NRL, activating retinal transcription by recruiting coactivators and components of the basal transcription machinery (Van2019Biallelic). The gene's expression continues in the adult retina, specifically in cone photoreceptors, indicating its ongoing role in maintaining normal retinal function (Markitantova2020Inherited).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAX2 gene are associated with various inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), particularly autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). This condition is characterized by symptoms such as night blindness, constriction of the visual field, and loss of visual acuity. The study identified five novel pathogenic variants of RAX2, including both sequence and structural variants, in five unrelated families with nonsyndromic recessive or sporadic RP. These findings support RAX2 as a novel disease gene for recessively inherited RP, expanding the phenotypic and inheritance pattern spectrum associated with RAX2 mutations (Van2019Biallelic).

RAX2 mutations have also been tentatively linked to autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Different RAX2 variants may alter the transactivation activity of photoreceptor-specific transcription factors CRX and NRL, which are crucial for photoreceptor differentiation and function. This suggests that RAX2 variants can cause both dominant and recessive IRD phenotypes, similar to other retinal transcription factors like CRX and NRL (Van2019Biallelic).

The absence of homozygous loss of function variants in RAX2 in the gnomAD database indicates the rarity of such mutations, highlighting the gene's critical role in retinal transcription regulation (Van2019Biallelic).

## Interactions
RAX2 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor involved in retinal development. It interacts with other transcription factors, notably CRX and NRL, forming a heterotrimeric complex that regulates retinal transcription. CRX is essential for the differentiation and maintenance of photoreceptors, while NRL is crucial for rod photoreceptor differentiation. These interactions are significant as they influence the transactivation activity of CRX and NRL, which can lead to different retinal disease phenotypes when altered by RAX2 variants (Van2019Biallelic).

The RAX2 protein also interacts with CRX in a complex that binds to the photoreceptor conserved element-1 (PCE-1/Ret-1). Specific variants in RAX2, such as p.(Arg87Gln), can disrupt interactions between the homeodomains of RAX2 and CRX, potentially leading to a dominant-negative effect (Van2019Biallelic). These interactions highlight the role of RAX2 in the regulation of gene expression critical for retinal development and function. The disruption of these interactions due to pathogenic variants in RAX2 can result in inherited retinal diseases, including autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and cone-rod dystrophy (Van2019Biallelic).
