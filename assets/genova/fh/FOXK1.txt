# FOXK1

## Overview
FOXK1 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box K1 protein, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by a conserved Forkhead DNA-binding domain and an FHA (forkhead-associated) domain, which are essential for its function in transcriptional regulation. As a transcription factor, forkhead box K1 plays a pivotal role in regulating cell cycle progression and cellular metabolism, acting as both an activator and repressor depending on the cellular context. It is involved in critical processes such as insulin regulation of cellular and mitochondrial metabolism, and its activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins, including the MADS-box transcription factor SRF and the four-and-a-half LIM protein 2 (FHL2) in cancer cells. The dysregulation of FOXK1 expression has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, including colorectal, gastric, and esophageal cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Freddie2007Functional; Wu2016FOXK1; Sakaguchi2019FoxK1).

## Structure
The human FOXK1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the forkhead family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved Forkhead DNA-binding domain and an FHA (forkhead-associated) domain. The FHA domain precedes the Forkhead domain and is involved in phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of coactivators, which is crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor (Freddie2007Functional). The FOXK1 protein shares a high degree of sequence identity with its mouse homologue, Foxk1/MNF, at 90%, while the sequence conservation with the yeast Fkh2p is lower, at 20%, primarily within the FHA and Forkhead domains (Freddie2007Functional).

The protein's structure allows it to interact specifically with the MADS-box protein SRF, forming complexes that regulate gene expression in a DNA-binding independent manner (Freddie2007Functional). FOXK1 acts as a transcriptional repressor, inhibiting SRF-dependent promoter activity, with the N-terminal part, including the FHA domain, being sufficient for this repressive function (Freddie2007Functional). The presence of splice variant isoforms, such as MNFb in mice, suggests potential functional diversity through alternative splicing (Freddie2007Functional). The molecular structure of FOXK1, including its specific domains and interactions, underpins its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes.

## Function
FOXK1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression and cellular metabolism in healthy human cells. It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes necessary for cell cycle transitions, acting as both an activator and repressor depending on the promoter context and cell type (Grant2012Livecell). FOXK1 binds to the promoters of genes with peak expression in the G1/S and S phases of the cell cycle, such as TFDP1 and DHFR, and its knockdown results in cell cycle arrest (Grant2012Livecell).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, FOXK1 is involved in insulin regulation of cellular and mitochondrial metabolism. It interacts with insulin and IGF-1 receptors, influencing mitochondrial β-oxidation and biogenesis. FOXK1 modulates insulin signal transduction pathways, affecting genes related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial function (Sakaguchi2019FoxK1). The translocation of FOXK1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon insulin stimulation is crucial for its role in gene expression regulation, impacting pathways related to cell survival and stress response (Sakaguchi2019FoxK1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FOXK1 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high expression of FOXK1, particularly when co-expressed with FHL2, is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. This co-expression is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in CRC patients (Wu2016FOXK1). In gastric cancer, FOXK1 overexpression promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. It is directly regulated by the c-jun proto-oncogene, which contributes to its role in cancer progression (Peng2016Direct).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), FOXK1 is upregulated and correlates with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. It promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and its overexpression is linked to radioresistance by enhancing DNA damage repair mechanisms (Li2023FOXK1). FOXK1 also plays an oncogenic role in esophageal cancer, where its high expression is associated with poor differentiation and shorter overall survival (Chen2017FOXK1). These findings suggest that FOXK1 could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
FOXK1, a transcription factor, is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In human cells, FOXK1 interacts with the MADS-box transcription factor SRF (serum response factor). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of SRF target genes, such as SM α-actin and PPGB, where FOXK1 acts as a transcriptional repressor. The interaction between FOXK1 and SRF is both physical and functional, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. These studies show that FOXK1 can bind to the SM α-actin promoter in an SRF-dependent manner, and its repressive activity is contingent upon the presence of SRF binding sites (Freddie2007Functional).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), FOXK1 interacts with the four-and-a-half LIM protein 2 (FHL2). This interaction promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells, and is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The co-expression of FOXK1 and FHL2 enhances these oncogenic processes, and their interaction is confirmed in CRC cell lines (Wu2016FOXK1). These interactions highlight FOXK1's role in both normal cellular regulation and cancer progression.
