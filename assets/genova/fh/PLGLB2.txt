# PLGLB2

## Overview
PLGLB2 is a gene that encodes the protein plasminogen-like B2, which is part of the plasminogen-related protein family. This protein is involved in various biological processes, including fibrinolysis and tissue remodeling, due to its structural similarity to plasminogen, a key enzyme in the breakdown of blood clots. Plasminogen-like B2 is categorized as a serine protease, which is a type of enzyme that cleaves peptide bonds in proteins. The gene and its encoded protein have been studied for their potential roles in pathological conditions, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, due to their involvement in extracellular matrix degradation and cell migration (Qiu2020aarFDC).
