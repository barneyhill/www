# SLC22A8

## Overview
The SLC22A8 gene encodes the protein known as organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), which is a member of the solute carrier family 22. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is primarily involved in the renal uptake and excretion of a wide array of organic anions, including both endogenous metabolites and pharmaceutical compounds. OAT3 is characterized by its 12 predicted alpha-helical transmembrane domains, a structural feature typical of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), which facilitates its role in transporting substances across cell membranes (Koepsell2013The; Volk2013OCTs). The protein is predominantly expressed in the kidneys, where it plays a critical role in drug clearance and detoxification processes, but it is also found in other tissues such as the brain, liver, and skeletal muscle (Jacobsson2007Identification). Variations in the SLC22A8 gene can lead to differences in drug response and susceptibility to certain conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (Nigam2018The; Erdman2006The).

## Structure
The SLC22A8 gene encodes the organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), a member of the solute carrier family 22. The protein is characterized by a common membrane topology featuring 12 predicted alpha-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs), which are typical of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (Koepsell2013The; Volk2013OCTs). These TMDs are interspersed with a large extracellular loop between TMDs 1 and 2 and a large intracellular loop between TMDs 6 and 7. The extracellular loop is glycosylated, which may play a role in oligomerization, while the intracellular loop contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinases, suggesting a role in regulation (Volk2013OCTs).

The protein's binding pocket is formed by several TMDs and can adopt inward- or outward-oriented conformations, affecting substrate affinity (Volk2013OCTs). Specific amino acids within this pocket are crucial for substrate binding, with a conserved positively charged amino acid, Arg356, in TMD 7, potentially interacting with organic anions (Wu2009Analysis). The SLC22A8 protein is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, and is involved in the transport of organic anions (Jacobsson2007Identification).

## Function
The SLC22A8 gene encodes the organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), which is primarily expressed in the kidneys, specifically in the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. OAT3 plays a crucial role in the renal uptake and excretion of a wide variety of organic anions, including endogenous metabolites and pharmaceutical compounds (Koepsell2013The; Erdman2006The). It facilitates the transport of substances such as p-aminohippurate, estrone sulfate, benzylpenicillin, and certain antiviral drugs, operating through a tertiary active transport mechanism that involves the exchange of substrates with dicarboxylates like α-ketoglutarate (Vávra2022Functional; Yee2021Emerging).

OAT3 is also involved in the transport of signaling molecules and metabolic intermediates, contributing to the regulation of metabolic pathways and maintaining physiological balance (Nigam2018The). It is implicated in the renal elimination of drugs and toxins, playing a significant role in detoxification and drug clearance (Bhatnagar2006Analyses). Additionally, OAT3 is expressed in the brain, where it helps transport compounds across the blood-brain barrier, influencing the removal of neurotransmitter metabolites (Nigam2018The; Koepsell2013The). Genetic variations in SLC22A8 can lead to functional heterogeneity, affecting drug disposition and contributing to interindividual variation in drug response (Erdman2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC22A8 gene, which encodes the organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), have been associated with various clinical implications. Variants such as p.R149C have been shown to significantly reduce uric acid transport, potentially contributing to conditions like hyperuricemia and gout (Vávra2022Functional). Other variants, such as p.V448I and p.R513Q, while not significantly affecting urate uptake on their own, may contribute to these conditions when present alongside mutations in other transporters (Vávra2022Functional).

The SLC22A8 gene is also involved in the renal excretion of drugs and endogenous compounds. Variants like p.Ile305Phe have been found to alter substrate specificity, affecting the transport of certain drugs, which may lead to differences in drug disposition and response among individuals (Erdman2006The). This can have significant implications for pharmacogenetics, as variations in OAT3 activity could influence drug efficacy and toxicity (Erdman2006The).

Alterations in SLC22A8 expression or function can impact drug clearance and are associated with conditions such as chronic kidney disease and hypertension, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Nigam2018The).

## Interactions
The SLC22A8 gene encodes the organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. OAT3 is associated with lipid raft domains (LRDs) in the plasma membrane, which are cholesterol-rich areas that play a crucial role in its localization and function. These domains are characterized by the presence of cytoskeletal proteins such as myosin and β-actin, as well as caveolin 1 (Cav1), a marker for caveolae-type LRD membranes. The association of OAT3 with these domains is dependent on the integrity of the cytoskeleton, and disruption of this association can lead to altered localization and function of the transporter (Srimaroeng2013Regulation).

OAT3 is also involved in forming complexes with other proteins within these domains, although the exact nature of these interactions requires further investigation (Srimaroeng2013Regulation). The transporter is part of a larger network of interactions with various metabolites, including uremic toxins and gut microbiome-derived products, which are visualized using systems biology approaches (Engelhart2020Systems). These interactions highlight the regulatory role of OAT3 in metabolic processes and its potential impact on drug metabolism and excretion.
