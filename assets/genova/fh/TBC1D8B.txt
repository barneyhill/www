# TBC1D8B

## Overview
TBC1D8B is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 8B, which is a member of the TBC domain protein family. This protein functions as a Rab-GTPase activating protein (Rab-GAP), specifically targeting Rab11b, a key player in vesicular trafficking processes. TBC1D8B is characterized by its Rab-GAP domain, two GRAM domains, and an EF-Hand domain, which collectively contribute to its role in cellular signaling and trafficking, particularly in podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney. The protein's interaction with Rab11b is crucial for the recycling of vesicles, maintaining the integrity of the slit diaphragm in podocytes, and ensuring proper kidney function. Mutations in TBC1D8B have been linked to nephrotic syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in kidney health (Dorval2019TBC1D8B; Hou2021Novel).

## Structure
The TBC1D8B protein is a member of the TBC domain protein family, characterized by its role as a Rab-GTPase activating protein (Rab-GAP). The protein contains a Rab-GAP domain responsible for binding to specific Rab proteins and stimulating their GTPase activity (Dorval2019TBC1D8B). TBC1D8B also includes two GRAM domains, which facilitate binding to lipid rafts, crucial for signaling in podocytes (Dorval2019TBC1D8B; Hou2021Novel). The protein's structure is further defined by an EF-Hand domain at the C-terminal extremity, which serves as a calcium-binding regulation site, potentially downregulating protein activity upon calcium ion binding (Dorval2019TBC1D8B).

TBC1D8B exists in two isoforms due to alternative splicing. The second isoform is shorter, lacking the C-terminal extremity of the Rab-GAP domain and the entire EF-like domain, although the catalytic residues (Arg534 and Glu574) are present in both isoforms (Dorval2019TBC1D8B). The protein is specifically identified as a Rab11b-GTPase activating protein, indicating its role in promoting GTP hydrolysis in Rab11b, which is involved in vesicular trafficking (Dorval2019TBC1D8B). Mutations in the GRAM domains have been linked to nephrotic syndrome, underscoring the importance of the protein's structural integrity (Dorval2019TBC1D8B).

## Function
The TBC1D8B gene encodes a protein that functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specifically for Rab11b, a member of the Rab GTPase family. This protein is crucial for regulating vesicular trafficking processes, particularly in podocytes, which are specialized cells in the kidney. TBC1D8B facilitates the hydrolysis of GTP on Rab11b, a process essential for the recycling of vesicles from the perinuclear recycling compartment back to the plasma membrane. This recycling is vital for maintaining the integrity of the slit diaphragm in podocytes, which is crucial for proper kidney function (Dorval2019TBC1D8B; Hou2021Novel).

In healthy human cells, TBC1D8B is involved in endocytic and recycling pathways, ensuring the proper internalization and recycling of cellular components. It interacts specifically with Rab11b, indicating a specialized role in Rab11b-dependent recycling pathways, which are important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Dorval2019TBC1D8B). The protein also contains GRAM domains that bind to lipid rafts, which are key elements in signaling within podocytes (Hou2021Novel). TBC1D8B's role in these processes is essential for preventing proteinuria and maintaining normal kidney function (Hou2021Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBC1D8B gene are implicated in the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome, particularly steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). These conditions are characterized by high-range proteinuria and can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in young individuals (Dorval2019TBC1D8B). TBC1D8B functions as a Rab-GTPase-activating protein involved in endocytic and recycling pathways, which are crucial for podocyte function. Mutations in TBC1D8B disrupt these pathways, leading to podocyte architectural changes and migration defects, common features in FSGS (Dorval2019TBC1D8B).

Research has shown that TBC1D8B mutations result in defective trafficking pathways, specifically affecting the interaction with Rab11b, a key protein in vesicular recycling. This disruption leads to decreased internalization and recycling processes in podocytes and fibroblasts, contributing to nephrotic syndrome (Dorval2019TBC1D8B). In zebrafish models, knockdown or knockout of TBC1D8B induced proteinuria and glomerular permeability defects, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by wild-type human TBC1D8B mRNA (Dorval2019TBC1D8B). These findings highlight the critical role of TBC1D8B in maintaining normal kidney function and its involvement in nephrotic syndrome when mutated.

## Interactions
TBC1D8B is a GTPase-activating protein that interacts specifically with Rab11b, a member of the Rab GTPase family. This interaction is crucial for regulating vesicular trafficking, particularly in the endocytic and recycling pathways. TBC1D8B acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab11b, facilitating its role in the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC) dynamics and recycling processes in podocytes. This interaction is essential for maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier by regulating the recycling of slit diaphragm proteins (Dorval2019TBC1D8B).

Mutations in TBC1D8B can lead to defects in these pathways, resulting in delayed transferrin uptake and recycling, which are indicative of impaired endocytosis and recycling functions. These mutations can trap Rab11b in the PNRC, disrupting the normal recycling processes and potentially contributing to nephrotic syndrome (Dorval2019TBC1D8B).

TBC1D8B also interacts with nephrin, a key protein in the slit diaphragm of podocytes, through Rab11-dependent vesicle transport pathways. This interaction is vital for maintaining podocyte structure and function, and disruptions can lead to structural abnormalities in podocytes, contributing to nephrotic syndrome (Hou2021Novel).
