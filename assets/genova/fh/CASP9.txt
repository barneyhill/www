# CASP9

## Overview
The CASP9 gene encodes caspase-9, a crucial initiator caspase involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Caspase-9 is a cysteine-aspartic protease that plays a pivotal role in programmed cell death by mediating the activation of downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3, following mitochondrial cytochrome c release and apoptosome formation (Avrutsky2021Caspase9:; Kim2014Caspase9). The CASP9 gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct functional properties, including dominant-negative variants that modulate apoptosis (Angelastro2001Characterization). Beyond apoptosis, caspase-9 is implicated in non-apoptotic processes such as autophagy and cellular differentiation, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis (An2019CASP9; Avrutsky2021Caspase9:). Dysregulation of CASP9 is associated with various pathologies, including cancer, neural tube defects, and cardiovascular diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Brynychova2016Transcript; Avrutsky2021Caspase9:).

## Structure
Caspase-9 (CASP9) is a crucial component of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, characterized by its unique structural features. The protein contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which is a six-helix bundle facilitating interactions with the apoptosome through homotypic interactions with the CARD of apoptotic protease activation factor 1 (Apaf-1) (Huber2018Caspase9; Bratton2010Regulation). This domain is essential for the recruitment and activation of caspase-9 within the apoptosome complex (Huber2018Caspase9).

Caspase-9 is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and exists in equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric states, with dimerization being necessary for its activation (Huber2018Caspase9). The catalytic core of caspase-9 is composed of large and small subunits connected by an intersubunit linker, which supports the ordering of the active site and CARD interaction (Huber2018Caspase9). The active site of caspase-9 is formed by four mobile loops, and its proper ordering is crucial for the CARD:core interaction (Huber2018Caspase9).

Alternative splicing of the CASP9 gene results in isoforms such as casp-9-CTD, which lacks certain residues necessary for substrate recognition and processing, leading to altered enzyme specificity and reduced catalytic activity (Angelastro2001Characterization). This isoform acts as a dominant-negative variant, inhibiting apoptosis by preventing the activation of downstream executioner caspases (Angelastro2001Characterization).

## Function
Caspase-9 (CASP9) is a critical initiator caspase in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, primarily involved in programmed cell death. In healthy human cells, CASP9 is activated in response to mitochondrial signals, forming part of the apoptosome complex with cytochrome c and apoptosis-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). This activation leads to the cleavage and activation of downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3, which execute apoptosis, ensuring the removal of damaged or unnecessary cells and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Avrutsky2021Caspase9:; Kim2014Caspase9).

Beyond its apoptotic role, CASP9 is involved in non-apoptotic processes, including the regulation of autophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis. It is essential for autophagosome maturation, as its activity influences mitochondrial dynamics, such as fusion and fission, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (An2019CASP9). CASP9 also plays a role in cellular differentiation and maturation, contributing to various cellular functions that support tissue integrity and health (Avrutsky2021Caspase9:). The regulation of CASP9 activity is complex, involving interactions with proteins like XIAP and modulation through phosphorylation, ensuring its activity is tightly controlled to prevent excessive cell death (Cardone1998Regulation; Kim2014Caspase9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CASP9 gene are associated with a variety of diseases. Specific genetic variants, such as G66A, R191G, and Y251C, have been linked to neural tube defects (NTDs) due to impaired apoptosis under low folate conditions. The Y251C mutation affects protein stability, while the H237P variant results in a complete absence of caspase-9 protein expression, leading to reduced apoptosis (Avrutsky2021Caspase9:; Liu2018Genetic). The H237P mutation is also associated with immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferation, as it disrupts normal apoptotic processes and alters immune cell receptor expression (Clemente2015A).

In cancer, CASP9 polymorphisms have been linked to various malignancies, including lung, esophagus, liver, and breast cancers. The Q221R mutation is associated with an increased risk of multiple cancers, though its functional impact is unclear (Avrutsky2021Caspase9:). In breast cancer, the CASP9A/B isoform expression ratio is associated with prognosis, with a low ratio linked to shorter disease-free survival (Brynychova2016Transcript).

Alterations in CASP9 expression are also implicated in cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, where increased expression is found in atherosclerotic arteries (Avrutsky2021Caspase9:). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of CASP9 mutations and expression alterations in human diseases.

## Interactions
Caspase-9 (CASP9) is a key player in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, interacting with several proteins to regulate apoptosis. CASP9 is activated through its recruitment to the apoptosome, a multiprotein complex formed by Apaf-1 and cytochrome c in the presence of dATP or ATP. This interaction is mediated by the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of Apaf-1, which binds to the CARD of CASP9, facilitating its activation and subsequent cleavage of downstream effector caspases like caspase-3 (Li1997Cytochrome).

CASP9 is also regulated by the inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP. XIAP binds to CASP9 through its BIR3 domain, inhibiting CASP9's catalytic activity by sequestering it in a monomeric state. This interaction involves the binding of the BIR3 domain to the N-terminal tetrapeptide of the small subunit of CASP9, with key residues Trp310, Glu314, and His343 of XIAP being essential for this inhibition (Riedl2004Molecular).

Beyond its role in apoptosis, CASP9 is involved in endosomal transport, interacting with proteins such as RAB7A, VPS35, and SNX dimers. These interactions suggest a role for CASP9 in the retrograde transport of IGF2R and lysosomal biogenesis (Han2020Involvement).
