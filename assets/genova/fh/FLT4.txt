# FLT4

## Overview
FLT4 is a gene that encodes the fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 4, also known as VEGFR-3, a critical component in the regulation of lymphangiogenesis. This receptor tyrosine kinase is characterized by its structure, which includes an extracellular region with seven immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. VEGFR-3 is primarily expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells and is activated by its ligands, VEGF-C and VEGF-D, leading to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. This activation triggers downstream signaling pathways that are essential for lymphatic vessel formation, maintenance, and function. The FLT4 gene and its encoded protein play a pivotal role in maintaining fluid balance, immune response, and lipid absorption, and mutations in this gene are associated with various clinical conditions, including Milroy disease and congenital heart defects (Agnès1997Genomic; Sheik2015FOXC2andFLT4Gene; Brouillard2014Genetics).

## Structure
The FLT4 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase known as VEGFR-3, which is involved in lymphangiogenesis. The protein structure includes an extracellular region with seven immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (Agnès1997Genomic; Fournier1996Interaction). The FLT4 protein is expressed in two isoforms: a long form (FLT4L) and a short form (FLT4S). The long isoform differs by an additional 65 amino acids at the C-terminus, which includes three conserved tyrosine residues: Tyr 1333, Tyr 1337, and Tyr 1363 (Fournier1996Interaction).

The FLT4 receptor undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is crucial for its function. The Tyr 1337 residue is particularly important for interaction with the SHC protein's phosphotyrosine binding domain, which is essential for the receptor's transforming activity (Fournier1996Interaction). The receptor's quaternary structure involves dimerization upon ligand binding, which is typical for receptor tyrosine kinases (Joukov1996A). The FLT4 gene's exon/intron structure is similar to other receptor tyrosine kinases with immunoglobulin-like domains, indicating evolutionary conservation (Agnès1997Genomic).

## Function
The FLT4 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase known as VEGFR-3, which is primarily involved in the regulation of lymphangiogenesis, the formation of lymphatic vessels. In healthy human cells, FLT4 is expressed predominantly in lymphatic endothelial cells and plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the lymphatic system. The receptor is activated by its ligands, VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which leads to dimerization and autophosphorylation of the receptor, initiating downstream signaling pathways essential for lymphatic vessel formation and function (Quentmeier2012DNA; Sheik2015FOXC2andFLT4Gene).

FLT4 signaling is critical for the transduction of signals that promote cell proliferation, migration, and survival, contributing to the stability and integrity of the lymphatic network (Sheik2015FOXC2andFLT4Gene). This signaling pathway is also involved in the regulation of endothelial cell sprouting and differentiation, as evidenced by its role in inducing cell-cycle arrest in endothelial cells to facilitate these processes (Jerafi-Vider2021VEGFC/FLT4-induced). The proper function of FLT4 ensures the maintenance of fluid balance, immune response, and lipid absorption within the organism (Quentmeier2012DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FLT4 gene, which encodes the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3), are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the lymphatic and cardiovascular systems. One of the most notable conditions linked to FLT4 mutations is Milroy disease, a form of primary congenital lymphedema. This condition is characterized by swelling due to lymphatic dysfunction, typically affecting the lower limbs from birth. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains of FLT4 reduce kinase activity, impairing lymphatic development and function (Liu2021FLT4; Brouillard2014Genetics).

FLT4 mutations have also been implicated in congenital heart defects, such as the tetralogy of Fallot. These mutations can lead to loss of function in the VEGFR-3 protein, contributing to the pathogenesis of these defects (Tabib2022A). Additionally, FLT4 mutations can occur in both autosomal dominant and recessive patterns, with compound heterozygous variants leading to autosomal recessive hereditary lymphedema (Xiang2023Case; MelikhanRevzin2015A). The genetic heterogeneity and variable clinical presentations associated with FLT4 mutations underscore the complexity of its role in human disease (Liu2021FLT4).

## Interactions
FLT4, also known as VEGFR-3, is a receptor tyrosine kinase that interacts with several proteins to mediate its signaling functions. One of the key interactions is with the SHC adaptor protein, which is crucial for the transforming activity of FLT4. This interaction is mediated through the phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB) of SHC, specifically at the phosphorylated tyrosine residue Tyr 1337 of the long isoform of FLT4 (FLT4L). Mutations at Tyr 1337 and Asn 1334 significantly reduce SHC phosphorylation and disrupt the co-immunoprecipitation of the receptor, indicating these residues are essential for the interaction (Fournier1996Interaction).

FLT4 also interacts with the GRB2 adaptor protein. The cytoplasmic region of FLT4L binds directly to GRB2, and a second pool of GRB2 is recruited through its interaction with SHC. This interaction is important for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is involved in cell survival and proliferation (Salameh2005Direct; Fournier1999Role).

Additionally, FLT4 interacts with its ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which are crucial for its role in lymphangiogenesis and vascular development (Joukov1996A). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions that FLT4 engages in to regulate endothelial cell function and signaling pathways.
