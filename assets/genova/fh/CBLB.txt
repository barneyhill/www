# CBLB

## Overview
The CBLB gene encodes the Cbl-b protein, a member of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune responses. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cbl-b is involved in tagging proteins for degradation or functional modification, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating immune cell signaling pathways (Qingjun2014E3). The protein is characterized by several structural domains, including a tyrosine kinase binding domain, a linker helix region, and a RING finger domain, which are essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity (Kimani2023The; Thien2005cCbl). Cbl-b is particularly significant in T cells, where it regulates activation thresholds and peripheral tolerance, preventing excessive immune responses that could lead to autoimmunity (Bachmaier2000Negative; Chiang2000Cblb). Additionally, Cbl-b's interactions with various proteins and its involvement in endocytic pathways underscore its role in cellular signaling and immune regulation (Voisinne2016Co‐recruitment; Liu2021Stable). The clinical significance of CBLB is highlighted by its association with autoimmune diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target (LutzNicoladoni2015Modulation; Fujiwara2017Cblb).

## Structure
The CBLB gene encodes the Cbl-b protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in regulating immune responses. The protein structure includes several key domains: an N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR), and a RING finger domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity (Kimani2023The; Thien2005cCbl). The TKBD is composed of a four-helix bundle, a calcium-binding EF-hand fold, and a variant Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, forming a unique phosphotyrosine-recognition module (Kimani2023The; Thien2005cCbl). The RING finger domain recruits E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, facilitating the ubiquitination process (Swaminathan2006The).

Cbl-b also contains a proline-rich region and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain in its C-terminal extension, which are involved in protein interactions (Kimani2023The; Thien2005cCbl). The UBA domain can bind ubiquitin, although this is not essential for its E3 ligase activity (Thien2005cCbl). Phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues, such as Y363, is critical for activating Cbl-b's ligase function (Kimani2023The). Cbl-b has splice variant isoforms, including one that is 172 amino acids shorter and another with a unique sequence insertion, altering its length by 213 amino acids (Swaminathan2006The).

## Function
The CBLB gene encodes the Cbl-b protein, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a critical role in regulating immune cell signaling pathways. Cbl-b is involved in the ubiquitination process, where it tags proteins for degradation or functional modification, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qingjun2014E3). It is particularly active in T cells, where it sets the activation threshold and regulates peripheral tolerance by modulating signaling pathways such as the Vav1-WASP pathway and NF-κB activation (Qingjun2014E3). Cbl-b negatively regulates T-cell activation by enforcing the requirement for CD28 co-stimulation, preventing excessive immune responses that could lead to autoimmunity (Bachmaier2000Negative; Chiang2000Cblb).

In B cells, Cbl-b acts as a negative regulator of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, affecting downstream pathways like MAPKs and NF-κB, which are crucial for immune responses (Qingjun2014E3). Cbl-b is expressed in various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells, and is involved in maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity (LutzNicoladoni2015Modulation). Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which are essential for its function in immune cell signaling (Qingjun2014E3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CBLB gene are associated with several autoimmune diseases and immune-related conditions. Cbl-b deficiency in mice leads to spontaneous autoimmunity, characterized by the production of autoantibodies and infiltration of activated T and B cells into multiple organs, indicating its crucial role in maintaining peripheral tolerance (LutzNicoladoni2015Modulation; Bachmaier2000Negative). In humans, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CBLB gene have been linked to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis (Fujiwara2017Cblb).

Cbl-b also plays a significant role in regulating T cell activation thresholds and antigen affinity, impacting the development of autoimmune diabetes and other autoimmune conditions (LutzNicoladoni2015Modulation). Cbl-b deficiency results in resistance to TGF-β-mediated suppression, affecting regulatory T cell function and promoting pro-inflammatory responses (Tang2019Regulation).

Alterations in Cbl-b expression influence T helper cell polarization, contributing to conditions like asthma (LutzNicoladoni2015Modulation). Additionally, mutations in Cbl-b are associated with myeloproliferative disorders and advanced mastocytosis, affecting E3 ligase activity crucial for oncogenic processes (LutzNicoladoni2015Modulation). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CBLB in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CBLB, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in signal transduction pathways. It shares structural similarities with the CBL protein, including a tyrosine kinase binding domain, a linker domain, and a RING finger domain, which are essential for its E3 ligase activity and substrate specificity (Liu2021Stable). CBLB interacts with the GRB2 adaptor protein through its proline-rich domain, forming a constitutive complex that is not altered by FL stimulation (LavagnaSévenier1998The). This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal SH3 domain of GRB2 (LavagnaSévenier1998The).

CBLB also interacts with components of the endocytic machinery, such as ITSN2, EPS15L1, CD2AP, and SH3KBP1, which are involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis and EGFR internalization (Liu2021Stable). In T cells, CBLB is recruited to the immunological synapse by CD5, organizing ubiquitylation following TCR stimulation and downregulating TCR signals (Voisinne2016Co‐recruitment). CBLB's UBA domain preferentially binds to tetraubiquitin chains, playing a role in ubiquitin-mediated processes (Davies2004Cblb). These interactions highlight CBLB's involvement in regulating immune responses and cellular signaling.
