# RBCK1

## Overview
RBCK1 is a gene that encodes the RANBP2-type and C3HC4-type zinc finger containing 1 protein, which is a member of the RING-IBR protein family. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. It is a crucial component of the Linear Ubiquitination Chain Assembly Complex (LUBAC), which is involved in the activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway, essential for immune response regulation and cell survival. The RBCK1 protein is characterized by its complex domain structure, including a ubiquitin-like sequence, coiled-coil regions, and a RING-IBR domain, which are integral to its function in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes (Yoshimoto2005Cytoplasmic; Eisenhaber2007The). Mutations in the RBCK1 gene are linked to a rare multisystem disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as polyglucosan body myopathy and immunological dysfunction (Krenn2017Mutations; Nilsson2013Polyglucosan).

## Structure
RBCK1 is a protein that belongs to the RING-IBR protein family and is characterized by its complex domain structure. The protein consists of 498 amino acid residues and includes a ubiquitin-like (UBL) sequence, two coiled-coil regions, and a RING-IBR domain, arranged from the N- to C-terminus (Yoshimoto2005Cytoplasmic). The RING-IBR domain is composed of two RING fingers and an 'in-between-RING fingers' (IBR) domain, which are crucial for its transcriptional activity (Yoshimoto2005Cytoplasmic). This domain structure is typical of proteins involved in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes, as seen in other RBR proteins (Eisenhaber2007The).

RBCK1 also contains a classical Leu-rich nuclear export signal (NES) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which facilitate its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Yoshimoto2005Cytoplasmic). The protein interacts with itself and its splice variant RBCK2, which lacks the C-terminal half, including the RING-IBR domain, and shows no transcriptional activity (Yoshimoto2005Cytoplasmic). RBCK2 can repress RBCK1's transcriptional activity by forming a hetero-oligomeric complex, tethering RBCK1 in the cytoplasm (Yoshimoto2005Cytoplasmic). The UBL region (residues 1-120) is not involved in the interaction between RBCK1 and RBCK2 (Yoshimoto2005Cytoplasmic).

## Function
The RBCK1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation within cells. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, determining the specificity of the ubiquitination process by recognizing target substrates and facilitating their tagging for degradation (Wang2013Wholegenome). RBCK1 is a component of the Linear Ubiquitination Chain Assembly Complex (LUBAC), which is involved in the activation of the canonical NF-kB pathway in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-1β. This pathway is critical for preventing cell death and regulating immune responses (Shinwari2021Identifying).

In healthy human cells, RBCK1 is involved in maintaining balanced immune responses and preventing excessive inflammation by ensuring proper signaling through the NF-kB and PI3K/Akt pathways (Shinwari2021Identifying). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell survival, proliferation, and immune response modulation (Taminiau2016HOXA1). Additionally, RBCK1 interacts with other proteins, such as HOXA1 and TRAF2, to modulate the TNF/NF-kB signaling pathway, highlighting its complex role in cell signaling and regulation (Taminiau2016HOXA1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RBCK1 gene are associated with a rare multisystem disorder characterized by polyglucosan body accumulation, leading to conditions such as polyglucosan body myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and immunological dysfunction. These mutations can result in a range of clinical manifestations, including skeletal muscle weakness, cardiac involvement, and chronic autoinflammation (Krenn2017Mutations; Nilsson2013Polyglucosan). The specific phenotype often depends on the mutation's location within the gene. N-terminal mutations are typically linked to severe immunological dysfunction, while mutations in the mid- and C-terminal regions are more likely to cause myopathy and cardiomyopathy without immunodeficiency (Phadke2020RBCK1‐related; Krenn2017Mutations).

RBCK1 is part of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which is crucial for NF-κB pathway activation, affecting inflammatory and immune responses. Disruption of this complex due to RBCK1 mutations can impair NF-κB activation, leading to unbalanced cellular responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines and resulting in conditions such as auto-inflammation and recurrent infections (Phadke2020RBCK1‐related; Shinwari2021Identifying). The variability in clinical outcomes underscores the complexity of RBCK1-related disorders and the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and management (AlAnzi2022A).

## Interactions
RBCK1, also known as HOIL-1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It is a component of the Linear Ubiquitination Chain Assembly Complex (LUBAC), which includes HOIP and SHARPIN, and plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses through the NF-κB signaling pathway (Shinwari2021Identifying). RBCK1 interacts with the YAP protein in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, where it acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to regulate YAP stability and ubiquitination. This interaction involves the RBR domain of RBCK1 and the TA domain of YAP, leading to YAP degradation via K48-linked poly-ubiquitination (Li2022RBCK1).

RBCK1 also interacts with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in breast cancer cells, enhancing ERα promoter activity and expression. This interaction is facilitated by RBCK1's recruitment to the ERα promoter, where it cooperates with protein kinase C beta 1 (PKCβ1) to regulate gene expression (Gustafsson2012Estrogen). In renal cell carcinoma, RBCK1 interacts with the p53 protein, promoting its degradation through ubiquitination. This interaction is mediated by the RBR-C domain of RBCK1 and the DNA-binding domain of p53, affecting p53 stability and function (Yu2019RBCK1).
