# CLPSL1

## Overview
The CLPSL1 gene encodes the colipase-like 1 protein, which is a paralog of colipase, a critical cofactor in lipid digestion. Colipase-like 1 is categorized as a lipid metabolism-associated protein, given its structural and functional similarities to colipase, which aids pancreatic lipase in the hydrolysis of dietary lipids by anchoring it to the lipid-water interface (Vicedomini2021Dietary). While the precise biological role of CLPSL1 in humans is not fully understood, it is expressed in the cytoplasm of glandular cells in the epididymis, suggesting a specialized function in lipid metabolism within certain tissues (Sivertsson2020Enhanced). The gene has been noted for its evolutionary significance, particularly in Neanderthals, where it shows a positive copy number variation trend, possibly reflecting adaptations to a lipid-rich diet (Vicedomini2021Dietary). Despite these insights, the detailed molecular mechanisms and broader physiological implications of CLPSL1 remain to be comprehensively characterized.

## Function
The CLPSL1 gene encodes a protein that is a paralog of colipase, which plays a crucial role in lipid digestion and transport. Colipases are essential cofactors for pancreatic lipase, facilitating the efficient hydrolysis of dietary lipids. They enable the lipase to attach to the lipid-water interface, preventing it from being displaced by bile salts, which is vital for the digestion of dietary fats (Vicedomini2021Dietary). Although the specific function of CLPSL1 in healthy human cells is not well-characterized, it is known to be expressed in the cytoplasm of glandular cells in the epididymis (Sivertsson2020Enhanced). This suggests a potential role in lipid metabolism within specific tissues. The gene has shown a positive copy number variation trend in Neanderthals, indicating its possible significance in their diet, which might have been rich in lipids due to environmental conditions or dietary habits (Vicedomini2021Dietary). However, no such trend is observed in modern Homo sapiens, suggesting differences in dietary adaptations between these populations. The exact molecular activities and organismal outcomes of CLPSL1 in humans remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the CLPSL1 gene, which encodes a protein similar to colipase involved in lipid digestion, is not well-documented in terms of specific diseases or conditions resulting from its mutations or expression alterations. However, some studies have suggested potential roles in various contexts. In pancreatic cancer, CLPSL1 was identified as a downregulated gene, indicating that its role in this type of cancer requires further investigation (Mao2017RNA). In lung cancer, CLPSL1 was part of the overlap between differentially expressed genes associated with mitosis, suggesting its potential involvement in resistance mechanisms specific to lung cancer (Tomasi2024Investigating).

Additionally, a study on structural variations in Asian genomes identified a duplication overlapping the CLPSL1 gene, which is common across several populations, though its direct clinical implications remain unclear (Bertin2023A). In a study on inflammation, CLPSL1 showed a significant correlation with C-reactive protein levels, a marker of inflammation, but no direct link to specific diseases was established (Kim2024An). These findings suggest that while CLPSL1 may play a role in certain conditions, its clinical significance requires further research.
