# LMNA

## Overview
The LMNA gene encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and lamin C, which are classified as type V intermediate filament proteins. These proteins are integral components of the nuclear lamina, a dense fibrillar network inside the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, providing structural support and playing a pivotal role in various nuclear functions. Lamin A and C are involved in maintaining nuclear integrity, regulating gene expression, and facilitating DNA replication and repair. The LMNA gene undergoes alternative splicing to produce these two isoforms, which differ in their C-terminal regions. Mutations in LMNA are associated with a spectrum of genetic disorders known as laminopathies, which include muscular dystrophies, cardiomyopathies, lipodystrophies, and premature aging syndromes (Worman2009Laminopathies; Bonne1999Mutations).

## Structure
The LMNA gene encodes lamin A/C, a type V intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining nuclear structure. The primary structure of lamin A/C includes a central α-helical coiled-coil rod domain, flanked by a non-α-helical N-terminal head and a C-terminal tail domain. The tail domain contains a globular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold, which is a novel subtype of Ig-related domain specific to lamins (DhePaganon2002Structure; Turgay2017The).

In terms of secondary structure, the lamin A/C protein forms coiled-coil dimers through its central rod domain. These dimers interact longitudinally and laterally to form higher-order structures. The tertiary structure of the globular tail domain is composed entirely of beta strands, forming a beta sandwich, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (DhePaganon2002Structure).

The quaternary structure involves the assembly of lamin A/C dimers into head-to-tail polymers, creating a filamentous meshwork within the nuclear lamina. This assembly is facilitated by specific interactions, such as the A11 interaction, which is essential for lamin filament formation (Ahn2019Structural).

Lamin A/C undergoes post-translational modifications, including farnesylation and phosphorylation, which are important for its function and regulation. The LMNA gene produces splice variants, resulting in lamin A and C isoforms, which differ in their C-terminal regions (DhePaganon2002Structure).

## Function
The LMNA gene encodes lamin A and C, which are integral components of the nuclear lamina, a structure that provides mechanical support to the nucleus in healthy human cells. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization, gene transcription, and DNA replication (Worman2009Laminopathies; ButinIsraeli2012Nuclear). Lamin A is synthesized as prelamin A, which undergoes post-translational modifications to become mature lamin A, a process essential for its proper incorporation into the nuclear lamina (Capell2006Human).

A-type lamins, including lamin A and C, play a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by tethering chromatin and protein complexes, contributing to the maintenance of telomeres and the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway (GonzalezSuarez2010Nurturing). They interact with several proteins of the inner nuclear membrane and transcription factors, influencing the organization of the nuclear envelope and chromatin during interphase (Worman2009Laminopathies). These interactions are vital for the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure, impacting cellular differentiation and tissue integrity (Capell2006Human).

In addition to structural roles, A-type lamins are involved in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, influencing RNA splicing and transcriptional regulation (Capell2006Human). The LMNA gene's function is multifaceted, impacting both the mechanical properties of the nucleus and the regulation of gene expression.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C, are associated with a wide range of disorders collectively known as laminopathies. These include Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), characterized by muscle weakness, early tendon contractures, and cardiomyopathy (Lu2011LMNA; Bonne1999Mutations). LMNA mutations also cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B), which affects proximal skeletal muscles and is often accompanied by cardiac issues (Lu2011LMNA; Scharner2011Novel).

In addition to muscular dystrophies, LMNA mutations are linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and conduction system disease, which can lead to arrhythmias and heart failure (van2007High; Lu2011LMNA). The gene is also implicated in familial partial lipodystrophy of Dunnigan type (FPLD), characterized by abnormal fat distribution and metabolic syndrome (Bertrand2011Clinical).

Premature aging syndromes such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) are also caused by LMNA mutations. HGPS is associated with a specific splicing defect leading to the production of a toxic protein called progerin (Bertrand2011Clinical; Csoka2004Novel). The R644C mutation in LMNA is noted for its extreme phenotypic diversity, causing conditions ranging from left ventricular hypertrophy to atypical progeria (Rankin2008Extreme).

## Interactions
The LMNA gene encodes lamin A/C, which are integral components of the nuclear lamina and participate in various protein interactions crucial for maintaining nuclear structure and function. Lamin A/C interacts with a wide range of proteins, forming multiprotein complexes that play roles in nuclear processes such as genome organization, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Dittmer2014Systematic). Among the identified interactors are emerin, nesprins, and components of the LINC complex, which connects the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton (Yang2013Mutations; Dittmer2014Systematic).

Mutations in LMNA can disrupt these interactions, leading to various diseases known as laminopathies. For instance, the interaction between lamin A and matrin-3 is affected by myopathy-associated mutations, such as Δ303 and R453W, which alter the biophysical properties of mutant cells (Depreux2015Disruption). Similarly, mutations like V415I and Q432X modulate the interaction between lamin A and Nesprin-2, affecting nuclear stability and contributing to disease phenotypes like cardiomyopathy (Yang2013Mutations).

Lamin A also interacts with chromatin and transcription factors, influencing DNA replication and repair. The Ig-like domain of lamin A is a key interaction hotspot, and mutations in this domain can significantly impact protein interactions, contributing to the tissue-specific appearance of laminopathic phenotypes (Dittmer2014Systematic).
