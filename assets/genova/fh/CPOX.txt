# CPOX

## Overview
The CPOX gene encodes the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase, a key player in the heme biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidase and is responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX, a precursor to heme. The gene is located on chromosome 3q11.2 and consists of seven exons. The enzyme is synthesized in the cytosol and transported to the mitochondria, where it becomes active. Structurally, coproporphyrinogen oxidase forms a homodimer and does not require metal ions or cofactors for its activity, relying instead on molecular oxygen. Mutations in the CPOX gene can lead to hereditary coproporphyria, a disorder characterized by neurovisceral attacks and skin photosensitivity, and a distinct subtype known as Harderoporphyria, which presents with neonatal jaundice and hemolytic anemia (Kim2013The; Lee2005Structural; Hasanoglu2010Harderoporphyria).

## Structure
The human gene CPOX encodes the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase, which plays a crucial role in heme biosynthesis. The primary structure of CPOX is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 3q11.2, consisting of seven exons (Kim2013The). The enzyme is initially synthesized as a 40 kDa precursor with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is cleaved to produce the mature 37 kDa form (Kim2013The).

The secondary structure of CPOX includes a unique topology characterized by a large, flat seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Lee2005Structural). This structure does not form a barrel, distinguishing it from similar proteins like porins (Lee2005Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, CPOX forms a globular shape, and its quaternary structure is a biologically active homodimer. The dimerization involves a 40° rotation between subunits, forming a hinge-like motion around a crystallographic 2-fold axis (Lee2005Structural). The dimer interface is composed of 64% nonpolar and 36% polar atoms, with ten intersubunit hydrogen bonds contributing to its stability (Lee2005Structural).

CPOX does not require metal ions or cofactors for its catalytic activity, relying instead on molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor (Lee2005Structural). The enzyme's active site features an electropositive cleft where citrate is bound, mimicking the substrate's carboxylate groups (Lee2005Structural).

## Function
The CPOX gene encodes the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase, which plays a crucial role in the heme biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX, a precursor to heme, through two sequential steps of oxidative decarboxylation (Kim2013The; Li2009Cloning). The process involves the removal of carboxyl groups from the propionic acid side chains on rings A and B of coproporphyrinogen-III, converting them into vinyl groups (Li2009Cloning). 

CPOX is synthesized in the cytosol as a precursor protein and is transported to the mitochondria, where it becomes active after the cleavage of a mitochondrial targeting sequence (Li2009Cloning). In the mitochondria, CPOX functions as a homodimeric enzyme, facilitating the production of protoporphyrinogen IX, which is essential for the synthesis of heme (Kim2013The). Heme is a critical component of hemoglobin and other hemoproteins, impacting oxygen transport and cellular respiration (Shetty2020Mitochondrial). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal heme biosynthesis, which is essential for mitochondrial function and overall cellular energy metabolism (Módis2019Cystathionineγlyase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CPOX gene are associated with hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by acute neurovisceral attacks and skin photosensitivity. These attacks are due to the accumulation of porphyrin precursors, such as 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), which have neurotoxic effects (Yasuda2019Recent; Chen2019International). HCP results from loss-of-function mutations in the CPOX gene, leading to reduced enzyme activity and the accumulation of coproporphyrin III (Hasanoglu2010Harderoporphyria).

A clinically distinct subtype of HCP, known as Harderoporphyria, is associated with specific CPOX mutations, such as p.K404E and p.H327R. This condition presents with neonatal jaundice, hemolytic anemia, and the accumulation of harderoporphyrin in feces (Hasanoglu2010Harderoporphyria; Yasuda2019Recent). Harderoporphyria is typically autosomal recessive, with affected individuals often being homozygous for these mutations (Hasanoglu2010Harderoporphyria).

The CPOX gene has been found to have over 50 mutations, mostly private missense mutations, complicating genotype-phenotype correlations (Hasanoglu2010Harderoporphyria). Genetic analysis is crucial for diagnosis and for identifying at-risk family members (Chen2019International).

## Interactions
CPOX (coproporphyrinogen oxidase) is involved in the mitochondrial heme metabolism complex, interacting with other enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway. It is part of a complex that includes protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX) and ferrochelatase (FECH), which are involved in the terminal steps of heme synthesis. This complex facilitates the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrin IX and the insertion of iron to form heme (Medlock2015Identification).

The study by Medlock et al. suggests that CPOX, PPOX, and FECH form functional homodimers. While direct interactions between FECH and CPOX were not confirmed, interactions between FECH and PPOX were observed. It is proposed that CPOX and PPOX might interact through a transporter or bridge protein, although such a protein was not identified in the study. Potential bridging proteins include transmembrane protein 14c, 2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier, and adenine nucleotide translocators (Medlock2015Identification).

The interactions within this complex are thought to facilitate substrate channeling, reduce competition for metabolites, and protect cells from reactive intermediates. These interactions are likely transient and dependent on the conformational states of the involved proteins, reflecting the dynamic nature of the mitochondrial heme metabolism complex (Medlock2015Identification).
