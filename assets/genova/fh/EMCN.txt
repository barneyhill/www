# EMCN

## Overview
The EMCN gene encodes endomucin, a type I integral membrane glycoprotein predominantly expressed in the endothelial cells of capillaries and venules. This protein is characterized by its mucin-like extracellular domain, which is heavily O-glycosylated, contributing to its extended structure and functional role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Endomucin plays a critical role in vascular biology, particularly in maintaining vascular homeostasis and modulating angiogenesis through its interaction with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2). It is involved in preventing leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells under non-inflammatory conditions, thereby maintaining an anti-adhesive endothelial surface. The expression of EMCN is regulated by shear stress and is downregulated during inflammation, which can facilitate leukocyte recruitment. Clinically, alterations in EMCN expression have been linked to cancer metastasis and prognosis, highlighting its significance in both vascular integrity and disease progression (Cano2024Endomucin; Zahr2016Endomucin; Hu2020Elements).

## Structure
Endomucin (EMCN) is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein expressed primarily in endothelial cells of capillaries and venules. The protein consists of 261 amino acids and features a mucin-like extracellular domain (ECD) that is rich in serine and threonine residues, which are crucial for extensive O-glycosylation (Zahr2016Endomucin; Hu2020Elements). This glycosylation contributes to the protein's highly extended and rigid structure, preventing it from folding into a globular form (Zahr2016Endomucin). The ECD of EMCN is described as having a bottlebrush structure typical of mucins, which plays a significant role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (Hu2020Elements).

EMCN also contains several potential N-glycosylation sites, which are important for its interaction with VEGFR2, a receptor involved in angiogenesis. N-glycosylation is crucial for EMCN's role in VEGFR2 signaling and internalization (Hu2020Elements). The protein's core molecular weight is approximately 27.5 kDa, with additional weight contributed by glycosylation (Hu2020Elements).

The primary structure of EMCN includes a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain, but detailed information on its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures is not available in the provided context. There is no mention of specific domains, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms (Zahr2016Endomucin; Hu2020Elements).

## Function
Endomucin (EMCN) is a glycoprotein expressed on the luminal surface of endothelial cells, particularly in venous and capillary endothelium. It plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by preventing leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells under non-inflammatory conditions. EMCN achieves this by opposing the binding of neutrophils to ICAM-1, thereby maintaining an anti-adhesive surface on endothelial cells and inhibiting leukocyte adhesion (Zahr2016Endomucin).

EMCN is also involved in angiogenesis, modulating vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) signaling. It facilitates VEGFR2 internalization, which is essential for VEGF-induced endothelial cell functions such as migration, proliferation, and tube formation. This process is crucial for angiogenesis and maintaining vascular stability (Cano2024Endomucin; Hu2020Elements).

In addition to its role in leukocyte adhesion and angiogenesis, EMCN is part of the endothelial glycocalyx, contributing to vascular permeability and endothelial homeostasis. It interacts with the AP2 complex, necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of VEGFR2, highlighting its specific role in VEGFR2 signaling pathways (Cano2024Endomucin). EMCN's expression is regulated by shear stress and is downregulated under inflammatory conditions, which can facilitate leukocyte recruitment (Zahr2016Endomucin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EMCN gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer metastasis. EMCN is downregulated in metastatic tumors, which is associated with increased metastasis in lung and breast cancers. This downregulation compromises the integrity of the endothelial barrier, facilitating tumor cell infiltration and metastasis (Zhang2022Loss). In lung cancer, high EMCN expression correlates with better survival rates, suggesting its protective role against metastasis. Conversely, EMCN deficiency promotes lung metastasis by enhancing vascular permeability and forming a premetastatic niche through the recruitment of neutrophils and upregulation of factors like MMP9 and TGF-β (Zhang2022Loss).

In gastric cancer, high EMCN expression is linked to poor prognosis, indicating its complex role in different cancer types (Dai2020Systematical). In Wilms tumor, EMCN downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, as it disrupts vascular integrity and promotes angiogenesis and tumor progression (Zeng2024Screening). EMCN's role in preventing leukocyte adhesion under non-inflamed conditions is also significant, as its downregulation during inflammation facilitates leukocyte migration into tissues, highlighting its potential in managing inflammatory diseases (Zahr2016Endomucin).

## Interactions
Endomucin (EMCN) is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of vascular biology. EMCN interacts with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), playing a significant role in its endocytosis and signaling. This interaction is facilitated through the AP2 adaptor protein complex, specifically the AP2A2 subunit, which is crucial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of VEGFR2 (Cano2024Endomucin). EMCN's extracellular domain, particularly amino acids 121-190, is essential for its interaction with VEGFR2, and N-glycosylation of this domain is necessary for the interaction (Cano2024Endomucin; Hu2020Elements).

EMCN also forms complexes with actin regulatory proteins such as CFL2, ARPC3, ARPC1A, and TPM3, which are involved in cell motility and cytoskeletal organization (Moon2024Endomucin). These interactions highlight EMCN's role in regulating the endothelial cytoskeleton independently of VEGF signaling. Additionally, EMCN is known to prevent leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells by opposing the binding of neutrophils to ICAM-1, a process that is modulated during inflammatory conditions (Zahr2016Endomucin). These interactions underscore EMCN's multifaceted role in endothelial cell function and vascular integrity.
