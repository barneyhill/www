# ZNF710

## Overview
ZNF710 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 710, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and are involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 710 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression and has been associated with several biological pathways and disease states. The gene's expression and its regulatory mechanisms are of particular interest in cancer research, where alterations in ZNF710 expression have been linked to tumor progression and patient prognosis in renal cell carcinoma (Li2020Overexpression). Additionally, ZNF710's expression may be influenced by environmental factors, such as prenatal arsenic exposure, which can lead to changes in DNA methylation patterns (Kile2014Effect).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF710 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the antisense long non-coding RNA ZNF710-AS1-202 plays a significant role in regulating ZNF710 expression. Overexpression of ZNF710-AS1-202 in ccRCC cells promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression. This overexpression leads to downregulation of ZNF710 mRNA and upregulation of ZNF710 protein, which is associated with poor prognosis in ccRCC patients (Li2020Overexpression).

In papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), ZNF710-AS1 is identified as one of the cuproptosis-related long non-coding RNAs linked to patient outcomes. A prognostic risk model incorporating ZNF710-AS1 has been developed to predict therapeutic responses and outcomes in pRCC, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for this cancer subtype (Tang2023A).

Additionally, ZNF710 has been associated with altered DNA methylation patterns due to prenatal arsenic exposure, which may affect its expression and contribute to various physiological and pathological processes (Kile2014Effect). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZNF710 in cancer and other conditions.
