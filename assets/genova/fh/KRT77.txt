# KRT77

## Overview
KRT77 is a gene that encodes keratin 77, a type II cytokeratin protein, which is part of the keratin family known for forming intermediate filaments in epithelial cells. These filaments are crucial for providing mechanical support and maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial tissues, particularly in the skin. Keratin 77 is characterized by its alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains, allowing it to form heterodimers with type I keratins and contribute to the formation of intermediate filaments (Langbein2013New). The protein is predominantly expressed in the luminal cells of eccrine sweat gland ducts, playing a specialized role in the structural integrity of these glands (Langbein2013New). Alterations in KRT77 expression have been linked to various skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, and its expression patterns have been studied in the context of hair follicle dynamics and tumor progression (Goleva2020Skin; Mottaghitalab2021Revealing; Zhang2023Labelfree).

## Structure
Keratin 77 (KRT77) is a type II cytokeratin, part of the keratin family of fibrous structural proteins that form intermediate filaments in epithelial cells. The primary structure of KRT77 consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains, which is typical for keratins (Langbein2013New). The secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices, contributing to the protein's stability and flexibility. The tertiary structure involves coiled-coil formations, which are crucial for the protein's mechanical resilience and structural integrity (Langbein2013New).

In terms of quaternary structure, KRT77 typically forms heterodimers with type I keratins, a common feature among type II keratins, facilitating the formation of intermediate filaments (Langbein2013New). Post-translational modifications of KRT77 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Langbein2013New). These modifications are important for regulating the protein's activity and stability, as well as its interactions with other cellular components. The specific sequence and structural features of KRT77 contribute to its role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial tissues.

## Function
KRT77, also known as keratin 77, is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It is involved in the formation of intermediate filaments, which are essential for providing mechanical support and resilience to cells, particularly in the skin. These filaments help maintain cell shape and stability, contributing to the overall structural framework of epithelial tissues (Langbein2013New; Zhang2023Labelfree).

In healthy human cells, KRT77 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it is expressed in the luminal cells of eccrine sweat gland ducts. This localization is significant for the function of sweat glands, as KRT77 is part of the periluminal keratin belt, which is crucial for the structural integrity of the ductal system (Langbein2013New). The expression of KRT77 is restricted to specific areas, such as the luminal cells of eccrine sweat gland ducts, indicating its specialized role in these structures (Langbein2013New).

The down-regulation of KRT77 has been associated with defects in sweat glands, as observed in conditions like recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa and aging skin, suggesting its importance in maintaining normal sweat gland function (Breitenbach2015Transcriptome).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KRT77 gene have been associated with several skin conditions, particularly in the context of atopic dermatitis (AD). In patients with AD, KRT77 expression is decreased, which may contribute to tissue fragility and reduced mechanical stress resilience in the skin. This reduction in KRT77 levels is linked to increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), suggesting a role in skin barrier dysfunction and allergic sensitization (Goleva2020Skin). The decreased expression of KRT77 in AD is also associated with impaired sweating ability, potentially due to a decrease in eccrine sweat gland density, which can lead to symptoms such as heat retention, skin dryness, and increased susceptibility to infections (Goleva2020Skin).

In addition to its role in skin conditions, KRT77 has been studied in the context of gliomas. It is under-expressed in both low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), suggesting a potential involvement in tumor progression (Mottaghitalab2021Revealing). However, specific diseases directly resulting from KRT77 gene mutations have not been detailed in the available literature.

## Interactions
KRT77 (keratin 77) is involved in various protein interactions, particularly within the context of hair follicle structure and function. In Inner Mongolia cashmere goats, KRT77 is expressed in both down hair (DH) and guard hair (GH), and it interacts with other keratins, such as KRT1, within a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. KRT1 serves as a central node in this network, connecting to several other keratins, including KRT77, which highlights its role in the structural composition of hair fibers (Zhang2023Labelfree).

In the context of the hair follicle cycle in Liaoning cashmere goats, KRT77 is identified as a key node in a PPI network that includes other keratins like KRT24, KRT19, and KRT14. These interactions suggest that KRT77 may play a role in regulating the hair follicle cycle through its interactions with other proteins, although its specific interactions in this cycle have not been previously reported (Gao2021Proteomics).

While specific interactions involving KRT77 in humans or other species are not detailed in the provided context, its involvement in keratin networks and potential regulatory roles in hair follicle dynamics are evident from studies in goats.
