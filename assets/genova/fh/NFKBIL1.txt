# NFKBIL1

## Overview
NFKBIL1 is a gene that encodes the protein NF-kB inhibitor-like 1 (IkBL), which is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing and immune responses. Unlike classical inhibitors of NF-kB, IkBL does not interact with NF-kB subunits, such as p50 or p65, nor does it regulate NF-kB-driven promoter activity, indicating a unique function distinct from typical IκB proteins (Greetham2007Functional). Instead, IkBL is implicated in the modulation of alternative splicing of immune-related genes and viral RNA, highlighting its role in both immune regulation and viral infection processes (An2013A). The protein is localized in nuclear speckles and interacts with various proteins involved in mRNA processing, suggesting its involvement in broader RNA-related functions (An2013A; Greetham2007Functional). NFKBIL1 has been associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, underscoring its clinical significance in immune system pathologies (Annemann2016Atypical).

## Function
The NFKBIL1 gene encodes the inhibitor of kB-like protein (IkBL), which plays a significant role in the regulation of alternative splicing of immune-related genes. IkBL is involved in the suppression of exon exclusion in the splicing of genes such as CD45, CD72, and CTLA4, indicating its broad regulatory function across different cell types (An2013A). It interacts with CLK1, a kinase involved in splicing, and SR proteins, which are crucial for splicing processes, although its role in splicing is independent of CLK1's kinase activity (An2013A). IkBL is localized in nuclear speckles, structures enriched with splicing factors, and is associated with RNA, supporting its role in RNA splicing (An2013A).

In addition to its role in human gene regulation, IkBL also influences the splicing of the influenza virus M gene, reducing the production of the M2 splice variant, which is crucial for viral replication (An2013A). This suggests that NFKBIL1 has a broader role in regulating splicing events critical for both immune function and viral infection processes.

## Clinical Significance
The NFKBIL1 gene has been implicated in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases due to its role in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Polymorphisms within the NFKBIL1 gene locus are associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjögren's syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis (Annemann2016Atypical). In rheumatoid arthritis, NFKBIL1 is expressed in synovial tissue, particularly in macrophages and T cells, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Greetham2007Functional). The gene's expression is also linked to the severity of psoriasis, with specific genetic variants associated with more severe forms of the disease (Nikamo2015Association).

NFKBIL1 does not function as a classical inhibitor of NF-κB, as it does not interact with NF-κB dimers. Instead, it may be involved in mRNA processing or translation regulation, potentially affecting immune responses (Greetham2007Functional). The gene's interactions with proteins such as CTPS, EF1a, and LKP, which are involved in transcription and translation, further suggest its role in cellular processes beyond NF-κB inhibition (Greetham2007Functional). These interactions may contribute to the gene's involvement in autoimmune conditions.

## Interactions
NFKBIL1, also known as NF-kB inhibitor-like protein 1, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It has been shown to directly bind to CTP synthase 1 (CTPS), translation elongation factor 1-a 1 (EF1a), and leukophysin (LKP) through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating its involvement in mRNA processing or translation regulation (Greetham2007Functional). However, NFKBIL1 does not bind to the hsp90 co-chaperone, cdc37 (Greetham2007Functional).

NFKBIL1 is also associated with mRNA, similar to the poly-A-binding protein (PABP), suggesting that it may bind to bulk cellular mRNAs without specific sequence preferences (Greetham2007Functional). This association with mRNA and its co-localization with spliceosome components imply a role in RNA-related functions (Greetham2007Functional).

Despite its structural similarities to IκB proteins, NFKBIL1 does not interact with NF-kB subunits such as p50 or p65, nor does it regulate NF-kB-driven promoter activity, indicating it lacks typical IκB-like functions (Greetham2007Functional). Instead, its interactions suggest a distinct role in RNA processing and immune regulation.
