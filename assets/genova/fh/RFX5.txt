# RFX5

## Overview
The RFX5 gene encodes the regulatory factor X5 protein, a crucial component of the regulatory factor X (RFX) complex, which plays a significant role in the transcriptional activation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes. The RFX5 protein is categorized as a transcriptional activator and is integral to the immune system's function, particularly in antigen presentation and the activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes. It achieves this by binding to the X box motif in the promoter region of MHC-II genes, facilitating the formation of a stable RFX/NF-Y complex necessary for gene expression (Villard2000A; Steimle1995A). Mutations in the RFX5 gene can lead to severe immunodeficiency disorders, such as Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome (BLS), due to the lack of MHC-II expression (Reith2001The; Steimle1995A). Additionally, aberrant expression of RFX5 has been linked to cancer progression, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Chen2020RFX5).

## Structure
The RFX5 protein is a component of the RFX complex, essential for the regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes. Structurally, RFX5 contains several distinct domains: the oligomerization domain, the RFX DNA binding domain, the dimerization domain, and the transactivation domain (Laird2010Solution). The oligomerization domain is characterized by a leucine-rich region and forms a tetramer when isolated, but it is dimeric in the presence of other domains or when complexed with RFXAP and RFXB (Laird2010Solution). This domain consists of a long central helix flanked by two shorter helices, forming an anti-parallel coiled coil (Laird2010Solution).

The RFX5 protein forms a heterotrimeric complex with RFXAP and RFXB, with the oligomerization domain playing a crucial role in dimerization and complex stability (Laird2010Solution). The structure of the RFX5 monomer includes three α-helices connected by short loops, forming a 'C' shape, with specific interactions between helices stabilizing the structure (Laird2010Solution). The leucine-rich region, particularly residues 62-LYLYLQL-68, is critical for forming a hydrophobic interface with RFXAP, essential for the stability of the RFX complex (Laird2010Solution). The protein's ability to form dimers is crucial for its function in assembling the RFX complex on MHC-II promoters (JabraneFerrat2002Major).

## Function
The RFX5 gene encodes a subunit of the regulatory factor X (RFX) complex, which is essential for the transcriptional activation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes. In healthy human cells, RFX5 functions as a transcriptional activator by binding to the X box motif in the promoter region of MHC-II genes, a critical step for their expression (Villard2000A; Steimle1995A). The RFX complex, which includes RFX5, RFXANK, and RFXAP, forms a heterotrimeric DNA-binding protein complex that stabilizes the binding of other transcription factors such as NF-Y and X2BP to the MHC-II promoter (Reith2001The; Villard2000A).

RFX5 contains a DNA-binding domain that allows it to specifically bind to the X box, facilitating the formation of a stable RFX/NF-Y complex, which is crucial for the transcriptional activation of MHC-II genes (Reith2001The; Steimle1995A). This cooperative binding is essential for the proper expression of MHC-II genes, which are vital for antigen presentation and the activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, playing a critical role in the immune response (Villard2000A; Steimle1995A). Mutations in RFX5 can lead to a lack of MHC-II expression, resulting in severe immunodeficiency, as seen in bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) (Reith2001The; Steimle1995A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RFX5 gene are associated with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) deficiency, also known as Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome (BLS), a severe immunodeficiency disorder. This condition is characterized by a lack of MHC-II expression, leading to impaired immune responses and increased susceptibility to infections, particularly affecting the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (Chen2022Case; Steimle1995A). BLS is an autosomal recessive disorder, and mutations in RFX5 disrupt the formation of the RFX complex, which is essential for MHC-II gene expression (Masternak1998A; JabraneFerrat2002Major).

Specific mutations in RFX5, such as splicing mutations and point mutations, have been identified in patients with BLS. These mutations can lead to frameshifts, premature stop codons, and non-functional RFX5 proteins, resulting in the absence of MHC-II expression (Chen2022Case; Steimle1995A). The lack of functional MHC-II molecules impairs the presentation of antigenic peptides to CD4+ T lymphocytes, crucial for adaptive immune responses (Villard2000A).

Alterations in RFX5 expression have also been implicated in cancer progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma, RFX5 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and promotes tumor progression by suppressing the p53 signaling pathway (Chen2020RFX5).

## Interactions
RFX5 is a critical component of the RFX complex, which regulates the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) genes. It interacts with RFXAP and RFXB to form a heterotrimeric complex essential for MHCII gene expression. The RFX5 protein contains several domains, including an oligomerization domain that forms a dimer and interacts with the C-terminal domain of RFXAP to form a stable complex. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and function of the RFX complex (Laird2010Solution).

The leucine-rich region of RFX5 is important for dimer formation and interaction with RFXAP. Mutations in this region, such as Leu 62 and Leu 66, can destabilize the RFX complex by affecting the hydrophobic interface with RFXAP (Laird2010Solution). RFX5 also enhances RFXAP's affinity for RFXB by stabilizing its conformation, suggesting a potential binding site for RFXB (Laird2010Solution).

RFX5 interacts with the DNA binding domain of RFXANK and X-box DNA. The binding of RFX5 to X-box DNA is characterized by a biphasic binding isotherm, indicating two classes of binding sites (Chakraborty2010DNA). These interactions are crucial for the transcriptional activation of MHCII genes (Villard2000A).
