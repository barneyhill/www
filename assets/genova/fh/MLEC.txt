# MLEC

## Overview
The MLEC gene encodes the protein malectin, a lectin primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mammalian cells. Malectin is involved in the quality control of glycoproteins, specifically recognizing di-glucosylated N-glycans on newly synthesized glycoproteins. This recognition is crucial for retaining misfolded glycoproteins within the ER, thereby preventing their premature secretion and ensuring proper protein maturation (Qin2012Malectin; Galli2011Malectin). Malectin's function is enhanced through its interaction with ribophorin I, a transmembrane protein, forming a complex that is essential for its role in protein quality control (Qin2012Malectin). During conditions of ER stress, malectin expression is upregulated, and it may relocate to the Golgi apparatus, a process that helps alleviate the ER's burden by facilitating glycoprotein transport (Yang2018Subcellular). This protein's activity is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has implications for overall organismal health.

## Structure
The MLEC gene encodes the protein malectin, which is involved in glycoprotein quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum. Malectin features a conserved malectin domain that is responsible for binding specific oligosaccharides. The primary structure of malectin consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function and interactions. In terms of secondary structure, malectin may include elements such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its stability and binding capabilities.

The tertiary structure of malectin involves the overall three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its ability to interact with other molecules and perform its role in the endoplasmic reticulum. This folding is influenced by the presence of the malectin domain, which is essential for its carbohydrate-binding function. While the quaternary structure of malectin, which would involve the formation of protein complexes, is not detailed in the available information, it is possible that malectin interacts with other proteins as part of its functional role.

Post-translational modifications and splice variants can affect the function and localization of malectin, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the available context.

## Function
Malectin, encoded by the MLEC gene, is a lectin protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mammalian cells, where it plays a crucial role in glycoprotein quality control. It specifically recognizes di-glucosylated N-glycans on newly synthesized glycoproteins, facilitating the retention of misfolded glycoproteins within the ER to prevent their premature secretion (Qin2012Malectin; Galli2011Malectin). Malectin forms a complex with ribophorin I, an ER-resident transmembrane protein, which enhances its association with misfolded glycoproteins and is essential for its function in protein quality control (Qin2012Malectin).

Under normal conditions, malectin is primarily localized in the ER, where it operates as part of a backup quality control pathway, distinct from the Calnexin chaperone system (Galli2011Malectin). During ER stress, malectin expression is upregulated, and it may relocate to the Golgi apparatus, a process regulated by the expression balance between malectin and ribophorin I (Yang2018Subcellular). This relocation is thought to alleviate the burden on the ER by facilitating the transport of glycoproteins to the Golgi (Yang2018Subcellular). Malectin's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein maturation, impacting overall organismal health.

## Interactions
Malectin (MLEC) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident lectin that participates in the quality control of glycoproteins by forming complexes with other proteins. A significant interaction is with ribophorin I, a transmembrane protein that is part of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. This interaction enhances malectin's association with misfolded glycoproteins, facilitating their retention in the ER and preventing their secretion. The interaction between malectin and ribophorin I is independent of malectin's glycan binding activity, indicating a stable complex formation (Qin2012Malectin).

Ribophorin I is suggested to function as a chaperone, recognizing misfolded proteins through its hydrophobic surfaces. This interaction is crucial for the selective binding of malectin to misfolded glycoproteins, as ribophorin I's expression levels directly affect malectin's association with these proteins (Qin2012Malectin).

Malectin also interacts with components of the OST complex, such as RPN1, STT3A, and DDOST, particularly during viral infections. These interactions are thought to facilitate glycoprotein biogenesis and are enhanced during mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection, suggesting a role in promoting viral replication (Davies2024The).
