# GPRIN2

## Overview
GPRIN2, or G protein regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, a critical process in neuronal development and differentiation. The protein encoded by GPRIN2 is categorized as a signaling modulator, interacting with G-proteins and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to influence cytoskeletal dynamics and promote neurite extension. This function is essential for neural connectivity and plasticity, contributing to the proper development and function of the nervous system. GPRIN2's interactions with GPCRs, such as the serotonin 5-HT4d receptor, highlight its role in modulating complex signaling pathways that are crucial for maintaining neural health and function (Sokolina2017Systematic). The gene has also been implicated in various neuropsychiatric conditions and cancer, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Duan2018Whole; Firouzabadi2016Copy).

## Function
GPRIN2, or G protein regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 2, plays a significant role in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, a critical process in neuronal development and differentiation. It interacts with G-proteins to modulate signaling pathways that influence cytoskeletal dynamics, thereby promoting the extension of neurites. This function is essential for neural connectivity and plasticity, contributing to the proper development and function of the nervous system (Sokolina2017Systematic).

GPRIN2 is known to interact with the serotonin 5-HT4d receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), in transfected cells. This interaction is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease, as the activation of the 5-HT4d receptor modulates alpha-secretase activity, promoting the generation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) alpha, which is beneficial in reducing Alzheimer's disease-associated APP beta. This effect involves the Gs/cAMP signaling pathway, and the presence of GPRIN2 is expected to amplify the beneficial effects of 5-HT4d receptor activation in cells (Sokolina2017Systematic).

GPRIN2 is primarily active in the nervous system, where it contributes to the regulation of neurotransmission and the maintenance of neuronal structure and function. Its interactions with GPCRs and G-proteins underscore its role in modulating complex signaling pathways that are crucial for maintaining neural health and function (Sokolina2017Systematic).

## Clinical Significance
GPRIN2 has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric conditions, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Duplications of the GPRIN2 gene have been identified in patients with autism and other clinical features, suggesting its role as a candidate modifier gene. In one study, a 9-year-old girl with autism, severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, and hearing loss was found to have a paternally inherited duplication of GPRIN2, alongside a de novo deletion affecting other genes (Firouzabadi2016Copy). Another case involved a 7-year-old boy with autism, intellectual disability, and seizures, where a de novo duplication of GPRIN2 was detected (Firouzabadi2016Copy). These findings suggest that GPRIN2 duplications may contribute to phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance in neuropsychiatric conditions, potentially acting as a "second hit" in conjunction with other genetic abnormalities (Rylaarsdam2019Genetic).

GPRIN2 has also been associated with neuroblastoma, where somatic mutations in the gene were identified in patients undergoing chemotherapy. These mutations were consistent between bone marrow and plasma cell-free DNA, indicating a potential role in tumor progression and as a biomarker for minimal residual disease monitoring (Duan2018Whole). However, specific diseases or conditions directly caused by GPRIN2 mutations remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
GPRIN2, or G protein regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 2, is known to interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. One significant interaction involves the serotonin 5-HT4d receptor (HTR4), where GPRIN2 physically interacts with this receptor, as confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian systems. This interaction is crucial because it modulates the signaling capacity of the 5-HT4d receptor, which is a promising target for Alzheimer's disease due to its role in modulating a-secretase activity and promoting the generation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)a (Sokolina2017Systematic).

GPRIN2 also interacts with GPR37, another GPCR, and this interaction has been validated using biochemical and cell-based assays. The interaction between GPR37 and the adenosine A2A receptor (ADORA2A) enhances the expression of GPR37, suggesting a chaperone-like function of ADORA2A. This interaction was confirmed in HEK-293 cells and through BRET saturation experiments, highlighting the specificity of the interaction, as it does not occur with the related adenosine receptor ADORA1 (Sokolina2017Systematic). These interactions are part of a broader GPCR interactome that provides insights into complex signaling pathways and potential therapeutic targets.
