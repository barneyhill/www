# LIX1

## Overview
LIX1 is a gene that encodes the protein limb and CNS expressed 1, which is primarily involved in mitochondrial function and cellular processes. The LIX1 protein is characterized by a double-stranded RNA-binding domain, suggesting its role in RNA processing and metabolism (Guérin2022LIX1; McKey2016LIX1). It is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial ultrastructure and function through interactions with proteins such as PHB2 and OPA1 (Guérin2022LIX1). LIX1 is also involved in regulating key signaling pathways, including the Hippo pathway, which influences cell fate decisions and energy metabolism (Guérin2022LIX1). Its expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors and spinal muscular atrophy, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Guérin2022LIX1; Fyfe2006An).

## Structure
The LIX1 protein is a 282-amino acid protein with a predicted double-stranded RNA-binding domain, suggesting a role in RNA processing (Guérin2022LIX1; McKey2016LIX1). The secondary structure of LIX1 includes a double-stranded RNA-binding domain, which is a common feature in proteins involved in RNA metabolism or transport (Fyfe2006An). The tertiary structure of LIX1, predicted using the AlphaFold algorithm, reveals that cysteine 84 is accessible for lipid modification, located between an alpha-helix and a beta-strand (Guérin2022LIX1). This cysteine residue is conserved across vertebrate LIX1 orthologs and Drosophila homologs, indicating its evolutionary importance (Guérin2022LIX1).

LIX1 undergoes post-translational modification through S-palmitoylation at cysteine 84, which is crucial for its translocation to the mitochondria and association with the outer mitochondrial membrane (Guérin2022LIX1). This modification facilitates its localization in lipid raft-like micro-domains enriched in cardiolipin, essential for maintaining mitochondrial ultrastructure and function (Guérin2022LIX1). The protein's role in mitochondrial function and its structural features suggest its involvement in regulating cellular processes related to RNA metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics.

## Function
The LIX1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in mitochondrial function and cellular processes in healthy human cells. LIX1 is primarily localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), where it is involved in regulating mitochondrial metabolism and organization. This localization is facilitated by S-palmitoylation, a lipid modification that allows LIX1 to dock to the OMM, with cysteine 84 being a critical site for this modification (Guérin2022LIX1). LIX1 influences mitochondrial cristae organization by stabilizing PHB2, a protein essential for cristae structure, and affects the distribution of cardiolipin, a phospholipid crucial for mitochondrial membrane integrity (Guérin2022LIX1).

In the context of cell biology, LIX1 is a master regulator of digestive mesenchymal progenitor specification, primarily through its control of the Hippo pathway effectors YAP1/TAZ. It is involved in maintaining mitochondrial ultrastructure and signaling pathways, which are essential for cell identity and function (Guérin2022LIX1). LIX1's role in mitochondrial dynamics includes influencing mitochondrial morphology and respiration, with its absence leading to altered mitochondrial structure and reduced respiration (Guérin2022LIX1). These functions highlight LIX1's importance in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and cell fate decisions.

## Clinical Significance
The LIX1 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cell fate decisions and mitochondrial function. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), LIX1 is upregulated and serves as a poor prognostic factor. Its expression is associated with the regulation of KIT and the Hippo effectors YAP1/TAZ, which are crucial for GIST cell proliferation and differentiation. Silencing LIX1 in GIST cells leads to a loss of KIT expression and a shift towards a smooth muscle cell phenotype, reducing the cells' proliferative and invasive capacities (Guérin2022LIX1).

In the context of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), LIX1 is suggested to play a role in motor neuron survival. A study on feline SMA identified a 140-kb deletion affecting LIX1, indicating its essential function in motor neuron development. Although no mutations were found in human SMA patients lacking SMN1 mutations, the study could not exclude a defect in LIX1 expression (Fyfe2006An).

These findings suggest that alterations in LIX1 expression or function may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain cancers and neurological conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
LIX1 is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes, particularly in the context of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and stomach mesenchymal progenitors. LIX1 regulates the activity of the Hippo pathway effector YAP1, a transcriptional coactivator involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. This regulation is crucial for the development and proliferation of stomach mesenchymal progenitors, as well as for the tumorigenic potential of GIST cells (Guérin2020LIX1; McKey2016LIX1).

LIX1 is also associated with mitochondrial functions, where it interacts with mitochondrial proteins such as PHB2 and OPA1. These interactions are essential for maintaining mitochondrial cristae organization and function. LIX1's S-palmitoylation at cysteine 84 facilitates its localization to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it may influence mitochondrial metabolism and structure (Guérin2022LIX1).

In the context of drug resistance, LIX1 expression is linked to increased YAP1/TAZ activity in response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib, suggesting a role in the adaptive response of GIST cells to treatment (RuizDemoulin2023LIX1). These interactions highlight LIX1's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular structures.
