# C11orf97

## Overview
C11orf97 is a gene located on chromosome 11 in humans, encoding a protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 97. This protein is relatively short, comprising 121 amino acids, and is primarily associated with motile ciliated tissues, such as those found in the respiratory epithelium and brain ependyma. Although the protein localizes to the basal bodies of cilia and is suggested to interact with the BBSome complex involved in ciliary trafficking, it is not essential for ciliogenesis, as evidenced by studies in mice where knock-out models do not exhibit impaired ciliary function (Stauber20171700012B09Rik). The gene is conserved among amniotes, indicating a potentially specialized role in these organisms, though its exact function remains to be fully elucidated. C11orf97 has been implicated in clinical contexts such as oral squamous cell carcinoma and obstructive sleep apnea, suggesting a possible role in disease mechanisms, although further research is needed to clarify its significance (Cade2016Genetic; Huang2019Identification).

## Function
C11orf97, also known as 1700012B09Rik in mice, is a gene associated with motile ciliated tissues. In mice, it is expressed predominantly in tissues with motile cilia, such as the epithelia of airways and the ependyma of the brain, and localizes to the basal bodies of cilia. Despite its association with motile cilia, C11orf97 is not essential for ciliogenesis, as knock-out mice do not exhibit impaired ciliary function (Stauber20171700012B09Rik).

The protein encoded by C11orf97 is relatively short, consisting of 121 amino acids, and lacks predicted motifs or domains. It is suggested to interact with the BBSome, a protein complex involved in ciliary trafficking, although its role is not critical for ciliary function, as evidenced by the absence of BBSome-related defects in knock-out mice (Stauber20171700012B09Rik). This indicates that C11orf97 may have a non-essential or redundant role in ciliary processes, potentially emerging later in the evolution of motile ciliogenesis. The gene is conserved within amniotes, including humans, but not widely conserved outside this group, suggesting a specialized function in these organisms (Stauber20171700012B09Rik).

## Clinical Significance
C11orf97 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although its precise role in disease mechanisms remains under investigation. In the context of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), C11orf97 is included in a Cox regression model that evaluates prognostic significance, suggesting that its expression levels may be associated with risk and prognosis in OSCC patients (Huang2019Identification). However, the specific clinical significance of C11orf97 in OSCC is not fully detailed, indicating a need for further research to clarify its role (Huang2019Identification).

In genetic studies related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), C11orf97 is located at a significant locus on chromosome 11q21, which is associated with the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI). This suggests a potential biological relevance of C11orf97 in the context of OSA, although causal mechanisms have not been established (Cade2016Genetic).

Despite these associations, the gene's clinical significance in other conditions remains limited. Research indicates that mutations in C11orf97 may not lead to significant clinical manifestations, as its function might be compensated by other factors (Stauber20171700012B09Rik). Further studies are needed to elucidate the gene's role in human health and disease.
