# BCL10

## Overview
BCL10 is a gene that encodes the BCL10 immune signaling adaptor protein, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune responses. The BCL10 protein is characterized by its caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which facilitates its oligomerization into filamentous structures essential for the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathways (Cheng2020Critical; Gehring2018BCL10). As a critical component of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, BCL10 acts as a scaffolding protein that links antigen receptor signals to downstream pathways, thereby influencing lymphocyte activation, survival, and differentiation (Meininger2016Lymphocyte). The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its function and the dynamic assembly of CBM complexes (Gehring2018BCL10). Mutations in the BCL10 gene have been implicated in immune-related disorders and certain lymphomas, highlighting its clinical significance in both immune function and oncogenesis (Torres2014Inherited; Müllauer2001Mutations).

## Structure
The BCL10 protein is a small protein composed of 233 amino acids, featuring an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and a C-terminal serine/threonine-rich region (Gehring2018BCL10). The CARD domain is crucial for BCL10's ability to oligomerize into filamentous structures, which are essential for NF-κB activation (Cheng2020Critical). The CARD domain of BCL10 is composed of six alpha-helices, a common feature of the death domain superfamily, characterized by conserved structures with acidic and basic patches that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Li2012Structural). 

BCL10 forms cytoplasmic filaments with left-handed symmetry, involving three to four subunits per helical turn, driven by homotypic CARD-CARD interactions (Gehring2018BCL10). These filaments serve as platforms for signaling, particularly in TCR-mediated pathways (Gehring2018BCL10). The BCL10-MALT1 complex forms flexible helical filaments, with the BCL10 CARD structure stabilized within the filament assembly (Schlauderer2018Molecular). 

BCL10 undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and MALT1-catalyzed cleavage, which regulate its function and the assembly of CBM complexes (Gehring2018BCL10). These modifications are crucial for its role in immune signaling pathways.

## Function
BCL10 is a critical component of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is essential for the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways in response to antigen receptor stimulation in lymphocytes. This complex acts as a scaffolding unit, linking upstream signals from T cell receptors (TCR) and B cell receptors (BCR) to downstream pathways, facilitating the activation, survival, proliferation, and differentiation of T and B lymphocytes (Gehring2018BCL10; Meininger2016Lymphocyte). BCL10 is involved in the formation of cytoplasmic filaments upon TCR stimulation, which are crucial for NF-κB activation through CARD-CARD interactions, with CARD11 acting as a nucleation seed (Gehring2018BCL10).

BCL10 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its function and the dynamic assembly of CBM complexes. These modifications are essential for activating downstream signaling pathways and for BCL10's degradation, which is necessary to terminate CBM complex signaling after T cell co-stimulation (Gehring2018BCL10). BCL10 also plays a role in actin polymerization and cell spreading in T cells and macrophages, independent of its association with CARD11 and MALT1, indicating its involvement in cytoskeletal remodeling and immune cell function (Gehring2018BCL10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BCL10 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly affecting immune function and contributing to oncogenesis. BCL10 mutations have been identified in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, where they can lead to protein truncation, affecting apoptosis induction and NF-κB activation. These mutations may confer a survival advantage to lymphoma cells by gaining pro-proliferative functions (Müllauer2001Mutations). However, BCL10 mutations are rare in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), including MALT lymphomas, follicular B-cell lymphomas, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, suggesting they do not commonly contribute to the pathogenesis of these cancers (Takahashi1999Infrequent).

Inherited BCL10 deficiency is linked to combined immunodeficiency (CID), characterized by severe recurrent infections and impaired immunity. This deficiency results from a loss-of-function mutation, leading to impaired NF-κB-mediated functions and affecting both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic immunity (Torres2014Inherited). The deficiency impacts cytokine production and immune cell maturation, contributing to a profound deficit in memory T and B cells (Torres2014Inherited). Aberrant BCL10 expression has also been observed in ocular adnexal lymphomas, although it does not correlate with clinical outcomes (Vejabhuti2005BCL10).

## Interactions
BCL10 is a protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, primarily within immune signaling pathways. It is a key component of the CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is essential for NF-κB activation. BCL10 interacts with CARMA/CARD proteins such as CARMA1 (CARD11), CARMA2 (CARD14), and CARMA3 (CARD10) through heterotypic CARD-CARD interactions, forming distinct CBM complexes that respond to different stimuli (Cheng2020Critical; Gehring2018BCL10). 

BCL10 also binds to MALT1, a protein with a C-terminal caspase-like domain, forming a tight complex that synergizes in activating NF-κB (Lucas2001Bcl10). This interaction is mediated through the Ig-like domains of MALT1, which bind to a specific region of BCL10 critical for NF-κB activation (Lucas2001Bcl10). 

Additionally, BCL10 interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner, which negatively regulates NF-κB activation by inhibiting the interaction between BCL10 and CARMA1 (Edin2010Interaction). BCL10's interactions with TRAF6 and its role in forming cytoplasmic filaments are also crucial for its function in immune signaling (Cheng2020Critical; Gehring2018BCL10).
