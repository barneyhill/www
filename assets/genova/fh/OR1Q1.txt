# OR1Q1

## Overview
The OR1Q1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily Q member 1, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules. Olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR1Q1, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by initiating a neuronal response upon binding specific odorants. The OR1Q1 gene is part of a large gene family responsible for the diversity of olfactory receptors, which allows for the detection of a wide range of odorant molecules (Qiu2020aarFDC).
