# SLC39A7

## Overview
The SLC39A7 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 7, commonly known as ZIP7, which is a zinc transporter integral to cellular zinc homeostasis. ZIP7 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. It facilitates the release of zinc from intracellular stores into the cytoplasm, a process essential for activating various signaling pathways, including those involving tyrosine kinases, AKT, and ERK1/2, which are crucial for cell proliferation and migration (Myers2013The; Taylor2012Protein). ZIP7 is activated by phosphorylation through protein kinase CK2, which is vital for its function in zinc release and subsequent cellular signaling (Taylor2012Protein). The gene's role extends to influencing glucose metabolism, immune function, and maintaining ER homeostasis, highlighting its importance in normal cellular processes and its implications in various clinical conditions, including immunodeficiencies and cancer (Xie2020Zinc; Myers2013The; Ohashi2016Zinc).

## Function
The SLC39A7 gene encodes the zinc transporter ZIP7, which plays a crucial role in maintaining zinc homeostasis within cells. ZIP7 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the release of zinc from intracellular stores into the cytoplasm (Myers2013The; Taylor2012Protein). This release is essential for activating downstream signaling pathways, including those involving tyrosine kinases, AKT, and ERK1/2, which are important for cell proliferation and migration (Taylor2012Protein; Kambe2015The).

ZIP7 is activated by phosphorylation through protein kinase CK2, which triggers zinc release and subsequent signaling events (Taylor2012Protein). This process is vital for various cellular functions, such as enzyme activity, gene expression, and signal transduction. In skeletal muscle cells, ZIP7 influences glucose metabolism by affecting insulin signaling and glycogen synthesis (Myers2013The). Additionally, ZIP7 is involved in immune function, as it plays a role in macrophage activation and phagocytosis (Xie2020Zinc).

Overall, ZIP7's function in zinc homeostasis and signaling is fundamental for normal cellular processes, including development, immunity, and neurotransmission (Taylor2012Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC39A7 gene, which encodes the zinc transporter ZIP7, have been linked to a novel form of autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia. This condition is characterized by a lack of B cells and humoral immunodeficiency, resulting in early onset infections and agammaglobulinemia. Affected individuals may also experience severe blistering dermatosis, failure to thrive, and thrombocytopenia. These mutations lead to a developmental blockade at the pre-B-cell stage, similar to other primary agammaglobulinemias, and are associated with impaired BCR signaling due to defective Zn2+-dependent inhibition of phosphatase activity (Anzilotti2019An).

SLC39A7 is also implicated in necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. Deficiency in SLC39A7 disrupts zinc homeostasis and ER stress, affecting the trafficking of death receptors like TNFR1 and Fas, which can lead to improper glycosylation and folding of these receptors. This disruption is linked to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), a primary immunodeficiency characterized by defective FASL-induced lymphocyte apoptosis (Fauster2018Systematic).

Alterations in SLC39A7 expression have been associated with various malignancies, including breast cancer, due to its role in cell signaling and proliferation (Ohashi2016Zinc).

## Interactions
The SLC39A7 gene encodes the zinc transporter protein ZIP7, which is involved in several critical protein interactions. ZIP7 is phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2, a process that is essential for its function in releasing zinc from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. This phosphorylation occurs at specific serine residues, Ser 275 and Ser 276, and is crucial for activating downstream signaling pathways such as AKT and ERK1/2, which are involved in cell proliferation and migration (Taylor2012Protein).

ZIP7 also forms a positive feedback loop with CK2, where the increase in cytosolic zinc upregulates CK2 activity, further enhancing ZIP7 phosphorylation and zinc release. This interaction is significant in various cell types, including breast cancer cells, cardiomyocytes, and osteosarcoma cells (Kambe2021Zinc).

In addition to its interaction with CK2, ZIP7 is involved in the regulation of ER stress and apoptosis. Its activity influences the unfolded protein response (UPR) and is linked to the maintenance of ER homeostasis. ZIP7's role in these processes is highlighted by its ability to modulate ER stress responses and protect against apoptosis (Ohashi2016Zinc; Chen2021Zinc).
