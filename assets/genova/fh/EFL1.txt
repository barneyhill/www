# EFL1

## Overview
EFL1 is a gene that encodes the protein elongation factor-like GTPase 1, which plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis within eukaryotic cells. The EFL1 protein is categorized as a GTPase, a type of enzyme that hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to facilitate various cellular processes. It is primarily involved in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit by promoting the release of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6), a critical step for the assembly of functional ribosomes capable of protein synthesis (Finch2011Uncoupling; PérezJuárez2022Altered). EFL1 operates in conjunction with the SBDS protein, which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, enhancing EFL1's activity (PérezJuárez2022Altered). Mutations in the EFL1 gene have been linked to Shwachman-Diamond-like syndrome, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal health (Tan2018Further).

## Structure
The human EFL1 protein is a GTPase encoded on chromosome 15q25, consisting of 1120 amino acids. It is organized into five domains, similar to those observed in the elongation factor EF-2. Domain 1 is responsible for guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, which is crucial for its function in ribosome maturation (Gijsbers2018Interaction). EFL1 shares sequence similarity with translation elongation factors EF-G and EF-2 and includes a G domain that binds and hydrolyzes GTP. Within domain II, there is an insertion domain of approximately 160 amino acids, which is essential for interaction with the SBDS protein (Asano2014Direct).

The insertion domain is intrinsically disordered and becomes more structured upon binding with SBDS, indicating a transition from a flexible to a rigid form (Asano2014Direct). This structural transition is important for the GTPase activity of EFL1, which is necessary for the release of eIF6 from the ribosome (Asano2014Direct). The SAXS analysis of EFL1 suggests it is a compact molecule with an asymmetric shape, and its structure in solution is larger than when bound to the ribosome, indicating different conformations in free and bound states (Gijsbers2018Interaction; Delre2019Exploring).

## Function
EFL1 (elongation factor like GTPase 1) is a crucial protein involved in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit in eukaryotic cells. It functions by facilitating the release of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) from pre-60S ribosomal subunits, a necessary step for the formation of mature ribosomes capable of engaging in translation (PérezJuárez2022Altered). This process is tightly regulated and requires GTP binding and hydrolysis, which induces a conformational change in EFL1, enabling it to displace eIF6 (Finch2011Uncoupling; PérezJuárez2022Altered).

EFL1 operates in conjunction with the SBDS protein, which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, promoting EFL1's active GTP-bound conformation (PérezJuárez2022Altered). This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and function of ribosomes, as it ensures the release of eIF6, allowing the 60S subunit to join the pool of mature ribosomes (Finch2011Uncoupling). The activity of EFL1 is critical for efficient protein synthesis, impacting cellular growth and proliferation (Finch2011Uncoupling). Mutations in EFL1 can lead to disorders such as Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (PérezJuárez2022Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EFL1 gene are associated with a Shwachman-Diamond-like syndrome, a condition that shares clinical features with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). This syndrome is characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, bone marrow dysfunction, and skeletal abnormalities such as metaphyseal dysostosis (Tan2018Further). EFL1 mutations, such as the homozygous missense variant c.379 A>G; p.Thr127Ala, have been identified in patients with SDS-like symptoms, including developmental delay, failure to thrive, and cytopenias (Tan2018Further). These mutations can impair the GTPase function of EFL1, affecting ribosome maturation and leading to fewer mature 60S ribosomal subunits (Gijsbers2018Interaction).

The EFL1 gene's interaction with the SBDS protein is crucial for ribosome assembly, and disruptions in this interaction due to mutations can result in the clinical manifestations of SDS (Gijsbers2018Interaction). Specific mutations, such as R1086Q, alter the conformational landscape of EFL1, impairing its ability to release eIF6, a critical step in ribosome maturation (PérezJuárez2022Altered). These mutations can lead to impaired protein synthesis and contribute to the pathology of SDS (PérezJuárez2022Altered).

## Interactions
EFL1 interacts with the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome protein (SBDS) to facilitate the release of eIF6 from the 60S ribosomal subunit, a critical step in ribosome maturation. EFL1 and SBDS can independently bind to mature 60S subunits, but their interaction is characterized by positive cooperativity, suggesting a conformational change in the complex. SBDS acts as a guanine exchange factor for EFL1, enhancing its GTP-bound active conformation necessary for binding to the ribosomal subunit (Gijsbers2018Interaction).

The interaction between EFL1 and SBDS is mediated by the insertion domain of EFL1, which is intrinsically disordered and becomes structured upon binding with SBDS. This interaction is enthalpy-driven and crucial for the release of Tif6 from the pre-60S ribosomal subunit (Asano2014Direct). EFL1 competes with eIF6 for an overlapping binding site on the 60S ribosomal subunit, and its conformational change upon binding with SBDS and the ribosome is incompatible with simultaneous binding of eIF6 (Weis2015Mechanism).

Mutations in SBDS can weaken its interaction with EFL1, affecting the release of eIF6 and subsequently downregulating translation (Gijsbers2018Interaction). The interaction between EFL1 and SBDS is essential for proper ribosome function and is disrupted in Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (Finch2011Uncoupling).
