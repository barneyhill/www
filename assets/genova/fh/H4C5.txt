# H4C5

## Overview
The H4C5 gene encodes the H4 clustered histone 5 protein, a variant of the histone H4 family, which plays a pivotal role in the structural organization of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histone H4 is a core component of the nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin, and is involved in the packaging of DNA into a compact, organized structure. This protein is crucial for various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation, thereby maintaining genomic stability and influencing gene expression (Dong2022Identification; Seal2022A). The H4C5 gene is part of the replication-dependent histone gene cluster, with its expression tightly regulated during the S phase of the cell cycle, highlighting its role in chromatin assembly and cell cycle progression (Hsiao2020Characterizing). Post-translational modifications of the H4 protein, such as acetylation, further modulate its function and interactions within the chromatin structure, impacting chromatin dynamics and gene regulation (Yang2011Structure).

## Structure
The H4C5 gene encodes a histone H4 protein, which is a key component of the nucleosome core particle. The primary structure of histone H4 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the N-terminal tail, which is crucial for chromatin function and regulation (Banères1997The). The N-terminal tail of histone H4 is known to adopt a highly structured conformation, primarily consisting of alpha-helices, when bound to DNA within the nucleosome core particle (Banères1997The). This alpha-helical structure is significant for interactions with the nucleosomal acidic patch, which is important for chromatin compaction and regulation (Yang2011Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, play a critical role in the function of histone H4. Specifically, acetylation of lysine 16 (K16) on the H4 tail can disrupt the alpha-helical structure, affecting its binding affinity to the nucleosome and influencing chromatin structure (Yang2011Structure). These modifications are essential for regulating gene expression and chromatin dynamics.

Histone H4, including the variant encoded by H4C5, forms part of the histone octamer, which consists of two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, contributing to the quaternary structure of the nucleosome (Wood2005Highresolution).

## Function
H4C5 encodes a variant of histone H4, a core component of the nucleosome, which is essential for DNA packaging in eukaryotic cells. Histones, including H4C5, play a crucial role in the structural organization of chromatin, facilitating DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation. These processes are vital for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression during cell division (Dong2022Identification; Seal2022A).

H4C5 is part of the replication-dependent histone gene cluster, which is expressed primarily during the S phase of the cell cycle. This expression pattern indicates its involvement in DNA replication and chromatin assembly, as histones are required to package newly synthesized DNA into chromatin (Hsiao2020Characterizing). The gene's cyclic expression pattern through the cell cycle further underscores its role in cell cycle regulation (Hsiao2020Characterizing).

In healthy human cells, H4C5 contributes to the higher-order chromatin structure by interacting with other core histones, such as H2A, H2B, and H3, forming an octamer around which DNA is wound. This interaction is crucial for the compaction of DNA and the regulation of access to genetic information, impacting cellular processes like cell cycle progression and gene expression (Dong2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the H4C5 gene have been associated with developmental disorders. Specifically, two patients with high-impact missense de novo variants in H4C5 exhibited infantile-onset gross motor developmental delays, dysmorphic facial features, and speech difficulties. These phenotypes have been linked to missense variants in histone H4 genes, suggesting a connection between H4C5 mutations and developmental delays and dysmorphic features. In one case, the de novo variant was interpreted by clinical experts as causal, while in another, the variant was reclassified as 'pathogenic,' leading to a new diagnosis (Kobren2024Joint).

In a study on craniosynostosis, the H4C5 gene was among those with novel and possibly relevant variants detected, although the specific conditions associated with these mutations were not detailed (Topa2024The). While the role of histone H4 genes in cancer is less frequently reported, the most common mutation in histone H4 genes, R4C, is associated with transcriptional repression and DNA damage, though this does not specifically pertain to H4C5 (Dhahri2024Beyond).
