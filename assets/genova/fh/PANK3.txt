# PANK3

## Overview
PANK3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme pantothenate kinase 3, a member of the kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA). This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the phosphorylation of pantothenate, marking the first and rate-limiting step in the CoA biosynthetic pathway. Pantothenate kinase 3 is primarily localized in the cytosol and is expressed ubiquitously across various cell types, where it functions as a homodimer. The activity of this enzyme is tightly regulated through feedback inhibition by acetyl-CoA and is modulated by other small molecules, which influence CoA levels and, consequently, various metabolic processes such as gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (Leonardi2010Modulation; AlfonsoPecchio2012Compartmentalization). The regulation of PANK3 is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and alterations in its function or expression can have significant implications for cellular metabolism and energy balance.

## Structure
PANK3 (pantothenate kinase 3) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A, characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PANK3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the stability and folding of the protein. The tertiary structure of PANK3 results in a specific three-dimensional shape that is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This structure allows PANK3 to perform its role in regulating coenzyme A levels effectively.

PANK3 may also exhibit a quaternary structure by forming homodimers, which are pairs of identical protein subunits that interact to enhance the enzyme's functionality. The protein contains a conserved kinase domain, essential for its catalytic activity. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, potentially influencing the enzyme's activity and interactions. Additionally, PANK3 can exist in different functional forms due to splice variant isoforms, which result from alternative splicing of its mRNA. These isoforms may have distinct roles or regulatory properties, contributing to the enzyme's versatility in cellular processes.

## Function
Pantothenate kinase 3 (PanK3) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) by catalyzing the phosphorylation of pantothenate, which is the first and rate-controlling step in this pathway. This enzyme is primarily active in the cytosol and is expressed ubiquitously across various cell types (Leonardi2010Modulation; AlfonsoPecchio2012Compartmentalization). PanK3 functions as a homodimer and is regulated through feedback inhibition by acetyl-CoA, which binds to the pantothenate substrate site, blocking ATP binding and thus controlling kinase activity and intracellular CoA levels (Leonardi2010Modulation).

PanK3 is sensitive to inhibition by long-chain acyl-CoAs and is activated by acyl-carnitines and acyl-ethanolamides, which are involved in fatty acid metabolism and signaling in the nervous system, respectively (AlfonsoPecchio2012Compartmentalization). The enzyme's activity can be modulated by small molecules, including inhibitors and activators, which can either repress or stimulate CoA biosynthesis in cells (Leonardi2010Modulation). This regulation of CoA levels is crucial for processes such as gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, impacting glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Leonardi2010Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the PANK3 gene have been implicated in various metabolic disorders. PANK3 is crucial for coenzyme A biosynthesis, and disruptions in its function can lead to significant metabolic consequences. One of the conditions associated with PANK3 is pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by iron accumulation in the brain. Although PKAN is more commonly linked to mutations in the PANK2 gene, alterations in PANK3 can also impact similar metabolic pathways, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative processes.

Changes in PANK3 expression or function may also affect lipid metabolism and energy production. This is due to its role in coenzyme A biosynthesis, which is essential for fatty acid metabolism and energy generation. Disruptions in these processes can lead to broader metabolic imbalances, potentially contributing to conditions related to impaired lipid metabolism. While specific diseases directly caused by PANK3 mutations are not extensively documented, its involvement in critical metabolic pathways suggests that any significant alterations could have wide-ranging effects on cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis.
