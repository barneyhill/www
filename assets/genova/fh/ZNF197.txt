# ZNF197

## Overview
ZNF197 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 197, a member of the zinc finger protein superfamily, which is characterized by its DNA-binding capabilities. The protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, utilizing its 20 tandemly arrayed C2H2-type zinc finger domains to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. It also contains a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and a SCAN box, which are involved in transcriptional repression and protein-protein interactions. ZNF197 is located on chromosome 3p21, a region noted for evolutionary changes that suggest its role in local adaptation and phenotypic variation. The protein is implicated in various biological processes, including the regulation of hypoxic responses and fetal growth signaling, and is associated with DNA methylation changes in response to copper levels, which may influence its expression and function in placental development (Wang2020&lt; Kennedy2019Copper; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic; miRNA; p&gt).

## Structure
ZNF197 is a member of the zinc finger protein superfamily, characterized by the presence of nucleic acid-binding zinc finger domains. The protein encoded by ZNF197 contains 20 tandemly arrayed C2H2-type zinc fingers, which are common motifs in DNA-binding proteins, allowing it to function as a transcription factor (p&gt; Wang2020&lt; miRNA). These zinc finger domains are crucial for the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. 

In addition to the zinc finger motifs, ZNF197 includes a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and a SCAN box, both of which are involved in transcriptional repression and protein-protein interactions (p&gt; Wang2020&lt; miRNA). The KRAB domain is known for its role in recruiting co-repressor complexes, which can modify chromatin structure and influence gene expression.

ZNF197 is part of a cluster of zinc finger genes located at 3p21, a region that has undergone significant evolutionary changes, including tandem duplications and positive selection, suggesting its involvement in local adaptation and phenotypic variation (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic). The gene is also subject to alternative splicing, which may result in different isoforms, potentially altering its structure and function. However, specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of ZNF197 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ZNF197 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. It is part of the SCAN family of zinc-finger proteins, which are expanded in placental mammals and appear to be under positive selection in Homininae, indicating a potential role in placentation (Kennedy2019Copper). ZNF197 acts as a transcriptional repressor of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α), suggesting its involvement in the regulation of hypoxic responses (Kennedy2019Copper; Bosco2006Hypoxia).

The gene is co-expressed with 138 other genes enriched for growth-related processes, indicating its involvement in fetal growth signaling and potentially in copper metabolism (Kennedy2019Copper). ZNF197 is also associated with DNA methylation changes in response to copper levels, which may influence its expression and function in placental development and metabolism (Kennedy2019Copper).

In terms of cellular localization, ZNF197 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it regulates cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Its activity is modulated by its interaction with other proteins and its involvement in transcriptional repression (Kennedy2019Copper).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF197 is known to interact with several proteins and participate in transcriptional regulation. One of its isoforms, VHLaK, interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) through its KRAB-A domain. This interaction is crucial for the repression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) transcriptional activity and HIF-1α-induced VEGF expression. VHLaK can recruit KRAB-associated protein-1 (KAP1) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family members, forming a complex that enhances transcriptional repression (Li2003The).

The SCAN domain of ZNF197 facilitates homo-oligomerization, which enhances its repressive activity. This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, allowing ZNF197 to dimerize with other SCAN family members, potentially altering nucleotide binding and transcriptional regulation (Collins2005The).

ZNF197 is also identified as a transcriptional repressor of HIF-1α, with its DNA binding activity potentially influencing the expression of genes associated with growth hormone secretion and lipid biosynthesis (Kennedy2019Copper). Despite its interactions, ZNF197 does not form heterodimers with certain SCAN domains, such as Zfp206, indicating selective interaction capabilities within the SCAN domain family (Liang2012Structural).
