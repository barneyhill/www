# EXOC1L

## Overview
EXOC1L is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 1 like, which is involved in the exocyst complex, a key player in the regulation of vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion processes. The exocyst complex is essential for the targeting and tethering of secretory vesicles to specific sites on the plasma membrane, facilitating exocytosis and cell surface expansion. The protein encoded by EXOC1L is categorized as a component of the exocyst complex, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell migration, growth, and morphogenesis. Understanding the role of EXOC1L and its encoded protein in these processes is vital for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular dynamics and their implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
