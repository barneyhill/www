# TXN2

## Overview
The TXN2 gene encodes thioredoxin 2, a mitochondrial protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular redox homeostasis and antioxidant defense. As a member of the thioredoxin family, thioredoxin 2 is characterized by its thioredoxin fold and functions primarily as a redox-active protein, facilitating the reduction of protein disulfides and maintaining a reducing environment within the mitochondria (Chasapis2019Implications; AlOkda2023Evolutionarily). This protein is integral to the mitochondrial thioredoxin system, which includes thioredoxin reductase 2 and peroxiredoxins, and is essential for mitigating oxidative stress by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Holzerova2015Human). TXN2's interactions with various mitochondrial components underscore its involvement in critical processes such as energy metabolism, apoptosis regulation, and protein synthesis (Chasapis2019Implications; AlOkda2023Evolutionarily). Mutations in the TXN2 gene have been linked to severe clinical manifestations, including neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Holzerova2015Human).

## Structure
Thioredoxin 2 (TXN2) is a mitochondrial protein with a primary structure consisting of 166 amino acids, forming an 18 kDa polypeptide chain (Wen2009Genetic). The active site of TXN2 includes the sequence Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys, where the cysteine residues are crucial for maintaining protein thiols in a reduced state, contributing to mitochondrial antioxidant defenses (Nonn2003The; Wen2009Genetic). 

The secondary structure of TXN2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of thioredoxin proteins, which contribute to its stability and function (AlOkda2023Evolutionarily). The tertiary structure is characterized by a thioredoxin fold, a common feature among proteins involved in redox signaling, which includes a disulfide bond crucial for its antioxidant function (AlOkda2023Evolutionarily). 

TXN2 may form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, which is significant for its function in redox regulation (Chasapis2019Implications). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions (Chasapis2019Implications). Splice variant isoforms of TXN2 may exist, potentially altering its functional properties and interactions within the mitochondrial environment (Chasapis2019Implications).

## Function
Thioredoxin 2 (TXN2) is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. It is involved in the mitochondrial thioredoxin system, which includes thioredoxin reductase 2 (TXNRD2) and peroxiredoxins 3 and 5 (PRDX3, PRDX5), and is essential for eliminating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) within the mitochondria, thus preventing oxidative damage and participating in cell signaling (Chasapis2019Implications; Holzerova2015Human).

TXN2 interacts with various mitochondrial proteins, influencing processes such as protein synthesis, folding, and assembly. It is involved in mitoribosomal assembly and protein synthesis through interactions with mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA and other components (Chasapis2019Implications). TXN2 also plays a role in energy metabolism by interacting with components of the electron transport chain and enzymes involved in the citric acid cycle, such as aconitate hydratase and isocitrate dehydrogenases (Chasapis2019Implications).

TXN2 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, influencing apoptosis regulation by binding to apoptosis-signal kinase 1 (ASK1) and preventing apoptotic signaling cascades (AlOkda2023Evolutionarily). Its deficiency can lead to increased ROS levels, impaired mitochondrial function, and reduced ATP production, highlighting its role in oxidative stress defense (Holzerova2015Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TXN2 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial protein thioredoxin 2, have significant clinical implications, particularly in neurodegenerative disorders. A study involving a 16-year-old patient with early-onset neurodegeneration identified a homozygous stop mutation in TXN2, resulting in the absence of the TXN2 protein. This led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, impaired oxidative stress defense, and mitochondrial dysfunction, including reduced ATP production and increased lactate levels. The patient exhibited severe developmental delays, drug-resistant epilepsy, optic neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy (Holzerova2015Human).

TXN2 deficiency also affects mitochondrial function by impairing the cycling of peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3) in the mitochondrial H2O2 defense system, leading to the accumulation of PRDX3 dimers and reduced oxygen consumption (Holzerova2015Human). Antioxidant supplementation has shown potential in reducing ROS production and improving clinical symptoms in patients with TXN2 mutations (Holzerova2015Human).

In Alzheimer's disease models, altered TXN2 expression influences amyloidogenesis by modulating BACE1 expression, a key enzyme in amyloid precursor protein processing. TXN2 overexpression decreases ROS levels and BACE1 expression, suggesting a protective role against amyloid-beta production (Li2020Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
Thioredoxin 2 (TXN2) is a mitochondrial protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis. TXN2 interacts with mitochondrial aconitate hydratase (ACO2) and isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH1, IDH2, IDH3G), suggesting its involvement in the citric acid cycle and potential feedback mechanisms with IDH2 (Chasapis2019Implications). It also interacts with components of the electron transport chain, such as cytochrome c oxidase subunits MT-CO1 and NDUFA4, and ATP synthase subunits ATP5B and ATP5A, indicating a role in redox regulation and ATP synthesis (Chasapis2019Implications).

TXN2 is involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis through interactions with proteins like HSPA9, which is central to this process (Chasapis2019Implications). It also interacts with mitochondrial creatine kinase (CKMT2) and acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase 2-like (ACSS1), implicating it in energy metabolism (Chasapis2019Implications). TXN2's interaction with peroxiredoxins PRDX3 and PRDX5 is essential for reducing hydrogen peroxide and maintaining a reducing environment in the mitochondrial matrix (Holzerova2015Human). These interactions highlight TXN2's critical role in cellular defense against oxidative stress and its potential link to various mitochondrial dysfunctions.
