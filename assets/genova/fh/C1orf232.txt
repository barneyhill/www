# C1orf232

## Overview
C1orf232 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 230. This protein is categorized as a hypothetical protein due to the limited functional characterization available in current scientific literature. While the precise biological role of C1orf232 remains to be fully elucidated, preliminary studies suggest potential involvement in cellular processes that are yet to be defined. The gene's expression patterns and any associated pathways or interactions are subjects of ongoing research, with implications for understanding its role in human health and disease. Further investigation is required to determine the clinical significance and potential therapeutic targets related to C1orf232.
