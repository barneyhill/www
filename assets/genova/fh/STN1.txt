# STN1

## Overview
The STN1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the CST complex, which is involved in telomere maintenance and DNA replication. The STN1 protein, characterized by its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold domain and winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) motifs, plays a pivotal role in binding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and interacting with other proteins within the CST complex, such as CTC1 and TEN1 (Bryan2013Structure; Amir2020Structural). This interaction is essential for the protection and replication of telomeric DNA, particularly in the C-strand fill-in synthesis following telomerase action, which is crucial for maintaining telomere integrity and preventing genomic instability (Stewart2018Emerging). Mutations in the STN1 gene have been associated with Coats plus syndrome, underscoring its importance in genomic stability and disease prevention (Simon2016Mutations).

## Structure
The STN1 protein is a component of the CST complex, which plays a crucial role in telomere maintenance and DNA replication. Structurally, STN1 is composed of 368 amino acids and features an N-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold domain, which is a common motif involved in nucleic acid binding (Amir2020Structural; Stewart2018Emerging). This OB-fold domain is essential for binding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and interacting with DNA polymerase α (POLα) (Chai2021The).

The C-terminal region of STN1 contains two winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to the structural flexibility of the protein (Lyu2021CST; Bryan2013Structure). These motifs allow STN1 to interact with other components of the CST complex, such as CTC1 and TEN1, forming a stable heterotrimeric assembly (Lim2020The).

STN1's quaternary structure involves its interaction with CTC1 and TEN1, forming a complex that binds ssDNA with high affinity, although STN1 alone has a lower binding affinity compared to the entire CST complex (Bryan2013Structure). The protein's structure is conserved across species, indicating its essential role in telomere maintenance (Bryan2013Structure).

## Function
The STN1 gene encodes a subunit of the CST complex, which is crucial for telomere maintenance and DNA replication in healthy human cells. The CST complex, composed of CTC1, STN1, and TEN1, binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at telomeres, protecting them from degradation and ensuring their proper function (Miyake2009RPAlike). STN1 is involved in the replication of telomeric DNA, particularly in the C-strand fill-in synthesis following telomerase action, which is essential for maintaining telomere integrity and preventing genome instability (Stewart2018Emerging).

STN1 also plays a role in the restart of stalled replication forks, a process critical for genomic stability. It facilitates replication restart by interacting with DNA polymerase alpha and is involved in the firing of new replication origins after fork stalling (Stewart2012Human). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it localizes to telomeres throughout the cell cycle (Miyake2009RPAlike). The proper function of STN1 is essential for cellular longevity, as its depletion leads to telomere dysfunction and premature cellular senescence (Boccardi2015Stn1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STN1 gene, a component of the CST complex, are linked to Coats plus syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by retinal telangiectasia, leukodystrophy, intracranial calcifications, and various systemic manifestations such as gastrointestinal bleeding, liver fibrosis, and osteopenia (Simon2016Mutations; Acharya2021Novel). Patients with Coats plus syndrome often exhibit genomic instability and telomere defects due to STN1 mutations, which can lead to abnormal telomere phenotypes, including extremely long single-stranded G-rich telomeric sequences and telomere-telomere fusions (Simon2016Mutations).

Specific mutations, such as R135T and D157Y, have been shown to cause significant conformational changes in the STN1 protein, affecting its interaction with the TEN1 protein and disrupting telomere homeostasis (Amir2019Structural). These mutations destabilize the protein structure, contributing to the pathogenesis of Coats plus syndrome (Amir2019Structural). The STN1 gene's role in telomere maintenance and DNA replication is crucial, and its dysfunction can lead to severe clinical manifestations, highlighting its importance in genomic stability and disease prevention (Simon2016Mutations).

## Interactions
The STN1 protein is a crucial component of the CST complex, which includes CTC1 and TEN1, and is involved in telomere maintenance and DNA replication. STN1 interacts with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and exhibits high affinity for ssDNA substrates that are 18 bases or longer. This interaction is primarily facilitated by its highly conserved DNA binding pocket (Bryan2013Structure). Within the CST complex, STN1 interacts with both CTC1 and TEN1, forming a trimeric complex essential for efficient ssDNA binding and telomere protection (Miyake2009RPAlike).

STN1 also interacts with DNA polymerase α-primase, specifically binding to the POLA2 subunit. This interaction is mediated by the OB fold domain of STN1, which is crucial for stimulating primase-polymerase activity, although the DNA-binding and protein interaction functions of STN1 are distinct (Ganduri2017STN1–POLA2). The interaction with POLA2 is stable and involves a 1:1 stoichiometry, with both the N- and C-terminal domains of STN1 capable of binding to POLA2 (Lue2014The).

STN1's role in the CST complex and its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids are vital for its function in telomere maintenance and DNA replication processes (Miyake2009RPAlike).
