# CDH5

## Overview
CDH5 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 5, commonly referred to as vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), which is a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the cadherin superfamily. VE-cadherin is a critical component of endothelial adherens junctions, playing a pivotal role in maintaining vascular integrity and regulating endothelial cell functions such as adhesion, proliferation, and migration (Schubert2014Cadherin; Sauteur2014Cdh5VEcadherin). The protein is characterized by its five extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region, and a conserved cytoplasmic tail, which facilitate homophilic interactions essential for cell-cell adhesion (Hulpiau2009Molecular). VE-cadherin's interactions with cytoplasmic partners, including β-catenin and plakoglobin, link it to the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cellular signaling and mechanotransduction (Sauteur2014Cdh5VEcadherin). The gene's expression and the protein's function are modulated by various factors, including phosphorylation and corticosteroids, impacting processes such as vascular permeability and angiogenesis (Angst2001The; Schubert2014Cadherin). CDH5 is clinically significant, with alterations in its expression linked to cancer progression and vascular disorders (Schubert2014Cadherin; Casal2019Beyond).

## Structure
The CDH5 gene encodes a calcium-binding cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein, known as VE-cadherin, which is a classic cadherin. The protein structure includes five extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail (Schubert2014Cadherin). These extracellular cadherin repeats are involved in homophilic interactions that are crucial for cell adhesion and are characterized by a beta-sheet-rich domain structure (Hulpiau2009Molecular). 

VE-cadherin forms homodimers at cell junctions, which is essential for its function in maintaining vascular integrity and controlling the cohesion and organization of intercellular junctions (Schubert2014Cadherin). The protein interacts with cytoplasmic partners such as β-catenin and plakoglobin, linking the actin cytoskeleton to adherens junctions, which influences cell adhesion and signaling (Sauteur2014Cdh5VEcadherin). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the adhesive functions of VE-cadherin, affecting its role in vascular permeability (Angst2001The). The expression of CDH5 can be influenced by corticosteroids, with prednisolone shown to significantly reduce its expression in endothelial cells (Schubert2014Cadherin).

## Function
The CDH5 gene encodes vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), a critical component of endothelial adherens junctions. VE-cadherin plays a central role in endothelial cell biology by regulating cell adhesion, proliferation, survival, shape, and motility. It is involved in transforming cell junctions from circular to elliptic shapes, a process that requires actin polymerization (Sauteur2014Cdh5VEcadherin). The C-terminal portion of VE-cadherin interacts with proteins like β-catenin and plakoglobin, linking the actin cytoskeleton to adherens junctions, which is essential for sensing, resisting, and transmitting mechanical forces (Sauteur2014Cdh5VEcadherin).

VE-cadherin is crucial for angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, by maintaining cell junction integrity and facilitating cell migration and junctional remodeling. It suppresses VEGFR2-Rac1-dependent vessel sprouting and is involved in the dynamics of endothelial cell junctions necessary for cell migration during angiogenesis (Cao2017Polarized). VE-cadherin also plays a role in endothelial cell interface elongation during angiogenic sprouting by promoting cortical actin polymerization (Sauteur2014Cdh5VEcadherin). In vivo, VE-cadherin is important for vascular permeability and leukocyte transmigration, and its absence leads to embryonic lethality due to cardiovascular defects (Sauteur2014Cdh5VEcadherin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDH5 gene, also known as VE-cadherin, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and vascular disorders. In cancer, overexpression of VE-cadherin is associated with vasculogenic mimicry, a process where cancer cells form blood-vessel-like structures, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. This phenomenon is observed in tumors such as uveal melanoma, glioblastoma, and certain pediatric cancers, and is linked to poor survival rates and reduced efficacy of antiangiogenic treatments (Casal2019Beyond). High CDH5 expression is also correlated with tumor progression and poor survival in gastric cancer, although it is not an independent prognostic factor (Higuchi2016Cadherin).

In the context of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), variants in the CDH5 gene have been statistically associated with the condition, particularly in males. The gene's expression is downregulated by corticosteroids, which may increase vascular permeability and contribute to the disease's pathogenesis (Schubert2014Cadherin). These findings suggest that CDH5 plays a significant role in both cancer progression and vascular disorders, highlighting its clinical significance.

## Interactions
CDH5, also known as VE-cadherin, is a key component of endothelial cell-cell junctions, where it participates in various protein interactions crucial for maintaining vascular integrity and regulating endothelial functions. VE-cadherin interacts with the actin cytoskeleton through a complex involving catenins, specifically binding to p120-catenin, β-catenin, and α-catenin. This interaction forms a structural bridge that links VE-cadherin to actin filaments, which is essential for cell junction integrity and mechanotransduction (Dorland2016Cell–cell; Taha2014ARP23mediated).

VE-cadherin's activity is modulated by phosphorylation events, where kinases such as Src and C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) phosphorylate its cytoplasmic domain, affecting signaling and junctional permeability. Src-mediated phosphorylation increases permeability, while dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases strengthens junctions (Casal2019Beyond).

The protein also interacts with the ARP2/3 complex, which regulates actin dynamics at cell junctions. This interaction is crucial for the formation of junction-associated lamellipodia, facilitating the formation of new VE-cadherin adhesion sites and maintaining monolayer integrity (Taha2014ARP23mediated).

Additionally, VE-cadherin is involved in a complex with PACSIN2, EHD4, and MICAL-L1, which coordinates its trafficking and turnover at adherens junctions, playing a significant role in endothelial migration and angiogenesis (Malinova2021A).
