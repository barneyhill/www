# SERINC2

## Overview
SERINC2 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein serine incorporator 2, which plays a critical role in the incorporation of serine into membrane lipids. This process is essential for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids, key components of cell membranes that are vital for maintaining membrane integrity and facilitating signal transduction (Mao2022Serinc2; Xu2022The). The protein is predominantly active in the cell membrane and is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of inflammatory responses and apoptosis pathways (Qi2020Serine). SERINC2's function in lipid synthesis and membrane dynamics underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and suggests potential implications in health conditions related to inflammation and cellular stress (Mao2022Serinc2). Additionally, SERINC2 is highly expressed in neurons, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where it contributes to neural plasticity and signaling (Zuo2013NKAIN1–SERINC2).

## Function
SERINC2 (serine incorporator 2) is a transmembrane protein involved in the incorporation of serine into membrane lipids, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids. These lipids are essential components of cell membranes, playing significant roles in maintaining membrane integrity and facilitating signal transduction processes (Mao2022Serinc2; Xu2022The). SERINC2 is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it contributes to membrane lipid biosynthesis and the regulation of membrane trafficking (Qi2020Serine).

In healthy human cells, SERINC2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the modulation of inflammatory responses and apoptosis pathways. It is suggested to maintain lipid raft integrity, which is crucial for effective signal transduction (Mao2022Serinc2). Although the specific physiological functions of SERINC2 in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, its role in lipid synthesis and membrane dynamics indicates its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Xu2022The). The protein's involvement in these processes suggests that it may have broader implications in organismal health, potentially influencing conditions related to inflammation and cellular stress responses (Mao2022Serinc2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SERINC2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In gliomas, particularly low-grade gliomas (LGG), elevated SERINC2 expression is associated with shorter overall survival, making it an independent prognostic marker for LGG. This association is particularly significant in patients with the isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) mutation (Qi2020Serine). 

In the context of psychiatric disorders, SERINC2 has been identified as a risk gene for bipolar disorder (BD) in the Chinese population. A specific nonsense variant, rs2275434, was found to be significantly associated with BD, suggesting that SERINC2 mutations may contribute to the disorder's pathophysiology (Yang2021SERINC2increases). 

SERINC2 is also linked to alcohol dependence in individuals of European descent. Rare variants in the NKAIN1-SERINC2 region have been associated with this condition, with some variants affecting SERINC2 mRNA expression and being linked to Alzheimer's disease (Zuo2013Rare; Zuo2013NKAIN1–SERINC2). 

Additionally, SERINC2 has been proposed as a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A chromosomal duplication involving SERINC2 was identified in patients with ASD, suggesting its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Hnoonual2017Chromosomal).

## Interactions
SERINC2 is involved in the incorporation of serine into membrane lipids, a process crucial for lipid biosynthesis and membrane dynamics. It is part of a family of cell membrane carrier proteins and is highly concentrated in neurons of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. SERINC2 co-localizes with lipid biosynthetic enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum and interacts with an intracellular serine-synthesizing protein complex, facilitating the synthesis of phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids, which are essential for neural plasticity and signaling (Zuo2013NKAIN1–SERINC2).

In the context of sepsis-associated acute lung injury (ALI), SERINC2 interacts with the Akt signaling pathway. It enhances Akt phosphorylation, which is crucial for its protective effects against apoptosis and inflammation. The use of an Akt-specific inhibitor demonstrated that Akt signaling is essential for SERINC2's protective role, indicating a pro-survival interaction mediated by the Akt pathway (Mao2022Serinc2). Additionally, SERINC2 is involved in modulating inflammatory responses by interacting with inflammatory pathways and cytokines, playing a protective role in ALI by maintaining lipid raft integrity (Mao2022Serinc2). These interactions highlight SERINC2's role in cellular signaling and its potential impact on disease processes.
