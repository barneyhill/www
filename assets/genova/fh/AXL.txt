# AXL

## Overview
AXL is a gene that encodes the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, a member of the TAM (Tyro3, AXL, Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The AXL protein is characterized by its transmembrane structure, which includes an extracellular domain with two immunoglobulin-like domains and two fibronectin type III-like domains, and an intracellular domain containing a conserved tyrosine kinase domain (Sasaki2005Structural; Tsou2014Receptor). This receptor is primarily activated by its ligand, growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6), which triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell survival, proliferation, migration, and immune regulation (HAFIZI2006Signalling; Linger2008TAM). AXL plays a significant role in various physiological processes and is implicated in pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where it contributes to tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance (Zhu2019AXL; Wang2021Prognostic).

## Structure
The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is a member of the TAM family, which also includes Tyro3 and Mer. Its molecular structure is characterized by an extracellular domain composed of two immunoglobulin-like (IG) domains followed by two fibronectin type III-like domains (Sasaki2005Structural; Tsou2014Receptor). The IG domains are arranged in a fully extended fashion, with the IG1 domain belonging to the intermediate (I) set of the IG superfamily, featuring a characteristic ABED and A'GFCC' topology (Sasaki2005Structural). The intracellular region contains a highly conserved tyrosine kinase domain, which includes a TAM-specific sequence KW(I/L)A(I/L)ES in the catalytic domain (Tsou2014Receptor).

The kinase domain of AXL has been crystallized, revealing both inactive and active conformations. The inactive conformation features a rotated C-helix away from the kinase domain, while the active conformation shows an ordered activation loop and a C-helix forming a salt-bridge with Lys567, indicative of active kinases (Gajiwala2017The). The juxtamembrane region plays a role in activation, with different conformations in active and inactive states (Gajiwala2017The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are crucial for AXL's activation and function. Key phosphorylation sites include Tyr698, Tyr702, and Tyr703, which stabilize the activation loop upon GAS6 binding (Gajiwala2017The). AXL can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure (Tsou2014Receptor).

## Function
The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells, including cell survival, proliferation, migration, and immune regulation. AXL is activated by its ligand, Gas6, which triggers various downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK, promoting cell survival and proliferation (HAFIZI2006Signalling; Linger2008TAM). In particular, Gas6/AXL signaling enhances the activity of the NF-kB transcription factor, leading to increased levels of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-xL, and reduces caspase 3 activity, thereby promoting cell survival (HAFIZI2006Signalling).

AXL also plays a role in cell migration by influencing the actin cytoskeleton and promoting cellular motility, which is crucial for processes such as angiogenesis and tissue repair (Linger2008TAM). In the immune system, AXL is involved in regulating inflammatory responses, as it helps limit the severity and duration of immune reactions by modulating cytokine production (Lu2001Homeostatic; Linger2008TAM).

AXL is primarily active in the cell membrane and is expressed in various cell types, including epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic cells, contributing to its diverse functional roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and repair (HAFIZI2006Signalling).

## Clinical Significance
The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is implicated in various cancer-related processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, and drug resistance. Altered expression of AXL is associated with increased malignancy, metastasis, and poor prognosis in several cancers, such as breast, prostate, ovarian, colorectal, and lung cancers (Zhu2019AXL). In breast cancer, increased AXL expression is linked to the loss of epithelial markers and the gain of mesenchymal markers, promoting metastasis (Zhu2019AXL). AXL also contributes to drug resistance by heterodimerizing with other receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR and MET, allowing cancer cells to evade inhibitors (Zhu2019AXL).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), AXL is an independent prognostic factor, with its expression linked to overall survival and associated with immune infiltrations and tumor mutation burden (Wang2021Prognostic). AXL's role in immune evasion is significant, as it promotes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by affecting immune cell infiltration and cytokine profiles, contributing to resistance against immune checkpoint inhibitors (Engelsen2022Dissecting). Targeting AXL has shown potential in enhancing immune responses and improving the efficacy of therapies like anti-PD-1 (Engelsen2022Dissecting).

## Interactions
The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. AXL is known to physically associate with the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase upon ligand stimulation, which is crucial for its signaling functions (Fridell1996Differential). It also interacts with the Grb2 adapter protein, linking AXL to the Ras-ERK pathway, and this interaction is facilitated by a potential Grb2 binding site, YVNM, in the AXL intracellular domain (Fridell1996Differential; Hafizi2002Interaction). The Shc protein is tyrosine phosphorylated in AXL-expressing cells upon ligand stimulation, suggesting a role in AXL signaling through the Shc-Grb2 complex (Fridell1996Differential).

AXL also interacts with the novel protein C1-TEN, which contains SH2 and PTB domains. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that C1-TEN may link AXL to various downstream signaling pathways (Hafizi2002Interaction). AXL's primary ligand is Gas6, which binds specifically to AXL and not to other related receptors like Tyro3, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Stitt1995The; Tsou2014Receptor). The binding of Gas6 to AXL is essential for receptor activation and subsequent signaling events (Tsou2014Receptor).
