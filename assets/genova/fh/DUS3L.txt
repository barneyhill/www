# DUS3L

## Overview
DUS3L is a gene that encodes the dihydrouridine synthase 3-like protein, an enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of transfer RNA (tRNA). This enzyme is categorized as a synthase, specifically responsible for catalyzing the reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine, a modification critical for the proper folding and function of tRNA molecules. The activity of the dihydrouridine synthase 3-like protein is essential for maintaining protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis, as it influences the stability and expression levels of tRNA. DUS3L is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it modifies specific sites on tRNA, contributing to the regulation of protein translation and cell proliferation. The gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer prognosis and epigenetic regulation, highlighting its potential significance in disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies (Wang2022Identification; Yu2023Cell; Back2012Epigenetic).

## Function
DUS3L encodes a dihydrouridine synthase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules by catalyzing the reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine. This modification is essential for the proper folding and function of tRNA, impacting protein synthesis and cellular protein homeostasis (Yu2023Cell). DUS3L is active in the cytoplasm, where it modifies specific sites on tRNA, such as D47 on tRNA-Val-CAC, which is crucial for maintaining the translational function of tRNA (Yu2023Cell).

In healthy human cells, DUS3L contributes to the regulation of protein translation and cell proliferation. Knockout studies have shown that the absence of DUS3L leads to compromised protein translation efficiency, although it does not significantly affect cell proliferation in some cell types (Yu2023Cell). The enzyme's activity is linked to the stability and expression levels of tRNA, which are vital for efficient protein synthesis (Yu2023Cell). DUS3L's role in modifying tRNA is part of a broader network of RNA modifications that ensure the proper function and stability of tRNA molecules, thereby supporting overall cellular function (Yu2023Cell).

## Clinical Significance
DUS3L has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), DUS3L is part of a prognostic gene signature known as CDPsig, which includes genes associated with tumor recurrence risk in stage II-III CRC patients. This signature has been validated across multiple datasets, indicating its potential utility in predicting patient outcomes and informing treatment strategies (Wang2022Identification).

Alterations in DUS3L expression have also been linked to translational regulation defects. Studies have shown that knockout of DUS3L in HeLa cells reduces global protein translation, although it does not affect cell growth. This suggests that DUS3L plays a role in maintaining efficient protein synthesis, which is crucial for normal cellular function (Yu2023Cell).

In the context of epigenetic changes, DUS3L has been identified as hypermethylated during keratinocyte differentiation, indicating a potential role in skin-related conditions (Back2012Epigenetic). Despite these associations, the direct clinical significance of DUS3L in liver function or bile acid metabolism remains unclear, as studies have not established a direct link to these processes (Kulecka2017Clinical).
