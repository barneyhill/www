# AQP3

## Overview
Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is a gene that encodes the aquaporin 3 protein, a member of the aquaglyceroporin subfamily of transmembrane proteins. This protein functions as a channel facilitating the transport of water, glycerol, and urea across cell membranes, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular hydration and homeostasis (Unknownauthors2021StructureandFunctionofAquaporins:theMembraneWaterChannelProteins; Hara‐Chikuma2005Aquaporin‐3). AQP3 is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract, where it contributes to processes such as skin hydration, wound healing, and water absorption (Sougrat2002Functional; HaraChikuma2008Roles). The protein's structure is characterized by six transmembrane α-helices forming a pore, and it typically assembles as a homotetramer in the membrane (Verkman2000Structure). AQP3's expression and function are implicated in several physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer, skin disorders, and gastrointestinal diseases, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Ala2021Aquaporins; Moosavi2019Aquaporins).

## Structure
Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is a membrane protein that functions as a channel for water, glycerol, and urea. The primary structure of AQP3 includes conserved Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs, which are crucial for its function in facilitating water transport through hydrogen bonding with water molecules (Unknownauthors2021StructureandFunctionofAquaporins:theMembraneWaterChannelProteins). The secondary structure of AQP3 consists of six transmembrane α-helical segments, forming a barrel-like configuration that surrounds a central pore (Unknownauthors2021StructureandFunctionofAquaporins:theMembraneWaterChannelProteins; Verkman2000Structure).

The tertiary structure of AQP3 is characterized by the 'hourglass model,' where the helical segments create cytoplasmic and extracellular vestibules linked by an aqueous pore (Unknownauthors2021StructureandFunctionofAquaporins:theMembraneWaterChannelProteins). In terms of quaternary structure, AQP3 forms homotetramers in the membrane, with each monomer functioning independently as a channel (Unknownauthors2021StructureandFunctionofAquaporins:theMembraneWaterChannelProteins; Verkman2000Structure).

AQP3 is expressed in various tissues, including the basolateral membrane of the kidney's collecting duct and human skin, where it plays a role in glycerol transport and skin hydration (Unknownauthors2021StructureandFunctionofAquaporins:theMembraneWaterChannelProteins; Hara‐Chikuma2005Aquaporin‐3). The protein's activity can be inhibited by low pH and nickel concentrations (Unknownauthors2021StructureandFunctionofAquaporins:theMembraneWaterChannelProteins).

## Function
Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is a transmembrane protein that functions as an aquaglyceroporin, facilitating the transport of water and glycerol across cell membranes. It is prominently expressed in the basal layer of keratinocytes in the epidermis, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining skin hydration and elasticity by regulating water and glycerol transport (Hara‐Chikuma2005Aquaporin‐3; HaraChikuma2008Roles). AQP3 is involved in the physiological process of water transport in the skin, contributing to the skin's barrier function by maintaining hydration in the viable layers of the epidermis (Sougrat2002Functional).

In addition to its role in hydration, AQP3 is essential for epidermal cell migration and proliferation, particularly during wound healing. It facilitates the transport of glycerol, which is vital for keratinocyte migration and proliferation, processes that are impaired in AQP3-deficient models (HaraChikuma2007Aquaporin3; HaraChikuma2008Roles). The protein's function in glycerol transport is significant for skin physiology, as glycerol acts as a humectant, helping to retain moisture and support cellular processes (HaraChikuma2007Aquaporin3; BouryJamot2006Expression). AQP3's activity is crucial for maintaining skin health and facilitating effective wound repair.

## Clinical Significance
Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In cancer, AQP3 is overexpressed in several types, including gastric, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, where it promotes tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis through pathways like PI3K/AKT/SNAIL and Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin (Ala2021Aquaporins; Moosavi2019Aquaporins). In gastric cancer, AQP3 overexpression is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to poor prognosis and reduced overall survival (Chen2014Aquaporin).

In gastrointestinal conditions, AQP3 is linked to water absorption, affecting constipation and diarrhea. Its upregulation is noted in dysfunctional constipation, while its inhibition can alleviate constipation symptoms (Ala2021Aquaporins). In osteoarthritis, AQP3 expression in chondrocytes is associated with joint swelling and edema due to altered water metabolism (Ala2021Aquaporins).

AQP3 also plays a role in skin conditions. In eczema, its overexpression is linked to skin dryness, while in psoriasis, AQP3 knockout mice show reduced disease development, indicating its role in exacerbation (Ala2021Aquaporins). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, AQP3 expression is significantly lower, although it does not correlate with tumor progression stages (Li2022Abnormal).

## Interactions
Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is known to interact with several proteins, particularly in keratinocytes. AQP3 colocalizes with phospholipase D2 (PLD2) in caveolin-rich membrane microdomains, suggesting a direct or adaptor-mediated protein-protein interaction. This interaction is significant for the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol, a lipid involved in signaling pathways that regulate keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation (Qin2011Aquaporin3; Zheng2003Aquaporin). AQP3 does not directly interact with caveolin 1, but their colocalization in lipid rafts is influenced by the lipid environment (Zheng2003Aquaporin).

In other tissues, AQP3 interacts with the ClC-3 chloride channel in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, playing a role in cell volume regulation and differentiation (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight). In adipocytes, AQP3 interacts with perilipin-1, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight). AQP3's interactions are modulated by various factors, including extracellular calcium levels and osmotic stress, which influence its expression and function in keratinocytes (Qin2011Aquaporin3). These interactions highlight AQP3's role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and response to environmental changes.
