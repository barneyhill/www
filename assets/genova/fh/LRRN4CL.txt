# LRRN4CL

## Overview
LRRN4CL is a gene that encodes the LRRN4 C-terminal like protein, which is implicated in various biological processes, including immune response and myocardial recovery. The protein is characterized by its extracellular domain, which facilitates interactions with other cell-surface proteins, such as CRTAC1, although the functional consequences of these interactions remain to be fully elucidated (van2021CRISPR). LRRN4CL has been identified as a significant predictor of myocardial recovery, with differential expression levels observed between clinical responders and non-responders (Visker2024Integrating). Additionally, in the context of cancer biology, LRRN4CL is associated with immune cell infiltration and cytotoxicity in triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting its potential role in tumor immunity (Zhang2022Identification). Despite these associations, the precise molecular mechanisms and pathways involving LRRN4CL remain an active area of research.

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The LRRN4CL protein has been identified to interact with CRTAC1 through its extracellular domain, as discovered using cell microarray screening. However, this interaction does not appear to mediate the enhanced metastatic phenotype observed in mice, since Crtac1 is barely detectable in mouse lungs (van2021CRISPR). The study also employed a Retrogenix cell microarray to screen for interactions of a fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of human LRRN4CL with a library of human transmembrane and cell-surface proteins, although specific interactions beyond CRTAC1 were not detailed (van2021CRISPR).

In the context of myocardial recovery, LRRN4CL was identified as a significant predictor of myocardial recovery, with higher expression levels in non-responders compared to responders and non-failing donors. The study utilized STRING analysis to explore protein-protein interactions, but specific interactions involving LRRN4CL were not detailed (Visker2024Integrating). In triple-negative breast cancer, LRRN4CL was highlighted as one of the key genes associated with CD8+ T cell infiltration and immune cell cytotoxicity, suggesting a role in tumor immunity, although specific protein interactions were not provided (Zhang2022Identification).
