# KDM6A

## Overview
KDM6A is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 6A, also known as UTX. This protein is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of histone demethylases, which play a critical role in epigenetic regulation by removing methyl groups from histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a mark associated with transcriptional repression. KDM6A is involved in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, and tumor suppression, by modulating chromatin structure and gene expression. The protein functions as part of the MLL3/4 complex, contributing to enhancer activation and transcriptional regulation. Mutations in KDM6A are implicated in several diseases, such as Kabuki syndrome type 2 and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Chen2021Significance; Faundes2021Clinical; Gažová2019Lysine).

## Structure
The KDM6A protein, also known as UTX, is composed of 1,401 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 154,177 Da (Schulz2019The). Its structure includes several key domains: a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is essential for its demethylase activity, and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Tran2020Lysine; Gažová2019Lysine). The JmjC domain is subdivided into pre-, main-, and post-JmjC subdomains, with the main-JmjC domain coordinating iron ions and binding to the histone 3 tail during demethylation (Schulz2019The). The post-JmjC domain includes a Zn2+-binding region crucial for catalysis and histone binding (Schulz2019The).

The protein's secondary structure features a jumonji domain with a jelly-roll fold flanked by α-helices, which is a characteristic of the cupin superfamily (Sengoku2011Structural). The zinc-binding domain, composed of six beta strands and two alpha helices, undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding, which is essential for substrate specificity (Sengoku2011Structural).

KDM6A is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, some of which lack the JmjC or TPR domains (Gažová2019Lysine). The protein is also partially intrinsically disordered, particularly in the middle region, which may serve as a linker for protein interactions (Schulz2019The).

## Function
KDM6A, also known as lysine demethylase 6A, is a crucial enzyme involved in the demethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a modification associated with transcriptional repression. This demethylation process is essential for regulating gene expression, particularly during development, as it facilitates chromatin opening for transcription factor binding and RNA polymerase recruitment (Gažová2019Lysine). KDM6A is active in the nucleus and plays a significant role in cell differentiation and development by interacting with transcription factors and chromatin regulators (Tran2020Lysine).

KDM6A is part of the MLL3/4 complex, which is critical for enhancer activation and gene expression regulation. This interaction is necessary for the stability and function of KDM6A, highlighting its role in maintaining normal cellular functions (Tran2020Lysine). The protein is involved in various biological processes, including muscle regeneration, craniofacial development, and immune function, where it influences the expression of specific genes and cell differentiation (Tran2020Lysine).

KDM6A also acts as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting tumor growth and progression in various cancers. Its demethylation activity is crucial for maintaining tumor suppressive programs and regulating cell cycle control (Gažová2019Lysine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KDM6A gene are associated with several diseases, most notably Kabuki syndrome type 2 (KS2) and certain cancers. KS2 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, growth delays, intellectual disabilities, and various congenital anomalies. Pathogenic variants in KDM6A, including truncating and missense mutations, contribute to the phenotypic variability observed in KS2, with males often experiencing more severe symptoms than females due to differences in X-chromosome inactivation (Faundes2021Clinical). These mutations can disrupt the interaction between KDM6A and histone H3, leading to a loss of function and affecting embryonic development (Petrizzelli2020Mechanisms).

In cancer, particularly bladder cancer, KDM6A mutations are prevalent and have been linked to poor prognosis. These mutations are associated with lower levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and a state of immune tolerance, suggesting a role in immune escape mechanisms. Patients with KDM6A mutations often exhibit reduced mRNA expression levels and worse survival outcomes, although these mutations are not independent prognostic factors (Chen2021Significance). The gene's alterations in expression and interaction with other proteins can significantly impact disease progression and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
KDM6A, also known as UTX, is a histone demethylase that participates in various protein interactions, primarily as a component of the MLL2/3 or COMPASS complex. This complex includes proteins such as MLL2, MLL3, ASH2L, RBBP5, WDR5, NCOA6, DPY30, and PAXIP, and is involved in gene transcriptional activation processes like H3K4 methylation and H3K27me2/me3 demethylation (Tran2020Lysine; Schulz2019The). KDM6A also interacts with histone acetyltransferases, such as p300 or CBP, and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, facilitating transcriptional elongation (Chi2021Molecular; Schulz2019The).

KDM6A interacts with DNA-binding transcription factors, including nuclear receptors like estrogen receptors, retinoic acid receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, often mediated by NCOA6 (Hua2021KDM6; Schulz2019The). It also plays a role in the regulation of pluripotency stem cell factors and the p53 tumor suppressor protein, influencing cell cycle and differentiation (Schulz2019The). Additionally, KDM6A acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the binding of other factors for transcription regulation (Hua2021KDM6). These interactions highlight KDM6A's multifaceted role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation.
