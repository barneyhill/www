# PLEKHA4

## Overview
PLEKHA4 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology domain containing A4, which is a plasma membrane-localized signaling protein involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. This protein plays a critical role in cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation by modulating the levels of Dishevelled (DVL) proteins through the inhibition of their polyubiquitination. PLEKHA4 achieves this by recruiting the CUL3-KLHL12 E3 ligase complex to the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing Wnt signaling. The gene is expressed in various cell types, including myoepithelial and smooth muscle cells, and is particularly significant in muscle cell development and differentiation. Clinically, PLEKHA4 is implicated in cancer biology, notably breast cancer, where it is downregulated, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role. Its expression patterns in normal versus cancerous tissues highlight its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Dastsooz2024Involvement).

## Function
PLEKHA4 encodes a plasma membrane-localized signaling protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway, which is vital for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. In healthy human cells, PLEKHA4 functions as a positive regulator of disheveled (DVL) protein levels by inhibiting its polyubiquitination, thereby enhancing Wnt signaling pathways. This regulation is achieved by recruiting the CUL3-KLHL12 E3 ligase complex to the plasma membrane, which reduces DVL protein ubiquitination (Dastsooz2024Involvement).

The gene is expressed in various cell types, including myoepithelial and smooth muscle cells, and is involved in muscle cell development. PLEKHA4 is upregulated in muscle cells differentiated from human embryonic stem cells, indicating its role in muscle differentiation stages (Dastsooz2024Involvement). The protein's activity in the Wnt signaling pathway is significant for the induction of mesoderm and muscle lineage, highlighting its importance in muscle development (Dastsooz2024Involvement). In normal breast tissue, PLEKHA4 shows high immunostaining in myoepithelial cells, suggesting its role in maintaining normal cellular functions (Dastsooz2024Involvement).

## Clinical Significance
PLEKHA4 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer, where it is significantly downregulated. This downregulation is observed across all stages and subclasses of breast cancer, including HER2-positive and triple-negative types, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Dastsooz2024Involvement). The gene is proposed as a tumor suppressor, with its decreased expression linked to a higher risk of breast cancer, especially in patients experiencing menopause before the age of 50 (Dastsooz2024Involvement). PLEKHA4's involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, crucial for muscle differentiation, further suggests its role in muscle-related disorders (Dastsooz2024Involvement).

The gene's expression is notably higher in normal myoepithelial cells compared to luminal epithelial cells, indicating its potential tumor-suppressive function (Dastsooz2024Involvement). Its expression patterns in normal versus cancerous tissues highlight its potential as a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer (Dastsooz2024Involvement). While PLEKHA4 is mentioned in a study on left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), its specific association with this condition is not detailed (Zhou2018Whole). Overall, alterations in PLEKHA4 expression are linked to significant clinical implications in cancer and possibly muscle disorders.

## Interactions
PLEKHA4 is involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of Dishevelled (DVL) protein levels. It functions as a positive regulator by inhibiting the polyubiquitination of DVL. This regulation is achieved through the recruitment of the CUL3-KLHL12 E3 ligase complex to the plasma membrane, which reduces DVL protein ubiquitination and enhances Wnt signaling pathways (Dastsooz2024Involvement). This interaction suggests that PLEKHA4 plays a role in modulating signal transduction processes that are crucial for cellular functions such as proliferation and differentiation.

While specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context, PLEKHA4's involvement in these signaling pathways indicates its potential participation in complex regulatory networks. The downregulation of PLEKHA4 in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues suggests its role in tumor suppression and metastasis, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Dastsooz2024Involvement). The gene's expression patterns in various cell types, including mesenchymal and smooth muscle cells, further support its involvement in muscle cell differentiation and development (Dastsooz2024Involvement).
