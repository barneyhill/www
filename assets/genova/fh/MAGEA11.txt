# MAGEA11

## Overview
MAGEA11 is a gene that encodes the MAGE family member A11 protein, which is part of the melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) family. This protein functions primarily as a steroid hormone receptor coregulator, playing a crucial role in modulating transcriptional activity in human cells. MAGEA11 is particularly significant in reproductive biology, where it acts as a coactivator for the androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor-B, enhancing their transcriptional activity (Minges2015Posttranslational; Bai2005Melanoma). The protein is characterized by a MAGE Homology Domain (MHD) that facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as AR, and is subject to post-translational modifications like ubiquitinylation and phosphorylation, which regulate its stability and function (Li2021Pathogenicity; Laiseca2017Functional). MAGEA11's expression is hormonally regulated and is implicated in various cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and hormone receptor activity, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Su2013Protooncogene; Xiao2022MAGEA11).

## Structure
MAGEA11, a member of the MAGE protein family, exhibits a complex molecular structure that includes specific domains facilitating its interactions with other proteins. The protein contains a MAGE Homology Domain (MHD), which is crucial for its function and interaction with other proteins, such as the androgen receptor (AR) (Laiseca2017Functional). The MHD is composed of tandem winged-helix motifs, known as WH-A and WH-B, connected by a linker loop. These motifs form a substrate binding cleft (SBC) that is essential for substrate recognition and binding (Yang2020Structural).

The MAGEA11 protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including ubiquitinylation at lysines 240 and 245, which regulate its stability and degradation. Mutations at these sites can reduce ubiquitinylation, thereby increasing protein stability (Laiseca2017Functional). MAGEA11 also undergoes phosphorylation, which influences its interaction with the androgen receptor and its role in hormone signaling regulation (Li2021Pathogenicity).

Splice variants of MAGEA11 can result in different isoforms, potentially altering its activity and interactions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and modifications play a significant role in its function as a co-regulator in cancer and reproductive biology.

## Function
MAGEA11 (Melanoma Antigen Family A11) is a primate-specific steroid hormone receptor coregulator that plays a significant role in modulating transcriptional activity in healthy human cells. It primarily functions as a coactivator for the androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor-B, enhancing their transcriptional activity by interacting with the AR NH2-terminal FXXLF motif and facilitating the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators (Minges2015Posttranslational; Bai2005Melanoma). MAGEA11 is expressed at low levels in normal tissues of the human reproductive tract, including the testis, ovary, and endometrium, and its expression is hormonally regulated during the menstrual cycle (Su2013Protooncogene).

In the cellular context, MAGEA11 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and protein degradation pathways. It interacts with proteins such as Skp2 and cyclin A, influencing the degradation of cyclin A and stabilization of E2F1, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation (Su2017Melanoma). MAGEA11's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation, which are crucial for its interaction with AR and its role in transcriptional regulation (Bai2008Epidermal). These molecular processes contribute to its function in normal reproductive physiology and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
MAGEA11 is implicated in several cancers due to its role in enhancing tumor progression and hormone receptor activity. In prostate cancer, MAGEA11 is overexpressed and acts as a proto-oncogene by interacting with retinoblastoma-related protein p107 and E2F1, leading to increased transcriptional activity and cancer cell growth (Su2013Protooncogene). It enhances androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, promoting the progression of AR-dependent tumors (Li2021Pathogenicity). 

In bladder cancer, MAGEA11 co-expressed with MAGE-A6 is associated with tumor aggressiveness and is linked to clinicopathological parameters such as tumor size and histological grade (Mohsenzadegan2022Coexpression). 

In gastric cancer, MAGEA11 expression is significantly upregulated and correlates with poor prognosis. High MAGEA11 levels are associated with increased immune invasion and drug sensitivity, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and target for immunotherapy (Xiao2022MAGEA11). 

MAGEA11 is also involved in DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation, mechanisms underlying gene silencing in breast cancer (Mohsenzadegan2022Coexpression). These findings highlight MAGEA11's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
MAGEA11, also known as MAGE-A11, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function as a coregulator. It interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) by binding to the AR NH2-terminal FXXLF motif, which is crucial for modulating AR function. This interaction enhances AR transcriptional activity and stability, particularly in the absence of androgen, by competing with the androgen-induced N/C interaction and facilitating coactivator recruitment to the AF2 site (Bai2005Melanoma).

MAGEA11 also interacts with Skp2, an F-box protein involved in protein degradation, and cyclin A. It contains a cyclin A binding motif similar to Skp2's, allowing it to stabilize cyclin A at low Skp2 levels and increase Skp2-mediated degradation of cyclin A when Skp2 levels are high. MAGEA11 forms a complex with E2F1 and Skp2, protecting E2F1 from Skp2-mediated degradation, thereby regulating the substrate-specificity of Skp2-mediated protein degradation (Su2017Melanoma).

Additionally, MAGEA11 interacts with the p300 transcriptional coactivator, enhancing its transcriptional activity through specific motifs and phosphorylation sites. This interaction is important for AR signaling and involves the carboxyl-terminal region of MAGEA11 (Askew2010Transcriptional).
