# ATRX

## Overview
The ATRX gene encodes the ATRX chromatin remodeler protein, a member of the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating chromatin structure. The ATRX protein is characterized by its ATPase/helicase domain, essential for chromatin remodeling and DNA translocation, and the ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain, which is involved in recognizing specific histone modifications (Mitson2011Functional; Pang2023The). Functionally, ATRX is involved in DNA replication, repair, and transcriptional regulation, and it interacts with the DAXX protein to deposit the histone variant H3.3 at telomeric and pericentromeric regions, crucial for telomere integrity and chromosomal stability (Pang2023The; Leung2013Alpha). Mutations in the ATRX gene are linked to various developmental disorders and cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Haase2018Mutant; Gibbons2008Mutations).

## Structure
The ATRX protein is a member of the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers, characterized by its ATPase/helicase domain located at the C-terminus, which is crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and DNA translocation (Mitson2011Functional; Pang2023The). The protein is composed of 2492 amino acids and includes several conserved domains, such as the ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain at the N-terminus, which contains a GATA-like zinc finger, a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, and an alpha-helical region (Bérubé2011ATRX; Pang2023The).

The ADD domain is involved in recognizing specific histone modifications, such as H3K9me3, and plays a role in binding histone variants (Pang2023The). The protein also contains a low complexity region rich in serine, lysine, and glutamate residues, which may be involved in protein-protein interactions (Park2004Comparative). ATRX interacts with other proteins, such as DAXX, forming a complex that deposits the histone variant H3.3 at telomeres and other repetitive DNA regions (Wang2017Structural; Pang2023The).

Alternative splicing of the ATRX gene results in a shorter isoform, ATRXt, which lacks the C-terminal ATPase/helicase motif and other interaction regions but retains the ADD domain (Bérubé2011ATRX). This isoform is localized at pericentromeric heterochromatin and may modulate the activity of the full-length ATRX protein (Bérubé2011ATRX).

## Function
The ATRX gene encodes a protein that is a member of the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and proper chromatin structure in healthy human cells. ATRX is primarily localized in the nucleus and is involved in several key molecular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and transcriptional regulation (Pang2023The; Leung2013Alpha).

ATRX interacts with the DAXX protein to deposit the histone variant H3.3 at telomeric and pericentromeric regions, which is essential for maintaining telomere integrity and chromosomal stability (Dyer2017ATRX; Pang2023The). It also plays a role in resolving G-quadruplex DNA structures, which can impede replication fork progression, thereby preventing replication stress and DNA breakage (Pang2023The).

In the context of mitosis, ATRX is involved in chromosome cohesion and congression, ensuring proper alignment and segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Its loss leads to defects in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome congression, resulting in mitotic abnormalities (Ritchie2008Loss). ATRX's function in these processes is critical for normal development and cellular differentiation, with deficiencies linked to developmental disorders and genomic instability (De2011Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATRX gene are associated with a range of diseases and conditions, primarily due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. ATRX syndrome, also known as alpha thalassemia mental retardation X-linked syndrome, is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, genital abnormalities, and alpha thalassemia. This syndrome is predominantly found in males due to its X-linked recessive inheritance pattern (Dyer2017ATRX; Gibbons2008Mutations).

In cancer, ATRX mutations and altered expression levels are linked to various malignancies, including gliomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and osteosarcoma. These mutations often result in genomic instability and are associated with the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism, which is prevalent in certain cancers like gliomas and osteosarcoma (Haase2018Mutant; Watson2015Emerging). ATRX mutations frequently co-occur with mutations in other genes such as TP53 and IDH1, suggesting a collaborative effect in tumorigenesis (Watson2015Emerging).

Despite ATRX's involvement in DNA repair, patients with ATRX syndrome do not show an increased incidence of cancer, indicating that ATRX may not be a conventional cancer driver gene (Haase2018Mutant; Dyer2017ATRX). However, ATRX mutations in cancer cells can lead to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, presenting potential therapeutic opportunities (Haase2018Mutant).

## Interactions
The ATRX chromatin remodeler protein interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and genome stability. ATRX forms a complex with DAXX, which is essential for depositing the histone variant H3.3 at telomeres and pericentromeric regions. This interaction is mediated through specific domains within ATRX and DAXX, with the C-terminal region of ATRX showing a stronger interaction with DAXX (Tang2004A; Truch2022The). ATRX also interacts with the MRN complex, which is vital for DNA repair and replication (Pang2023The).

ATRX's interaction with nucleic acids includes binding to GC-rich regions prone to forming G-quadruplex (G4) structures, which helps resolve these structures and prevent replication stress (Pang2023The). The RNA-binding region (RBR) of ATRX is crucial for its interaction with Xist RNA, influencing ATRX's localization to heterochromatic regions (Ren2020Disruption).

ATRX also interacts with chromobox homolog 5 (CBX5) at telomeres, contributing to telomere structural integrity (Wong2010ATRX). Additionally, ATRX is recruited to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies through its interaction with DAXX, which influences its cellular localization (Tang2004A).
