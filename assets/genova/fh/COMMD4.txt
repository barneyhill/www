# COMMD4

## Overview
The COMMD4 gene encodes the protein COMM domain containing 4, which is a member of the COMMD protein family characterized by a conserved COMM domain. This domain is essential for protein-protein interactions and plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair processes. The COMMD4 protein is involved in maintaining genomic stability by regulating chromatin structure at sites of DNA double-strand breaks, interacting with histones and the RNF20/40 complex to facilitate DNA repair. Additionally, COMMD4 is a component of the Commander complex, which is implicated in endosomal protein trafficking. Alterations in COMMD4 expression have been associated with various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and gliomas, where it influences disease progression and treatment response (Liu2022COMMD4; Suraweera2021COMMD4; Burstein2005COMMD).

## Structure
The COMMD4 protein is characterized by a conserved COMM domain located at its carboxy-terminal end, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and is leucine-rich, typically forming a β-sheet structure (Jin2012Cloning; Burstein2005COMMD). This domain is approximately 70-85 amino acids long and is a defining feature of the COMMD protein family (Burstein2005COMMD). The N-terminal region of COMMD4 is also conserved and plays a role in its interaction with other proteins, such as histone H2B (Tang2023Targeting).

The primary structure of COMMD4 includes a sequence that allows for interactions with histone proteins, particularly through its N-terminal domain, which binds to a helical region of H2B (Tang2023Targeting). The protein's interaction with H2B involves a large interface with multiple salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, indicating a complex and stable binding (Tang2023Targeting).

COMMD4 is involved in DNA repair processes, where it interacts with the histone H2A-H2B dimer and the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex RNF20/40, suggesting its role in chromatin remodeling (Suraweera2021COMMD4). The protein's function in these processes may be regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect its interactions and localization at DNA damage sites (Suraweera2021COMMD4). However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of COMMD4 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
The COMMD4 protein plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating chromatin structure at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It is involved in the repair of DSBs through both non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways. COMMD4 interacts with histones H2A and H2B, as well as the chromatin modifier RNF20/40, suggesting its role in chromatin remodeling at DSB sites. The interaction between COMMD4 and H2B is disrupted by the phosphorylation of H2B at Ser14, which allows RNF20/40 to ubiquitinate H2B, facilitating chromatin remodeling necessary for DNA repair. COMMD4's binding to H2A and its regulation of RNF20/40 activity are essential for controlling the extent of epigenetic modifications around the break-site, ensuring proper repair processes (Suraweera2021COMMD4).

In the absence of COMMD4, cells exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and defects in DSB repair, leading to excessive elongation of remodeled chromatin and impaired NHEJ and HR pathways. This underscores the importance of COMMD4 in the timely repair of DSBs and maintaining genomic integrity (Suraweera2021COMMD4). COMMD4 is also involved in regulating NF-κB-mediated transcription, where it can suppress NF-κB activation, indicating its broader role in cellular stress responses (Burstein2005COMMD).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COMMD4 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and gliomas. In NSCLC, COMMD4 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, especially in adenocarcinoma (ADC) subtypes. High levels of COMMD4 expression correlate with reduced cell proliferation and viability, leading to mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis when depleted, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Suraweera2020Defining). The interaction between COMMD4 and histone H2B is crucial for DNA double-strand break repair, and disrupting this interaction can increase the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to treatments like ionizing radiation (Tang2023Targeting).

In gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lower-grade gliomas (LGG), elevated COMMD4 expression is linked to worse overall survival. High COMMD4 levels are associated with greater malignancy and are more prevalent in IDH-wildtype and 1p19q-non-codeletion groups. This suggests that COMMD4 may contribute to glioma progression and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Liu2022COMMD4). These findings highlight the clinical significance of COMMD4 in cancer, where its altered expression and interactions play a critical role in disease progression and treatment response.

## Interactions
COMMD4 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It interacts with the H2B protein, specifically binding to a helical region comprising amino acids 61 to 84. This interaction is characterized by a large interface involving salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and non-bonded interactions. Mutations in COMMD4, such as A70K, can reduce its binding capability to H2B (Tang2023Targeting). COMMD4 regulates chromatin remodeling at sites of DNA double-strand breaks by hindering the access of the E3 ligase complex, RNF20/40, to H2B, thus preventing ubiquitination and nucleosome remodeling. This interaction is disrupted when H2B is phosphorylated, causing COMMD4 to dissociate and allowing RNF20/40 access (Tang2023Targeting).

COMMD4 is also a subunit of the Commander complex, a multiprotein assembly involved in endosomal protein trafficking and embryogenesis. Within this complex, COMMD4 interacts with other COMMD proteins, such as COMMD1, which serves as a central interacting hub. The Commander complex is composed of 14 subunits, including COMMD1-10, CCDC22, CCDC93, C16orf62, and DSCR3 (Mallam2017Systemswide).
