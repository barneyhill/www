# PLA2G15

## Overview
PLA2G15 is a gene that encodes the enzyme lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2), a member of the phospholipase A2 family, which is primarily involved in the degradation of phospholipids within lysosomes. This enzyme is categorized as a serine hydrolase and is characterized by its ability to hydrolyze both sn-1 and sn-2 fatty acids in phospholipids, functioning optimally under mildly acidic conditions typical of the lysosomal environment (Murakami2020Updating). LPLA2 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and is essential for immune system regulation, particularly in the presentation of lysophospholipid antigens to invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells (Murakami2020Updating). The gene's expression and function are implicated in various diseases, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lysosomal phospholipidosis, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions (Bond2018Novel; Shayman2019Lysosomal).

## Structure
The PLA2G15 protein, also known as lysosomal phospholipase A2, is characterized by a highly conserved primary structure across species, consisting of 412 amino acids in humans and mice, and 407 in bovines (Shayman2019Lysosomal). The protein contains six exons and features a signal peptide cleavage site and a lipase motif, AXSXG, typical of serine hydrolases. The catalytic triad is composed of serine, aspartic acid, and histidine residues (Bouley2019Structural; Shayman2019Lysosomal).

The secondary structure includes a six-stranded α/β hydrolase domain, which is common among enzymes in the α/β-hydrolase superfamily (Glukhova2015Structure). The tertiary structure of PLA2G15 includes a 'cap' domain involved in ligand binding, with a flexible lid element that contributes to substrate selectivity (Glukhova2015Structure). The enzyme's activity is dependent on disulfide bonds, particularly between cysteines C65 and C89, which are crucial for proper folding (Shayman2019Lysosomal).

PLA2G15 is N-glycosylated with high mannose-type oligosaccharides, and glycosylation is important for its synthesis and folding (Bouley2019Structural; Shayman2019Lysosomal). The enzyme can be deglycosylated without losing activity, but certain mutations at glycosylation sites can lead to loss of function (Shayman2019Lysosomal). The presence of mannose 6-phosphate groups suggests a role in sorting and uptake by macrophages (Shayman2019Lysosomal). The enzyme's structure has been studied in various crystal forms, including fully glycosylated and deglycosylated states (Bouley2019Structural).

## Function
PLA2G15 encodes lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2), an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the degradation of phospholipids within lysosomes, which is essential for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis. LPLA2 is catalytically active under mildly acidic conditions and is structurally homologous with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). It hydrolyzes both sn-1 and sn-2 fatty acids in phospholipids, contributing to their breakdown in lysosomes (Murakami2020Updating).

In healthy human cells, LPLA2 is involved in the turnover and degradation of phospholipids, which is vital for cellular function and immune system regulation. The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper presentation of lysophospholipid antigens to CD1d by invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, playing a significant role in immune function. It is also implicated in adaptive T cell immunity against mycobacterium, highlighting its importance in immune responses (Murakami2020Updating).

Genetic deletion of LPLA2 can lead to the accumulation of non-degraded lung surfactant phospholipids in lysosomes of alveolar macrophages, resulting in phospholipidosis, which underscores its role in maintaining lipid balance within cells (Murakami2020Updating).

## Clinical Significance
The PLA2G15 gene, encoding lysosomal phospholipase A2, is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), the NFATC3-PLA2G15 fusion is associated with aggressive disease biology and poor patient outcomes. This fusion was identified in a subset of T-ALL samples and is linked to reduced overall and event-free survival, suggesting its role in leukemogenesis (Bond2018Novel). The fusion has also been reported in acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer, where its inhibition decreased cell proliferation and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Bond2018Novel).

PLA2G15 is also involved in lysosomal phospholipidosis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of phospholipids in cells, which can affect cellular function. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of PLA2G15 leads to phospholipid accumulation in alveolar macrophages, resulting in foam cell formation and lysosomal phospholipid accumulation, which are indicative of lysosomal phospholipidosis (Shayman2019Lysosomal). These findings suggest that alterations in PLA2G15 activity, whether through genetic mutations or expression changes, could be associated with conditions involving phospholipid metabolism, such as lysosomal phospholipidosis or drug-induced toxicity (Shayman2019Lysosomal).
