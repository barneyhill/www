# PSMA8

## Overview
PSMA8 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 8, a component of the spermatoproteasome, which is a specialized form of the proteasome complex. This protein is categorized as a proteasome subunit and plays a critical role in the degradation of proteins during spermatogenesis, particularly in the testis. The PSMA8-encoded protein is essential for the proper progression of meiosis, as it facilitates the degradation of proteins involved in DNA repair and homologous recombination, such as RAD51 and RPA1 (Xiong2022Ubiquitin-Proteasome; GómezH2019The). The absence of PSMA8 leads to meiotic arrest and male infertility, underscoring its importance in reproductive biology (GómezH2018Spermatoproteasomedeficient). Additionally, PSMA8 interacts with various proteins, including the proteasome activator PA200, to regulate chromatin remodeling and protein homeostasis during sperm development (GómezH2018Spermatoproteasomedeficient).

## Function
The PSMA8 gene encodes the α4s subunit of the spermatoproteasome, a specialized form of the 20S proteasome complex that is crucial for spermatogenesis in mammals. This proteasome variant is specifically active in the testis, particularly in spermatocytes and spermatids, where it plays a vital role in protein degradation during meiosis (GómezH2019The; Morozov2019Proteasomes). PSMA8 is involved in the degradation of proteins such as RAD51 and RPA1, which are essential for DNA repair and homologous recombination, facilitating the progression of meiosis I (Xiong2022Ubiquitin-Proteasome).

The PSMA8-containing proteasome is also associated with the synaptonemal complex, a structure that aids in the synapsis of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. Its absence leads to the accumulation of key meiotic proteins, resulting in meiotic arrest and male infertility (GómezH2018Spermatoproteasomedeficient; GómezH2019The). PSMA8 interacts with the proteasome activator PA200, which is involved in the acetylation-dependent degradation of histones, crucial for chromatin remodeling and the transition from histones to protamines in sperm development (GómezH2018Spermatoproteasomedeficient). This highlights its essential role in maintaining protein homeostasis and ensuring successful spermatogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PSMA8 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in male fertility. PSMA8 is crucial for the formation of spermatoproteasomes, which are essential for the degradation of core histones during meiosis. Deletion or deficiency of PSMA8 in mice leads to male infertility due to meiotic arrest at the spermatocyte stage, resulting in reduced testis size and the absence of mature spermatozoa (Zhang2021Proteasome; GómezH2019The). This arrest is associated with the accumulation of proteins like RAD51 and RPA1, which are not properly degraded in the absence of PSMA8, highlighting its role in protein degradation during spermatogenesis (Xiong2022Ubiquitin-Proteasome).

In humans, PSMA8 expression is primarily restricted to the testis, and its dysregulation has been linked to infertility. For instance, PSMA8 is differentially expressed in infertile men with varicocele, suggesting a potential causal role in infertility (GómezH2019The). Additionally, PSMA8 has been implicated in cancer, as a novel long noncoding RNA associated with PSMA8, termed lnc-PSMA8-1, is overexpressed in rhabdomyosarcoma, promoting tumor progression through the mTOR pathway (Meng2024LncPSMA81). These findings indicate that PSMA8 could be a target for therapeutic interventions in both infertility and certain cancers.

## Interactions
PSMA8, a subunit of the spermatoproteasome, is involved in several specific protein interactions crucial for its function in spermatogenesis. It interacts with SYCP3, a component of the synaptonemal complex, which is essential for meiotic chromosome synapsis. This interaction is specific to PSMA8, as it does not occur with the similar subunit PSMA7. In the absence of PSMA8, SYCP3 accumulates abnormally, indicating that PSMA8 is involved in its degradation (GómezH2019The).

PSMA8 also interacts with the proteasome activator subunit PA200, which is involved in the degradation of acetylated histones. This interaction is necessary for the proper localization of PA200 to the axial elements of spermatocytes, facilitating histone turnover during spermatogenesis (GómezH2019The). Additionally, PSMA8 is associated with the regulation of proteins involved in spindle checkpoint activation, such as TRIP13 and MAD2, with increased levels observed in PSMA8-deficient cells (GómezH2019The).

The study of PSMA8 interactions has identified over 596 proteins, including canonical subunits of the core particle and regulatory particles, through affinity chromatography. This suggests that PSMA8-containing proteasomes have unique functions beyond those of other proteasome activators (GómezH2019The).
