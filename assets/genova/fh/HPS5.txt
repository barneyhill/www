# HPS5

## Overview
The HPS5 gene encodes the HPS5 biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex 2 subunit 2 protein, which is a critical component of the Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelle Complex-2 (BLOC-2). This protein is involved in the trafficking and maturation of lysosome-related organelles (LROs), such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules, which are essential for pigmentation and platelet function (Di2004Characterization; Huizing2008Disorders). The HPS5 protein contains a WD40 domain, facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for the stability and function of the BLOC-2 complex (Daly2013snow). Mutations in the HPS5 gene can lead to Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 5 (HPS-5), a genetic disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and bleeding diathesis, due to defects in lysosomal organelles (Stephen2017Cellular; Mériot2020Donskoy). The study of HPS5 and its interactions within the BLOC-2 complex provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these clinical manifestations (Boeckelmann2022HermanskyPudlak).

## Structure
The HPS5 protein is a component of the BLOC-2 complex, which plays a crucial role in lysosomal trafficking. The protein contains a WD40 domain, which typically forms a seven- or eight-bladed propeller structure. Each blade of this propeller is composed of beta-sheets, with the top surface being the functional area for protein-protein interactions (Daly2013snow). The I76N mutation in the HPS5 gene, located in the WD40 domain, affects the stability of interactions within the BLOC-2 complex, particularly between HPS5 and HPS6, although it does not completely prevent binding (Daly2013snow).

The tertiary structure of HPS5 has been modeled, revealing a predicted propeller core, with isoleucine 76 positioned at the top, suggesting its role in interactions with other proteins such as HPS3 and HPS6 (Daly2013snow). The mutation from isoleucine to asparagine at this position may alter the conformation or interaction stability of the HPS5/HPS6 complex, leading to a more transient association and increased susceptibility to degradation (Daly2013snow). The study of zebrafish models has provided insights into the structural and functional implications of mutations in the HPS5 gene, contributing to the understanding of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 5 (Daly2013snow).

## Function
The HPS5 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelle Complex-2 (BLOC-2), which also includes HPS3 and HPS6. This complex is involved in the trafficking and maturation of lysosome-related organelles (LROs), such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules, which are essential for pigmentation and platelet function (Di2004Characterization; Huizing2008Disorders). In healthy human cells, the HPS5 protein plays a significant role in the proper sorting and delivery of proteins to melanosomes, facilitating the incorporation of essential proteins like PMEL17 and tyrosinase, which are necessary for melanin synthesis (Kato2019New). The BLOC-2 complex is also involved in the transport of cargo proteins to endosomes and other target organelles, which is vital for normal cellular function (Kato2019New).

HPS5 is expressed in all tissues, with particularly high expression in the lung and testis, and is involved in protein trafficking and organelle function, particularly in the regulation of membrane and protein trafficking to specialized organelles known as lysosome-related organelles (Wei2006Hermansky–Pudlak). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm is essential for maintaining proper pigmentation and immune function (Di2004Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HPS5 gene are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 5 (HPS-5), a genetic disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and defects in lysosomal organelles. HPS-5 is considered a milder form of Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome, with symptoms including hypopigmentation, reduced visual acuity, and mild prolonged bleeding time. Unlike other forms of HPS, HPS-5 typically does not involve severe complications such as pulmonary fibrosis (Stephen2017Cellular; Mériot2020Donskoy).

The clinical manifestations of HPS-5 are linked to mutations that affect the expression and function of the HPS5 gene. For instance, a splice-site variant in the HPS5 gene has been identified in Donskoy cats, serving as a model for oculocutaneous albinism, which results in a phenotype similar to HPS-5 in humans (Mériot2020Donskoy). In humans, mutations in the HPS5 gene can lead to reduced levels of HPS5 protein, as observed in patients with loss-of-function mutations, which results in symptoms such as nystagmus, impaired visual acuity, and a tendency for bleeding (Stephen2017Cellular). These mutations disrupt the normal interactions of the HPS5 protein within the BLOC-2 complex, affecting the biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles (Boeckelmann2022HermanskyPudlak).

## Interactions
HPS5 is a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 2 (BLOC-2), which includes HPS3 and HPS6. HPS5 interacts directly with HPS6, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. This interaction is mediated by the 187-189 amino acids (HCP) on HPS6. However, HPS3 does not directly interact with HPS5 or HPS6, suggesting the involvement of another protein that may bridge these interactions (Li2007The).

HPS5 has also been shown to interact with integrin α3 through Y2H experiments, although this interaction is considered controversial (Li2007The). BLOC-2, which includes HPS5, may interact with clathrin through HPS3, which contains a clathrin-binding domain. Preliminary data suggest an association of BLOC-2 with microtubules, but specific interactions involving HPS5 in this context are not detailed (Li2007The).

The role of HPS5 in these interactions is crucial for the function of BLOC-2 in endosomal transport and the formation of lysosome-related organelles, although specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been reported (Li2007The).
