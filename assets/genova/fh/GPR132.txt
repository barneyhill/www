# GPR132

## Overview
GPR132, also known as G2A, is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 132, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane alpha-helical structure, which is typical of GPCRs and essential for its role in cellular signaling. G protein-coupled receptor 132 is primarily expressed in immune cells, such as leukocytes, where it modulates immune responses and inflammation. It is activated by oxidized fatty acid derivatives and lysophosphatidylcholine, influencing processes like macrophage and T cell migration. The receptor is involved in various physiological functions, including hematopoiesis and the regulation of tumor-associated macrophages, making it a potential target for cancer therapy. Additionally, GPR132 plays a role in the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells, contributing to immune homeostasis (Kabarowski2009G2A; Sisignano2021ProtonSensing; Lin2003The).

## Structure
GPR132, also known as G2A, is a G protein-coupled receptor characterized by its seven-transmembrane alpha-helical structure, a common feature of GPCRs. This structural motif is integral to its function in cellular signaling processes. The receptor's secondary and tertiary structures are defined by these transmembrane helices, which facilitate its interaction with various ligands and G proteins.

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in the function of GPR132. Phosphorylation and glycosylation are common modifications that can influence the receptor's activity, stability, and cellular localization. These modifications are crucial for the receptor's ability to respond to extracellular signals and mediate intracellular responses.

GPR132 may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can result in variations in its structure and function. These isoforms allow the receptor to participate in diverse cellular processes by altering its interaction with different signaling molecules and pathways.

The receptor does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer within the cell membrane. The specific domains and prominent folds of GPR132 contribute to its role in various physiological and pathological processes, although detailed structural information beyond the transmembrane regions is limited.

## Function
GPR132, also known as G2A, is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various cellular processes, particularly in immune cells. It is primarily expressed in leukocytes, including T and B cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, where it plays a role in modulating immune responses and inflammation (Sisignano2021ProtonSensing). GPR132 is activated by oxidized fatty acid derivatives and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which influence macrophage and T cell migration, as well as neutrophil and macrophage activation (Kabarowski2009G2A). 

In terms of molecular activity, GPR132 can activate multiple G proteins, including Gαs, Gαi, Gαq, and Gα13, leading to various downstream effects such as increased intracellular cAMP levels and apoptosis (Lin2003The). The receptor is also involved in hematopoiesis, where it affects the number of hematopoietic stem cells and is required for normal marrow transplantation (Sisignano2021ProtonSensing). 

GPR132's role extends to the regulation of tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, potentially influencing tumor growth and making it a target for cancer treatment (Sisignano2021ProtonSensing). It is also implicated in the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells, suggesting a role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Kabarowski2009G2A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the GPR132 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, GPR132 is primarily expressed in tumor-associated macrophages rather than cancer cells themselves. Its expression is associated with more aggressive forms of breast cancer, such as ER-negative subtypes, and correlates with increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers like CCL2, MMP9, and PTGS2. Knockdown of GPR132 in macrophages has been shown to reduce cancer cell growth, while overexpression promotes it, suggesting that GPR132 plays a role in tumor growth and inflammation (Cheng2016Macrophage).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), GPR132 expression is linked to better prognosis, as higher levels are associated with increased differentiation of myeloid cells. Activation of GPR132 in AML cells promotes differentiation and reduces tumor growth, indicating a potential protective role in this context (Yi2022Activation).

GPR132 also plays a role in hematopoiesis, where it is involved in the specification of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Knockout studies in mice have shown that GPR132 is crucial for normal hematopoietic stem cell function, and its absence can lead to age-related autoimmune diseases (Lahvic2018Specific).

## Interactions
GPR132, also known as G2A, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its expression and function. In B-lymphocytes and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells, GPR132 expression is regulated by the transcription factors Foxp1 and Ikaros. Foxp1 directly binds to the GPR132 gene, enhancing its expression. This interaction is antagonized by the wild-type Ikaros protein, which inhibits Foxp1's effect on GPR132 expression. However, the IK6 isoform of Ikaros, which lacks the DNA binding domain, does not inhibit this interaction, leading to increased GPR132 expression in the absence of functional Ikaros (Bond2016Direct).

GPR132 also plays a role in the tumor microenvironment, particularly in breast cancer. It acts as a receptor for lactate, a byproduct of cancer cell metabolism, facilitating interactions between tumor cells and macrophages. Lactate binds to GPR132 on macrophages, promoting the M2 macrophage phenotype, which supports cancer cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. This interaction is crucial for the lactate-triggered calcium mobilization in macrophages, highlighting GPR132's role in mediating lactate signaling in the tumor microenvironment (Chen2017Gpr132).
