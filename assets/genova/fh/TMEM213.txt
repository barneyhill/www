# TMEM213

## Overview
TMEM213 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 213, which is characterized by its ability to span cellular membranes, primarily localizing in the endoplasmic reticulum and early endosomes. This protein is involved in essential cellular functions such as transmembrane transport and signal detection, and it plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and communication. TMEM213 is implicated in the regulation of genes associated with ion transport and cellular protein modification, suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes, including protein folding and trafficking. The gene's expression levels have been linked to clinical outcomes in certain cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma, where higher expression correlates with improved patient survival. Additionally, TMEM213 has been associated with renal ciliopathies and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, indicating its potential significance in kidney-related conditions (Leveson2020Exome; Zou2019TMEM213; Wesoly2024Structural).

## Structure
TMEM213, or transmembrane protein 213, is characterized by its transmembrane domains, which allow it to span cellular membranes. The protein has two open reading frame (ORF) variants, TMEM213_ORF1 and TMEM213_ORF2, resulting from alternative splicing. TMEM213_ORF1 is 107 amino acids long, while TMEM213_ORF2 lacks a lysine at position 27 due to the absence of the AAG codon in exon 2 (Wesoly2024Structural).

Both ORF variants of TMEM213 localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the N-terminus of TMEM213 is exposed to the cytoplasm, while the C-terminus faces the ER lumen (Wesoly2024Structural). The protein's orientation in the cellular membrane was confirmed using a fluorescence protease protection assay (Wesoly2024Structural).

The study also identified potential signal peptides (SP) in TMEM213, with predicted cleavage sites at position 27 for both ORF1 and ORF2. However, experimental validation suggested that these signal peptides might not be processed in certain cell types, indicating cell type-dependent processing (Wesoly2024Structural).

TMEM213 is involved in essential cellular functions such as transmembrane transport and signal detection, and its overexpression leads to the deregulation of genes involved in these pathways (Wesoly2024Structural).

## Function
TMEM213 is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully characterized. It is known to be an integral membrane protein that localizes primarily in early endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with its N-terminus directed toward the cytoplasm (Wesoly2024Structural). This localization suggests a potential role in processes related to the ER, such as protein folding or trafficking (Wesoly2024Structural).

TMEM213 is implicated in the regulation of genes involved in ion and transmembrane transport, indicating a functional relationship with other membrane proteins (Wesoly2024Structural). Overexpression studies have shown that TMEM213 can lead to the deregulation of genes associated with transmembrane transport, cellular protein modification, and glycosylation (Wesoly2024Structural). These activities suggest that TMEM213 may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and communication.

In terms of organismal outcomes, TMEM213 expression levels have been correlated with patient survival rates in certain cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma, where higher expression is associated with better overall survival (Zou2019TMEM213). However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these associations remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM213 has been implicated in various cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and lung adenocarcinoma. In ccRCC, TMEM213 is one of the most downregulated transmembrane proteins at the mRNA level, and its mutations, although infrequent, may contribute to the disease's etiology (Wesoly2024Structural). Specifically, a mutation classified as 'Loss_of_helix' in the transmembrane domain of TMEM213 has been identified in ccRCC tumors, suggesting a potential role in cancer development (Wesoly2024Structural).

In lung adenocarcinoma, TMEM213 serves as a prognostic biomarker, with higher expression levels associated with longer overall survival. This suggests that TMEM213 may inhibit cancer progression and could guide adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions (Zou2019TMEM213). TMEM213 expression is also linked to specific gene sets related to drug metabolism and transport, indicating its involvement in treatment efficacy (Zou2019TMEM213).

Additionally, TMEM213 has been associated with renal ciliopathies in the context of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), highlighting its potential role in kidney-related conditions (Leveson2020Exome).
