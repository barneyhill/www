# HTR3C

## Overview
The HTR3C gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3C (5-HT3C), a subunit of the serotonin type 3 receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in neurotransmission. This receptor is unique among serotonin receptors as it directly mediates fast synaptic transmission by allowing ion flow across cell membranes. The 5-HT3C subunit, when coexpressed with the 5-HT3A subunit, forms heteromeric receptor complexes that exhibit distinct functional properties compared to homomeric 5-HT3A receptors, contributing to the diversity and complexity of the 5-HT3 receptor system (Niesler2007Characterization). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and gastrointestinal tract, indicating its involvement in multiple physiological processes such as gut motility and secretion (Kapeller2010Serotonin; Niesler2003Cloning). Variations in the HTR3C gene have been associated with clinical conditions like autism spectrum disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, highlighting its potential significance in medical genetics (Celli2016The; Pud2014Association).

## Structure
The HTR3C gene encodes a subunit of the 5-HT3 receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel. The protein subunit includes a signal peptide sequence of 27 amino acids and features a cysteine loop at the extracellular N-terminal part, which is involved in ligand binding (Niesler2007Characterization; Niesler2003Cloning). The 5-HT3C subunit contains four transmembrane regions, with the second transmembrane region lining the ion pore, crucial for ion channel conductance (Niesler2003Cloning). The C-terminus of the protein is predicted to be extracellular (Niesler2003Cloning).

The 5-HT3C subunit cannot form functional receptors on its own and requires coexpression with the 5-HT3A subunit to form heteromeric receptor complexes (Niesler2007Characterization). These complexes exhibit different serotonin efficacies, suggesting a modulatory role in receptor function, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract (Niesler2007Characterization). The theoretical mass of the 5-HT3C subunit is approximately 48 kDa (Niesler2003Cloning). The protein shares 36% amino acid identity with the 5-HT3A subunit, indicating some structural similarities (Barnes2009The). The HTR3C gene is organized into nine exons, and its expression is observed in various adult and fetal tissues (Niesler2003Cloning).

## Function
The HTR3C gene encodes a subunit of the serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in neurotransmission. This receptor is unique among serotonin receptors as it directly mediates fast synaptic transmission by allowing ion flow across cell membranes. The 5-HT3C subunit, along with other subunits like 5-HT3A, forms heteromeric receptor complexes that exhibit distinct functional properties compared to homomeric 5-HT3A receptors (Niesler2007Characterization).

In healthy human cells, the 5-HT3C subunit is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, colon, intestine, lung, muscle, stomach, and fetal tissues, suggesting its involvement in multiple physiological processes (Niesler2003Cloning). In the gastrointestinal tract, the 5-HT3C subunit is expressed in myenteric and submucosal neurons, enterocytes, and immune cells, indicating a role in gut motility, secretion, and possibly immune responses (Kapeller2010Serotonin). The subunit's presence in colonic enterocytes suggests it may influence mucosal secretion and absorption (Kapeller2010Serotonin). The 5-HT3C subunit cannot form functional receptors alone but modulates receptor function when combined with 5-HT3A, contributing to the diversity and complexity of the 5-HT3 receptor system (Niesler2007Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the HTR3C gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. Two non-synonymous SNPs, rs6766410 (p.Asn163Lys) and rs6807362 (p.Ala405Gly), have been linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the specific causative mutations and their functional relevance to ASD remain unclear (Celli2016The; Rehnström2009Allelic). The rs6766410 variant is also associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in males, suggesting a potential role for HTR3C in OCD and related phenotypes (Celli2016The).

In the context of chemotherapy, HTR3C variants have been implicated in the severity of chemotherapy-induced symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting. The KK-GG genotype is associated with more severe symptoms, while the NN-AA genotype may offer some protection (Pud2014Association). These findings suggest that genetic testing for HTR3C variants could help predict the likelihood of severe side effects from chemotherapy (Pud2014Association).

HTR3C variants have also been linked to nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, with specific SNPs showing marginal associations with these symptoms (GOECKE2010Two). Additionally, the gene is associated with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (Celli2016The).
