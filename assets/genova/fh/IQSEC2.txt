# IQSEC2

## Overview
The IQSEC2 gene encodes the IQ motif and Sec7 domain ArfGEF 2 protein, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) primarily involved in synaptic signaling and plasticity. This protein is characterized by several functional domains, including an IQ-like domain, a Sec7 domain, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitate its role in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking (Levy2023Molecular). IQSEC2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, with significant roles in the development and function of excitatory synapses, particularly through its interactions with proteins such as PSD-95 and Arf6 (Petersen2018BRAG1IQSEC2; Levy2023Molecular). Mutations in the IQSEC2 gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and epilepsy, underscoring its critical function in cognitive development and synaptic regulation (Shoubridge2018IQSEC2mutation; Liu2022IQSEC2related).

## Structure
The IQSEC2 protein is a 1488 amino acid protein characterized by several functional domains that contribute to its role in cellular signaling. It contains an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain, which facilitates protein self-association, and an IQ-like domain that binds apo-calmodulin, influencing the activity of the Sec7 domain (Levy2023Molecular). The Sec7 domain is crucial for GDP-GTP exchange on Arf6, a small GTPase involved in membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Levy2023Molecular). The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is involved in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signaling and plasma membrane localization (Levy2023Molecular).

The protein also includes a proline-rich (PR) domain that interacts with the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate of 53 kD (IRsp53), potentially playing a role in dendrite formation, and a PDZ domain that binds to PSD95, anchoring proteins to the cytoskeleton and mediating signal transduction (Levy2023Molecular). There is a potential seventh domain (D7) defined by certain mutations, although its function is not fully understood (Levy2023Molecular). The IQSEC2 protein is involved in multiple protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions, extending beyond NMDA receptor complexes, indicating a broad functional scope (Levy2023Molecular). Specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The IQSEC2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Arf family of small G proteins, particularly Arf6. In healthy human cells, IQSEC2 is crucial at excitatory synapses, where it facilitates synaptic plasticity and cognitive development. Upon glutamate release from presynaptic neurons, NMDA receptors are activated, leading to calcium influx in postsynaptic neurons. This calcium binds to calmodulin on the IQ domain of IQSEC2, activating its Sec7 domain, which then catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Arf6, activating it. Activated Arf6-GTP mediates downstream effects such as the activation of phospholipase D, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases, and Rac1, which are involved in membrane trafficking and actin dynamics (Levy2023Molecular).

IQSEC2 is also involved in the growth and development of dendritic spines, axonal elongation, and branching in postsynaptic neurons, essential for cognitive development and learning. It plays a role in the removal of AMPA receptors in hippocampal neurons following excitatory stimulation, highlighting its role in synaptic plasticity (Levy2023Molecular). The protein is expressed throughout the brain, with the highest levels in the hippocampus, and is involved in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (Levy2023Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IQSEC2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These mutations can lead to varying phenotypes, with males typically experiencing more severe symptoms due to the gene's escape from X chromosome inactivation in females (Baladron2022Differences; Liu2022IQSEC2related). The clinical manifestations of IQSEC2 mutations include moderate to severe intellectual disability, early-onset seizures, autistic traits, and psychiatric issues (Shoubridge2018IQSEC2mutation; Shoubridge2010Mutations).

The severity of the clinical phenotype is influenced by the type and position of the mutation, as well as the sex of the patient. Truncating mutations often result in more severe phenotypes, particularly in males, while females may experience milder symptoms due to compensatory mechanisms from the normal X chromosome (Baladron2022Differences; Tran2013Expanding). IQSEC2 mutations can also lead to altered synaptic transmission and neuronal connectivity, contributing to the observed neurodevelopmental disorders (Levy2023Molecular).

In some cases, IQSEC2 mutations result in aberrant splicing, producing truncated proteins that lack functional domains, potentially leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Madrigal2016A). The clinical severity in affected individuals correlates with the ratio of aberrant to wild-type transcripts, with more severe cases showing a higher proportion of aberrant transcripts (Madrigal2016A).

## Interactions
The IQSEC2 protein, also known as BRAG1, is involved in several critical interactions at excitatory synapses. It interacts with the central scaffold protein PSD-95, adhesion molecules like IRsp53, and the NMDAR subunit GluN2B. These interactions are crucial for its role in synaptic plasticity and AMPAR trafficking (Bai2024Structural). IQSEC2 also interacts with calmodulin (CaM) through an IQ-like motif in a Ca2+-dependent manner, which modulates its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity (Petersen2018BRAG1IQSEC2). 

The protein's C-terminal sequence allows it to bind to type I PDZ domains, facilitating interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins such as PSD-95, PSD-93, and SAP-97. These interactions are essential for the organization of the postsynaptic density and synaptic transmission (Brown2016Bidirectional). IQSEC2's interaction with Arf6, a small GTPase, is vital for AMPAR internalization during long-term depression (LTD) (Petersen2018BRAG1IQSEC2). 

Mutations in IQSEC2 can affect its interactions and lead to intellectual disabilities, highlighting the importance of these protein interactions in maintaining normal synaptic function (Shoubridge2018IQSEC2mutation).
