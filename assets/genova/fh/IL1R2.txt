# IL1R2

## Overview
The IL1R2 gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor type 2, a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family that functions primarily as a decoy receptor. This receptor is characterized by its extracellular region, which contains three immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Unlike other receptors in its family, IL1R2 lacks the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain necessary for signal transduction, rendering it incapable of initiating intracellular signaling cascades. Instead, IL1R2 sequesters interleukin-1 ligands, such as IL-1α and IL-1β, thereby preventing their interaction with signaling receptors and modulating inflammatory responses (Boraschi2013The; Peters2013IL1). The protein exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the latter being generated through alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage. The soluble form plays a significant role in regulating inflammation by binding and neutralizing pro-inflammatory cytokines (Boraschi2017The; Supino2022Negative). IL1R2's ability to modulate immune responses and its involvement in various pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, underscore its clinical significance (Lin2011A; Zhang2019IL1R2).

## Structure
The IL1R2 protein is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family and functions primarily as a decoy receptor. Structurally, it is characterized by an extracellular region composed of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, which are extensively glycosylated. This glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that contributes to the protein's stability and function (Peters2013IL1; Supino2022Negative). The protein also includes a single helical transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail of 29 amino acids, which lacks the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain necessary for signal transduction (Boraschi2017The; Peters2013IL1).

IL1R2 exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. The soluble form (sIL-1R2) can be generated through alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage by metalloproteinases such as ADAM17, which is activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli (Boraschi2017The; Supino2022Negative). The soluble form retains the ability to bind interleukin-1 ligands, effectively sequestering them and preventing their interaction with signaling receptors (Boraschi2017The). The receptor's affinity for IL-1β is notably high, with a dissociation constant of 10^-10 M, while its affinity for IL-1α is significantly lower (Peters2013IL1).

## Function
IL1R2, or interleukin 1 receptor type 2, functions primarily as a decoy receptor in healthy human cells. It binds interleukin-1 (IL-1) ligands, including IL-1α and IL-1β, without initiating a signaling cascade due to the absence of the intracellular TIR domain necessary for signal transduction (Boraschi2013The; Peters2013IL1). By sequestering these ligands, IL1R2 prevents their interaction with the signaling receptor IL1R1, thereby inhibiting IL-1-mediated inflammatory responses (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2017The).

IL1R2 exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. The soluble form (sIL-1R2) is generated through alternative splicing or cleavage by metalloproteinases and is particularly effective at binding IL-1β, preventing its interaction with signaling receptors (Boraschi2017The; Peters2013IL1). This form can also bind pro-IL-1β, inhibiting its maturation into an active cytokine, thus regulating inflammation (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2017The).

IL1R2's role as a decoy receptor is crucial for modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis by preventing excessive inflammation. It acts as a buffer against overactivation of inflammatory pathways, contributing to tissue homeostasis and preventing damage in healthy cells (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in IL1R2 expression or function are implicated in various diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, IL1R2 is upregulated, particularly in breast tumor-initiating cells (BTICs), and is associated with increased metastasis and poorer survival rates. It promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion by stabilizing BMI1 protein through interaction with the deubiquitinase USP15, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Zhang2019IL1R2). In autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypomethylation of the IL1R2 promoter correlates with increased disease activity, indicating a potential epigenetic mechanism in SLE pathogenesis (Lin2011A).

In inflammatory conditions, IL1R2 acts as a decoy receptor, modulating immune responses. In rheumatoid arthritis, increased soluble IL1R2 levels are found in synovial fluid and plasma, correlating negatively with disease severity, suggesting a protective role against joint destruction (Peters2013IL1). In atherosclerosis, decreased IL1R2 expression in macrophages from hyperlipidemic patients is linked to unchecked IL-1-dependent inflammation during atheroma formation (Peters2013IL1). IL1R2 expression is also associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate cancers, where it may protect cancer cells from apoptosis (Supino2022Negative).

## Interactions
IL1R2, also known as interleukin 1 receptor type 2, is involved in several protein interactions that modulate immune responses and influence cancer progression. It acts primarily as a decoy receptor, binding interleukin-1 (IL-1) to prevent its interaction with signaling receptors. IL1R2 forms non-signaling complexes with IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP), sequestering both the ligand and the accessory protein required for signal transduction (Boraschi2017The; Peters2013IL1).

In the context of breast cancer, IL1R2 interacts with the deubiquitinase USP15, which stabilizes the BMI1 protein by preventing its degradation. This interaction is crucial for BMI1's stability, as IL1R2 overexpression inhibits BMI1 ubiquitination, thereby preventing its degradation. The intracellular domain of IL1R2 (icd-IL1R2) enhances USP15's activity on BMI1 deubiquitination, although there is no direct interaction between BMI1 and IL1R2 alone (Zhang2019IL1R2).

IL1R2 also interacts with pro-IL-1α intracellularly, inhibiting its maturation and preventing its cleavage by calpain, which can be disrupted by caspase-1 (Boraschi2017The). These interactions highlight IL1R2's role in modulating immune responses and its potential impact on cancer progression.
