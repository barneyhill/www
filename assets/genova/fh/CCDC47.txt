# CCDC47

## Overview
The CCDC47 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 47 protein, a crucial endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein involved in calcium homeostasis and ER function. This protein, also known as calumin, plays a significant role in calcium signaling and the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins. It is a component of the PAT complex and interacts with the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) complex, influencing protein translocation and degradation processes. CCDC47's involvement in calcium regulation is particularly important in cardiomyocytes, where it affects excitation-contraction coupling. The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including colorectal cancer and choroid plexus tumors, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Kondelin2018Comprehensive; Thapa2018Dysregulation; Wu2018Human).

## Function
The CCDC47 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function in cells. CCDC47 is an ER transmembrane protein involved in calcium signaling through its calcium-binding acidic luminal domain. It interacts with the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) complex, which is essential for guiding misfolded proteins to ubiquitination and degradation, thereby relieving ER stress (Wu2018Human). The protein is vital for maintaining calcium levels within cells, as CCDC47-deficient fibroblast cells exhibit insufficient calcium content in intracellular stores and reduced store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (Wu2018Human).

In cardiomyocytes, CCDC47 is involved in calcium regulation, which is crucial for excitation-contraction coupling. It is a high-capacity calcium-binding protein with moderate affinity for calcium, and its overexpression enhances ionomycin-induced increases in intracellular calcium, affecting both release and uptake (Thapa2018Dysregulation). CCDC47 shares structural homology with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a key regulator of SOCE, suggesting similar functional properties (Thapa2018Dysregulation). The protein's role in calcium handling is significant in maintaining cellular function and survival, particularly in the context of cardiac physiology (Thapa2018Dysregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC47 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of colorectal cancer, CCDC47 has been identified as a potential driver gene in microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer (MSI CRC). Although it has not been previously implicated in colorectal cancer, it was highlighted among the top genes with significant mutations, suggesting its potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Kondelin2018Comprehensive).

In choroid plexus tumors (CPTs), a rare CCDC47-PRKCA fusion has been identified in adult patients, associated with an aggressive clinical course. This fusion results from a chromosomal inversion and is linked to tumor aggressiveness, indicating a potential oncogenic role for CCDC47 in this context (Thomas2020The).

Additionally, CCDC47 has been mentioned in the context of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic cardiopathy, where specific differentially methylated regions in the gene were observed in patients with these conditions, suggesting a possible epigenetic involvement in cardiovascular diseases (Gensous2017The).

## Interactions
CCDC47, also known as calumin, is a protein that plays a significant role in the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins through its involvement in the PAT complex, which includes Asterix. CCDC47 is a stable subunit of this complex and is essential for the stability of Asterix. The interaction between CCDC47 and Asterix is obligate, as the knockdown or knockout of one results in the loss of the other, indicating a strong interdependence (Chitwood2020An).

CCDC47 interacts with the Sec61 complex, where it influences the translocation of nascent proteins by maintaining the Sec61 complex in a closed conformation. This interaction is facilitated by CCDC47's latch helices, which impede the rotation of Sec61α and obstruct nascent chain access to the Sec61 vestibule and lateral gate (Smalinskaitė2022Mechanism).

In cardiomyocytes, CCDC47 is involved in calcium regulation, co-localizing with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2), suggesting its role in calcium handling and homeostasis (Thapa2018Dysregulation). These interactions highlight CCDC47's multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in protein biogenesis and calcium regulation.
