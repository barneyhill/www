# HMGA2

## Overview
HMGA2 is a gene that encodes the high mobility group AT-hook 2 protein, a non-histone chromatin architectural protein involved in the regulation of gene expression. The HMGA2 protein is characterized by its three AT-hook DNA-binding motifs, which enable it to bind to AT-rich regions in the minor groove of DNA, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene accessibility. As a member of the high mobility group A (HMGA) family, HMGA2 plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and the maintenance of stem cell potency (Kumar2019HMGA2; Vignali2020HMGA). It is particularly active during embryogenesis and is implicated in developmental processes such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and craniofacial development (Vignali2020HMGA). Dysregulation of HMGA2 expression is associated with several pathological conditions, including various cancers and growth disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Lee2007The; IKEDA2012THE).

## Structure
The HMGA2 protein is a member of the high mobility group A (HMGA) family, characterized by its three DNA-binding domains known as AT-hooks. These AT-hooks are positively charged stretches of nine amino acids, featuring an invariant Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro (R-G-R-P) repeat, which allows them to bind to AT-rich sequences in the minor groove of B-form DNA (Pfannkuche2009The; Cleynen2008The). The AT-hooks are unstructured in solution but adopt a crescent-shaped configuration upon binding to DNA, facilitating their role in chromatin architecture (Pfannkuche2009The; Li2006High‐level).

The primary structure of HMGA2 shares approximately 55% similarity with HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins (Cleynen2008The). The protein's C-terminal tail is rich in negatively charged acidic residues, which may modulate protein-protein interactions, although its exact function is not fully understood (Noro2003Molecular; Cleynen2008The). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, occur on the C-terminal tail and influence HMGA2's DNA binding properties (Sgarra2009Macroscopic).

HMGA2 is intrinsically disordered, lacking a defined tertiary structure, which provides flexibility in binding to various DNA sequences and protein partners (Vignali2020HMGA). The protein can form complexes with other proteins, suggesting a role in quaternary structure through protein-protein interactions (Cleynen2008The).

## Function
The HMGA2 gene encodes a non-histone chromatin protein that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. It binds to DNA in the minor groove, particularly at AT-rich sequences, and modifies chromatin conformation, which affects the accessibility of regulatory factors to DNA (Cleynen2008The; Vignali2020HMGA). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and the maintenance of stem cell potency (Kumar2019HMGA2; Vignali2020HMGA).

HMGA2 is highly expressed during embryogenesis and plays a significant role in developmental processes such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial for development and tissue remodeling (Vignali2020HMGA). In hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, HMGA2 promotes self-renewal and influences differentiation, particularly favoring myeloerythroid lineages (Kumar2019HMGA2). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, allowing it to act as a 'molecular glue' in various nuclear functions (Vignali2020HMGA).

HMGA2 also plays a role in craniofacial development and is associated with organ and body size regulation, as evidenced by its involvement in chondrocyte proliferation and skeletal development (Vignali2020HMGA).

## Clinical Significance
The HMGA2 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. Overexpression of HMGA2 is associated with several types of tumors, including benign mesenchymal tumors, lung cancers, and uterine leiomyomas. In lung cancer, particularly non-small-cell carcinoma, HMGA2 is overexpressed in 90% of cases, correlating with high cell proliferation and poor survival (Lee2007The). In uterine leiomyomas, HMGA2 overexpression is linked to chromosomal rearrangements at 12q14-15, contributing to tumorigenesis (Klemke2008Overexpression).

HMGA2 is also involved in hematologic disorders, where its overexpression is linked to myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes. Chromosomal rearrangements that delete let-7 miRNA binding sites in the 3'UTR of HMGA2 can lead to its overexpression, conferring a growth advantage to abnormal progenitor cells (IKEDA2012THE).

In familial multiple lipomatosis, novel variants in the HMGA2 gene have been identified, suggesting a role in neoplastic transformation (Mejía2020&lt; p&gt; Clinical). Additionally, a splicing mutation in HMGA2 has been associated with Silver-Russell syndrome, characterized by growth retardation and distinctive facial features (De2015A).

## Interactions
HMGA2 is involved in various interactions with both nucleic acids and proteins. It contains three AT-hook DNA-binding motifs that specifically bind to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA sequences, inducing DNA bending and facilitating the assembly of transcriptional complexes (Su2020The). The region between amino acids 54 and 73, which includes part of the second AT-hook, is crucial for protein-protein interactions, and is referred to as the HMGA protein-protein interacting domain (Sgarra2005Discovering). This region is also important for enhancing the binding of NF-κB to DNA, particularly the PRDII element of the IFN-β promoter (Noro2003Molecular).

HMGA2 interacts with NF-κB subunits, showing a strong interaction with the p50 subunit and a weaker interaction with the p65 subunit. The region necessary for p50 binding is identified as residues 44-63 (Noro2003Molecular). The acidic C-terminal tail of HMGA2 modulates interactions with some partners, and its removal can increase binding affinity for several proteins (Sgarra2005Discovering). HMGA2 also forms homodimers, primarily due to electrostatic interactions between its positively charged AT-hooks and negatively charged C-terminus (Su2020The). These interactions are crucial for the formation of higher-order nucleoprotein complexes at promoters and enhancers (Noro2003Molecular).
