# CDH4

## Overview
CDH4, or cadherin 4, is a gene that encodes a classical cadherin protein involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The protein, cadherin 4, is characterized by its five extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a conserved cytoplasmic tail, which are essential for its adhesive functions and interactions with the cytoskeleton (Sotomayor2014Sorting; Murase2000Lateral). As a member of the cadherin superfamily, cadherin 4 plays a pivotal role in maintaining tissue integrity and cellular communication, particularly in the brain, muscle, and gastrointestinal tract (Xie2016CDH4). It is involved in critical processes such as neuronal migration and synaptogenesis, contributing to proper brain function and development (Isik2023Understanding). Alterations in CDH4 expression and function have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Erdman2022Alu; Wiszniewski2018Comprehensive).

## Structure
CDH4, or cadherin 4, is a classical cadherin protein involved in cell-cell adhesion. It is characterized by five extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a conserved cytoplasmic tail (Sotomayor2014Sorting). The EC repeats are crucial for calcium-dependent adhesion, with the N-terminal EC1 repeat playing a significant role in homotypic interactions through the exchange of secondary-structure elements and docking of tryptophan side chains (Sotomayor2014Sorting). 

The primary structure of CDH4 includes these EC repeats, which are approximately 110 amino acids long and form a structure similar to the immunoglobulin-like domain (Hulpiau2009Molecular). The secondary structure involves β-sheets connected by loops or α-helices, particularly in the EC1 domain (Murase2000Lateral). 

The cytoplasmic domain of CDH4 interacts with catenins, which are important for linking cadherins to the cytoskeleton and regulating their stability (Sotomayor2014Sorting). Post-translational modifications of CDH4 may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are common in cadherins, although specific modifications for CDH4 are not detailed in the provided context. The quaternary structure involves the formation of dimers, essential for its adhesive functions (Murase2000Lateral).

## Function
CDH4, or cadherin 4, is a calcium-dependent cell adhesion glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion, which is essential for tissue integrity and cellular communication. It is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it facilitates homophilic interactions between cells, contributing to tissue morphogenesis and stability (Isik2023Understanding). CDH4 is involved in various molecular processes, including neuronal migration, synaptogenesis, and the formation of glial-axonal networks, which are critical for proper brain function (Isik2023Understanding).

In healthy human cells, CDH4 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, muscle, and gastrointestinal tract, where it contributes to the development and maintenance of these tissues (Xie2016CDH4). The protein is part of the classical cadherins, which are involved in dynamic intracellular signaling events, such as the Wnt/β-catenin and RHO GTPase pathways, influencing cell signaling and structural organization (Isik2023Understanding). CDH4's role in cell adhesion and signaling is crucial for maintaining cell polarity and tissue homeostasis, preventing disruptions that could lead to pathological conditions (zhang2020circrna).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CDH4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, decreased expression of CDH4 is associated with an increased risk, as a significant percentage of cancer cells exhibit a methylated CDH4 promoter, unlike healthy cells (Erdman2022Alu). In breast cancer, CDH4 expression levels are altered, with low levels being strongly associated with poor recurrence-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Xu2021Systemic). 

CDH4 is also linked to disorders of cerebral cortical development. Mutations in CDH4 have been associated with brain malformations, including microcephaly and corpus callosum dysgenesis, as observed in patients with specific rare variants (Wiszniewski2018Comprehensive). 

In the context of capecitabine-induced hand-foot syndrome (CiHFS), genetic variants in CDH4 are associated with increased susceptibility. Specific variants affect transcription factor binding and chromatin interactions, leading to altered CDH4 expression, which correlates with a higher risk of severe CiHFS in patients undergoing treatment (Ruiz‐Pinto2020Regulatory). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CDH4 in various pathological conditions, emphasizing its role in cancer progression, neurodevelopmental disorders, and drug-induced syndromes.

## Interactions
Cadherin 4 (CDH4) is known to interact with β-catenin, a key component in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. This interaction is significant in the context of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), where CDH4 is overexpressed and predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. CDH4 binds to β-catenin, disrupting its interaction with β-TrCP1, a component of the destruction complex responsible for β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation. This disruption prevents β-catenin degradation, allowing it to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus, where it enhances the transcription of genes involved in tumor progression (Wu2024Cytosolic).

In addition to its role in cancer, CDH4 is involved in cell adhesion processes through lateral clustering. The extracellular domain of CDH4 facilitates lateral cluster formation, which is crucial for cell adhesion. This clustering occurs independently of homophilic interactions, suggesting a unique mechanism of action for CDH4 in cell adhesion (Murase2000Lateral).

CDH4 also interacts with proteins like p120ctn and β-catenin, which are involved in cell adhesion processes. Mutations affecting the β-catenin binding site significantly impact CDH4's clustering ability, highlighting the importance of these interactions in its function (Murase2000Lateral).
