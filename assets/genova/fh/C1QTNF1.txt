# C1QTNF1

## Overview
C1QTNF1 is a gene that encodes the protein C1q and TNF related 1, which is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family. This protein is categorized as a secreted glycoprotein and is characterized by its modular structure, including a signal peptide, a collagen-like domain, and a C-terminal globular C1q domain. The C1q domain is crucial for the protein's trimerization and higher-order oligomeric complex formation, which are essential for its biological functions (Tom2005The; Wong2008Molecular). C1q and TNF related 1 is involved in various physiological processes, particularly in metabolism and cardiovascular health, where it enhances glucose and fatty acid oxidation, improves insulin sensitivity, and reduces blood glucose levels (Wu2018C1QTNF1). Additionally, it plays a protective role in cardiovascular health by activating the AMPKa pathway, which is involved in inhibiting hypertrophic growth in cardiomyocytes (Wu2018C1QTNF1). The protein's interactions with other proteins and lipids further underscore its significance in cellular signaling and metabolic regulation (Ye2020Adiponectin).

## Structure
C1QTNF1, a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, is characterized by a modular structure that includes a signal peptide, a collagen-like domain, and a C-terminal globular C1q domain (Tom2005The; Wong2008Molecular). The C1q domain, approximately 135-140 amino acids in length, adopts a jelly-roll folding topology similar to that of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (Tom2005The; Wong2008Molecular). This domain is crucial for the trimerization of the protein, forming the basic structural unit of C1QTNF1 (Wong2008Molecular).

C1QTNF1 proteins can form higher-order oligomeric complexes through disulfide bonds mediated by N-terminal cysteine residues (Wong2008Molecular). These proteins are secreted glycoproteins, with potential N-linked glycosylation sites contributing to their molecular mass and functional properties (Wong2008Molecular). The collagen-like domain, characterized by Gly-X-Y repeats, supports the formation of triple helices, contributing to the protein's stability and structural integrity (Tom2005The).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of C1QTNF1 are not provided, the protein's ability to form trimers and higher-order structures is well-documented, indicating its role in various biological processes (Wong2008Molecular).

## Function
The C1QTNF1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various physiological processes, particularly in metabolism and cardiovascular health. In healthy human cells, C1QTNF1 is involved in enhancing glucose and fatty acid oxidation, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing blood glucose levels, which contributes to better glucose metabolism (Wu2018C1QTNF1). It is highly expressed in adipose tissues and is associated with metabolic functions, including the regulation of inflammatory responses, especially under conditions of chronic inflammation (Wu2018C1QTNF1).

C1QTNF1 also plays a protective role in cardiovascular health by mitigating cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. It achieves this by activating the AMPKa pathway, which inhibits mTOR/P70S6K signaling, thereby reducing protein synthesis and hypertrophic growth in cardiomyocytes (Wu2018C1QTNF1). The protein is active in the extracellular matrix and influences signaling pathways related to cell survival and differentiation (Tom2005The). Through these mechanisms, C1QTNF1 contributes to maintaining metabolic and cardiovascular health, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal homeostasis (Wu2018C1QTNF1).

## Interactions
C1QTNF1, also known as CTRP1, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role in signaling pathways. It exerts its effects by binding to adiponectin receptor 1 (adipoR1). This interaction is crucial for its anti-hypertrophic effects, as blocking adipoR1 with an antibody abolishes these effects, indicating a direct interaction between C1QTNF1 and the receptor (Wu2018C1QTNF1). 

C1QTNF1 also influences the AMPKa pathway, a key signaling pathway in cellular energy homeostasis. The activation of AMPKa by C1QTNF1 is mediated through the upstream regulator LKB1, which is critical for the pathway's activation. This suggests an indirect interaction where C1QTNF1 modulates the activity of AMPKa via LKB1 (Wu2018C1QTNF1). 

In addition to protein interactions, C1QTNF1 has been shown to bind to specific lipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and sulfogalactosyl-ceramide (ST), through its C1q domain. This lipid-binding capability is dependent on oligomerization mediated by disulfide bonds, highlighting its role in lipid interactions (Ye2020Adiponectin). These interactions are essential for its function in glucose and lipid metabolism.
