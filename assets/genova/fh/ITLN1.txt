# ITLN1

## Overview
The ITLN1 gene encodes the protein intelectin 1, a carbohydrate-binding protein that plays a significant role in the human immune system. Intelectin 1 is primarily involved in innate immunity, where it recognizes and binds to microbial glycans, facilitating the body's defense against pathogens. This protein is predominantly expressed in the intestinal mucosa and visceral adipose tissue, where it contributes to the secretion of mucus and metabolic regulation, including glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (Nonnecke2022Characterization). Structurally, intelectin 1 is a glycoprotein that forms a disulfide-linked homotrimer, with a fibrinogen-related domain and a carbohydrate recognition domain crucial for its function (almalki2020genetic; Tsuji2007Differential). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the adiponectin receptor and lactotransferrin, further underscore its involvement in various physiological processes, including inflammation and cancer cell motility (Kobayashi2022Intelectin1; AuYeung2020ITLN1). Variations in the ITLN1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including Crohn's disease, type 2 diabetes, and asthma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for these diseases (Everman2024A; Nonnecke2021Human; Tabassum2012Common).

## Structure
Human intelectin-1 (ITLN1) is a glycoprotein that plays a role in the immune system by recognizing microbial glycans. The primary structure of ITLN1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its globular and oblong shape (almalki2020genetic). The tertiary structure of ITLN1 is characterized by a fibrinogen-related domain (FReD) at the N-terminus and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) at the C-terminal. The CRD is crucial for binding microbial glycans and contains a calcium ion that aids in this process (almalki2020genetic; Wesener2017Recognition).

ITLN1 forms a quaternary structure as a disulfide-linked homotrimer, with each monomer being approximately 40 kDa, resulting in a total molecular weight of around 120 kDa (Nonnecke2021Human; Tsuji2007Differential). The protein is glycosylated at Asn-163, which is a common post-translational modification that influences its stability and function (Tsuji2007Differential). The presence of conserved cysteine residues is essential for the formation of disulfide bonds, which stabilize the trimeric structure (Tsuji2007Differential).

## Function
Human intelectin-1 (ITLN1) is a carbohydrate-binding protein involved in innate immunity, primarily expressed in the intestinal mucosa and visceral adipose tissue. It plays a crucial role in recognizing and binding to microbial glycans, which suggests its involvement in immune defense mechanisms (Nonnecke2022Characterization). ITLN1 is known to bind specific ligands such as β-ribofuranose and β-arabinofuranose in a calcium-dependent manner, highlighting its specificity in microbial recognition (Wesener2015Recognition).

In the human intestine, ITLN1 is predominantly expressed in goblet cells, where it is involved in the secretion of mucus, contributing to the protective barrier against pathogens (Nonnecke2021Human). The protein is also associated with metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, indicating its role in metabolic regulation (Nonnecke2022Characterization).

ITLN1 forms stable homotrimers and potentially higher molecular weight oligomers, which are important for its function in glycan binding and immune response (Nonnecke2021Human). Despite its significant roles, the exact molecular mechanisms and organismal outcomes of ITLN1's activities in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Tsuji2007Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITLN1 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In Crohn's disease, genetic variations at the ITLN1 locus, particularly the SNPs rs2274910 and rs2274907, form a risk haplotype linked to the disease. These SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with other Crohn's disease-associated SNPs, suggesting a complex genetic interaction that may influence disease risk (Nonnecke2021Human).

ITLN1 is also implicated in metabolic disorders. Variants in the ITLN1 gene, such as rs1333062, have been associated with type 2 diabetes, especially in individuals with higher body mass index (BMI), indicating a role in modulating genetic susceptibility to diabetes in the context of obesity (Tabassum2012Common). Additionally, ITLN1 expression is linked to obesity-related conditions, with variations in expression levels affecting glucose metabolism and potentially serving as a biomarker for metabolic diseases (Czechowski2024Expression).

In asthma, the ITLN1 gene influences mucus plugging, particularly in severe cases. The rs4656959 variant is associated with reduced ITLN1 expression in the airways, affecting mucus plug formation in T2-high asthma patients (Everman2024A). This variant may offer protection against mucus plugging by modulating ITLN1 expression and secretion in response to inflammatory stimuli (Everman2024A).

## Interactions
Intelectin 1 (ITLN1) is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. ITLN1 interacts with the adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1), which plays a role in inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) signaling pathway. This interaction prevents the phosphorylation of IKBA, thereby inhibiting NFKB's nuclear translocation and reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kobayashi2022Intelectin1).

In the context of ovarian cancer, ITLN1 interacts with lactotransferrin (LTF). ITLN1 binds to LTF, preventing it from binding to its receptor LRP1 on ovarian cancer cells. This interaction leads to the downregulation of MMP1, a matrix metalloproteinase involved in cancer cell motility and invasion. ITLN1's binding to LTF also affects the activation of signaling molecules such as p-ERK1/2 and p-Jun, thereby modulating the invasive potential of ovarian cancer cells (AuYeung2020ITLN1).

ITLN1 also has a potential interaction with glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) in neuroblastoma cells, which may modulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction suggests a role for ITLN1 in tumor suppression through the ITLN1/KLF4/NDRG2 axis in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis (Li2015Intelectin).
