# TXNRD3

## Overview
TXNRD3 is a gene that encodes the protein thioredoxin reductase 3, a member of the thioredoxin reductase family of selenoproteins. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes both thioredoxin reductase and glutaredoxin domains, allowing it to participate in both the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways. Thioredoxin reductase 3 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis, particularly in the testes, where it is highly expressed and essential for male fertility. The protein's function is crucial for processes such as DNA synthesis, repair, and apoptosis, as well as for the maturation and motility of sperm. TXNRD3's involvement in redox regulation extends to its interactions with various proteins, including thiol peroxidases and mitochondrial proteins, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism and post-transcriptional regulation. Additionally, alterations in TXNRD3 expression have been linked to drug resistance in certain cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Dou2021TXNRD3; Liu2020Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The TXNRD3 protein, also known as thioredoxin reductase 3, is a selenoprotein characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes both thioredoxin reductase and glutaredoxin domains. The primary structure of TXNRD3 features a C-terminal penultimate selenocysteine (Sec), which is the 21st amino acid encoded by the UGA codon (Dou2021TXNRD3). The protein is composed of two 65 kDa subunits, forming a homodimer with monomers oriented in a head-to-tail manner (Dou2021TXNRD3).

The secondary structure of TXNRD3 includes an N-terminal glutaredoxin (Grx) domain, which is distinct from other thioredoxin reductases. This domain allows TXNRD3 to support both the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways, crucial for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis (Dou2021TXNRD3). The tertiary structure involves the formation of two active sites per dimer, with each active site consisting of a selenothiol at the C-terminal site of one monomer and an adjacent dithiol at the N-terminal site of the second monomer (Ingold2018Oxidative).

TXNRD3 is primarily expressed in the testes and plays a significant role in male fertility by maintaining redox homeostasis during spermiogenesis (Dou2021TXNRD3). The protein's structure and function are supported by a conserved CxxxC motif, facilitating electron transfer from FAD and mediating the flow of reducing equivalents from NADPH to thioredoxin (Dou2021TXNRD3).

## Function
Thioredoxin reductase 3 (TXNRD3) is a selenoprotein that plays a crucial role in maintaining redox homeostasis in cells, particularly in the testes. It is part of the thioredoxin reductase family, which includes TXNRD1 and TXNRD2, and is characterized by its unique N-terminal glutaredoxin domain (Dou2021TXNRD3). TXNRD3 is involved in the reduction of thioredoxin and glutathione, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADPH to these substrates, which is essential for various cellular processes, including DNA synthesis, repair, and apoptosis (Dou2021TXNRD3).

In the context of male fertility, TXNRD3 supports spermatogenesis by maintaining redox balance, which is critical for sperm maturation and motility. It is highly expressed in the testes and is involved in the reduction of thiol peroxidases and the isomerization of disulfide bonds during spermiogenesis. This activity is vital for the stabilization of sperm DNA and proper sperm function (Dou2021TXNRD3). TXNRD3 also targets RNA-binding and mitochondrial proteins, indicating its role in post-transcriptional regulation and ATP production, which are essential for sperm capacitation and motility (Dou2021TXNRD3). Its deficiency can lead to subfertility due to altered thiol redox homeostasis and incorrect disulfide bond formation (Dou2021TXNRD3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TXNRD3 gene have been linked to drug resistance in cancer, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and liver cancer. In sorafenib-resistant AML cells, TXNRD3 is upregulated over 1000-fold compared to non-resistant cells, contributing to drug resistance through redox-mediated mechanisms (Liu2020Mitochondrial). This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis in high-risk AML patients, indicating its clinical significance (Liu2020Mitochondrial). In liver cancer cells, overexpression of mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase 3 (mtTXNRD3), a variant of TXNRD3, leads to increased resistance to sorafenib by promoting a metabolic shift to glycolysis and reducing reactive oxygen species levels, which helps cancer cells survive oxidative stress (Liu2020Mitochondrial).

Inhibition of TXNRD3 has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance. The thioredoxin reductase inhibitor auranofin has shown potential in counteracting resistance by decreasing levels of anti-apoptotic factors and restoring drug sensitivity in resistant cancer cells (Liu2020Mitochondrial). These findings suggest that targeting TXNRD3 could be a promising approach in treating drug-resistant cancers (Liu2020Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
Thioredoxin reductase 3 (TXNRD3) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in maintaining redox homeostasis during spermatogenesis. TXNRD3 interacts with thiol peroxidases, particularly glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4). The interaction with GPX4 is suggested by a high confidence score from String analysis, indicating a potential functional relationship. In TXNRD3-deficient testes, GPX4 expression is higher compared to wild-type, although its expression in sperm is not significantly affected. Conversely, PRDX4 shows decreased expression in TXNRD3-deficient testes, suggesting a complex interaction network involving these thiol peroxidases (Dou2021TXNRD3).

TXNRD3 also targets RNA-binding proteins and mitochondrial proteins, which are involved in ATP production and sperm motility. These interactions are crucial for supporting mitochondrial function during sperm capacitation and redox regulation during epididymal maturation (Dou2021TXNRD3). The protein is abundant during sperm maturation and plays a role in maintaining thiol redox status in sperm proteins, potentially affecting ATP production in sperm cells (Dou2021TXNRD3). These interactions highlight TXNRD3's role in reducing disulfide-containing substrates during sperm maturation, which is essential for proper sperm function and male fertility.
