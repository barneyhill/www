# GNG7

## Overview
GNG7 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit gamma 7 (Gγ7), a critical component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in cellular signal transduction. The Gγ7 protein is categorized as a signaling molecule and plays a pivotal role in the stability and assembly of G protein heterotrimers, particularly influencing signaling pathways mediated by dopamine and adenosine receptors in the brain (Hansen2010Specificity). Predominantly expressed in the striatum, Gγ7 is essential for proper locomotor activity and the regulation of various physiological processes, including actin filament formation and cell junctions (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). Beyond its role in normal cellular function, alterations in GNG7 expression have been implicated in several cancers, where its downregulation is often associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wei2022Comprehensive; Duan2023Identification).

## Function
The GNG7 gene encodes the gamma 7 (γ7) subtype of the G-protein, which plays a crucial role in signal transduction pathways in human cells. This protein is predominantly expressed in the striatum of the brain, where it is involved in controlling locomotor activity. The γ7 subtype is essential for the stability and assembly of the G-protein heterotrimer, particularly influencing the level of the αolf protein in the striatum. This indicates that γ7 is necessary for the proper functioning of signaling pathways mediated by D1 dopamine and A2a adenosine receptors, which activate the Golf protein to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity (Hansen2010Specificity).

The Gγ subunits, including Gγ7, are involved in forming the Gβγ functional subunit, a tightly associated heterodimer crucial for the structural integrity and function of the Gβγ subunit. The interaction between Gβ and Gγ subunits is vital for maintaining the structural stability of the Gβγ complex, which plays a significant role in GPCR and G protein signaling pathways. These pathways are critical for various cellular and physiological processes, including actin filament formation and cell junctions (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GNG7 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer (GC), GNG7 is significantly downregulated, correlating with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Its low expression is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in GC (Duan2023Identification). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), GNG7 is also downregulated, with its low expression linked to poor clinical outcomes, including high tumor stage and poor therapy response. GNG7 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly B cells, which may influence prognosis (Wei2022Comprehensive).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), GNG7 expression is reduced, correlating with tumor progression and decreased patient survival. This downregulation is linked to DNA methylation, which may silence GNG7 expression (Xu2019G; Zheng2023Establishment). Similarly, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), GNG7 is downregulated, associated with poorer survival and increased metastatic potential (Zhang2021GNG7).

In squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, GNG7 loss is frequent and associated with promoter hypermethylation, suggesting a role in tumor suppression (Hartmann2011Loss). In oesophageal cancer, reduced GNG7 expression is linked to greater tumor invasion and poorer survival (Ohta2008Clinical).

## Interactions
GNG7 (G protein subunit gamma 7) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the context of cellular signaling and regulation. It is known to interact with components of the MTOR complexes, including MTOR, RAPTOR, and RICTOR, although these interactions are described as weak. This interaction is significant as it leads to the inhibition of the MTOR pathway, which is a central regulator of autophagy and cell proliferation (Liu2016G). 

GNG7 also forms a heterotrimeric complex with Gα olf and Gβ2, which is coupled to the D1 receptor. This complex is involved in signal transduction across the plasma membrane from a receptor to an effector (Liu2016G). 

In addition to its role in signaling pathways, GNG7 affects the actin cytoskeleton by reducing actin stress fibers, which may contribute to its role in inhibiting cell division (Liu2016G). The interaction with the actin cytoskeleton suggests a mechanism by which GNG7 influences cell division and autophagy, potentially through its effects on actin and microtubule dynamics (Liu2016G).
