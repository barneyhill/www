# NCKIPSD

## Overview
The NCKIPSD gene encodes the NCK-interacting protein with SH3 domain, commonly referred to as SPIN90, which is a crucial adaptor protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by its LIW domain and proline-rich regions, facilitating interactions with other proteins through SH3 domains. SPIN90 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as actin polymerization, sarcomere assembly, and stress fiber formation, contributing to cell adhesion and motility. It is also implicated in the Rho GTPase signaling pathway, which is essential for cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are vital for maintaining cellular structure and function, particularly in neuronal cells, where it influences synaptic activity and dendritic spine development (Huang2006Identification; Mei2023A; Lew2020Transgelin).

## Structure
The NCKIPSD protein, also known as NCK-interacting protein with SH3 domain, is characterized by the presence of the LIW domain, which is approximately 170 to 200 amino acids in length and rich in leucines (Huang2006Identification). This domain is a significant structural feature, containing conserved residues such as asparagines, aspartic acids, and arginines, and is predicted to consist of three β-sheets and seven α-helices (Huang2006Identification). The LIW domain overlaps with proline-rich regions in NCKIPSD and its isoforms, which are found in various multicellular animals, including humans, rodents, and insects (Huang2006Identification).

NCKIPSD is involved in cytoskeletal organization and interacts with the FH2 domain in mDia, but not with FHOD1, indicating specific binding interactions (Huang2006Identification). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function in actin polymerization, sarcomere assembly, stress fiber formation, and cell adhesion turnover (Huang2006Identification). The presence of SH3 domains facilitates binding to proline-rich motifs, contributing to its role in protein-protein interactions. NCKIPSD may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which could result in variations in its functional properties.

## Function
The NCKIPSD gene encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily related to actin cytoskeleton organization and cell signaling. In healthy human cells, NCKIPSD plays a crucial role in the assembly of myofibrils into sarcomeres and the formation of stress fibers, which are essential for maintaining cell structure and function (Huang2006Identification; Mei2023A). It is also involved in the development and maintenance of dendritic spines, contributing to synaptic activity regulation in neurons (Mei2023A).

NCKIPSD functions as an adaptor molecule, recruiting other proteins to Nck at focal adhesions, which is vital for stable cell adhesion (Huang2006Identification). It interacts with proteins containing SH3 domains, influencing cellular processes such as cell shape, motility, and adhesion. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and has roles in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, potentially contributing to transcriptional regulation and actin dynamics (Alerasool2021Identification).

NCKIPSD is also implicated in the Rho GTPase signaling pathway, which is crucial for cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration (Lew2020Transgelin). Its interactions with other proteins, such as DCAF7, suggest a role in transcriptional activation and actin dynamics (Alerasool2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The NCKIPSD gene, encoding the SPIN90 protein, has been implicated in several neurological disorders due to its role in synaptic function and brain network modulation. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the NCKIPSD rs12497850 variant is associated with alterations in brain network properties, particularly affecting the small-worldness of gray and white matter networks. This variant influences cerebral cortex development and neurite morphology, potentially modifying structural networks in PD patients (Chen2022Parkinson’s). Additionally, NCKIPSD is one of the genes identified as dysregulated in both blood and brain tissues in PD, suggesting its involvement in pathways related to neuron death regulation (Moni2019A).

NCKIPSD is also considered a risk gene for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), with genetic variations at its locus affecting gene expression regulation across multiple brain regions (Küçükali2024Multiomic). Furthermore, mutations in NCKIPSD may have clinical significance in brain disorders due to its role in dendritic spine maintenance and synaptic activity modulation, although specific diseases are not detailed (Powell2021Investigating). These findings highlight the gene's potential impact on neurological conditions through its influence on synaptic and structural brain networks.

## Interactions
NCKIPSD, also known as SPIN90, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with Nck, a protein involved in signal transduction, through its proline-rich motifs and SH3 domain. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization and is modulated by ERK1-mediated phosphorylation of SPIN90, which is influenced by cell adhesion and growth factors (Lim2001SPIN90; Lim2003Regulation).

SPIN90 also interacts with βPIX and WASP, forming a molecular complex that is dependent on cell adhesion. The SH3 domain of SPIN90 mediates its interaction with βPIX, a Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation (Lim2003Regulation).

In addition, NCKIPSD interacts with IGPR-1 through its proline-rich motif, linking it to actin fibril assembly and endothelial barrier function. This interaction is part of the mechanisms that regulate cell-cell junction assembly and cell morphology (Rahimi2017Defenders).

NCKIPSD is also part of a core module within the Rho GTPase signaling pathway, interacting with proteins such as RAC1, WAS, and MYO1F, which are involved in cytoskeleton remodeling (Lew2020Transgelin).
