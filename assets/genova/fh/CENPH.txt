# CENPH

## Overview
CENPH, or centromere protein H, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of the centromere, a key component of the chromosome essential for proper cell division. The protein, centromere protein H, is a part of the CENP-A nucleosome-associated complex and plays a critical role in kinetochore assembly, which is necessary for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. Characterized by coiled-coil domains, centromere protein H facilitates protein-protein interactions, contributing to the stability and integrity of the centromere complex. It undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions within the centromere. The gene can produce multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, allowing for functional diversity. CENPH's involvement in maintaining genomic stability underscores its importance in cellular processes, and its dysregulation has been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Guo2008Prognostic; Alonso2007Colocalization).

## Structure
CENPH (centromere protein H) is a component of the CENP-A nucleosome-associated complex, essential for centromere function and kinetochore assembly. The protein structure of CENPH includes coiled-coil domains, which are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These domains contribute to the protein's ability to form stable complexes with other centromere proteins, playing a significant role in its function within the centromere.

CENPH undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions within the centromere complex. These modifications are important for the dynamic regulation of CENPH's function during cell division.

The gene encoding CENPH can produce multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, allowing for variations in its structure and potentially its function. These isoforms may have distinct roles or regulatory mechanisms within the cell, contributing to the versatility and adaptability of the centromere complex.

Overall, the structural features of CENPH, including its coiled-coil domains and post-translational modifications, are integral to its role in maintaining centromere integrity and facilitating proper chromosome segregation during mitosis.

## Function
CENPH (centromere protein H) is a crucial component of the centromere, playing a significant role in the assembly and function of the kinetochore, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. CENPH is part of the CENP-A nucleosome-associated complex and is involved in the structural organization of centromeric chromatin. It co-localizes with CENP-A and CENP-C at human neocentromeres, forming a distinct chromatin domain that is vital for kinetochore assembly (Alonso2007Colocalization).

CENPH is dependent on CENP-A for its localization and may facilitate the interaction between CENP-C and CENP-A, contributing to the structural integrity of the centromere (Alonso2007Colocalization). The presence of CENPH is crucial for the proper loading of CENP-C, which is necessary for the formation of a functional kinetochore (Alonso2007Colocalization). This protein is active at the centromere throughout the cell cycle, ensuring accurate attachment of spindle microtubules to chromosomes, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Ekwall2007Epigenetic; Alonso2007Colocalization). The co-localization of CENPH with other centromeric proteins suggests its involvement in defining the chromatin structure at neocentromeres, which is essential for centromere function and chromosome segregation (Alonso2007Colocalization).

## Clinical Significance
CENPH (centromere protein H) is implicated in several cancers due to its role in chromosomal instability. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), CENPH is overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels, correlating with tumor progression and shorter overall survival. It serves as an independent prognostic marker, with higher expression linked to more aggressive disease stages and poorer outcomes, particularly in male patients (Guo2008Prognostic). Similarly, in tongue cancer, elevated CENPH expression is associated with advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis. High CENPH levels predict shorter survival, especially in early-stage patients, and its depletion can inhibit cancer cell proliferation (Liao2009Upregulation).

In contrast, studies on prostate cancer have not found a significant association between CENPH expression and tumorigenesis. Although CENPH expression was observed to be lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, this difference was not statistically significant, suggesting no direct link to prostate cancer progression (Karalezli2021Evaluation). These findings highlight the gene's variable impact across different cancer types, underscoring its potential as a prognostic marker in certain cancers while being less relevant in others.

## Interactions
CENPH (centromere protein H) is a key component of the centromere, participating in crucial interactions with other centromeric proteins to ensure proper kinetochore assembly and function. It co-localizes with CENP-A and CENP-C at human neocentromeres, forming part of a distinct chromatin structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division (Alonso2007Colocalization). CENPH is necessary for the loading of CENP-C, indicating a hierarchical interaction where CENPH facilitates the recruitment of other centromeric proteins (Alonso2007Colocalization).

The study of CENPH in cell lines such as BBB and IMS13q has shown that it maps to the same BACs as CENP-A and CENP-C, suggesting a tight co-localization and potential physical interaction within these chromatin domains (Alonso2007Colocalization). Co-immunoprecipitation studies in HeLa cells have demonstrated that CENPH is tightly associated with CENP-A chromatin, along with CENP-C and other proteins, indicating its role in forming a stable multiprotein complex at the centromere (Alonso2007Colocalization). These interactions highlight the importance of CENPH in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the centromere.
