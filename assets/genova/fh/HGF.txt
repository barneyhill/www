# HGF

## Overview
The HGF gene encodes the hepatocyte growth factor, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including cell growth, motility, and morphogenesis. As a member of the plasminogen-related growth factor family, HGF is synthesized as an inactive precursor and undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form an active heterodimer. This protein functions primarily as a ligand for the MET receptor, a receptor-type tyrosine kinase, initiating a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways that promote cellular proliferation, survival, and tissue regeneration (Funakoshi2003Hepatocyte; Holmes2007Insights). HGF is critically involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, essential for organ development and repair, and exhibits anti-apoptotic properties that protect cells under stress conditions (Matsumoto1996Emerging; Yo1998Potential). Dysregulation of HGF and its signaling pathways is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it contributes to tumor progression and metastasis (Fu2021HGFcMET).

## Structure
The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multidomain protein structurally related to plasminogen. It is initially synthesized as a single-chain precursor and undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form an active two-chain heterodimer composed of an α-chain and a β-chain linked by disulfide bonds (Holmes2007Insights). The α-chain includes an N-terminal domain and four kringle domains (K1 to K4), while the β-chain contains a serine proteinase homology domain (SP) that lacks enzymatic activity due to specific mutations (Holmes2007Insights).

The N-terminal domain of HGF features a unique fold with a heparin-binding site, involving residues Lys-60, Lys-62, Arg-73, Arg-76, and Lys-78 (Chirgadze1998Insights). The kringle domains are characterized by a hydrophobic core and a globular structure stabilized by three conserved disulfide bonds (Chirgadze1998Insights). The serine proteinase domain, although homologous to active serine proteases, is inactive due to substitutions affecting catalytic residues (Chirgadze1998Insights).

HGF interacts with the MET receptor, a process facilitated by the N and K1 domains, which are crucial for receptor binding and activation (Holmes2007Insights). The protein also binds to glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate, which act as co-receptors (Holmes2007Insights). Splice variants of HGF, such as NK1 and NK2, exhibit partial agonistic or antagonistic activity (Chirgadze1998Insights).

## Function
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in various biological processes in healthy human cells. It is a potent stimulator of DNA synthesis and cell growth in several cell types, including hepatocytes, renal epithelial cells, melanocytes, and keratinocytes (Nakamura1991Structure). HGF acts as a ligand for the c-Met receptor, a receptor-type tyrosine kinase, which upon activation, triggers intracellular signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, motility, and survival (Funakoshi2003Hepatocyte; Matsumoto1996Emerging).

HGF is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, crucial for organ development and tissue reconstruction. It induces branching tubular structures in epithelial cells, essential for the development of organs like the kidney, liver, and mammary gland (Matsumoto1996Emerging). HGF also plays a role in wound healing and tissue regeneration by enhancing keratinocyte motility and proliferation, functioning in a paracrine manner (Matsumoto1991Marked).

In addition to its mitogenic effects, HGF exhibits anti-apoptotic properties, protecting epithelial and endothelial cells from apoptosis and injury, particularly under stress conditions such as serum deprivation and TNF-α treatment (Yo1998Potential). These functions underscore HGF's critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting tissue repair and regeneration.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene and its interactions with the Met receptor are implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In myeloid malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), elevated HGF levels are associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. In CML, high HGF levels correlate with increased basophilia during the acceleration phase, independent of the Bcr-Abl mutation (Boissinot2014The). In polycythemia vera (PV), HGF overexpression is linked to increased white blood cell counts and splenomegaly, independent of the JAK2V617F mutation (Boissinot2014The).

In solid tumors, the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Overexpression of HGF and c-MET is observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), contributing to poor prognosis and resistance to therapies (Fu2021HGFcMET; Gumustekin2011HGFcMet; Rothenberger2017Hepatocyte). In NSCLC, MET amplification can lead to resistance against EGFR inhibitors (Fu2021HGFcMET). The pathway's role in promoting angiogenesis and metastasis further underscores its clinical significance in cancer (Cecchi2012Targeting).

## Interactions
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) interacts with the MET receptor, a tyrosine kinase receptor, to initiate various signaling pathways. Upon binding to MET, HGF induces the receptor's dimerization and activation, which is crucial for downstream signaling events (Kemp2006Signalling). HGF can also form complexes with extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VN), enhancing its signaling capabilities. These complexes promote the formation of Met-integrin signaling complexes, which are essential for sustained activation of MET and its association with integrins α5β1 and αvβ3, facilitating endothelial cell migration (Rahman2005Novelhepatocytegrowthfactor(HGF)bindingdomainsonfibronectinandvitronectincoordinateadistinctandamplifiedMetintegrininducedsignallingpathwayin… page 2 of 8, page 6 of 8).

HGF's interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) also plays a role in modulating its activity. These GAGs act as coreceptors, enhancing the mitogenic potency of HGF and facilitating MET receptor dimerization, although they are not required for the initial binding of HGF to MET (Lyon2002The). These interactions underscore the complex network of HGF-mediated signaling pathways that contribute to processes such as cell motility, proliferation, and tissue regeneration.
