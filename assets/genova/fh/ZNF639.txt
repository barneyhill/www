# ZNF639

## Overview
ZNF639 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 639, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, through its interactions with complexes such as NuRD and HiRA. ZNF639 is particularly noted for its stabilizing role in the interaction between the NuRD complex and the transcription factor ZBTB2, which is crucial for maintaining proper gene expression during cellular transitions (Olivieri2020A; Olivieri2021The). Additionally, ZNF639 has been implicated in cancer biology, serving as a prognostic marker in breast cancer and playing a role in host-virus interactions, particularly in the context of Murine Leukemia Virus infection (Lee2024Zinc; Wang2020Zinc).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF639, also known as Zinc Finger Amplified in Esophageal Squamous Carcinoma 1 (ZASC1), has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in breast cancer. Low expression levels of ZNF639 are associated with worse overall and recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients. Studies have shown that reduced ZNF639 expression is observed in a majority of breast cancer samples, and its knockdown in breast tumor cell lines leads to increased clonogenicity, cell motility, and metastasis, particularly to the lungs in mice models. This suggests that ZNF639 plays a critical role in inhibiting breast cancer progression by affecting cell motility and metastasis (Lee2024Zinc).

In addition to its role in breast cancer, ZNF639 is involved in host-virus interactions, particularly in the activation of Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV). The reduction of endogenous ZNF639 protein in MLV-resistant cell lines confers resistance to MLV infection, indicating its potential role in viral replication and host resistance mechanisms (Wang2020Zinc).

ZNF639 has also been implicated in endometrial cancer through co-regulatory expression quantitative trait loci (creQTL) mapping, suggesting its involvement in gene regulation networks associated with cancer survival (Kompass2011Coregulatory).

## Interactions
ZNF639, also known as Zinc Finger Amplified in Esophageal Squamous Carcinoma 1 (ZASC1), is a zinc finger protein involved in various protein interactions and transcriptional regulation. It is known to interact with the NuRD complex, a chromatin remodeling complex, where it plays a stabilizing role. This interaction is crucial for the binding of the transcription factor ZBTB2 to the NuRD complex, as ZNF639 enhances the interaction between ZBTB2 and the NuRD complex by interacting directly with the Znf1 domain of ZBTB2 (Olivieri2020A). 

ZNF639 is also part of a functional module with the NuRD and HiRA complexes, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation during the transition from pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (Olivieri2021The). The presence of ZNF639 is necessary to stabilize or enhance the interaction between NuRD and ZBTB2, as evidenced by a significant reduction in NuRD interaction upon loss of ZNF639 (Olivieri2021The). Additionally, ZNF639 has been implicated in facilitating Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) infection by binding to the U3 region of the MLV 3' LTR, suggesting a role in host-virus interactions (Wang2020Zinc).
