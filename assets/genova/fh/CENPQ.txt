# CENPQ

## Overview
CENPQ, or centromere protein Q, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the function and structure of the kinetochore, a critical component in chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein encoded by CENPQ is a part of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), where it interacts with other centromeric proteins, such as CENPA, to ensure the proper attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores. This interaction is vital for maintaining genomic stability and facilitating accurate chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis (Reinhold2011Identification). Dysregulation of CENPQ has been linked to aneuploidy and cancer, particularly breast cancer, where it is involved in the miR-2052/CENPQ axis, affecting metastasis and angiogenesis (Qian2022LncRNA). The gene's expression is co-regulated with other kinetochore-associated genes, underscoring its importance in cell cycle progression and chromosomal stability (Reinhold2011Identification).

## Function
CENPQ (centromere protein Q) is a crucial component of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), which is essential for the assembly and function of the kinetochore, a multi-protein structure necessary for chromosome segregation during cell division. CENPQ interacts with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENPA, playing a vital role in the early organization of centromeric chromatin structure (Reinhold2011Identification). This interaction is critical for the accurate attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores, ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis, thereby contributing to genomic stability and cell cycle progression (Reinhold2011Identification).

The expression of CENPQ, along with other kinetochore-associated genes, is co-regulated, indicating a tightly controlled mechanism that ensures the proper function of the kinetochore complex. This co-regulation is influenced by various transcription factors, including CREB1, E2F1, FOXE1, and FOXM1, as well as microRNAs, which collectively maintain the expression levels necessary for kinetochore integrity and function (Reinhold2011Identification). Dysregulation of CENPQ and its associated network can lead to aneuploidy, a condition often linked to cancer, highlighting its importance in maintaining chromosomal stability (Reinhold2011Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CENPQ gene have been implicated in the progression of breast cancer. The long non-coding RNA LINC01857 is known to regulate the miR-2052/CENPQ axis, which plays a significant role in breast cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. High expression levels of LINC01857 and CENPQ are observed in breast cancer tissues, while miR-2052 is expressed at lower levels. Down-regulation of LINC01857 has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis in breast cancer cells by reducing the expression of angiogenesis-related proteins such as VEGF and CD31, as well as metastasis-related proteins MMP-2 and MMP-9. This suggests that CENPQ, as part of the miR-2052/CENPQ axis, is associated with breast cancer progression (Qian2022LncRNA).

In vivo experiments further support the role of CENPQ in cancer, as down-regulating LINC01857 significantly suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice. The effects of LINC01857 down-regulation could be partially reversed by miR-2052 inhibitors, indicating the critical role of the miR-2052/CENPQ axis in these processes (Qian2022LncRNA). These findings highlight the potential of targeting the CENPQ gene and its regulatory pathways as a therapeutic strategy in breast cancer treatment.

## Interactions
CENPQ is a component of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), which is crucial for kinetochore assembly and function. It interacts with other proteins within the CCAN, including CENPA, CENPB, and CENPC, forming a complex network essential for the proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division (Reinhold2011Identification). CENPQ is part of a multi-protein structure that assembles on centromeric DNA, contributing to the kinetochore's structural integrity and function (Reinhold2011Identification).

In the context of breast cancer, CENPQ is involved in the miR-2052/CENPQ axis, where it is targeted by miR-2052. This interaction is regulated by the long non-coding RNA LINC01857, which affects metastasis and angiogenesis in breast cancer cells. The down-regulation of LINC01857 leads to decreased expression of CENPQ, impacting the expression of angiogenesis-related proteins such as VEGF and CD31, as well as metastasis-related proteins MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Qian2022LncRNA). This regulatory axis highlights the role of CENPQ in cancer progression, although specific details on its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not provided (Qian2022LncRNA).
