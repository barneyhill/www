# ADM

## Overview
The ADM gene encodes the peptide hormone adrenomedullin, which is a multifunctional protein involved in a variety of physiological processes. Adrenomedullin is categorized as a vasodilator peptide and plays a crucial role in cardiovascular homeostasis, influencing vascular tone and blood pressure regulation. It is also involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis regulation, and the inflammatory response, exhibiting both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects. The protein interacts with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors and forms functional receptor complexes with calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), which are essential for its biological activity (Aiyar2001Receptoractivitymodifyingproteinsinteractionwithhumanandporcinecalcitoninreceptorlikereceptor(CRLR); Zimmermann1995Adrenomedullin page 0 of 1). Adrenomedullin's expression is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Simonetti2021Adrenomedullin; Larráyoz2014Adrenomedullin).

## Structure


## Function
Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a multifunctional peptide involved in various physiological processes, including vasodilation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis regulation. In osteoblastic cells, ADM promotes cell survival and proliferation through several signaling pathways. It activates the MAPK/ERK pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of p90RSK, which inactivates the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, thereby promoting cell survival (Lausson2011Signal). ADM also enhances the transcriptional activity of the transcription factor CREB, increasing the expression of proliferative proteins like PCNA (Lausson2011Signal).

ADM is expressed in the zona glomerulosa of the human adrenal gland, where it acts as an autocrine-paracrine growth regulator. It enhances cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis in cultured zona glomerulosa cells, influencing aldosterone secretion (Rebuffat2002Adrenomedullin). In the cardiovascular system, ADM is a potent vasodilator, contributing to the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. It achieves these effects by elevating intracellular cAMP levels and activating adenylate cyclase and nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells (Wong2005Adrenomedullin).

ADM also plays a role in the inflammatory response, exhibiting both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects. It modulates cytokine production and macrophage migration inhibitory factor secretion in macrophage cells, indicating its complex role in inflammation (Wong2005Adrenomedullin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADM gene, which encodes adrenomedullin, are associated with various cancers. Elevated levels of adrenomedullin are observed in several tumor types, including osteosarcoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, and colorectal carcinoma. These elevated levels often correlate with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. For example, in breast cancer, increased plasma concentrations of adrenomedullin are linked to lymph node metastasis, while in epithelial ovarian cancer, high expression is associated with metastasis and shorter survival times (Larráyoz2014Adrenomedullin). In colorectal cancer, adrenomedullin expression is significantly higher in tumors with KRAS mutations, suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis and cell invasion under hypoxic conditions (Wang2013Adrenomedullin).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), adrenomedullin is overexpressed in leukemia stem cells and is associated with an inflammatory transcriptional program. This overexpression is linked to poor overall survival in certain risk classes of AML, and targeting adrenomedullin could have therapeutic potential (Simonetti2021Adrenomedullin). In gastric cancer, adrenomedullin induces mast cell degranulation, promoting tumor progression through the release of proinflammatory cytokines (Lv2018Degranulation). These findings suggest that adrenomedullin plays a significant role in cancer progression and could be a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Adrenomedullin (ADM) interacts with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors, as demonstrated in studies using cultured human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells. ADM and CGRP share the same receptor, with ADM inhibiting [125I]CGRP binding. However, ADM is less efficient than CGRP in stimulating cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation. The N-terminal ring structure of ADM is crucial for its binding to the CGRP receptor (Zimmermann1995Adrenomedullin).

ADM also interacts with calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) to form functional receptor complexes. In human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293), ADM interacts with CRLR, and the receptor phenotype is determined by coexpression with RAMP2 or RAMP3, which makes CRLR responsive to ADM. This interaction is crucial for the glycosylation and transport of CRLR to the plasma membrane, facilitating ligand binding (Aiyar2001Receptoractivitymodifyingproteinsinteractionwithhumanandporcinecalcitoninreceptorlikereceptor(CRLR)inHEK293cells page 0 of 3).

ADM's interaction with CRLR and RAMPs is also observed in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells, where CRLR is uniformly glycosylated regardless of the RAMP present. This interaction is significant for the potential therapeutic applications of ADM in cardiovascular disorders and septic shock (Aldecoa2000Mammalian).
