# PIGP

## Overview
The PIGP gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class P protein, a critical component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex. This protein is integral to the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are glycolipids that tether proteins to the cell membrane, facilitating various cellular functions such as enzymatic activity, cell adhesion, and signal transduction (Johnstone2017Compound; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). PIGP is characterized as a transmembrane protein, with its structure comprising two transmembrane domains that anchor it within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Watanabe2000Initial). The protein's interaction with other subunits of the GPI-GnT complex, such as PIG-A and PIG-Q, is essential for the initial step of GPI anchor biosynthesis, underscoring its role in the proper expression of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface (Wu2020The). Mutations in the PIGP gene have been linked to inherited GPI deficiencies, which can result in severe developmental disorders, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Johnstone2017Compound; Vetro2020Early).

## Structure
The PIGP protein is a 134-amino acid component of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex, essential for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. The primary structure of PIGP includes two N-terminal hydrophobic regions and a C-terminal hydrophilic region (Watanabe2000Initial). The secondary structure is characterized by two transmembrane domains, TM1 and TM2, as predicted by the TMpred program (Watanabe2000Initial). These transmembrane domains suggest that PIGP is embedded within the membrane, with the N-terminus and the major hydrophilic region located on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (Watanabe2000Initial).

In terms of quaternary structure, PIGP interacts with other components of the GPI-GnT complex, specifically binding to PIG-A and GPI1, but not to PIG-H or PIG-C (Watanabe2000Initial). This interaction is crucial for the function of the GPI-GnT complex, as PIGP is necessary for the first step of GPI-anchor biosynthesis (Watanabe2000Initial). The protein does not show significant homology with other proteins of known functions, indicating a unique role in GPI biosynthesis (Watanabe2000Initial).

## Function
The PIGP gene encodes a 134-amino-acid protein that is an essential component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This complex is responsible for the initial step in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which involves the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI) on the cytoplasmic side of the ER (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). PIGP interacts with other subunits of the GPI-GnT complex, such as PIG-A and PIG-Q, and is crucial for the expression of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface (Wu2020The).

GPI anchors are glycolipids that tether proteins to the cell membrane, playing a significant role in various cellular functions, including acting as enzymes, adhesion molecules, and receptors (Johnstone2017Compound). The absence of PIGP results in defective GPI-AP expression, highlighting its essential role in the GPI biosynthesis pathway (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). In healthy human cells, PIGP is involved in the early steps of GPI biosynthesis, contributing to the proper anchoring of proteins to the cell membrane, which is vital for maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (Wu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGP gene are associated with a range of developmental disorders known as inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), which are a subset of congenital disorders of glycosylation. These disorders often present with symptoms such as seizures, hypotonia, and intellectual disability. Specifically, compound heterozygous mutations in PIGP have been linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by early-onset seizures, profound global developmental delay, and hypotonia (Johnstone2017Compound). 

In a study involving two siblings with compound heterozygous mutations in PIGP, the mutations led to reduced PIGP mRNA levels and decreased expression of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface, which are critical for various cellular functions (Johnstone2017Compound). Another study identified a homozygous c.384del variant in PIGP, causing a frameshift mutation that resulted in severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including epileptic-dyskinetic encephalopathy, characterized by severe hypotonia, dyskinesia, and various types of seizures (Vetro2020Early).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of PIGP mutations in contributing to severe neurological conditions and highlight the importance of the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway in neurodevelopment (Johnstone2017Compound; Vetro2020Early).

## Interactions
The PIGP gene encodes a protein that is an essential component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis pathway. PIGP is a subunit of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, which is responsible for the initial step of GPI anchor biosynthesis. This complex facilitates the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI) on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. PIGP interacts with several other proteins within the GPI-GnT complex, including PIG-A, PIG-H, PIG-C, PIG-Q, PIG-Y, and DPM2. The interaction of PIGP with PIG-A and PIG-Q is particularly crucial for the function of the GPI-GnT complex, which is necessary for the expression of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis).

In addition to its role in GPI anchor biosynthesis, PIGP has been associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-55 (EIEE55). Mutations in PIGP can lead to reduced expression of GPI-anchored proteins, affecting various cellular processes (Wu2020The). These interactions highlight the importance of PIGP in maintaining cellular function and its potential impact on human health.
