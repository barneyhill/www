# TMPO

## Overview
The TMPO gene encodes a group of proteins known as lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) isoforms, which are integral to the structural organization of the nuclear envelope and chromatin architecture. These proteins, including the well-studied isoforms LAP2α and LAP2β, play crucial roles in maintaining nuclear integrity, regulating gene expression, and facilitating cell cycle progression. LAP2α, a nucleoplasmic protein, interacts with A-type lamins and the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), influencing cell proliferation and gene repression. In contrast, LAP2β is an integral membrane protein of the inner nuclear membrane, interacting with B-type lamins and contributing to nuclear architecture. The TMPO gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct cellular functions, and is subject to post-translational modifications that further diversify its roles. Mutations in TMPO have been linked to cardiomyopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Weber1999On; Vadrot2023Abnormal; Wilson2010Laminbinding).

## Structure
The TMPO gene encodes several protein isoforms, including LAP2α and LAP2β, which are involved in nuclear envelope organization and cell cycle regulation. The primary structure of these isoforms includes a common N-terminal region encoded by exons 1, 2, and 3, which contains a LEM-like and a LEM domain. These domains are crucial for binding to the chromatin-associated protein BAF (Vadrot2023Abnormal). The C-terminal regions differ between isoforms, with LAP2α containing binding domains for pRb, lamin A/C, and HMGN5, while LAP2β interacts with lamin B1 and HDAC3 (Vadrot2023Abnormal).

The LAP2α isoform is unique to mammals and plays a role in binding lamin A in the nucleoplasm and interacting with unphosphorylated Rb to control cell-cycle progression (Abascal2015Alternative). The TMPO gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct cellular roles (Abascal2015Alternative). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are suggested by the presence of potential recognition sequences for cdc2-related kinases in the protein sequences (Berger1996The). These structural features and modifications contribute to the functional diversity of TMPO proteins in cellular processes.

## Function
The TMPO gene, also known as thymopoietin, encodes several isoforms of lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2), which are integral to nuclear envelope organization and chromatin structure. In healthy human cells, TMPO proteins play a crucial role in maintaining nuclear architecture and regulating gene expression. The LAP2 isoforms, particularly LAP2α, are involved in the structural organization of the nucleus and post-mitotic nuclear assembly. LAP2α interacts with A-type lamins in the nuclear interior, contributing to the regulation of cell proliferation through interactions with the tumor suppressor Rb, which is essential for the repression of E2F/Rb target genes in tissue progenitor stem cells (Wilson2010Laminbinding).

TMPOβ, another isoform, is an integral membrane protein of the inner nuclear membrane and binds to B-type lamins, suggesting its role in nuclear architecture and cell cycle regulation (Weber1999On). The expression of TMPOβ is notably high in cancerous cells, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis, but in healthy cells, it primarily maintains nuclear structure and facilitates cell cycle processes (Weber1999On). These functions highlight the importance of TMPO in cellular processes related to nuclear integrity and cell cycle control.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMPO gene, which encodes the lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2), have been implicated in various cardiomyopathies, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The TMPO variant p.(Arg690Cys) was initially identified in familial DCM cases, affecting the LAP2α isoform and compromising its interaction with lamin A/C, although it did not alter LAP2α localization in cells (Taylor2005Thymopoietin). However, this variant is now considered a functional polymorphism rather than a pathogenic mutation due to its high frequency in certain populations (Vadrot2023Abnormal).

Other TMPO variants, such as p.(Leu124Phe) and p.(Ala240Thr), have been associated with cardiomyopathy, affecting gene transcription regulation and nuclear structure. These variants may contribute to disease severity through mechanisms like TMPO haploinsufficiency or toxic effects of truncated proteins (Vadrot2023Abnormal). The p.(Gly395Glufs*11) variant, leading to LAP2α haploinsufficiency, has been linked to HCM and affects cell proliferation (Vadrot2023Abnormal).

The TMPO gene's role in cardiomyopathy may also be influenced by sex-specific factors, as LAP2α expression levels differ between males and females, potentially affecting disease prevalence and severity (Vadrot2023Abnormal).

## Interactions
The TMPO gene encodes proteins that are integral to nuclear envelope organization and chromatin structure. TMPO proteins, particularly the LAP2 isoforms, interact with lamins A/C, which are structural components of the nuclear lamina. These interactions are crucial for maintaining nuclear integrity and are implicated in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization and gene regulation (Lunin2020Precursors).

LAP2α, a splice variant of TMPO, interacts with A-type lamins throughout the nuclear interior, playing a role in maintaining the nucleoplasmic pool of these lamins during interphase. This interaction is significant for gene expression regulation through binding chromatin proteins and modifying enzymes, participating in epigenetic pathways (Lunin2020Precursors).

In the context of cardiomyopathies, TMPO variants have been shown to affect interactions with several proteins. For instance, a missense variant in LAP2α reduces its interaction with the nucleosome binding protein HMGN5, impacting genome organization and mechanical force resistance in cardiomyocytes (Vadrot2023Abnormal). Another variant affects the binding to the chromatin-associated protein BAF, altering E2F-regulated gene transcription and nuclear structure (Vadrot2023Abnormal). These interactions highlight the role of TMPO in nuclear architecture and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis.
