# HACD3

## Overview
HACD3, or 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 3, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the elongation of long-chain fatty acids, a critical process in lipid metabolism. The protein encoded by HACD3 is categorized as a dehydratase and plays a pivotal role in the fatty acid biosynthetic process by catalyzing the dehydration step within the fatty acid elongation cycle. This enzyme is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to the diversity of cellular lipids by participating in the elongation of both saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (Wang2024The; Sawai2017The). Although its enzymatic activity is considered weaker compared to other dehydratases such as HACD1 and HACD2, HACD3 is also involved in various cellular processes, including the Rac1 signaling pathway and insulin receptor internalization (Li2024HACD3; Sawai2017The). Additionally, HACD3 has been implicated in the replication of certain viruses, such as hepatitis C and influenza A, by interacting with viral proteins to prevent their degradation (Li2024HACD3). Despite these insights, the full spectrum of HACD3's physiological functions and substrates in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Sawai2017The).

## Function
HACD3 (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 3) is an enzyme involved in the fatty acid biosynthetic process, specifically in the elongation of long-chain fatty acids. It catalyzes the dehydration step in the fatty acid elongation cycle, which is crucial for lipid metabolism and maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis (Wang2024The; Sawai2017The). HACD3 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to the diversity of lipids by participating in the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, although its activity is relatively weak compared to other dehydratases like HACD1 and HACD2 (Sawai2017The).

In addition to its role in fatty acid metabolism, HACD3 is involved in the Rac1 signaling pathway and plays a role in insulin receptor internalization (Li2024HACD3). It is also implicated in the replication of certain viruses, such as the hepatitis C virus and influenza A virus, by interacting with viral proteins and preventing their degradation, although these functions are not directly related to its role in healthy human cells (Li2024HACD3). The physiological functions and exact substrates of HACD3 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Sawai2017The).

## Interactions
HACD3, also known as 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 3, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with the viral PB1 protein of the Influenza A Virus (IAV), a core subunit of the viral polymerase complex. This interaction is mediated by the first cytoplasmic domain of HACD3 (amino acids 1-149) and is essential for preventing PB1 from autophagic degradation, thereby facilitating IAV replication (Li2024HACD3).

HACD3 also interacts with the selective autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62. It competes with SQSTM1/p62 for binding to PB1, which prevents PB1 from entering the autophagic degradation pathway. This competition is crucial for maintaining PB1 protein stability and promoting IAV replication (Li2024HACD3).

In addition to its role in viral replication, HACD3 is part of the fatty acid elongation complex, interacting with ELOVL enzymes. These interactions are important for its function in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids, although specific details of these interactions are not extensively covered in the provided context (Blondelle2015HACD1).
