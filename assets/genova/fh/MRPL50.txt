# MRPL50

## Overview
The MRPL50 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L50, which is a crucial component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mtLSU). This protein plays a significant role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by contributing to the stability and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, essential for the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency). The MRPL50 protein is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands, such as the ovaries, ears, kidneys, and heart, where it supports cellular respiration and energy production (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency). Mutations in the MRPL50 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including autosomal recessive syndromic premature ovarian insufficiency and Perrault syndrome, highlighting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and overall cellular health (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency).

## Function
The MRPL50 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mtLSU). In healthy human cells, MRPL50 plays a crucial role in the stability and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is essential for the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery. This process is vital for cellular respiration and energy production, as it facilitates the synthesis of proteins necessary for the OXPHOS system, including mitochondrial complex I (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency).

MRPL50 is active within the mitochondria, where it contributes to mitochondrial protein homeostasis and supports the function of organs with high energy demands, such as the ovaries, ears, kidneys, and heart (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency). The protein's role in maintaining mitochondrial ribosome stability is critical for proper mitochondrial function and energy production in cells, which is essential for normal cellular and organismal function (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency). The deficiency of MRPL50 can lead to a decrease in the abundance of mitochondrial complex I, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular energy metabolism (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRPL50 gene are associated with autosomal recessive syndromic premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by amenorrhea and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in women under 40, often leading to infertility. A specific homozygous missense variant, c.335T > A; p.Val112Asp, has been identified in individuals with POI, sensorineural hearing loss, and organ dysfunction, including chronic kidney disease and left ventricular hypertrophy. This variant leads to a loss of MRPL50 protein, destabilizing the mitochondrial ribosome's large subunit and causing a decrease in mitochondrial complex I abundance (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency).

The MRPL50 deficiency is also linked to Perrault syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ovarian dysfunction in females and sensorineural hearing loss in both genders. The deficiency leads to reduced protein stability, impacting mitochondrial ribosome function, which is crucial for ovarian, hearing, kidney, and heart functions (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency).

Research using Drosophila models has shown that MRPL50 mutations can lead to significant reproductive issues, affecting ovarian and testicular development and function, with observed phenotypes including abnormal ovarian structures and impaired fertility (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency).

## Interactions
MRPL50 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically part of the large 39S subunit, and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It interacts with ribosomal RNA and other ribosomal proteins to form the ribosomal complex necessary for mitochondrial translation. The MRPL50 protein is involved in multimer contact, and its interactions are essential for the stability and function of the mitochondrial ribosome. A missense variant in MRPL50, resulting in a Val112Asp substitution, disrupts these interactions by altering the size, charge, and hydrophobicity of the residue, which affects the protein's ability to form a hydrogen bond and salt bridge with serine at position 68. This disruption likely impacts the multimerization process, potentially destabilizing the MRPL50 protein and the mitochondrial ribosome's large subunit (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency).

The deficiency of MRPL50 leads to a significant reduction in the abundance of the protein, which is associated with decreased levels of other proteins linked to the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, such as MRPL13, MRPL44, MRPL39, and MRPL9. This suggests that MRPL50 interacts with these proteins to maintain the stability of the mitochondrial ribosome's large subunit (Bakhshalizadeh2023Deficiency).
