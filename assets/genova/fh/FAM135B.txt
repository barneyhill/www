# FAM135B

## Overview
FAM135B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 135 member B, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein is categorized as a carboxyl ester hydrolase, part of a superfamily of enzymes crucial for maintaining structural integrity and cell-cell adhesion, particularly in the central nervous system (Sheila2019Phenotypic). FAM135B is expressed in the trigeminal motor nucleus, suggesting a role in motor neuron growth and survival, with implications for neurodegenerative conditions when downregulated (Sheila2019Phenotypic). Additionally, FAM135B is implicated in cancer biology, notably in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Wang2020Expression). The gene also holds potential as a biomarker for various diseases, including extrapulmonary tuberculosis and large-cell lung carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Oki2011Novel; Wu2023Wholegenome).

## Function
FAM135B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, FAM135B is associated with hydrolase activity, specifically carboxyl ester hydrolase activity, linking it to a superfamily of genes coding for carboxyesterases. These enzymes are important for maintaining structural integrity and cell-cell adhesion in the central nervous system (Sheila2019Phenotypic). 

FAM135B is expressed in the trigeminal motor nucleus of the brain, which is involved in innervating bulbar muscles. This expression pattern suggests a role in motor neuron growth and survival, as evidenced by studies showing that reduced levels of FAM135B lead to decreased neurite length and motor neuron survival (Sheila2019Phenotypic). The protein's molecular functions are linked to maintaining neuronal health, and its downregulation has been associated with neurodegenerative conditions (Sheila2019Phenotypic).

In the context of cancer, FAM135B expression is associated with tumor development and progression, particularly in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where it promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Wang2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
FAM135B is implicated in several cancers, notably esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). In ESCC, FAM135B is highly expressed, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and radioresistance. Silencing FAM135B enhances radiosensitivity by inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome radioresistance in ESCC (Bi2021Silencing). FAM135B expression is also linked to the progression of esophageal lesions, with increased expression observed from normal epithelium to cancerous tissue, indicating its role in tumor development (Wang2020Expression).

In COAD, FAM135B has been identified as an independent prognostic factor, with higher expression correlating with better survival outcomes. This suggests that FAM135B may have a complex role in different cancer types, potentially serving as a biomarker for prognosis (Wang2022Identification).

FAM135B is also associated with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, where a significant SNP in the gene is linked to the disease, indicating a possible genetic predisposition distinct from pulmonary tuberculosis (Oki2011Novel). In large-cell lung carcinoma, FAM135B mutations are prevalent, suggesting its potential as a molecular marker for diagnosis or prognosis (Wu2023Wholegenome).
