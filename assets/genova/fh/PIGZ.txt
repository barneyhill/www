# PIGZ

## Overview
The PIGZ gene encodes the protein phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class Z, which is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These GPI anchors are glycolipids that tether proteins to the cell membrane, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell adhesion. The PIGZ protein is categorized as an enzyme, specifically functioning in the later stages of GPI anchor biosynthesis. It is part of a complex pathway that ensures the proper attachment of GPI-anchored proteins to the cell surface, which is essential for maintaining cellular integrity and communication (Qiu2020aarFDC).
