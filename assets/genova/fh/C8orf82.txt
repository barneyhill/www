# C8orf82

## Overview
C8orf82 is a gene located on chromosome 8 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 8 open reading frame 82. This protein is primarily localized to the mitochondria and is implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is involved in signal transduction processes during oxidative stress, potentially through its interaction with the mitochondrial genome and proteome (Khorsandi2018An). The protein is characterized by pleckstrin homology, which is significant for nucleotide ligand binding, suggesting its involvement in various signaling pathways. C8orf82 is also associated with the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex, indicating a possible role in electron transfer processes (smith2019comparative). While the full spectrum of its molecular activities is not yet fully understood, C8orf82's involvement in oxidative stress management underscores its importance in cellular integrity and function.

## Function
C8orf82 is involved in managing oxidative stress in healthy human cells. It is associated with the regulation of REDOX balance through its interaction with the mitochondrial genome and proteome. Specifically, the protein encoded by C8orf82 is localized to the mitochondria and is involved in signal transduction during oxidative stress. This function is supported by evidence from protein studies and the Mitocarta2.0 database, which suggests that C8orf82 may play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (Khorsandi2018An).

The protein is also noted to have pleckstrin homology, which is important for nucleotide ligand binding, indicating its potential involvement in various signaling pathways. This suggests that C8orf82 may contribute to cellular processes that require precise regulation of oxidative stress responses, thereby influencing overall cell health and function (Khorsandi2018An).

While the specific molecular activities of C8orf82 in healthy cells are not fully characterized, its role in oxidative stress management highlights its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function. Further research is needed to elucidate its complete range of activities and interactions within the cell.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
C8orf82 is a mitochondrial protein implicated in various interactions related to mitochondrial processes and oxidative stress response. It is associated with the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex, suggesting a role in electron transfer processes. C8orf82 has been identified as potentially interacting with ETFA, a core subunit of the ETF complex, based on experimental associations in the BioGRID database (smith2019comparative). This interaction indicates that C8orf82 may participate in the assembly or function of the ETF complex, although the specific nature of these interactions is not fully detailed.

The protein is also involved in maintaining REDOX balance within mitochondria, a process regulated by miR-296-5p. It is characterized by pleckstrin homology, which suggests its involvement in nucleotide ligand binding and signal transduction during oxidative stress (Khorsandi2018An). While specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented, the evidence points to its participation in interactions related to oxidative stress response, potentially involving ligand binding to nucleotides. The precise roles and interactions of C8orf82 in these processes remain an area of active research.
