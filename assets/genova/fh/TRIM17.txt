# TRIM17

## Overview
TRIM17 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 17, which is a member of the TRIM protein family. This protein is characterized by a tripartite motif that includes a RING domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, followed by a PRY-SPRY domain. TRIM17 functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, and cell proliferation. It is involved in the degradation of specific proteins, such as the antiapoptotic protein MCL1, thereby influencing cell death pathways. TRIM17 also interacts with other TRIM proteins, forming complexes that can modulate their ubiquitin ligase activities. The protein is implicated in various cellular processes and diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, where it can affect protein stability and cellular homeostasis (Meroni2022Cellular; BasuShrivastava2021To; Lassot2010Trim17).

## Structure
TRIM17 is a protein characterized by a tripartite motif, which includes a RING domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, followed by a PRY-SPRY domain at the C-terminus (BasuShrivastava2021To; Lassot2010Trim17). The RING domain is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrates (BasuShrivastava2021To). The B-box domains are zinc-finger domains with conserved cysteine and histidine residues, important for the protein's function (BasuShrivastava2021To). The coiled-coil domain is involved in forming high molecular weight complexes through homo- and hetero-interactions (BasuShrivastava2021To).

TRIM17 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the full-length protein consisting of 477 amino acids. Truncated isoforms with 343 and 267 amino acids have been experimentally confirmed (BasuShrivastava2021To). The protein's ability to form homo- and hetero-dimers is facilitated by its coiled-coil region, although the specific domains involved in these interactions are not fully understood (BasuShrivastava2021To). TRIM17 can form inactive hetero-complexes with other TRIM proteins, inhibiting their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (BasuShrivastava2021To; Meroni2022Cellular). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in cellular processes such as apoptosis and autophagy (BasuShrivastava2021To).

## Function
TRIM17 is a member of the TRIM protein family, characterized by a RING domain, B-box, and coiled-coil domain, which confer its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. In healthy human cells, TRIM17 is involved in regulating apoptosis, autophagy, and cell proliferation. It plays a significant role in apoptosis by promoting the degradation of the antiapoptotic protein MCL1, thereby facilitating cell death through the intrinsic pathway (BasuShrivastava2021To). TRIM17 also interacts with other TRIM family proteins, forming inactive hetero-oligomers that inhibit their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, thus regulating protein stability and degradation (BasuShrivastava2021To).

TRIM17's role in autophagy involves recruiting autophagic factors to specific cellular locations, limiting autophagosome formation, and influencing the selective degradation of cellular components (BasuShrivastava2021To). It also modulates transcriptional regulation by interacting with transcription factors such as NFATc3 and ZSCAN21, affecting their stability and activity (BasuShrivastava2021To). TRIM17 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it responds to cellular stress by modulating these critical processes, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (BasuShrivastava2021To).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TRIM17 gene are implicated in several diseases, notably neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In Parkinson's disease (PD), TRIM17 is involved in the regulation of α-synuclein expression, a protein linked to neurodegeneration. Overexpression of TRIM17 increases α-synuclein levels, while silencing it reduces these levels. Genetic variations such as TRIM17p.R78W and TRIM17p.T407N have been identified in PD patients, potentially affecting the TRIM17/TRIM41/ZSCAN21 pathway and impairing protein interactions (BasuShrivastava2021To; Lassot2018The). 

In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), de novo mutations in TRIM17, including an insertion before the PRY-SPRY domain and a missense variation TRIM17p.R159T, have been linked to the disorder. These mutations affect domains crucial for TRIM17's activity, suggesting altered function (BasuShrivastava2021To).

TRIM17 also plays a role in cancer, where its expression is altered in tumors such as osteosarcoma and breast invasive carcinomas. Higher TRIM17 expression correlates with better survival in breast cancer, suggesting its potential as a prognostic indicator. TRIM17's involvement in regulating antiapoptotic proteins like MCL1 and BCL2A1 contributes to chemoresistance in cancers (BasuShrivastava2021To).

## Interactions
TRIM17, a member of the TRIM protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with several TRIM proteins, particularly those with a PRY-SPRY domain, such as TRIM39, TRIM41, TRIM5alpha, and TRIM22. TRIM17 also interacts with TRIM28 and TRIM44, which belong to different TRIM subgroups. These interactions have been identified through methods like yeast two-hybrid assays and coimmunoprecipitation (BasuShrivastava2021To).

TRIM17 can inhibit the E3 ubiquitin ligase activities of TRIM28, TRIM39, and TRIM41 by forming inactive hetero-oligomers, which may prevent these proteins from binding to E2 enzymes or substrates (BasuShrivastava2021To). It also interacts with ZSCAN21, a transcription factor, and inhibits its degradation by TRIM41, thereby stabilizing ZSCAN21 and increasing its protein level (Lassot2018The).

TRIM17's interaction with NFATc3 and NFATc4 prevents their nuclear translocation, reducing their transcriptional activity. This interaction is dependent on SUMOylation for NFATc3 but not for NFATc4 (BasuShrivastava2021To). Additionally, TRIM17 interacts with the RBM38 protein, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which is crucial for maintaining cisplatin resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (Zhong2023TRIM17mediated).
