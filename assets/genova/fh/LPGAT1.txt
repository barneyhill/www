# LPGAT1

## Overview
LPGAT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase 1, which is integral to lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an acyltransferase and is primarily involved in the remodeling of phospholipids, specifically catalyzing the acylation of lysophosphatidylglycerol to form phosphatidylglycerol, a critical component of mitochondrial membranes (Yang2004Identification). The LPGAT1 protein is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondrial-associated membrane, where it plays a vital role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and membrane integrity (Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Yang2004Identification). The gene is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the liver and placenta, and exists in two splice isoforms, which may contribute to its functional diversity (Yang2004Identification). LPGAT1's activity is crucial for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a phospholipid essential for heart function, and its dysregulation is implicated in several metabolic and cancer-related diseases (Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Shindou2013Generation).

## Structure
The human LPGAT1 gene encodes a protein that is 370 amino acids long, with a predicted molecular weight of 43 kDa. The protein features a 23-amino acid signal-anchor domain at the N terminus, which is indicative of its membrane-bound nature, specifically associating with the endoplasmic reticulum (Yang2004Identification). LPGAT1 includes motifs that are conserved among the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) family, suggesting a functional role similar to GPAT enzymes (Yang2004Identification). 

The LPGAT1 protein has a potential N-linked glycosylation site at position 209, although studies have suggested that the protein is expressed as a nonglycosylated form (Yang2004Identification). The enzyme is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, as confirmed by co-localization studies with the ER marker calnexin (Yang2004Identification). 

LPGAT1 mRNA is expressed in two splice isoforms of 7.5 and 9.5 kb, with the highest expression levels observed in the liver and placenta (Yang2004Identification). These isoforms may contribute to the enzyme's functional diversity across different tissues. The protein's structure and localization are crucial for its role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the remodeling of phosphatidylglycerol.

## Function
LPGAT1 (lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, specifically in the remodeling of phospholipids. It catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) to form phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a key component of mitochondrial membranes. This process is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in cells (Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Yang2004Identification).

LPGAT1 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondrial-associated membrane, where it contributes to cellular lipid homeostasis and membrane integrity (Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Yang2004Identification). The enzyme exhibits a preference for long-chain saturated fatty acyl-CoAs and oleoyl-CoA as acyl donors, which are used in the reacylation of LPG to PG (Shindou2013Generation; Yang2004Identification).

The activity of LPGAT1 is crucial for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a dimeric glycerophospholipid essential for normal heart function. Defective cardiolipin is associated with Barth syndrome, a condition that leads to cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy (Shindou2013Generation). LPGAT1's role in the synthesis of PG, a precursor for cardiolipin, suggests its involvement in maintaining healthy cellular membranes and potentially influencing heart health (Shindou2013Generation).

## Clinical Significance
LPGAT1 is implicated in several disease states due to its role in lipid metabolism. Alterations in LPGAT1 expression are associated with obesity, as its knockout in mice fed a high-fat diet leads to insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis. Reduced LPGAT1 activity results in lipid accumulation in the liver, causing hepatofibrosis under a high-fat diet (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). In cancer, LPGAT1 expression is increased in lung adenocarcinoma tumors, correlating with a worse prognosis. It is part of a five-gene metabolic signature associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients (Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Zhang2020Identification). Studies have shown that LPGAT1 is involved in tumor cell proliferation, and its expression is linked to poor outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma (Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Yu2020Identification).

LPGAT1 is also linked to 3-methylglutaconic aciduria with deafness, encephalopathy, and Leigh-like (MEGDEL) syndrome, caused by mutations in genes responsible for phosphatidylglycerol remodeling, including SERAC1 (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LPGAT1 in metabolic and cancer-related diseases.
