# LHFPL4

## Overview
LHFPL4 is a gene that encodes the protein LHFPL tetraspan subfamily member 4, which is characterized by its four transmembrane domains. This protein functions as an auxiliary subunit of the GABAA receptor, a critical component in the regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. LHFPL4 is particularly involved in the synaptic localization and function of the α1β2γ2 subtype of GABAA receptors, forming a complex with Neuroligin 2 to facilitate this process. The protein is predominantly localized at inhibitory synapses, where it plays a crucial role in anchoring γ2-containing GABAA receptors, thereby ensuring effective synaptic transmission. Disruptions in the LHFPL4 gene or its protein product have been associated with neurological disorders such as epilepsy and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its importance in maintaining synaptic integrity and normal brain function (Chen2024Proteome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the LHFPL4 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. These conditions arise due to disruptions in normal synaptic processes, which are crucial for proper neuronal communication. Changes in the expression levels of LHFPL4 or its interactions can lead to significant impairments in synaptic function, contributing to the pathophysiology of these disorders. The protein encoded by LHFPL4 plays a vital role in maintaining synaptic integrity, and any deviation from its normal function can result in neurological deficits. Research has shown that such genetic alterations can have profound effects on cognitive and neurological health, underscoring the clinical significance of LHFPL4 in maintaining normal brain function.

## Interactions
LHFPL4 is a four transmembrane-domain protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of the GABAA receptor. It forms a stable tripartite complex with the GABAA receptor by interacting with Neuroligin 2. This interaction is crucial for the synaptic localization and function of GABAA receptors, particularly the α1β2γ2 subtype, which is the major subtype involved in LHFPL4 binding. Other subunits such as α2 and β3 also interact with LHFPL4 in a heterologous expression system. Although a direct interaction between LHFPL4 and the γ2 subunit is not confirmed, reduced levels of LHFPL4 and Neuroligin 2 are observed in γ2-deficient cerebellar granule cells, suggesting an intimate association between γ2-containing GABAA receptors and LHFPL4 (Chen2024Proteome).

LHFPL4 is enriched at inhibitory synapses, particularly at gephyrin-containing inhibitory synapses, indicating its postsynaptic localization. In LHFPL4-deficient neurons, γ2-containing GABAA receptors are not synaptically anchored, leading to a loss of GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. However, there is no observed disruption in the cell surface expression level of GABAA receptors or their sensitivity to agonists and antagonists (Chen2024Proteome). LHFPL4 was also used as a positive control for GABAA receptor interaction in studies, confirming its interaction with GABAA receptors (Chen2024Proteome).
