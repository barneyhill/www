# NEK10

## Overview
NEK10 is a gene that encodes the protein NIMA-related kinase 10, a member of the serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase family. This kinase is involved in various cellular processes, including mitochondrial function, DNA damage response, and cell cycle regulation. NEK10 plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function by phosphorylating key mitochondrial proteins, thereby influencing oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiration. Additionally, NEK10 is integral to the DNA damage response, particularly through its regulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which it phosphorylates to modulate transcriptional activity. The protein also participates in cell signaling pathways, such as the MEK/ERK pathway, and is involved in the regulation of β-catenin turnover. Clinically, NEK10 has been implicated in cancer susceptibility and primary ciliary dyskinesia, highlighting its significance in both oncogenesis and ciliopathy-related conditions (Al2020Homozygous; de2024NEK10; Haider2020NEK10).

## Structure
NEK10 is a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase that belongs to the NIMA-related kinase (Nek) family. The protein has a molecular weight of 133 kDa, with a shorter isoform of 80 kDa enriched in mitochondria (de2024NEK10). NEK10 is composed of 1,125 amino acids and features a centrally located catalytic domain, which is distinct from the N-terminal kinase domains found in other Nek kinases (Moniz2011Nek10). The protein structure includes four N-terminal armadillo repeats, which are likely involved in protein-protein interactions, and coiled-coil repeats near the kinase domain (de2024NEK10). A putative PEST sequence is located near the C terminus, which may be involved in protein degradation (Moniz2011Nek10).

NEK10 is involved in various cellular processes, including the phosphorylation of proteins such as p53 and the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) in muscle cells (de2024NEK10). It also plays a role in mitochondrial homeostasis, affecting mitochondrial morphology and function (de2024NEK10). The protein's kinase activity is crucial for its function, particularly its tyrosine kinase activity, which is essential for regulating p53 transcriptional activity (Haider2020NEK10).

## Function
NEK10 is a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and morphology in healthy human cells. It is involved in the phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins, which is essential for mitochondrial respiration and function. NEK10 affects the phosphorylation status of proteins such as HSP60, TOM20, and NDUFB4, which are important for mitochondrial protein import and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (de2024NEK10). The absence of NEK10 leads to impaired mitochondrial respiration, decreased oxygen consumption rates, and altered mitochondrial morphology, including increased mitochondrial fragmentation (de2024NEK10).

NEK10 also plays a role in the DNA damage response by regulating the transcriptional activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53 through tyrosine phosphorylation. This phosphorylation is crucial for the expression of p53-responsive genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and DNA repair (Haider2020NEK10). NEK10's function in phosphorylating p53 helps modulate the p53-dependent transcriptional output, influencing cellular proliferation and sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (Haider2020NEK10).

In addition to its mitochondrial and DNA damage response roles, NEK10 is involved in the regulation of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint following UV irradiation, contributing to the cellular mechanisms that control this checkpoint (Moniz2011Nek10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NEK10 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). In cancer, NEK10 is associated with breast cancer susceptibility. Genome-wide association studies have identified NEK10 as a strong breast cancer susceptibility locus, and mutations in NEK10 have been reported in various cancers, including ovarian, lung, and stomach cancers (Moniz2011Nek; Moniz2011Nek10). NEK10 supports the tumor suppressor protein p53's transcriptional activity through phosphorylation. Loss of NEK10 leads to an impaired p53 response, resulting in increased cellular proliferation and sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, which may influence cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Haider2020NEK10).

In primary ciliary dyskinesia, a homozygous truncating mutation in NEK10 has been linked to the disorder, characterized by abnormal ciliary structure and function. This mutation results in pathologically short motile cilia, affecting mucociliary transport and leading to respiratory issues such as recurrent infections and bronchiectasis (Al2020Homozygous). These findings highlight NEK10's role in both oncogenesis and ciliopathy-related conditions.

## Interactions
NEK10, a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase, participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with components of the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) systems, affecting the phosphorylation status of proteins such as HSP60, TOM20, and NDUFB4, which are crucial for mitochondrial function (de2024NEK10). NEK10 also interacts with proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, including NDUFS1, ATP5J, and UQCR10, suggesting a role in mitochondrial metabolism and energy production (Basei2024The).

In the context of cell signaling, NEK10 forms a ternary complex with Raf-1 and MEK1, which is essential for MEK/ERK activation in response to UV irradiation. This interaction is crucial for MEK1 autophosphorylation and subsequent ERK signaling (Moniz2011Nek10). NEK10 also phosphorylates β-catenin at Tyr30, promoting its degradation through GSK3-mediated phosphorylation, and associates with the Axin complex, impacting β-catenin turnover (Dutt2022NEK10).

Additionally, NEK10 phosphorylates p53 at tyrosine 327, enhancing its transcriptional activity and playing a role in the DNA damage response (Haider2020NEK10). These interactions highlight NEK10's involvement in regulating mitochondrial function, cell cycle progression, and stress responses.
