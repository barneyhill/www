# TTR

## Overview
The TTR gene encodes transthyretin, a tetrameric transport protein primarily synthesized in the liver and choroid plexus. Transthyretin is classified as a transport protein due to its role in the systemic circulation of thyroxine (T4) and retinol (vitamin A) by forming complexes with retinol-binding protein (RBP) (Magalhães2021The; Vieira2014Transthyretin:). The protein's quaternary structure, a homotetramer, is crucial for its stability and function, as dissociation into monomers can lead to amyloid fibril formation, implicated in various amyloidosis conditions (Sanguinetti2022The). Transthyretin also plays a significant role in neuroprotection and metabolic processes, interacting with several receptors and proteins, including amyloid β peptide, which is relevant in Alzheimer's disease (Magalhães2021The; Costa2008Transthyretin). Mutations in the TTR gene are linked to hereditary amyloidosis, while wild-type transthyretin can lead to senile systemic amyloidosis, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene and its protein product (Ruberg2012Transthyretin; Sekijima2015Transthyretin).

## Structure
Transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric protein with a molecular mass of 55 kDa, composed of four identical monomers, each approximately 14 kDa. The primary structure of TTR consists of 127 amino acids, with a 20 amino acid signal peptide that is cleaved to produce the mature monomer (Sanguinetti2022The). Each monomer is structured with eight β-strands, labeled A to H, and a short α-helix between strands E and F. These β-strands are connected by loops and form two groups of twisted β-sheets: the inner β-sheet consists of strands D, A, G, and H, while the outer β-sheet consists of strands C, B, E, and F, arranged orthogonally (He2021The; Sanguinetti2022The).

The quaternary structure of TTR is a tetramer, organized as a dimer of dimers, stabilized by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions at the dimer-dimer interface. This structure includes two cylindrical hydrophobic channels capable of accommodating thyroxine (T4) molecules, with a 100-fold difference in binding constants due to negative cooperativity (Sanguinetti2022The). The tetramer also has four putative binding sites for retinol-binding protein on its external surface (Sanguinetti2022The). The stability of the tetramer is crucial, as its dissociation into monomers can lead to misfolding and aggregation into amyloid fibrils, causing transthyretin amyloidosis (Sanguinetti2022The).

## Function
Transthyretin (TTR) is a tetrameric protein primarily synthesized in the liver and choroid plexus, playing a crucial role in transporting thyroxine (T4) and retinol (vitamin A) throughout the body and brain. TTR forms a complex with retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transport retinol and is the main carrier of T4 in cerebrospinal fluid, carrying 80% of the hormone (Magalhães2021The; Vieira2014Transthyretin:). TTR is involved in the regulation of calcium dynamics and electrical activity in pancreatic β-cells, enhancing insulin secretion in response to glucose (Refai2005Transthyretin). It also plays a neuroprotective role, contributing to neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, and protection against conditions like cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer's disease (Magalhães2021The). TTR interacts with several receptors, including megalin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1-R), which are involved in neuronal plasticity and synaptic activity (Magalhães2021The). In cell metabolism, TTR is involved in the metabolic reprogramming of myeloid lineage cells and stimulates glycolysis in astrocytes, enhancing ATP synthesis (Magalhães2021The). These functions highlight TTR's importance in maintaining cellular health and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTR gene are associated with several forms of amyloidosis, a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in tissues. Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is caused by single point mutations in the TTR gene, leading to conditions such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC), and familial leptomeningeal amyloidosis. FAP is often linked to the Val30Met mutation, resulting in neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction, while FAC is commonly associated with the Val122Ile mutation, leading to cardiac issues like heart failure and arrhythmias (Bezerra2020Modulation; Sekijima2015Transthyretin).

Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis, also known as senile systemic amyloidosis, occurs without genetic mutations and is prevalent in the elderly, often presenting with cardiac symptoms and carpal tunnel syndrome (Koike2020Transthyretin; Sekijima2015Transthyretin). The pathogenesis involves the destabilization of the TTR tetramer, leading to the formation of amyloid fibrils (Ruberg2012Transthyretin). Therapeutic strategies include TTR tetramer stabilizers like tafamidis and diflunisal, as well as gene-silencing agents such as patisiran and inotersen, which aim to reduce TTR synthesis and stabilize the disease (Bezerra2020Modulation; Koike2020Transthyretin).

## Interactions
Transthyretin (TTR) is known for its interactions with various proteins, playing significant roles in physiological and pathological processes. TTR binds to thyroxine (T4) and retinol-binding protein (RBP), facilitating their transport in the bloodstream (Magalhães2021The). It also interacts with apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), forming complexes with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) through ApoA-I, but not with ApoA-II (Sousa2000Transthyretin).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, TTR interacts with amyloid β peptide (Aβ), binding to and cleaving it, which reduces Aβ fibrillogenesis and toxicity. This interaction is significant for neuroprotection and Aβ clearance from the brain (Magalhães2021The; Costa2008Transthyretin). TTR's binding to Aβ is enhanced by small-molecule chaperones like iododiflunisal (IDIF), which improve the binding affinity and reduce Aβ aggregation (Cotrina2020Calorimetric).

TTR also exhibits proteolytic activity, cleaving the C-terminus of ApoA-I, which influences cholesterol efflux and amyloidogenic potential (Magalhães2021The). Additionally, TTR interacts with neuropeptide Y (NPY) and other substrates in the nervous system, contributing to its role as a zinc-dependent metalloprotease (Magalhães2021The).
