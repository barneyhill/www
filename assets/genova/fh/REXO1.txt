# REXO1

## Overview
REXO1 (RNA exonuclease 1 homolog) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the critical cellular processes of RNA processing and degradation. The protein, categorized as an exonuclease, is responsible for removing nucleotides from the ends of RNA molecules, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining RNA quality control and processing ribosomal RNA. This function is essential for regulating RNA stability, which impacts gene expression and cellular homeostasis. REXO1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to RNA maturation and turnover, ensuring the integrity and stability of RNA molecules. This activity is crucial for the proper functioning of cellular processes and overall cellular health. The gene's involvement in RNA processing highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Zhang2021CircCCDC66).

## Function
REXO1 (RNA exonuclease 1 homolog) is a gene encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in RNA processing and degradation. As an exonuclease, REXO1 removes nucleotides from the ends of RNA molecules, a function essential for maintaining RNA quality control and processing ribosomal RNA. This activity is vital for regulating RNA stability, which in turn impacts gene expression and cellular homeostasis. REXO1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it participates in RNA maturation and turnover, ensuring the proper functioning of cellular processes by maintaining the integrity and stability of RNA molecules. This role is critical for the overall health and function of cells, as it influences the expression of genes and the stability of RNA, which are fundamental to cellular and organismal homeostasis. The precise mechanisms by which REXO1 contributes to these processes in healthy human cells are not detailed in the provided context, but its general function as an RNA exonuclease is well-established (Zhang2021CircCCDC66).

## Clinical Significance
REXO1 has been implicated in the progression of cervical cancer through its interaction with circ-CCDC66 and miR-452-5p. In cervical cancer tissues, circ-CCDC66 is upregulated and acts as a molecular sponge for miR-452-5p, a microRNA that typically suppresses REXO1 expression. This sponging effect leads to the upregulation of REXO1, which promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting its oncogenic role in cervical cancer (Zhang2021CircCCDC66). The study by Zhang et al. demonstrates that miR-452-5p is downregulated in cervical cancer tissues, and its interaction with REXO1 is crucial for the cancer's progression. Overexpression of REXO1 is associated with advanced tumor stages and larger tumor sizes, suggesting its significant role in cervical cancer pathogenesis (Zhang2021CircCCDC66). The circ-CCDC66/miR-452-5p/REXO1 axis is identified as a potential target for therapeutic intervention, as downregulation of circ-CCDC66 has been shown to suppress tumor growth in vivo (Zhang2021CircCCDC66). These findings underscore the clinical significance of REXO1 in cervical cancer and its potential as a biomarker or target for treatment strategies.

## Interactions
REXO1, a protein involved in RNA processing, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It shares a common domain architecture with Rex3, including a KIX domain and a CHORD domain, which are involved in protein interactions. The KIX domain in REXO1 is structurally homologous to the KIX domain known for mediating interactions with transcription factors, suggesting that REXO1 may compete with TFIIS for binding to RNA polymerase II, potentially influencing transcription termination and 3' processing (Daniels2024Conserved).

In the context of cervical cancer, REXO1 is regulated by the circ-CCDC66/miR-452-5p axis. Circ-CCDC66 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-452-5p, which directly targets REXO1. This interaction results in the upregulation of REXO1 expression, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhang2021CircCCDC66). The study by Zhang et al. utilized various experimental techniques, including RNA pull-down assays and dual luciferase assays, to demonstrate the regulatory interaction between miR-452-5p and the 3'UTR of REXO1, highlighting its role in cervical cancer progression (Zhang2021CircCCDC66).
