# DISP3

## Overview
DISP3 is a gene that encodes the protein dispatched RND transporter family member 3, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within neural stem cells (NSCs). The protein is characterized by the presence of a sterol-sensing domain (SSD), linking it to cholesterol homeostasis and signaling pathways crucial for neurogenesis (Konířová2017Modulated). DISP3 plays a significant role in the regulation of NSC proliferation and differentiation, maintaining the balance between these processes by modulating the expression of neural-specific markers (Konířová2017Modulated). Additionally, DISP3 is involved in lipid metabolism and the distribution of hedgehog ligands, which are essential for proper neural development and tissue patterning (Konířová2017Modulated). The gene's expression and function have implications in various diseases, including medulloblastoma and congenital Zika syndrome, highlighting its importance in both normal development and disease states (Konířová2017Modulated; Borda2021Wholeexome).

## Structure


## Function
The DISP3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in neural stem cell (NSC) biology, particularly in the processes of proliferation and differentiation. DISP3 is highly expressed in undifferentiated NSCs and its expression decreases as these cells differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Konířová2017Modulated). The protein contains a sterol-sensing domain (SSD), suggesting a link to cholesterol homeostasis and signaling, which are important for normal neurogenesis (Konířová2017Modulated).

In NSCs, DISP3 influences cell fate decisions by modulating the expression of neural-specific markers. Overexpression of DISP3 enhances NSC proliferation and maintains their undifferentiated state, while reduced expression leads to increased differentiation into neurons and astrocytes, as indicated by elevated levels of β III-tubulin and GFAP mRNA (Konířová2017Modulated). This regulation of differentiation markers suggests that DISP3 helps maintain NSC 'stemness' (Konířová2017Modulated).

DISP3 is also involved in lipid metabolism, which is essential for brain development and NSC proliferation (Konířová2017Modulated). The protein's activity in the cell membrane facilitates the release and distribution of hedgehog ligands, influencing cell differentiation and tissue patterning. This function is critical for proper neural development and maintaining the balance between NSC proliferation and differentiation (Konířová2017Modulated).

## Clinical Significance
DISP3 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in neural stem cell fate and tumorigenesis. Alterations in DISP3 expression are associated with medulloblastoma, a type of brain cancer. The gene is particularly elevated in aggressive non-SHH/WNT subtypes of medulloblastoma, which are characterized by markers found in neural cancer stem cells. This suggests a potential role for DISP3 in tumorigenesis, as its overexpression promotes proliferation and alters tumorigenic gene expression in cerebellar progenitor cells (Konířová2017Modulated).

In the context of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), DISP3 has shown a strong protective effect under a dominant model, with a significant association for the rs2076469 variant. This suggests that certain mutations in DISP3 may confer protection against CZS, although further investigation is needed due to the small sample size of the study (Borda2021Wholeexome).

DISP3 is also recurrently mutated in duodenal adenomas from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), indicating its potential role as a driver in duodenal tumorigenesis (Thomas2017Burden).
