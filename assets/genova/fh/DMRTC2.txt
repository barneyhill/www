# DMRTC2

## Overview
DMRTC2 is a gene that encodes the DMRT-like family C2 protein, which plays a significant role in sexual reproduction processes, including sexual differentiation and gametogenesis. The protein is characterized by a highly conserved DM domain, a zinc-finger DNA-binding motif, which is essential for its function in these biological processes (Li2020Cloning). The DMRTC2 protein is predominantly composed of random coil structures and lacks transmembrane regions, indicating it is not membrane-bound (Li2020Cloning). It contains multiple potential phosphorylation sites, suggesting that its activity may be regulated through post-translational modifications (Li2020Cloning). The gene has been implicated in male germ cell development and is associated with conditions such as cryptorchidism-induced infertility, highlighting its clinical significance (GegenschatzSchmid2017DMRTC2). Additionally, DMRTC2 has been studied in the context of cancer biology, particularly as a cancer-testis gene, although its expression is primarily restricted to the testis in patient samples (Almutairi2024Differential).

## Structure
The DMRTC2 protein in Tibetan sheep is composed of 370 amino acids and features a highly conserved DM domain, a zinc-finger DNA-binding motif consisting of 47 amino acids, which is crucial for its role in sexual reproduction processes such as sexual differentiation and gametogenesis (Li2020Cloning). The protein's secondary structure is predominantly random coil (73.24%), with smaller proportions of α-helix (13.53%), extended strand (11.35%), and β-turn (1.89%) (Li2020Cloning). The tertiary structure aligns with the secondary structure, incorporating these elements (Li2020Cloning).

The DMRTC2 protein lacks predicted transmembrane regions and signal peptide sequences, indicating it is likely not membrane-bound (Li2020Cloning). It contains a DMRT-like domain of 125 amino acids, which is conserved among mammals, located at residues 244-368 (Li2020Cloning). The protein has 34 potential phosphorylation sites, including 22 serine and 12 threonine sites, suggesting post-translational modifications that may regulate its function (Li2020Cloning). The isoelectric point of the protein is 9.2, and it has a molecular weight of 39.24 kDa (Li2020Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
The DMRTC2 gene is implicated in male germ cell development and has been studied in the context of cryptorchidism-induced infertility. Cryptorchidism, a condition where one or both testes fail to descend, can lead to infertility if untreated. Research indicates that DMRTC2 is involved in the testosterone-dependent transition from gonocytes to Ad spermatogonia, a critical process in male germ cell development. Alterations in DMRTC2 expression have been associated with defective mini-puberty, characterized by insufficient testosterone secretion, which impairs this transition. Treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) like Buserelin can induce the differentiation of gonocytes into Ad spermatogonia, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for DMRTC2 in preventing infertility in males with cryptorchidism (GegenschatzSchmid2017DMRTC2).

In the context of cancer, DMRTC2 has been studied as a cancer-testis (CT) gene in colon cancer tissues. Although DMRTC2 expression was not detected in colon cancer tissues, it was shown to be reactivated in colon cancer cell lines following treatment with epigenetic drugs, indicating its potential role in cancer biology. However, its expression was restricted to the testis in patient samples, suggesting it may not serve as a biomarker for colon cancer (Almutairi2024Differential).
