# SFXN3

## Overview
SFXN3 is a gene that encodes the protein sideroflexin 3, a member of the sideroflexin family, which is primarily localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane transporter, with a predicted structure comprising five transmembrane domains, facilitating its role in mitochondrial serine transport and one-carbon metabolism. These processes are vital for cellular biosynthesis, particularly in neurons, where SFXN3 is highly expressed. The gene is developmentally regulated and expressed in various tissues, including the brain, liver, kidney, and placenta. Sideroflexin 3 is implicated in several cellular pathways, including those related to synaptic morphology and cancer cell proliferation, and is associated with conditions such as retinal degeneration due to its role in mitochondrial function and synaptic integrity (Rivell2019Sideroflexin; Attwood2021Characterization; Chen2020Forward).

## Structure
The SFXN3 protein is a member of the sideroflexin family and is characterized by its localization in the mitochondria, specifically the inner mitochondrial membrane (Attwood2021Characterization). It is predicted to have five transmembrane domains, a structural feature typical of mitochondrial transporters (Yoshikumi2005Roles). The protein consists of 321 amino acids and includes a terminal tail that extends into the mitochondrial matrix, followed by the transmembrane domains, and a 35-amino acid C-terminal tail in the intermembrane space (Chen2020Forward).

The SFXN3 protein is involved in mitochondrial serine transport and one-carbon metabolism, which are crucial for cellular biosynthesis (Attwood2021Characterization). It is also a downstream target of α-synuclein in synapses, playing a role in regulating synaptic morphology (Attwood2021Characterization). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, liver, kidney, and placenta, with developmental expression noted in neurons (Attwood2021Characterization).

SFXN3 has multiple isoforms produced by differential splicing, with the longest isoform containing a 101-amino acid N-terminal region (Chen2020Forward). The F78S mutation affects the N-terminal tail and is adjacent to the conserved His-Pro-Asp-Thr (HPDT) motif, potentially altering the protein's structure and function (Chen2020Forward).

## Function
Sideroflexin 3 (SFXN3) is a mitochondrial protein that plays a significant role in serine transport during one-carbon metabolism, which is crucial for nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. This process is essential for cell growth and proliferation, particularly in neurons where SFXN3 is enriched (Rivell2019Sideroflexin). SFXN3 is developmentally expressed in the brain, with increasing levels from birth to maturity, especially in the cortex and hippocampus, and is more abundant in neurons than in astrocytes (Rivell2019Sideroflexin).

SFXN3 is involved in mitochondrial serine import, a function it shares with SFXN1, suggesting potential functional redundancy in serine transport (Tifoun2021Insights). The protein is localized to mitochondria in all major neuronal compartments, including synapses, and is present in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Rivell2019Sideroflexin). SFXN3's role in serine metabolism may also be significant for cancer growth, as serine is necessary for purine production (Rivell2019Sideroflexin).

In pancreatic islet cells, SFXN3 is expressed in mitochondria and may be involved in mitochondrial function and metabolic regulation, although its specific role in insulin secretion remains unclear (Yoshikumi2005Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SFXN3 gene have been associated with retinal degeneration. In mice, SFXN3 mutations lead to significant thinning of the outer retinal layers and retinal pigment epithelium, resulting in progressive outer retinal degeneration. This is evidenced by a reduction in outer nuclear layer thickness and disruptions in synaptic ribbons, which are crucial for photoreceptor-to-inner nuclear layer cell synapses (Chen2020Forward). The study identified two specific mutations, pew and basilica, which are linked to these degenerative changes (Chen2020Forward).

SFXN3 is also implicated in synaptic function and mitochondrial transport pathways, suggesting its role in maintaining retinal health. Despite the absence of SFXN3 expression in rods and cones, photoreceptor degeneration occurs, possibly due to dysfunctional synapses (Chen2020Forward). The gene's expression in various retinal cell types, including bipolar and retinal ganglion cells, further supports its involvement in retinal structure and function (Chen2020Forward).

While SFXN3's role in other diseases is not detailed, its involvement in mitochondrial transport and synaptic morphology suggests potential links to neurological conditions (Tifoun2022A). However, specific diseases or conditions associated with SFXN3 mutations or expression changes beyond retinal degeneration are not extensively documented.

## Interactions
Sideroflexin 3 (SFXN3) is a mitochondrial protein that plays a role in serine metabolism and is involved in various cellular processes, including cancer cell proliferation. SFXN3 is known to interact with pathways involving CyclinD1 (CCND1) and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NFKB1), which are crucial for cell cycle regulation and survival. Knockdown of SFXN3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines results in decreased expression of CCND1 and NFKB1, suggesting that SFXN3 may promote cell proliferation through the NF-κB1-activated CCND1-CDK4 signaling pathway (Jin2024SFXN3).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), SFXN3 is implicated in the regulation of immune cell infiltration and drug resistance. It is part of a regulatory mechanism involving the LINC01270/hsa-miR-29c-3p/SFXN3 axis, where LINC01270 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. This axis suggests a potential interaction between SFXN3 and non-coding RNAs, influencing its expression and contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment (Chen2022Noncoding).
