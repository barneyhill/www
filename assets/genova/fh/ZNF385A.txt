# ZNF385A

## Overview
ZNF385A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 385A, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by their ability to bind nucleic acids. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of mRNA export and stability, playing a crucial role in gene expression and cellular homeostasis. ZNF385A interacts with key proteins such as p53, influencing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and is implicated in various signaling pathways, including the p53 signaling pathway. Its activity is predominantly nuclear, where it affects transcriptional regulation. The protein's interactions and regulatory functions make it significant in the context of cancer biology, as it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer (Peng2023ZNF385A; HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C; Dassi2017Handshakes).

## Function
ZNF385A, also known as Hzf, is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of mRNA export, which is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function. It cooperates with other RNA-binding proteins, such as ELAVL1 (HuR), to co-regulate the nuclear export of p53 in an RNA-dependent manner. This cooperation highlights its involvement in maintaining mRNA stability and processing, essential for gene expression regulation in healthy human cells (Dassi2017Handshakes).

ZNF385A is also involved in the p53 signaling pathway, where it can facilitate p53-mediated cell cycle arrest by activating the expression of p21 cip1/waf1 in response to stress. This activity is mediated by direct binding to p53, indicating its role in controlling cell cycle progression and apoptosis (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C).

The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional activity. Its involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in normal cellular function and development, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and cellular homeostasis (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C; Dassi2017Handshakes).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF385A has been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In HCC, high expression of ZNF385A is associated with poor overall survival and is linked to an inflamed immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which may contribute to resistance to immunotherapy (Peng2023ZNF385A). The gene is also overexpressed in HBV-infected HCC patients, suggesting a role in HBV-related inflammation and liver carcinogenesis (Peng2023ZNF385A).

In CRC, ZNF385A is part of a gene signature associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance. It is involved in cancer progression and contributes to an immunosuppressive environment, facilitating tumor growth and immune evasion (Liu2024Identification; Zhang2022Cancerassociated).

In LUSC, ZNF385A is upregulated and interacts with TP53, promoting growth arrest. This interaction suggests a role in the pathogenesis and progression of LUSC, potentially impacting patient prognosis and treatment strategies (Wang2021P59.07; Zhang2021P59.05).

ZNF385A also interacts with microRNAs, such as hsa-mir-24, which may play a role in the molecular network associated with malaria infection (Oboh2022Transcriptomic).

## Interactions
ZNF385A, a zinc finger protein, is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with the tumor suppressor protein p53. ZNF385A regulates the expression of p53 downstream genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in cancer initiation and progression (Peng2023ZNF385A). This interaction is crucial for facilitating cell cycle arrest by activating p21 cip1/waf1 in response to stress, although it does not affect pro-apoptotic target genes (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C).

In addition to its interaction with p53, ZNF385A also cooperates with ELAVL1 (HuR) in the context of nuclear export. This interaction is RNA-dependent and highlights ZNF385A's role in post-transcriptional regulation, particularly in the co-regulation of p53 export (Dassi2017Handshakes). The protein's involvement in these interactions underscores its potential as a therapeutic target, especially in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, where its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Peng2023ZNF385A). These interactions illustrate the multifaceted role of ZNF385A in cellular regulation and its potential impact on cancer therapy.
