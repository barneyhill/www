# CD2AP

## Overview
CD2AP, or CD2-associated protein, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and membrane trafficking. The CD2AP protein is characterized by its three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which facilitate interactions with other proteins and play a crucial role in signal transduction and cytoskeletal dynamics (Agback2019Structural; Li2000CD2AP). It is particularly significant in the maintenance of podocyte structure in the kidneys and has been implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis due to its role in cellular signaling and structural integrity (Yaddanapudi2012CD2AP; Hollingworth2011Common). The protein's ability to form higher-order oligomers and its resistance to thermal denaturation underscore its stability and functional versatility in various cellular contexts (Qadri2024Biophysical).

## Structure
CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. These domains facilitate interactions with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction (Agback2019Structural; Li2000CD2AP).

The secondary structure of CD2AP is predominantly disordered, with some alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The protein's secondary structure is resistant to thermal denaturation, indicating stability under heat stress (Qadri2024Biophysical). The tertiary structure shows moderate packing, with tryptophan fluorescence indicating some degree of tertiary packing despite the presence of intrinsically disordered regions (Qadri2024Biophysical).

CD2AP forms higher-order oligomers, primarily octamers and tetramers, with the C-terminal coiled-coil region being essential for its oligomerization. A frameshift mutation can lead to abnormal oligomerization through the SH3 domains instead of the coiled-coil region (Qadri2024Biophysical).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, influence CD2AP's function and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Multiple splice variants of CD2AP exist, contributing to its diverse roles (Agback2019Structural).

## Function
CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily related to actin cytoskeleton organization and membrane trafficking. In healthy human cells, CD2AP plays a critical role in cytokinesis, particularly in the late stages, where it is involved in the scission of daughter cells. It localizes to the midbody during late telophase, and its interaction with anillin suggests a role in actin remodeling and membrane trafficking necessary for cell cleavage (Monzo2005Clues).

CD2AP is also essential for the formation and dynamics of actin-based structures at the cell periphery, such as lamellipodia, which are crucial for cell spreading and migration. It facilitates the recruitment of capping protein (CP) and cortactin to the cell periphery, promoting branched actin filament formation and enhancing cell motility (Zhao2013CD2AP).

In the kidneys, CD2AP is vital for maintaining the structure and function of podocytes, specialized cells that form part of the glomerular filtration barrier. It interacts with proteins like nephrin and synaptopodin, helping to regulate the cytoskeleton and prevent podocyte injury, which is crucial for kidney health (Yaddanapudi2012CD2AP; Li2000CD2AP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CD2AP gene are linked to several diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). In Alzheimer's disease, CD2AP has been identified as a genetic risk factor through genome-wide association studies. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9349407 in the CD2AP gene is associated with an increased risk of AD, with studies showing a significant correlation between this polymorphism and AD susceptibility in both European and Chinese populations (Gao2022An; Hollingworth2011Common). CD2AP influences amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolism, affecting Aβ levels and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, which are critical in AD pathogenesis (Camacho2021Association; Liao2015Effects).

In the context of kidney diseases, CD2AP mutations are linked to FSGS, a condition characterized by scarring in the kidney's filtering units. CD2AP is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney. Mutations or deletions in CD2AP can lead to podocyte injury, resulting in proteinuria and progressive renal failure (Yaddanapudi2012CD2AP; Brunskill2015Pathogenic). These mutations disrupt the cytoskeletal structure and cellular survival pathways in podocytes, contributing to the progression of kidney disease (Yaddanapudi2012CD2AP).

## Interactions
CD2AP (CD2-associated protein) is a multifunctional adaptor protein that engages in various protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization. It interacts with the PI3K p85α subunit at cell-cell boundaries in epithelial cells, a crucial interaction for maintaining epithelial cell architecture. This interaction is mediated by the SH3 domains of CD2AP, which are essential for recruiting PI3K to the cell membrane, affecting cell morphology by regulating cell height and area (Wang2019CD2AP).

CD2AP also interacts with nephrin, a protein involved in kidney function, through its carboxy-terminal domain. This interaction is part of a signaling pathway that includes the activation of the PI3K target protein kinase, AKT (Huber2003Nephrin). Additionally, CD2AP forms complexes with cortactin and capping protein (CP) at the cell periphery, facilitating the formation of lamellipodia, which are essential for cell migration. The interaction with cortactin is mediated by the SH3 domain of CD2AP, which binds to proline-rich sequences in cortactin (Zhao2013CD2AP).

CD2AP also interacts with RIN3, a protein involved in endocytosis, and is co-recruited to RAB5a-positive endosomes, highlighting its role in intracellular trafficking (Rouka2015Differential).
