# ZC3H11C

## Overview
ZC3H11C is a human gene that encodes the protein zinc finger CCCH-type containing 11C. This protein is characterized by the presence of a CCCH-type zinc finger motif, which is a structural domain that facilitates binding to RNA molecules. The zinc finger CCCH-type containing 11C protein is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism and regulation of gene expression. It plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA, influencing mRNA stability and translation. The protein's function is essential for maintaining normal cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several signaling pathways, such as the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the precise mechanisms by which ZC3H11C and its encoded protein operate can provide insights into their roles in health and disease.
