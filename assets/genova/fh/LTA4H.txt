# LTA4H

## Overview
Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) is a gene that encodes the enzyme leukotriene A4 hydrolase, a zinc metalloenzyme involved in the inflammatory response. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent pro-inflammatory lipid mediator, by converting leukotriene A4 (LTA4) through its epoxide hydrolase activity. LTA4H also exhibits aminopeptidase activity, contributing to the resolution of inflammation by degrading specific tripeptides. The enzyme is characterized by a monomeric structure with a catalytic domain that includes a zinc ion essential for its function. LTA4H is expressed in nearly all mammalian cells, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Mutations and polymorphisms in the LTA4H gene have been linked to various inflammatory diseases, making it a significant focus for therapeutic research (Röhn2021Drug; Thangapandian2012Structural; Snelgrove2011Leukotriene).

## Structure
Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) is a monomeric zinc metalloenzyme involved in the conversion of leukotriene A4 to leukotriene B4. The enzyme is composed of a single polypeptide chain, indicating it lacks a quaternary structure (CanyellesNiño2022Theoretical). The primary structure of LTA4H includes a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain, which folds into a compact, globular form. The secondary structure consists of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function (Audat2020Identification).

The tertiary structure of LTA4H is characterized by three distinct domains: an N-terminal domain, a catalytic domain containing zinc, and a C-terminal domain. The catalytic domain is crucial for the enzyme's function, with the zinc ion coordinated by specific histidine and glutamic acid residues (Tholander2008StructureBased; CanyellesNiño2022Theoretical). The active site is located in a deep cleft formed by these domains, where the zinc ion plays a critical role in catalysis (Michael2012Leukotriene).

LTA4H also features a hydrophobic substrate binding pocket, approximately 6-7 Å wide and 15 Å deep, which is essential for binding leukotriene A4 (Audat2020Identification). The enzyme's structure and function are influenced by specific amino acid residues, such as Arg563 and Lys565, which are involved in substrate recognition and binding (Thangapandian2012Structural).

## Function
Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) is a crucial enzyme in the inflammatory response, primarily involved in the conversion of leukotriene A4 (LTA4) to leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent pro-inflammatory lipid mediator. This conversion is facilitated by the enzyme's epoxide hydrolase activity, which involves the opening of the epoxide ring in LTA4 and the subsequent addition of a water molecule, leading to the formation of LTB4. LTB4 acts as a chemotactic agent, recruiting and activating neutrophils and other immune cells to sites of inflammation, thereby playing a significant role in the body's defense mechanisms against infections and injuries (Röhn2021Drug; CanyellesNiño2022Theoretical).

LTA4H also exhibits aminopeptidase activity, which allows it to degrade tripeptides such as Proline-Glycine-Proline (PGP), a neutrophil chemoattractant. This function contributes to the resolution of inflammation by reducing neutrophil influx (Szul2016Genetic; Snelgrove2011Leukotriene). The enzyme's dual functionality in both promoting and resolving inflammation highlights its role in maintaining the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators in healthy human cells (Röhn2021Drug; Snelgrove2011Leukotriene). LTA4H is active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in nearly all mammalian cells, underscoring its widespread importance in cellular and organismal homeostasis (Röhn2021Drug).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LTA4H gene have been implicated in various inflammatory diseases. The enzyme LTA4H is crucial in the biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent pro-inflammatory mediator. Mutations such as E271Q, R563A, and K565A can significantly impair the enzyme's catalytic functions, affecting its ability to bind and process substrates, which may contribute to inflammatory conditions like asthma and atherosclerosis (Thangapandian2012Structural).

Polymorphisms in the LTA4H gene have been studied for their association with diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and tuberculosis (TB). Although no strong associations were found between LTA4H polymorphisms and COPD, a modest link was observed with lung function measures in smokers (Tulah2011The). In TB, certain SNPs in the LTA4H gene, such as rs17525495, have been associated with altered expression levels, potentially influencing susceptibility, although findings were not statistically significant (Rito2019Association).

In Crohn's disease, the rs17525495 polymorphism in the LTA4H gene is associated with increased disease risk and affects glucocorticoid treatment efficacy, highlighting its potential role in precision medicine (Yu2019The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LTA4H in inflammatory diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.
