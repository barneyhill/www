# DMAP1

## Overview
DMAP1 (DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin modification and transcriptional repression. The DMAP1 protein is a nuclear co-repressor that plays a crucial role in DNA methylation, a key epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression. It interacts with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and other proteins, such as HDAC2, to form complexes that are essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper methylation patterns during DNA repair processes (Rountree2000DNMT1; Lee2010DNA). The protein is also a component of the Tip60-p400 histone acetyltransferase complex and the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex Swr1/SRCAP, contributing to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression (Lee2020MMTRDmap1). DMAP1's interactions and functions are significant in the context of cancer, where alterations in its expression and phosphorylation have been linked to tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Li2018CSrc; Li2021Comprehensive).

## Structure
The DMAP1 protein is composed of 467 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of approximately 53 kD (Rountree2000DNMT1). It is highly conserved between humans and mice, with about 98% similarity at the amino acid level, indicating its evolutionary importance (Rountree2000DNMT1). The protein contains a putative nuclear localization signal and a predicted coiled-coil domain, which may facilitate protein-protein interactions (Rountree2000DNMT1). The middle portion of DMAP1, referred to as DMAP1-b, interacts with the DNMT1-a region, and both regions are predicted to form coiled-coil structures (Rountree2000DNMT1).

DMAP1 is involved in forming complexes with other proteins, such as DNMT1 and HDAC2, at replication foci, suggesting a role in chromatin modification and transcriptional repression (Rountree2000DNMT1). It interacts with the transcriptional co-repressor TSG101 and is targeted to replication foci through interaction with DNMT1 during the S phase of the cell cycle (Rountree2000DNMT1). DMAP1 also interacts with Daxx, particularly through its C-terminal domain, which includes amino acid residues 235-467, with a strong interaction in the middle region (residues 293-411) (Muromoto2004Physicala). The protein is a component of the Tip60-p400 histone acetyltransferase complex and the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex Swr1/SRCAP (Lee2020MMTRDmap1).

## Function
DMAP1 (DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein 1) functions as a co-repressor that enhances DNA methylation, a critical epigenetic process regulating gene expression. It interacts with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to stimulate DNA methylation both globally and locally, particularly at sites of double-strand break repair (Lee2010DNA). DMAP1 is crucial for maintaining proper methylation patterns during DNA repair, which is essential for silencing genes post-repair and maintaining genomic stability (Lee2010DNA).

In healthy human cells, DMAP1 is active in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with DNMT1 and other proteins like HDAC2, contributing to transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling (Rountree2000DNMT1). DMAP1 preferentially binds to hemimethylated DNA, enhancing DNMT1 activity, which is vital for converting hemimethylated DNA to fully methylated DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle (Lee2010DNA). This activity is important for maintaining genome stability and preventing the reactivation of growth-inhibitory genes such as p16, which could lead to altered cell growth and potential tumorigenesis (Lee2010DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and phosphorylation of DMAP1 have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In pancreatic cancer, the phosphorylation of DMAP1 at Tyr246 by c-Src disrupts its interaction with Bub3, contributing to resistance against mitotic stress. This phosphorylation is associated with poor prognosis, as it promotes the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes, aiding tumor survival and progression (Li2018CSrc). High levels of DMAP1 phosphorylation at Tyr246 correlate with reduced survival rates in pancreatic cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Li2018CSrc).

In breast cancer, DMAP1 expression is generally lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Low DMAP1 expression is linked to poor survival outcomes and is associated with the activation of cancer-related pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. This suggests a tumor-suppressive role for DMAP1 in breast cancer (Li2021Comprehensive). Additionally, low DMAP1 expression correlates with increased sensitivity to PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2021Comprehensive). These findings highlight the importance of DMAP1 in cancer progression and its potential utility in clinical prognosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
DMAP1 (DNA methyltransferase 1 associated protein 1) is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. It interacts with DNMT1, forming a complex that is crucial for transcriptional repression. This interaction occurs through the N-terminal noncatalytic domain of DNMT1, which also binds to HDAC2, facilitating the formation of a repressive complex at replication foci during the S phase of the cell cycle (Rountree2000DNMT1).

DMAP1 also interacts with Daxx, a protein involved in apoptosis and transcriptional regulation. This interaction is mediated through the N-terminal region of Daxx and the C-terminal domain of DMAP1, forming a complex with DNMT1 in the nucleus. This complex is implicated in transcriptional repression and possibly DNA methylation processes (Muromoto2004Physical).

Additionally, DMAP1 is part of the Tip60-p400 histone acetyltransferase complex and the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex Swr1/SRCAP. It is involved in maintaining heterochromatin structure and histone modification during the late S phase, and it participates in DNA double-strand break repair and tumor suppression (Lee2020MMTRDmap1). DMAP1 also interacts with TSG101, a transcriptional co-repressor, although TSG101 does not directly interact with DNMT1, suggesting that DMAP1 mediates this association (Rountree2000DNMT1).
