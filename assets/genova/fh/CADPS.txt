# CADPS

## Overview
The CADPS gene encodes the calcium-dependent secretion activator protein, also known as CAPS1, which is integral to the process of exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. This protein is categorized as a cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein that facilitates the calcium-dependent release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), by promoting the docking and priming of dense-core vesicles at the cell membrane (Sadakata2007Autisticlike). CAPS1 interacts with SNARE proteins and the D2 dopamine receptor, playing a critical role in synaptic transmission and hormone secretion (Shumate2021RNA; Binda2005Regulation). Mutations in the CADPS gene have been associated with neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability, underscoring its importance in brain development and function (Bonora2014Maternally).

## Function
The CADPS gene encodes the calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion, which plays a crucial role in the exocytosis of dense-core vesicles, particularly at the ATP-dependent priming step. This protein is involved in the calcium-dependent release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are essential for brain development and function, including synapse and circuit formation (Sadakata2007Autisticlike). CADPS is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it facilitates the docking and priming of secretory vesicles, contributing to synaptic transmission and hormone secretion (Sadakata2007Autisticlike).

In healthy human cells, CADPS interacts with phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate and dense-core vesicles, enhancing the release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophins. This interaction is crucial for proper neuronal signaling and development, as well as for maintaining normal cellular communication and physiological processes (Sadakata2007Autisticlike). The protein's activity is particularly significant in neuroendocrine cells, where it supports the calcium-dependent release of neurotransmitters and hormones, ensuring effective synaptic transmission and hormone secretion (Sadakata2007Autisticlike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CADPS gene, which encodes a protein involved in neurotransmitter release, have been associated with several neurological disorders. In particular, CADPS mutations have been linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). Studies have identified rare variants in the CADPS gene in patients with ASD and ID, including missense mutations that disrupt the interaction between CADPS and dopamine receptor type 2 (D2DR), suggesting a mechanism for its involvement in these conditions (Bonora2014Maternally).

The CADPS gene is located on chromosome 7q31-q33, a region known as an "autism susceptibility locus." Alterations in CADPS expression, such as downregulation in the brains of autistic individuals, have been observed, indicating its potential role in ASD development (Bonora2014Maternally). The gene also exhibits monoallelic expression, with the expressed allele being of maternal origin, which may contribute to the development of ASD and ID through a parent-of-origin effect (Bonora2014Maternally).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CADPS in neurological disorders, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its role in synaptic transmission and neuronal communication.

## Interactions
The calcium-dependent secretion activator (CADPS), also known as CAPS1, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for neurotransmitter release. CAPS1 interacts directly with SNARE proteins, including syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin-2, and SNAP-25, facilitating the assembly of the SNARE complex essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Shumate2021RNA). This interaction is vital for the formation of a readily-releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, which are positioned close to the active zone plasma membrane and can undergo rapid exocytosis upon calcium influx (Shumate2021RNA).

CAPS1 also interacts with the D2 dopamine receptor, specifically with the D2L and D2S splice variants, but not with other dopamine receptors like D1, D3, D4, or D5. This interaction is calcium-independent and does not rely on phosphorylation (Binda2005Regulation). The binding site for the D2 receptor on CAPS1 is located within its C-terminal region, which includes the munc homology domain (MHD) (Binda2005Regulation).

RNA editing of CAPS1 results in a glutamate-to-glycine substitution in its C-terminal domain, affecting its synaptic localization and function. This editing is regulated by neuronal activity and mediated by ADAR enzymes, which convert adenosine to inosine in RNA transcripts (Shumate2021RNA).
