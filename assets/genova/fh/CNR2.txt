# CNR2

## Overview
The CNR2 gene encodes the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the immune system. CB2 is primarily expressed in immune cells, including B cells, NK cells, macrophages, and T cells, where it modulates immune responses through interactions with endocannabinoids, plant-derived, and synthetic cannabinoids (Malfitano2014What). The receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane α-helices, a common feature of GPCRs, and undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which influence its activity and function (Aghazadeh2016Medicinal; Malfitano2014What). CB2 is involved in various physiological processes, including B-cell differentiation and proliferation, and has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Carayon1998Modulation; Shapiro2019Reduced).

## Structure
The CNR2 gene encodes the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Structurally, CB2 is composed of a single polypeptide chain with seven transmembrane α-helices, typical of GPCRs, and features an extracellular glycosylated N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus (Malfitano2014What). The primary structure of CB2 includes 410 amino acids in its transmembrane domain, with a 48% homology to the CB1 receptor (Aghazadeh2016Medicinal). 

The secondary structure of CB2 involves these seven transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function as a GPCR (Aghazadeh2016Medicinal). The tertiary structure is characterized by the arrangement of these helices within the cell membrane, facilitating interactions with ligands and intracellular signaling proteins. 

Post-translational modifications of CB2 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence ligand-receptor interactions and receptor activity. Phosphorylation at serine 352 is particularly significant, as it is involved in receptor internalization and desensitization (Malfitano2014What). The receptor also exists in tissue-specific isoforms, CB2A and CB2B, which differ in their 5' untranslated regions and expression patterns, allowing for tissue-specific targeting (Aghazadeh2016Medicinal).

## Function
The CNR2 gene encodes the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in immune cells such as B cells, NK cells, macrophages, and T cells (Malfitano2014What). CB2 is involved in modulating immune responses by binding to endocannabinoids, plant-derived, and synthetic cannabinoids, which can lead to both inhibitory and stimulatory signals depending on the biological context (Malfitano2014What). In healthy human cells, CB2 is generally inactive but can be activated by specific ligands, leading to its phosphorylation and internalization (Malfitano2014What).

CB2 plays a significant role in B-cell differentiation and proliferation. Its expression is modulated during B-cell differentiation, with a decrease observed in germinal center B cells and centroblasts, and restoration in memory B cells (Carayon1998Modulation). The receptor is upregulated during CD40-mediated activation of B cells, suggesting its role as a coreceptor in CD40-induced proliferation (Carayon1998Modulation). CB2 is also involved in immune cell migration, as evidenced by its role in the homing and retention of specific B cell subpopulations (Malfitano2014What). The receptor's expression is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its activation state and function in immune modulation (Malfitano2014What).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CNR2 gene, which encodes the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. In epilepsy, reduced CB2R activity is associated with increased seizure susceptibility. Studies in mice have shown that both heterozygous and homozygous CB2R knockout mice exhibit heightened seizure risk, suggesting that CB2R activity may confer seizure protection (Shapiro2019Reduced).

In schizophrenia, the CNR2 gene has been linked to the disorder through genetic polymorphisms. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs2501432 (R63Q) and rs12744386 have been associated with schizophrenia, with the R63 allele showing lower response to CB2 ligands and reduced receptor expression (Ishiguro2010Brain). These genetic variations may contribute to altered CB2R function, impacting the pathology of schizophrenia (Ishiguro2010Brain).

The CNR2 gene is also associated with depression and panic disorder. The rs2501432 polymorphism has been linked to increased risk for depression, and certain SNPs in the CNR2 gene have been found to provide protection against panic disorder in males (Peiró2020Association). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of CNR2 gene mutations and expression level alterations in various mental health conditions.

## Interactions
The cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and signaling pathways. A significant interaction partner of CNR2 is the scaffold protein p62/SQSTM1, which plays a role in protein-protein interactions and regulates signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAP kinase. This interaction is stable and independent of receptor activation, suggesting a role in receptor trafficking and signaling, potentially impacting neurodegenerative conditions where CNR2 is upregulated (Sharaf2019Systematic).

CNR2 also interacts with proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) functions and protein metabolism. Notable interactors include calnexin, Sec61A, and tubulin chains, which are involved in protein translocation, folding, and trafficking. These interactions suggest a role for CNR2 in receptor transport and cellular processes related to ER stress and protein metabolism (Sharaf2019Systematic).

Additionally, CNR2 is part of a network that includes GTP-binding proteins and signaling alpha subunits of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (GNA proteins), indicating its involvement in complex signaling pathways (Sharaf2019Systematic). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CNR2 in cellular signaling and its potential impact on various physiological and pathological processes.
