# MMP16

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 16 (MMP16) is a gene that encodes a membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase, which is part of the larger matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to degrade components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), playing pivotal roles in tissue remodeling, cell migration, and various physiological processes such as wound healing and angiogenesis (Vu2000Matrix; Jackson2010Update). MMP16 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme and becomes active upon proteolytic cleavage. The protein is localized to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with other MMPs and ECM components, facilitating processes like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and neural crest cell migration (Roth2017A). MMP16's activity is tightly regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and its dysregulation is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Vu2000Matrix; Zhang2020A).

## Structure
MMP16, also known as MT3-MMP, is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family characterized by its membrane-type structure. It is localized to the plasma membrane through a transmembrane segment or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor domain (de2022Matrix). The protein structure includes a propeptide domain, a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif, and a hemopexin-like C-terminal domain. The catalytic domain is essential for its enzymatic activity, featuring a conserved sequence motif, HEXXHXXGXXH, where histidines coordinate the binding of a zinc ion crucial for its proteolytic function (Massova1998Matrix; de2022Matrix).

MMP16 is involved in cleaving fibrillar collagen types I to IV and XI, generating specific collagen fragments (de2022Matrix). The presence of a convertase cleavage site in its propeptide, cleaved by furin or furin-like proteases, is a notable feature of its activation mechanism (de2022Matrix). The protein can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional properties and interactions. The structural diversity among MMPs, including MMP16, is attributed to specific domain variations despite high homology in their catalytic domains (de2022Matrix).

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 16 (MMP16) is a membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, playing a crucial role in tissue remodeling and cell migration. MMP16 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme and becomes active upon the removal of its propeptide. It is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to processes such as wound healing, development, and angiogenesis (Vu2000Matrix; Jackson2010Update).

MMP16 is known to activate pro-MMP2, a key enzyme in ECM remodeling, which is essential for normal physiological processes like lung development and repair (Hadchouel2008Matrix). In the context of neural crest cell (NCC) migration, MMP16 facilitates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cell migration. It achieves this by degrading ECM components such as laminin and cell adhesion molecules like N-cadherin, thereby promoting NCC detachment and migration (Roth2017A).

MMP16's activity is regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and is involved in a cascade of ECM degradation events, modulating cell and ECM interactions to facilitate cell motility and tissue morphogenesis (Vu2000Matrix; Roth2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MMP16 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specific polymorphisms in MMP16, such as rs2664370T>C, are associated with a protective effect against the disease. The rs2664370CC genotype is linked to improved blood gas levels and reduced MMP16 expression, which may help mitigate lung tissue degradation in COPD patients (Zhang2020A).

In bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a condition affecting premature infants, certain MMP16 genotypes are associated with a lower risk of developing the disease. These genotypes correlate with reduced MMP16 protein levels and decreased MMP2 activity, suggesting a role in lung development and the pathogenesis of BPD (Hadchouel2008Matrix).

MMP16 is also involved in cancer progression. In uveal melanoma, high expression of MMP16 is linked to shorter overall survival and disease-free survival, indicating its role in tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Wang2021MMP1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MMP16 in various diseases, particularly those involving tissue remodeling and inflammation.

## Interactions
MMP16, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 16, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. MMP16 can cleave and activate pro-MMP2 and pro-MMP9, which are crucial for processes like neural crest cell migration and cancer progression (Roth2017A). It also interacts with other matrix metalloproteinases, such as MMP14, forming complexes that regulate collagen degradation and influence cell invasion behaviors (Turunen2017Membrane-type).

In the context of cancer, MMP16 is noted for its ability to cleave several cell surface proteins, including CD44, L1CAM, and syndecan-1, although the specific biological functions of these interactions are not fully understood (Turunen2017Membrane-type). MMP16 also participates in the ectodomain shedding of DDR1, which regulates collagen-induced receptor signaling (Turunen2017Membrane-type).

In prostate cancer, MMP16 is involved in SNP-SNP interactions with genes like ROBO1, CSF1, and EGFR, suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis and cell migration (Lin2013SNPSNP). These interactions highlight MMP16's involvement in complex gene networks and signaling pathways, contributing to its regulatory functions in both normal physiological and pathological conditions.
