# AGPAT3

## Overview
AGPAT3, or 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3, is a gene that encodes a membrane-associated enzyme integral to lipid metabolism. This enzyme is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, where it plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of phospholipids by catalyzing the conversion of lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid. This reaction is a critical step in the formation of glycerolipids and bioactive lipid mediators, which are essential for membrane biogenesis and energy storage (Yamashita2014Acyltransferases; Prasad2011Enzymatic). The AGPAT3 protein is characterized by its transmembrane domains and conserved motifs, which are crucial for its enzymatic function (Schmidt2010Membrane). Alterations in the AGPAT3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, including intellectual disability and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and pathological conditions (Wen2023The; Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

## Structure
The AGPAT3 protein, also known as 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3, is a 376-residue enzyme integral to the membrane, primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex. Its structure includes two transmembrane domains, with a cytoplasmic domain from residues 1-125, a transmembrane domain from residues 126-143, a luminal loop from residues 143-317, and another transmembrane domain between residues 308-339. The C-terminal tail is cytoplasmic, extending from residues 331-339 to 376 (Schmidt2010Membrane).

AGPAT3 contains four conserved motifs (I-IV) crucial for its enzymatic activity. Motif I is located in the cytoplasm, while motif II is in the ER and Golgi lumen, suggesting a unique enzymatic mechanism where these motifs operate on opposite sides of the membrane (Schmidt2010Membrane). The protein lacks N-linked glycosylation sites but features a C-terminal di- or tri-lysine sequence, potentially serving as an ER retention signal (Schmidt2010Membrane).

The protein's structure includes an acyltransferase or PLsC domain, with acidic and basic residues likely involved in catalysis and substrate recognition (Schmidt2010Membrane). AGPAT3 may have splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and localization. However, specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
AGPAT3, or 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the biosynthesis of phospholipids. It catalyzes the conversion of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to phosphatidic acid (PA) by adding an acyl group, a key step in the formation of glycerolipids and bioactive lipid mediators (Yamashita2014Acyltransferases; Prasad2011Enzymatic). This enzymatic activity is essential for the synthesis and remodeling of various phospholipids, including lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), and lysophosphatidylserine (LPS) (Yamashita2014Acyltransferases).

AGPAT3 is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the nuclear envelope, where it contributes to membrane biogenesis and energy storage (Prasad2011Enzymatic). It is involved in the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing phosphatidylcholine (PC), which is important for cell proliferation and survival (Yamashita2014Acyltransferases). The enzyme also plays a role in regulating the structure and function of the Golgi complex, affecting processes such as membrane tubule formation and protein trafficking (Yamashita2014Acyltransferases). AGPAT3's activity is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cellular membranes, impacting various cellular and physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AGPAT3 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. AGPAT3 is associated with intellectual disability and retinitis pigmentosa syndrome (IDRP), as well as autism spectrum disorder (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). Its expression levels are significant in various cancers. In colorectal cancer, AGPAT3 expression is increased, while in gastric cancer, higher expression levels correlate with a more favorable prognosis, suggesting potential anti-tumor properties (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AGPAT3 is among the genes from the GPAT/AGPAT family that are significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Wen2023The). The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism and its regulation by factors such as PPARδ and AMPK suggest that alterations in its expression could impact metabolic pathways, contributing to conditions like obesity and insulin resistance (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). These metabolic disruptions are linked to a predisposition to various cancers, including liver and colorectal cancers (Korbecki2024Phospholipid).
