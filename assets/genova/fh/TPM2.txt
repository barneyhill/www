# TPM2

## Overview
The TPM2 gene encodes the protein tropomyosin 2, a critical component of the cytoskeleton and muscle contraction machinery. Tropomyosin 2 is categorized as a regulatory protein that stabilizes actin filaments and modulates their interaction with myosin, thereby playing a pivotal role in muscle contraction and relaxation. This protein forms coiled-coil dimers that align along actin filaments, regulating access to myosin-binding sites in a calcium-dependent manner, particularly in association with the troponin complex in muscle tissues (Donner2002Mutations; Marttila2014Mutation). Beyond its role in muscle cells, TPM2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Zhang2018HypoxiaInduced). Mutations in the TPM2 gene are linked to several muscle disorders, such as nemaline myopathy and distal arthrogryposis, underscoring its clinical significance (Li2018Novel; Donner2002Mutations).

## Structure
The TPM2 gene encodes a protein known as tropomyosin 2, which plays a crucial role in muscle contraction and cytoskeletal functions. The primary structure of the TPM2 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a coiled-coil dimer, characterized by seven amino acid heptad pseudorepeats. These repeats typically have hydrophobic residues at the first and fourth positions, which is a hallmark of an alpha-helical coiled-coil dimer (Drees1995Tropomyosin).

The secondary structure of tropomyosin 2 is predominantly alpha-helical, which facilitates its role in stabilizing actin filaments. The tertiary structure involves the stabilization of these helices, allowing the protein to maintain its elongated shape. In its quaternary structure, tropomyosin 2 forms a polymer along actin filaments, which is essential for its function in muscle contraction (Drees1995Tropomyosin).

Post-translational modifications of tropomyosin 2 may include phosphorylation, which can affect its interaction with other proteins and its regulatory functions. The TPM2 gene also exhibits splice variants, resulting in different isoforms with distinct functional properties. These isoforms can have varying effects on muscle function and are implicated in conditions such as nemaline myopathy and congenital myopathy (Śliwinska2021Mutations; Assinder2010A).

## Function
The TPM2 gene encodes for β-tropomyosin, a protein that plays a crucial role in muscle function by stabilizing actin filaments and regulating their interaction with myosin, which is essential for muscle contraction and relaxation (Donner2002Mutations; Marttila2014Mutation). Tropomyosin forms coiled-coil dimers that run along the length of actin filaments, controlling access to myosin-binding sites and thus modulating muscle contraction (Marttila2014Mutation). In skeletal and cardiac muscles, tropomyosin, in association with the troponin complex, regulates the calcium-sensitive interaction of actin and myosin, which is vital for muscle contraction (Donner2002Mutations).

Beyond muscle cells, TPM2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, vesicle transport, cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, indicating its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Zhang2018HypoxiaInduced). TPM2 also plays a role in stabilizing the cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division and movement (Zhang2018HypoxiaInduced). The protein is expressed in both type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers, contributing to the regulation of muscle contraction and the stability of the actin filament (Marttila2014Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TPM2 gene are associated with a range of muscle disorders, including nemaline myopathy, distal arthrogryposis, and congenital myopathies. Nemaline myopathy, characterized by muscle weakness and the presence of nemaline bodies in skeletal muscle, can result from heterozygous mutations in TPM2, such as the Q147P and E117K mutations, which affect the protein's structure and function (Donner2002Mutations). Distal arthrogryposis, a condition marked by congenital contractures of the distal limb joints, is linked to various TPM2 mutations, including c.308A>G (p.Q103R) and c.456G>C (p.Lys152Asn), which alter the protein's conformation and function (Li2018Novel; Neissi2022A).

TPM2 mutations can lead to altered calcium sensitivity in muscle fibers, contributing to either muscle weakness or a hypercontractile state. For instance, the p.R133W mutation is associated with distal joint contractures and features reminiscent of Escobar variant multiple pterygium syndrome (Vogt2020A). The clinical presentation of TPM2-related disorders is highly variable, with some mutations causing severe congenital myopathy and others resulting in milder phenotypes (Mroczek2016A; Marttila2014Mutation). The inheritance pattern is predominantly autosomal dominant, although recessive forms have been reported (Schirwani2021Homozygous).

## Interactions
Tropomyosin 2 (TPM2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in muscle contraction and cytoskeletal functions. TPM2 interacts with actin filaments, stabilizing them and regulating the access of other actin-binding proteins. This interaction is essential for the modulation of muscle contraction, as TPM2 is part of the troponin-tropomyosin complex, which responds to calcium levels to regulate muscle contraction (Donner2002Mutations).

In yeast, TPM2, known as Tpm2p, exhibits Mg2+-dependent binding to F-actin, similar to other nonmuscle tropomyosins. This binding is affected by ionic strength, with Tpm2p maintaining appreciable binding even at higher salt concentrations (Drees1995Tropomyosin). Tpm2p can compete with another tropomyosin, Tpmlp, for binding to F-actin, suggesting a strong interaction with actin filaments (Drees1995Tropomyosin).

In the context of cancer, TPM2 interacts with the Rho protein family, influencing cell migration and polarity. Loss of Tpm2.1, a specific isoform, increases Rho-GTP levels and activates Rho-Rock-mediated regulation of actomyosin contractility, affecting cell migration (Meng2023Research). TPM2 also interacts with the RhoA signaling pathway in atherosclerosis, where its overexpression can suppress the activation of RhoA signaling proteins, thereby reducing oxidative stress and inflammation (Zhang2021Abnormal).
