# ARMC7

## Overview
ARMC7 is a gene that encodes the protein armadillo repeat containing 7, which is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeat domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that ARMC7 may play a role in forming multiprotein complexes or engaging in transient interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways or structural assemblies (Gul2016Metazoan). The protein is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, through its interaction with the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). This interaction is part of a complex signaling pathway that includes clusterin, p53, Dkk1, Wnt, PCP, and JNK, which are associated with neurotoxicity and tau phosphorylation (Huang2021ARMC). The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential significance in the pathology of neurodegenerative conditions, although further research is necessary to fully understand its clinical implications (Huang2021ARMC).

## Clinical Significance
ARMC7 is implicated in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) through its interaction with the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). This interaction is part of the clusterin/p53/Dkk1/Wnt/PCP/JNK pathway, which is associated with neurotoxicity and tau phosphorylation, key processes in AD progression. The pathway involves the upregulation of genes such as EGR1, NAB2, and KLF10, which mediate these effects. ARMC7's interaction with APP is also hypothesized to promote CAA, characterized by amyloid-beta deposition in cortical and leptomeningeal vessels (Huang2021ARMC).

While specific mutations in ARMC7 have not been detailed, its role in these pathways suggests that alterations in its expression or interactions could contribute to disease pathology. The gene's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential significance in neurodegenerative conditions, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical implications (Huang2021ARMC).

## Interactions
ARMC7 interacts with the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) to mediate neurotoxicity and tau phosphorylation through the ARMC7/APP/clusterin/p53/Dkk1/Wnt/PCP/JNK pathway. This interaction is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease, as it promotes the development of neuropathologies observed in the disease. The interaction with APP suggests that ARMC7 may also be involved in cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to the pathologic deposition of amyloid-beta within cortical and leptomeningeal arteries, arterioles, and capillaries (Huang2021ARMC). The sequence of ARMC7 is almost entirely occupied by the armadillo repeat domain, indicating that its relationship to diseases is primarily mediated through its interactions with other proteins, such as APP (Huang2021ARMC). Despite these interactions, specific physical interactions of ARMC7 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts (Huang2021ARMC). The armadillo repeat domain is known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which suggests that ARMC7 may participate in multiprotein complexes or transient interactions, influencing cellular signaling pathways or structural assemblies (Gul2016Metazoan).
