# PITPNM2

## Overview
PITPNM2 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatidylinositol transfer protein membrane-associated 2, which is a member of the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) family. This protein is primarily involved in lipid signaling and membrane trafficking, playing a critical role in the transfer of phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) between cellular membranes, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM) (Cockcroft2016Topological). The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein domain, a calcium-binding motif, and a transmembrane spanning domain, which facilitate its role in lipid homeostasis and signal transduction (Ocaka2004Chromosomal). PITPNM2 is essential for maintaining the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) cycle, a key component of the phospholipase C (PLC) signaling pathway, and is involved in various cellular processes such as vesicle transport and membrane dynamics (Raghu2021Emerging; Cockcroft2016Topological).

## Structure
The PITPNM2 gene encodes a protein that is involved in lipid transfer and signaling, featuring several distinct domains. The protein shares approximately 40% sequence identity with the Drosophila rdgB gene, which includes a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) domain, a calcium-binding motif, a transmembrane spanning domain, and a protein tyrosine kinase interacting region (Ocaka2004Chromosomal). Although PITPNM3 lacks a PITP domain, PITPNM2 retains this domain, which is crucial for its function in binding and transferring phosphatidylinositol (Ocaka2004Chromosomal).

The calcium-binding domain is conserved across the mammalian PITPNM genes and is encoded by a single exon of 96 base pairs (Ocaka2004Chromosomal). The transmembrane regions of PITPNM2 are encoded across 10 exons, specifically exons 9 to 18, with exons 15 and 17 being unique to PITPNM2 and subject to alternative splicing (Ocaka2004Chromosomal). This alternative splicing may result in different isoforms of the protein, potentially altering its functional properties.

The genomic sequence surrounding PITPNM2 also includes the ARL6IP4 gene, which is transcribed in the opposite direction, though it does not share significant sequence homology with AIP/AIPL1 (Ocaka2004Chromosomal).

## Function
PITPNM2 encodes a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein that plays a crucial role in lipid signaling and membrane trafficking in healthy human cells. This protein is involved in the transfer of phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM), which is essential for the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) cycle, a key component of the phospholipase C (PLC) signaling pathway (Cockcroft2016Topological). PITPNM2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and associated with membranes, where it influences cellular functions such as vesicle transport and lipid homeostasis (Cockcroft2016Topological).

In mammalian cells, PITPNM2 is involved in the replenishment of PI(4,5)P2 at the PM, particularly under conditions of low PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, while its counterpart, PITPNM1, operates at higher levels of stimulation (Cockcroft2016Topological). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining PI(4,5)P2 homeostasis, which is vital for various cellular functions, including signal transduction and membrane dynamics (Raghu2021Emerging). PITPNM2's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions in human cells.

## Interactions
PITPNM2, a member of the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that facilitate its role in lipid transfer and signaling. It contains an FFAT motif, which allows it to bind to the ER-resident protein VAP (VAMP-associated protein), playing a crucial role in bridging the ER and plasma membrane (PM) gap at membrane contact sites (MCS) (Lete2020Lipid; Cockcroft2016Topological). This interaction is essential for the transfer of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidic acid (PA) between the PM and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during the phospholipase C (PLC) cycle (Cockcroft2016Topological).

PITPNM2 also interacts with other proteins such as VAP-B and E-Syt1, which are important for its function in lipid transfer and maintaining the PI(4,5)P2 cycle at the PM (Cockcroft2016Topological). The LNS2 domain of PITPNM2 is involved in protein-protein interactions, specifically binding to protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) in human homologues, suggesting its participation in complex signaling pathways, particularly in neuronal tissues (Wyckoff2010Phosphatidylinositol). These interactions highlight the role of PITPNM2 in cellular dynamics and communication through its involvement in lipid transfer and signaling pathways.
