# KDM4A

## Overview
KDM4A is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 4A, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of histone demethylases. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression by specifically demethylating trimethyl groups from histone residues H3K9 and H3K36, thereby influencing gene expression, cell fate, and genomic stability (Van2011The). KDM4A is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation, through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Salifou2016The; Van2015Lysine). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, which affect its stability and function (Upadhyay2018Targeting). KDM4A is also implicated in several cancers, where its overexpression and genetic alterations are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to certain chemotherapeutics, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Lapidot2021Essential; Black2013KDM4A).

## Structure
KDM4A, also known as lysine demethylase 4A, is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of histone demethylases. The protein features a catalytic JmjC domain in its N-terminal half, which is responsible for its demethylase activity and binds Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) (Pilka2015Structural; Upadhyay2018Targeting). The active site of KDM4A is located at the open end of a double-stranded beta-helix, with the catalytic iron being octahedrally coordinated by a conserved HxD/E...H triad (Pilka2015Structural). 

KDM4A also contains a tandem PHD and tandem TUDOR domain in its C-terminal region. The tandem TUDOR domains are non-catalytic and play a crucial role in regulating chromatin localization and substrate specificity by binding to tri-methylated lysine residues on histones, such as H3-K4me3, H3-K23me3, and H4-K20me3 (Upadhyay2018Targeting). The TUDOR domain forms a tri-methyl lysine binding pocket with conserved aromatic residues F932, W967, and Y973, which are crucial for its interaction with histone marks (Upadhyay2018Targeting; Su2016Reader).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination can affect the activity and stability of KDM4A, influencing its role in chromatin structure and gene expression regulation (Upadhyay2018Targeting).

## Function
KDM4A, also known as lysine demethylase 4A, is a histone demethylase that plays a significant role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression in healthy human cells. It specifically demethylates trimethyl groups from histone residues H3K9 and H3K36, which is crucial for maintaining the balance of posttranslational modifications on histones, thereby influencing gene expression, cell fate, and genomic stability (Van2011The). KDM4A is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly in the expression of replicative canonical histone genes. Its activity is essential for maintaining proper chromatin organization and cell cycle progression, as it modulates the expression of histone genes during different cell cycle phases (Van2020The).

KDM4A also interacts with the transcription and processing machinery of histone genes, influencing RNA transcription and processing (Van2020The). It is active primarily in the nucleus, where it affects chromatin accessibility and replication timing, facilitating DNA replication and cell cycle progression (Black2010Conserved). Additionally, KDM4A has a role in the cytoplasm, where it associates with the translation initiation complex, impacting protein synthesis and cellular responses to mTOR inhibitors (Van2015Lysine).

## Clinical Significance
KDM4A, a lysine demethylase, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its overexpression and genetic alterations. In ovarian cancer, KDM4A is frequently amplified, with 46% of tumors showing this amplification, which correlates with increased expression levels and poorer prognosis. This suggests that KDM4A levels could serve as a biomarker for ovarian cancer prognosis (Black2013KDM4A). Overexpression of KDM4A is also linked to resistance to S-phase chemotherapeutics and cisplatin treatment, indicating its impact on drug response (Black2013KDM4A).

In prostate cancer, KDM4A overexpression correlates with the Gleason score and is implicated in prostatic intraepithelial tumor development. It represses the tumor suppressor ARHI and affects breast cancer metastasis by inhibiting SP1 expression (Franci2017Identification). A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in KDM4A, known as SNP-A482, is associated with worse outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and increased sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for mTOR inhibitor therapy (Van2015A).

In malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), KDM4A expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its inhibition reduces tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lapidot2021Essential).

## Interactions
KDM4A, also known as lysine demethylase 4A, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. KDM4A interacts with the RNA Polymerase I (Pol-I) transcription machinery, associating specifically with the rDNA promoter in growing cells, which suggests its involvement in regulating rDNA transcription (Salifou2016The). It is part of a multimolecular complex with Pol-I, as demonstrated by co-precipitation experiments (Salifou2016The).

KDM4A also interacts with translation initiation factors, including eIF2α, and is enriched in the 40S and 60S ribosomal fractions, indicating a role in translation initiation (Van2015Lysine). This interaction affects the distribution of translation initiation factors within polysome fractions, impacting protein synthesis (Van2015Lysine).

In the context of cell cycle progression, KDM4A interacts antagonistically with HP1γ, a chromatin-associated protein. This interaction influences chromatin accessibility and DNA replication timing, with KDM4A reducing HP1γ binding and facilitating DNA replication (Black2010Conserved). These interactions highlight KDM4A's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including transcription, translation, and DNA replication.
