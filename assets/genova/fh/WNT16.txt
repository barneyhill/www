# WNT16

## Overview
WNT16 is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 16, which is part of the Wnt family of proteins known for their roles in cell signaling. This protein is characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich domain, which is crucial for its function in signaling pathways. Wnt family member 16 is involved in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, playing a significant role in bone homeostasis by regulating osteoblast and osteoclast activity. It promotes osteogenic differentiation and inhibits osteoclastogenesis, thereby contributing to bone mass and strength. The protein is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts and is essential for maintaining cortical bone mass, particularly during skeletal growth and remodeling (Gori2015A; Ye2022Wnt16). Additionally, Wnt family member 16 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Qu2021Loss; Nalesso2016WNT16).

## Structure
The WNT16 protein is a member of the Wnt family, characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich domain crucial for its function. This domain is a key feature of the protein's tertiary structure, which is important for its signaling activity. The primary structure of WNT16 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its secondary and tertiary structures. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's overall stability and function. 

WNT16 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation. These modifications are essential for the protein's activity and secretion, influencing its ability to interact with receptors and other cellular components. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which allows for variations in its structure and function across different tissues or developmental stages.

While specific details about the quaternary structure of WNT16 are not provided, the protein's ability to interact with other molecules suggests it may form complexes as part of its signaling role. The structural characteristics of WNT16 are consistent with its involvement in various developmental and physiological processes, particularly in bone homeostasis and immune responses (Gori2015A; Zhang2016Molecular).

## Function
The WNT16 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Wnt family, which is involved in regulating cell-to-cell interactions during embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis. In healthy human cells, WNT16 plays a significant role in bone homeostasis by influencing both osteoblast and osteoclast activity. It promotes osteogenic differentiation and inhibits osteoclastogenesis, thereby positively affecting bone mass. WNT16 upregulates genes involved in osteoblast differentiation and proliferation, such as Bmpr1b, Bmp7, and Enpp1, and enhances the differentiation of perivascular stem cells towards osteoblasts through the JNK pathway (Ye2022Wnt16).

WNT16 also inhibits osteoclastogenesis by suppressing RANKL-induced NF-kB and NFATc1 signaling in osteoclast precursors and by upregulating OPG expression in pre-osteoblasts, which inhibits the RANK-RANKL interaction (Ye2022Wnt16). The protein can activate both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, but only non-canonical signaling in osteoclasts (Ye2022Wnt16). WNT16 is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts and is crucial for maintaining cortical bone mass and strength, particularly during skeletal growth and remodeling (Gori2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WNT16 gene are associated with several bone-related diseases and conditions. Variants in WNT16 have been linked to changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Genome-wide association studies have identified specific polymorphisms, such as rs2908004 and rs2707466, that are associated with femoral neck BMD and hip fractures, particularly in individuals under 80 years of age (GarcíaIbarbia2013Missense). These genetic variations can influence bone mass and structure, impacting both cortical and trabecular bone (Alam2015OsteoblastSpecific).

WNT16 also plays a role in osteoarthritis (OA). It is upregulated in articular cartilage following injury and in OA, suggesting a protective role against cartilage breakdown. WNT16-deficient mice develop more severe OA, characterized by reduced lubricin expression and increased chondrocyte apoptosis (Nalesso2016WNT16). The gene's ability to modulate WNT signaling pathways helps maintain cartilage homeostasis and prevent OA progression (Nalesso2016WNT16).

Alterations in WNT16 expression can lead to skeletal deformities and are associated with bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Loss of WNT16 results in reduced bone mineral density and decreased trabecular bone, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for osteoporosis treatment (Qu2021Loss).

## Interactions
WNT16 interacts with various proteins and components of signaling pathways, playing a significant role in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling. It interacts with receptors such as Ror2 and CD146, similar to Wnt5a, although its binding affinity is weaker compared to Wnt5a. WNT16 does not interact with Vangl2 or Ryk, and it does not induce phosphorylation of Vangl2, unlike Wnt5a (Tong2019Wnt16). WNT16 also interacts with AP2b1, a subunit of the adaptor complex for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which enhances phosphorylated JNK when overexpressed with WNT16 (Tong2019Wnt16).

In the context of osteoclastogenesis, WNT16 inhibits RANKL-induced NF-kB and NFATc1 signaling in osteoclast precursors and indirectly inhibits osteoclastogenesis by upregulating the expression of OPG, which binds to RANKL and inhibits the RANK-RANKL interaction (Ye2022Wnt16). WNT16 also interacts with intracellular partners such as Galpha subunits and transcription factors like TBX5, TBX15, USF3, TWIST1, and TCF12, which are involved in its signaling network (Ye2022Wnt16). These interactions highlight WNT16's role in regulating bone homeostasis and cartilage integrity.
