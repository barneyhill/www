# OR10H5

## Overview
OR10H5 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily H member 5, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of olfactory signal transduction pathways. These pathways ultimately lead to the perception of smell. The OR10H5 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the vast diversity of olfactory perception by binding specific odorants. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR10H5 has been associated with physiological processes such as cytoskeletal remodeling and airway smooth muscle cell proliferation, which are relevant to conditions like asthma. Additionally, structural variations in the OR10H5 gene have been observed in chimpanzees, suggesting its evolutionary importance in sensory perception (KozlikSiwiec2023CoExpression; Soto2020Identification).

## Function
OR10H5 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR10H5 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory perception (Soto2020Identification).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR10H5 has been implicated in other physiological processes. In the context of asthma, OR10H5 is involved in regulating cytoskeletal remodeling and airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell proliferation. This suggests a potential role in maintaining airway structure and function, which may be relevant to asthma pathogenesis and airway remodeling (KozlikSiwiec2023CoExpression).

The gene has also been studied in relation to structural variations in chimpanzees, where it is affected by deletions. These variations may have implications for the sensory perception of smell, highlighting the evolutionary significance of OR10H5 in olfactory function (Soto2020Identification).
