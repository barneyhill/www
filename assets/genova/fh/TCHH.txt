# TCHH

## Overview
The TCHH gene encodes trichohyalin, a structural protein primarily involved in the organization and integrity of hair follicles. Trichohyalin is categorized as an intermediate filament-associated protein, playing a critical role in the mechanical strength and morphology of hair by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) (Méchin2020Deimination; Ü.2016Mutations). The protein is expressed predominantly in the inner root sheath and medulla of hair follicles, where it undergoes post-translational modifications such as citrullination and cross-linking, which are essential for its function (Lee1993The; Kizawa2011S100). Mutations in the TCHH gene are linked to Uncombable Hair Syndrome, a condition characterized by distinctive hair shaft anomalies (Ü.2016Mutations page 0 of 7).

## Structure
Trichohyalin (TCHH) is a structural protein characterized by a long, segmented, rod-shaped configuration. It consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain with unique periodicities, which is distinct from typical intermediate filament chains (Lee1993The). The protein is composed of nine well-defined domains, with domains 2-4, 6, and 8 being highly charged and adopting an alpha-helical configuration stabilized by intrachain ionic salt bonds and hydrogen bonding from polar glutamine residues (Lee1993The). Domain 6 is particularly regular, featuring eight near-exact 30-residue repeats, suggesting a slow spiral of charged residues around the alpha-helix axis (Lee1993The).

The protein's structure is interrupted by proline residues, introducing bends or kinks, particularly in domains 5 and 7, which may lead to more complex conformations with turns and limited sheet structures (Lee1993The). TCHH contains two EF-hand calcium-binding domains, which are functional in binding calcium, indicating its role as a calcium-binding protein (Lee1993The).

Post-translational modifications of TCHH include the formation of isodipeptide cross-links catalyzed by transglutaminases and the conversion of arginines to citrullines by peptidylarginine deimidase, which significantly alter its charge and stability (Lee1993The). These modifications are calcium-dependent and contribute to the protein's function as an intermediate filament-associated protein (Lee1993The).

## Function
The TCHH gene encodes trichohyalin, a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural organization and integrity of hair follicles. Trichohyalin is primarily expressed in the inner root sheath and medulla of hair follicles, where it contributes to hair morphology by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) (Méchin2020Deimination; Ü.2016Mutations). This interaction is facilitated by the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase 3 (PADI3), which modifies trichohyalin through deimination, converting arginine residues into citrulline. This modification allows trichohyalin to be cross-linked by transglutaminase 3 (TGase 3) to itself, keratins, and other proteins, providing mechanical strength to the hair follicle sheath and supporting hair shaft growth (Méchin2020Deimination; Ü.2016Mutations).

In addition to its role in hair structure, trichohyalin is involved in forming cross-linked homo-oligomers and vacuolated aggregates in the medulla, which entrap air and contribute to thermal insulation (Méchin2020Deimination). The protein's structure includes a central alpha-helical rod domain, which facilitates ionic interactions with KIFs, suggesting its role as an intermediate filament-associated protein (Lee1993The). Trichohyalin's function is essential for maintaining the mechanical properties of hair and ensuring proper hair morphology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TCHH gene, which encodes the structural protein trichohyalin, are associated with Uncombable Hair Syndrome (UHS), a rare hair shaft anomaly. UHS is characterized by dry, frizzy, and unmanageable hair that often improves with age. The condition can be inherited in both autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive patterns (Ü.2016Mutations; Ahmed2019Genetic). 

The TCHH gene mutations lead to a truncated form of trichohyalin, which likely lacks functionality in interacting with keratin intermediate filaments (KIF), essential for hair structure. This disruption results in altered hair shaft morphology, such as longitudinal grooves and heart-shaped cross-sections (Ü.2016Mutations page 4 of 7). A specific nonsense mutation, c.991C>T (p.Gln331*), was identified in a German individual, highlighting the genetic basis of UHS (Ü.2016Mutations page 3 of 7).

UHS is also known as Pili Trianguli et Canaliculi or Spun Glass Hair Syndrome and can be sporadic or inherited. It is associated with other conditions like ectodermal dysplasia, retinal dysplasia, juvenile cataract, and tooth enamel anomalies (Ahmed2019Genetic). The manageability of hair in UHS often improves with age, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms or changes in hair follicles (Ü.2016Mutations page 6 of 7).

## Interactions
Trichohyalin (TCHH) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair follicles and the inner root sheath by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. It forms an interfilamentous matrix by cross-linking to itself and to the head and tail domains of keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical strength of the hair shaft (Gong2018Variation). TCHH also interacts with barrier proteins such as involucrin, serving as a cross-linking protein in the cornified cell envelope of the inner root sheath cells (Gong2018Variation).

TCHH undergoes post-translational modifications, including citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase, which converts arginine residues to citrulline. This modification affects the protein's interactions by making it more soluble and susceptible to cross-linking by transglutaminase (Kizawa2011S100). The presence of calcium-binding motifs in TCHH, known as EF-hands, suggests a role in calcium regulation, which is essential for the activities of enzymes like peptidylarginine deiminase and transglutaminase, both of which are calcium-dependent (Gong2018Variation). These interactions and modifications highlight TCHH's involvement in the regulation of post-translational processes during terminal differentiation in wool fibers (Gong2018Variation).
