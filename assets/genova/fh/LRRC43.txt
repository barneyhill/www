# LRRC43

## Overview
The LRRC43 gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 43, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of LRR motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are often implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response. Although the specific function of LRRC43 is not fully elucidated, proteins in this family are typically involved in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways and may play roles in developmental processes and disease mechanisms. Further research is needed to clarify the precise biological roles and potential clinical significance of LRRC43.
