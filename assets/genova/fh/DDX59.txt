# DDX59

## Overview
DDX59 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 59, a member of the DEAD-box protein family, which is characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD). This protein functions primarily as an RNA helicase, playing a pivotal role in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including RNA splicing, processing, and degradation. DEAD-box helicase 59 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it is involved in the regulation of nuclear non-coding RNAs and the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The gene's significance is underscored by its involvement in critical cellular processes such as the splicing of minor (U12) introns and its association with diseases like Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome and certain cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (Che2024Identification; You2017DDX59; Wheway2019Splicing).

## Function
DDX59 (DEAD-box helicase 59) is a crucial component in the processing and regulation of nuclear non-coding RNAs in human cells. It plays a significant role in the nuclear degradation of the long non-coding RNA MALAT1, particularly when its stability is compromised, indicating its involvement in RNA stability and processing (Che2024Identification). DDX59 is essential for the proper splicing of minor (U12) introns, which affects the RNA Exosome and the Nuclear Exosome Targeting (NEXT) complex. Knockout of DDX59 results in the retention of U12 introns in numerous genes, including those related to ciliary function and Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome, highlighting its role in maintaining RNA homeostasis (Che2024Identification).

DDX59 also influences the 3′-end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), as its knockout leads to the accumulation of 3′-extended precursors of snRNAs like U4atac and U11 (Che2024Identification). This suggests that DDX59 is involved in the regulation of RNA Exosome and NEXT complex functions, further emphasizing its importance in RNA metabolism. The protein is predominantly nuclear, where it facilitates these processes, ensuring proper cellular function (Che2024Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDX59 gene are associated with Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome (OFD), a ciliopathy characterized by developmental abnormalities. Specifically, homozygous deleterious missense variants in the helicase ATP binding domain or helicase C terminus of DDX59 are linked to OFD, resulting in normal cellular localization but abnormal ciliary signaling. In patient fibroblasts lacking DDX59, cilia grow normally but fail to respond to Hedgehog pathway stimulation, indicating a disruption in ciliary function (Wheway2019Splicing). Null variants in DDX59 are associated with a more severe phenotype of OFD, including complex neurological involvement, structural brain anomalies, seizures, and global developmental delay. These brain abnormalities resemble those seen in CADASIL syndrome, suggesting a potential role of DDX59 in Notch signaling regulation (Wheway2019Splicing).

DDX59 is also implicated in cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, where it is overexpressed and promotes DNA replication and cell proliferation. Knockdown of DDX59 in lung cancer cells leads to reduced cell proliferation and tumor growth, highlighting its role in cancer development (You2017DDX59). These findings suggest that DDX59 plays a significant role in both developmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
DDX59, a member of the DEAD-box protein family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in cellular processes. In lung adenocarcinoma, DDX59 interacts with minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins, including MCM2, MCM3, MCM6, and MCM7. These interactions are crucial for the loading of MCM proteins onto chromatin, which is essential for DNA replication efficiency. Knockdown of DDX59 results in reduced levels of chromatin-bound MCM proteins, affecting replication fork speed and origin activity (You2017DDX59).

In the context of nuclear RNA degradation, DDX59 is implicated in the retention of U12 introns within components of the RNA Exosome and the Nuclear Exosome Targeting (NEXT) complex. This suggests a role in minor intron splicing, although no direct physical associations with spliceosomes have been reported, indicating that interactions may be transient (Che2024Identification). DDX59 also influences the degradation of the long non-coding RNA MALAT1, potentially through interactions with the RNA Exosome and NEXT complex components, such as EXOSC1, EXOSC2, and ZCCHC8 (Che2024Identification). These interactions highlight DDX59's involvement in RNA processing pathways.
