# OR10AD1

## Overview
OR10AD1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily AD member 1, which is categorized as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This receptor is part of the olfactory receptor family, which is primarily known for its role in the detection of odorants. However, OR10AD1 is uniquely expressed in the human retina, where it is localized in various nuclear layers and ganglion cells, suggesting a function beyond olfaction (Jovancevic2017Deep). The receptor's presence in the retina implies potential roles in non-olfactory processes, such as chemical sensing in the cerebrospinal fluid or involvement in developmental pathways like axon guidance (Jovancevic2017Deep). Despite its established expression patterns, the precise physiological role of OR10AD1 remains to be fully elucidated, warranting further research into its potential as a therapeutic target (Jovancevic2017Deep).

## Function
OR10AD1 is an olfactory receptor expressed in the human retina, where it is localized in the nuclei of the outer and inner nuclear layers, as well as in ganglion cells. It is associated with the base of the photoreceptor cilia and the nuclear envelope of all retinal nuclei. The most intense expression of OR10AD1 is observed in the nuclei of the inner plexiform layer, which contains bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells (Jovancevic2017Deep). Despite its expression in the retina, OR10AD1 is not directly linked to the sense of smell, suggesting potential non-olfactory functions. These may include roles in detecting chemical changes in cerebrospinal fluid or involvement in developmental processes such as axon guidance (Jovancevic2017Deep).

The exact physiological role of OR10AD1 in healthy human cells remains unclear, but its presence in non-olfactory tissues like the retina indicates a possible unique biological function. The receptor's expression in the retina suggests it could be involved in processes like chemotaxis, apoptosis, and hormone secretion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jovancevic2017Deep).
