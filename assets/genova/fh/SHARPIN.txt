# SHARPIN

## Overview
SHARPIN is a gene that encodes the SHANK-associated RH domain interactor protein, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. The SHARPIN protein is a multifunctional component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), crucial for the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways, which are essential for immune response and inflammation regulation (Yu2022Advances). It also functions as an endogenous inhibitor of β1-integrin activation, thereby regulating cell adhesion and migration (Rantala2011SHARPIN). The protein is characterized by several domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, and a Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Yu2022Advances). Mutations in the SHARPIN gene have been linked to various diseases, including chronic proliferative dermatitis in mice and Alzheimer's disease in humans, as well as being implicated in cancer progression (Sundberg2020Keratinocytespecific; Zhang2020SHARPIN; Park2021A).

## Structure
SHARPIN is a protein composed of 387 amino acids and is a crucial component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) (Yu2022Advances). The protein contains several domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, and a Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) domain (Yu2022Advances). The PH domain has a conserved pleckstrin homology super folding and forms a tetrameric structure, resolved to a resolution of 2.0 Å (Yu2022Advances). The UBL domain interacts with the UBA domain of HOIP, contributing to the stability of the LUBAC complex (Yu2022Advances). The NZF domain is involved in ubiquitin binding, although its full structure has not been fully resolved (Yu2022Advances).

SHARPIN undergoes homo-dimerization through its LUBAC-tethering motifs (LTM), forming a stable globular domain with an antiparallel 2-stranded β-sheet and a 4-helix bundle (Zhang2023Mechanistic). The dimerization is mediated by hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interactions, with key hydrophobic residues forming the core of the dimer (Zhang2023Mechanistic). Phosphorylation of the S165 residue regulates NF-κB signaling but does not affect dimerization (Zhang2023Mechanistic).

## Function
SHARPIN is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is a key component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which is essential for the activation of NF-κB signaling, a pathway crucial for immune responses and inflammation regulation (Yu2022Advances). SHARPIN contributes to the linear ubiquitination of NEMO, a regulator in the NF-κB pathway, facilitating immune responses and protecting against apoptosis due to DNA damage (Yu2022Advances).

In addition to its role in NF-κB signaling, SHARPIN acts as an endogenous inhibitor of β1-integrin activation. It interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α-subunits, preventing the recruitment of Talin and Kindlin, which are necessary for integrin activation. This interaction helps maintain integrins in an inactive state, regulating cell adhesion and migration (Rantala2011SHARPIN).

SHARPIN is also involved in preventing excessive cell death by limiting sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yu2022Advances). It is expressed in various cell types and localizes predominantly in the cytoplasm, but also in cell membrane folds and the nucleus (Yu2022Advances).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SHARPIN gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In mice, mutations in SHARPIN lead to chronic proliferative dermatitis, characterized by multiorgan inflammation and immune system dysregulation (Sundberg2020Keratinocytespecific; Seymour2007Spontaneous). These mutations result in defective T cell development and impaired immunoglobulin isotype switching, contributing to immune deficiencies (Sundberg2020Keratinocytespecific). SHARPIN is also implicated in increased sensitivity to TNF-induced necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (Sundberg2020Keratinocytespecific).

In humans, SHARPIN is linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specific variants, such as rs77359862, are associated with increased cortical atrophy and a higher risk of AD, particularly in East Asian populations (Asanomi2021A; Park2021A). The G186R mutation in SHARPIN has been shown to suppress NF-κB pathway activity and increase amyloid-beta secretion, contributing to AD pathology (Asanomi2024CRISPRCas9mediated).

SHARPIN overexpression is observed in various cancers, including gastric cancer and melanoma, where it promotes tumor progression and is associated with poor prognosis (Zhang2020SHARPIN; Zhou2020SHARPIN). In these cancers, SHARPIN stabilizes β-catenin and interacts with signaling pathways that enhance cell proliferation and migration (Zhang2020SHARPIN; Zhou2020SHARPIN).

## Interactions
SHARPIN is a multifunctional protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing several cellular processes. It is a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), interacting with the HOIP component through its ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) to facilitate NF-κB signaling (Yu2022Advances). SHARPIN also binds to integrins, particularly inhibiting β1-integrin activation by interacting with the cytoplasmic tails of integrin α-subunits. This interaction prevents the recruitment of integrin activators such as Talin and Kindlin, maintaining integrins in an inactive state (Gao2019Sharpin; Rantala2011SHARPIN).

SHARPIN's interaction with integrins is mediated by its UBL domain, which binds to the integrin α-tail, and this binding is crucial for its role in integrin inhibition (De2015Mutually). SHARPIN also forms a complex with kindlin-1, which enhances its binding to the integrin β1 cytoplasmic tail, further inhibiting integrin activation (Gao2019Sharpin). The protein's interactions are mutually exclusive, as it cannot simultaneously bind integrins and RNF31, another LUBAC component (De2015Mutually). These interactions highlight SHARPIN's role as a regulatory hub in cellular signaling pathways, including immune responses and cancer progression (Yu2022Advances).
