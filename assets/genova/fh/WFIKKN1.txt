# WFIKKN1

## Overview
WFIKKN1 is a gene that encodes the protein WAP, follistatin/kazal, immunoglobulin, kunitz and netrin domain containing 1, a multidomain secreted protein known for its role as a potent antagonist of specific growth factors, particularly myostatin and GDF11. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes domains such as whey acidic protein (WAP), follistatin, immunoglobulin, Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, and netrin (NTR) domains, each contributing to its diverse biological functions (Kondás2011Biological; Liepinsh2006Second). WFIKKN1 is primarily expressed in tissues such as the pancreas, liver, thymus, kidney, and lung, and is involved in regulating muscle growth and differentiation by modulating the activity of myostatin and GDF11 (Kondás2008Both; Kondás2011Biological). Through its interactions with these growth factors, WFIKKN1 plays a crucial role in tissue-specific regulatory processes, influencing growth and differentiation in various tissues.

## Structure
The WFIKKN1 protein is a multidomain protein characterized by several distinct domains, including a whey acidic protein (WAP) domain, a follistatin domain, an immunoglobulin domain, two Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains, and a netrin (NTR) domain (Kondás2011Biological; Liepinsh2006Second). The protein is secreted and exhibits a specific domain architecture identical to its closely related counterpart, WFIKKN2 (Kondás2011Biological).

The second Kunitz-type domain (KU2) of WFIKKN1 has been structurally characterized using NMR spectroscopy. It shows a close similarity to the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) in its protease-binding loops, although the side-chain orientation of Trp22 may affect trypsin binding (Liepinsh2006Second). The secondary structure of the KU2 domain includes both β-strands and α-helices, with a unique Trp residue at the P'2 site contributing to its specificity for trypsin (Nagy2003Expression).

WFIKKN1 is known to bind myostatin and GDF11 with high affinity, acting as a potent antagonist to these growth factors. The interactions are primarily mediated by the follistatin and NTR domains (Kondás2011Biological). The protein's expression is prominent in the pancreas, liver, thymus, kidney, and lung (Kondás2011Biological).

## Function
The WFIKKN1 gene encodes a multidomain protein that plays a significant role in regulating growth factors, particularly myostatin and GDF11, which are involved in muscle growth and differentiation. The protein contains several functional domains, including WAP, follistatin, immunoglobulin, Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, and NTR domains, which contribute to its diverse functions (Kondás2008Both; Kondás2011Biological).

WFIKKN1 acts as a potent antagonist to myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth, by binding to its prodomain and mature form with high affinity. This interaction is primarily mediated through the follistatin and NTR domains, allowing WFIKKN1 to modulate myostatin activity and influence muscle development (Szláma2013Latent; Szláma2016Influence). The protein enhances the cleavage of latent myostatin by BMP1, a process further stimulated by heparin, suggesting a role in facilitating the activation of myostatin (Szláma2016Influence).

WFIKKN1 is expressed in various tissues, including the pancreas, liver, thymus, kidney, and lung, but not in the brain or skeletal muscle. In fetal tissues, it is highly expressed in the lung and to a lesser extent in skeletal muscle and liver (Kondás2008Both; Kondás2011Biological). This expression pattern indicates its involvement in tissue-specific regulatory processes, potentially influencing growth and differentiation in these tissues.

## Interactions
WFIKKN1 is known for its interactions with myostatin and its precursor forms, playing a significant role as a myostatin antagonist. It binds to both mature myostatin and the myostatin propeptide, with the follistatin domain primarily responsible for binding mature myostatin and the NTR domain contributing to the interaction with the propeptide (Szláma2013Latent; Kondás2008Both). This interaction is crucial in modulating myostatin activity, as WFIKKN1 can interfere with the release of mature growth factor from the latent complex, providing tighter control over myostatin activity compared to its paralog WFIKKN2 (Szláma2013Latent).

WFIKKN1 also enhances the BMP1-mediated cleavage of latent myostatin, an effect that is further increased by heparin. This enhancement is attributed to the cleavage of WFIKKN1 by BMP1, which generates a KKN1 fragment that acts as a potent enhancer (Szláma2016Influence). The interaction with BMP1 is facilitated by the NTR domain of WFIKKN1, which interacts with the prodomain of latent myostatin, potentially loosening the structure of the homodimeric precursor and making the BMP1-cleavage sites more accessible (Szláma2016Influence). These interactions highlight WFIKKN1's role in regulating the activation of latent myostatin and its potential as an antimyostatic agent.
