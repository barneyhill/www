# TCEA3

## Overview
TCEA3, or transcription elongation factor A3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transcription elongation factor family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. The protein encoded by TCEA3 is involved in facilitating the elongation phase of transcription by RNA polymerase II, particularly in skeletal muscle cells, where it is highly expressed and contributes to muscle development and differentiation (Kazim2020The). TCEA3 interacts with various proteins, including Annexin A1, and influences signaling pathways such as the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway, which are important for cellular differentiation and homeostasis (Ge2019TCEA3). Additionally, TCEA3 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancers and cardiac diseases, where its expression levels and interactions with other proteins can affect disease progression and therapeutic outcomes (Guo2023Identify; Hou2021USP47Mediated; Kazim2020The).

## Function
TCEA3, or transcription elongation factor A3, is a member of the transcription elongation factor family that plays a significant role in the transcriptional regulation process by facilitating RNA polymerase II elongation. In healthy human cells, TCEA3 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, where it promotes myogenesis, indicating its role in muscle development and function (Kazim2020The). During skeletal muscle differentiation, TCEA3 translocates to the nucleus, enhancing the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoters and traveling with elongating RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for efficient gene expression (Kazim2020The).

TCEA3 also interacts with Annexin A1, influencing the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, which is important for muscle differentiation (Ge2019TCEA3). This interaction suggests that TCEA3 is involved in balancing transcriptional programs necessary for normal cellular function (Kazim2020The). TCEA3's expression is regulated by factors such as TBX2 and DNA methylation, and its activity is affected by the deletion of MLL3, a subunit of the COMPASS complex required for H3K4 monomethylation at gene enhancers (Kazim2020The). These regulatory mechanisms highlight TCEA3's involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TCEA3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a pediatric cancer derived from muscle lineage, TCEA3 expression is significantly downregulated. This downregulation is associated with DNA methylation and repression by the oncogene TBX2, contributing to RMS pathogenesis by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation (Kazim2020The). Ectopic expression of TCEA3 in RMS cell lines has been shown to induce apoptosis and increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kazim2020The).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), TCEA3 is involved in modulating cell death. The deubiquitinating enzyme USP47 stabilizes TCEA3, reducing apoptosis and potentially contributing to chemoresistance (Hou2021USP47Mediated). TCEA3 expression is also upregulated in adenomas with early carcinoma, indicating a role in the progression from adenoma to carcinoma in CRC (Urh2021Identification).

In cardiac conditions, TCEA3 is downregulated in heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy, where it plays a protective role by maintaining fatty acid oxidation and reducing oxidative stress. Its expression is negatively correlated with markers of cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting its involvement in heart disease progression (Guo2023Identify).

## Interactions
TCEA3, also known as transcription elongation factor A3, participates in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in transcription regulation. TCEA3 acts as a co-activator for myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) such as MYOG and MYOD1, promoting muscle-specific gene expression. It interacts with these MRFs, facilitating their recruitment to gene promoters like Myog, Lmod2, and Tnni2, which is essential for muscle differentiation (Kazim2019The). TCEA3 also binds to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), traveling with it during transcription elongation, thereby enhancing RNAPII recruitment to MRF-dependent promoters (Kazim2019The).

In addition to its role in muscle differentiation, TCEA3 interacts with Annexin A1 (ANXA1) in the cytoplasm, influencing the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, which is important for cell differentiation (Ge2019TCEA3). TCEA3 is also involved in apoptosis regulation in cancer cells, where it interacts with USP47 in colorectal cancer cells. USP47 deubiquitinates and stabilizes TCEA3, affecting cell death pathways (Hou2021USP47Mediated). These interactions highlight TCEA3's multifaceted role in transcription regulation and cellular processes.
