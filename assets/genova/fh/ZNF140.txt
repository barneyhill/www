# ZNF140

## Overview
ZNF140 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 140, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains and a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences in promoter regions (Nishimura2001Characterization). The KRAB domain is known for its potent transcriptional repression capabilities, often interacting with co-repressors such as TRIM28 to facilitate chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation (Czerwinska2021Low; Vissing1995Repression). ZNF140 is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, indicating its involvement in multiple cellular processes, including cellular differentiation and development (Vissing1995Repression). Additionally, ZNF140 has been implicated in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, where its expression levels are associated with patient survival outcomes, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role (Czerwinska2021Low).

## Structure
ZNF140 is a zinc finger protein composed of 457 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 52.0 kDa. It features 10 contiguous zinc finger domains and a KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domain at the N-terminus (Vissing1995Repression). The zinc finger domains follow the general pattern CXzCXI2HXsH, which is typical for C2-H2 type zinc finger proteins, and are preceded by a conserved seven amino acid H/C link (Vissing1995Repression). These domains are involved in DNA binding, with ZNF140 specifically binding to the F2-3 region of the human FcγRIIB gene promoter (Nishimura2001Characterization).

The KRAB domain in ZNF140 is a potent transcriptional repression domain, composed of two contiguous modules: the KRAB A and B boxes (Vissing1995Repression). This domain is known for its role in transcriptional repression, and when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, it induces almost complete repression (Vissing1995Repression). The KRAB domain is a 75-amino acid region with two predicted amphipathic alpha-helices, and a 45-amino acid segment is necessary and sufficient for its repressive function (Margolin1994Krüppel-associated). The structure of ZNF140 suggests potential for alternative splicing, which could lead to different isoforms (Vissing1995Repression).

## Function
ZNF140 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. It contains a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is known for its role in transcriptional repression (Vissing1995Repression). ZNF140 binds to specific regions of the human FcγRIIB gene promoter, particularly the F2-3 region, where it inhibits transcription by reducing luciferase activity in transfected cells (Nishimura2001Characterization). This binding suggests that ZNF140 plays a significant role in regulating gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of target genes (Nishimura2001Characterization).

The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, indicating its involvement in multiple cellular processes (Vissing1995Repression). ZNF140's repressive function is crucial for maintaining proper gene expression levels, which can impact cellular differentiation and development. Although the precise mechanisms by which ZNF140 exerts its repressive effects in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its interaction with the KRAB domain and its ability to bind DNA suggest a role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Nishimura2001Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF140 has been implicated in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where its expression levels are associated with patient survival outcomes. High expression of ZNF140 is linked to better survival rates and reduced cancer stemness, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role in KIRC (Czerwinska2021Low). The study by Czerwinska and Mackiewicz highlights that ZNF140, along with other KRAB-ZNF transcription factors, is differentially expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal kidney tissues, with some being significantly downregulated in tumors (Czerwinska2021Low).

Despite these findings, the specific clinical significance of ZNF140 gene mutations, expression alterations, or interaction changes in KIRC or other diseases is not well-documented. The research indicates that KRAB-ZNFs, including ZNF140, are rarely mutated in KIRC tumors, which suggests that their role in cancer may be more related to expression levels rather than genetic mutations (Czerwinska2021Low). The potential of ZNF140 as a prognostic marker for KIRC is suggested, but further studies are needed to fully understand its clinical implications (Czerwinska2021Low).

## Interactions
ZNF140 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. It interacts with specific regions of the human FcγRIIB gene promoter, particularly binding to the F2-3 region, to inhibit transcription. This interaction was identified using a one-hybrid assay from a human placenta library, and its repressive activity was confirmed through transfection experiments in JEG-3 cells, where it was shown to inhibit luciferase activity (Nishimura2001Characterization).

ZNF140 contains a KRAB domain, which is known for its transcriptional repression capabilities. This domain facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as TRIM28 (also known as KAP1), which is a co-repressor that forms part of a histone-modifying complex. The interaction between ZNF140 and TRIM28 suggests a role in epigenetic regulation, although specific details of this interaction are not extensively detailed (Czerwinska2021Low).

In addition to its role in transcriptional repression, ZNF140 has been associated with the TRIM28-K304Q mutant, indicating a specific interaction with this mutant form of TRIM28, which affects gene expression in leukemic K562 cells (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
