# CEP164

## Overview
CEP164 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 164, a critical component involved in the formation and function of primary cilia, which are essential microtubule-based sensory organelles present on the surface of many eukaryotic cells. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein and is specifically localized to the distal appendages of mature centrioles, where it plays a pivotal role in ciliogenesis by recruiting necessary proteins for this process (Graser2007Cep164). Beyond its role in ciliogenesis, centrosomal protein 164 is also involved in the DNA damage response, interacting with key components such as ATR and ATRIP to maintain genomic stability (Sivasubramaniam2008Cep164). Mutations in the CEP164 gene are linked to several ciliopathies, including nephronophthisis and Joubert syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health and disease (Devlin2020Embryonic; Mansour2021The).

## Structure
The human gene CEP164 encodes a protein consisting of 1,460 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular mass of 164 kD. The primary structure of CEP164 includes a putative N-terminal WW domain located between residues 57 and 89, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions through recognition of proline-rich motifs. Additionally, the protein contains three coiled-coil regions, which are structural motifs that facilitate the formation of stable, rod-like structures and are often involved in protein oligomerization (Graser2007Cep164).

The secondary structure of CEP164 is characterized by these domains, suggesting specific folding patterns typical of WW domains and coiled-coil regions. Although the tertiary structure is not explicitly detailed, the presence of these domains implies a complex three-dimensional conformation that supports its function in centriole appendage formation (Graser2007Cep164).

CEP164 localizes specifically to the distal appendages of mature centrioles, indicating its role in primary cilium formation. The protein's migration in electrophoresis is slower than expected, possibly due to its acidic isoelectric point of 5.32, and it undergoes mitotic modification, likely phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity during the cell cycle (Graser2007Cep164).

## Function
CEP164, also known as centrosomal protein 164, is a crucial component in the formation and function of primary cilia, which are microtubule-based sensory organelles on the surface of many eukaryotic cells. It localizes specifically to the distal appendages of mature centrioles, playing a pivotal role in ciliogenesis by recruiting proteins necessary for this process (Graser2007Cep164). CEP164 interacts with Rabin 8 and Chibby 1 to recruit Rab8 positive vesicles to the centrosome, essential for basal body anchoring to the plasma membrane and primary cilia development (Devlin2020Embryonic). It also forms a complex with tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) to facilitate the removal of the centriolar capping protein CP110, allowing for intraflagellar transport and axonemal extension (Devlin2020Embryonic).

CEP164 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, retina, and brain, indicating its role in normal development and maintenance of these tissues (Devlin2020Embryonic). In the kidney, it is involved in mechanosensation and chemical signal transduction, crucial for oriented cellular divisions and kidney maintenance (Devlin2020Embryonic). In the brain, CEP164 is implicated in signaling pathways like sonic hedgehog (SHH) and Wnt, which are vital for neuronal patterning, cell proliferation, and migration (Devlin2020Embryonic). Its dysfunction is linked to ciliopathies, such as nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies, characterized by cystogenesis and developmental abnormalities (Devlin2020Embryonic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP164 gene are associated with several ciliopathy syndromes, including nephronophthisis, Senior-Løken syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and Joubert syndrome. These conditions are characterized by defects in primary cilia, leading to a range of clinical manifestations such as progressive cystic kidney disease, retinal dysplasia, and neurological abnormalities (Devlin2020Embryonic; Mansour2021The). In nephronophthisis, CEP164 mutations contribute to kidney fibrosis and cyst formation by disrupting cilia function and DNA damage response, leading to increased apoptosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Slaats2014NephronophthisisAssociated).

CEP164 is also implicated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its deficiency promotes cancer cell proliferation through both cilia-dependent and independent mechanisms. This is linked to the activation of the GLI2-Cyclin D/CDK6 axis, and low CEP164 expression is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients (Kobayashi2020CEP164). In zebrafish and murine models, CEP164 mutations can lead to developmental abnormalities, widespread apoptosis, and enhanced DNA damage signaling, further linking the gene to fibrotic and ciliary dysfunctions (Devlin2020Embryonic; Slaats2014NephronophthisisAssociated).

## Interactions
CEP164 is a centrosomal protein that plays a significant role in DNA damage response and ciliogenesis through its interactions with various proteins. It is known to interact with ATR and ATRIP, key components of the DNA damage response pathway. This interaction is demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, indicating a direct interaction between the N-terminal region of CEP164 and ATRIP (Sivasubramaniam2008Cep164). CEP164 is also associated with ATM and MDC1, forming complexes that are crucial for DNA damage signal transduction and genomic stability (Sivasubramaniam2008Cep164).

In the context of ciliogenesis, CEP164 localizes to the distal appendages of centrioles and is essential for primary cilium formation. It interacts with Cby1, facilitating the recruitment of FAM92A to centrioles, which is crucial for ciliogenesis. This interaction is dependent on CEP164, as its depletion significantly reduces the centriolar localization of FAM92A (Li2016BAR). CEP164 also recruits Cby1 to the distal appendages of nascent basal bodies, aiding in ciliary vesicle formation during multiciliated cell differentiation (Hoque2021CEP164). These interactions highlight CEP164's pivotal role in both DNA damage response and ciliogenesis.
