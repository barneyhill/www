# ACMSD

## Overview
The ACMSD gene encodes the enzyme aminocarboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase, a zinc-dependent enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. This enzyme is crucial for the decarboxylation of 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde, leading to the production of picolinic acid and regulation of quinolinic acid levels, a neurotoxic compound. By modulating quinolinic acid, ACMSD contributes to neurological health and influences the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), an essential coenzyme in cellular metabolism (Egashira2006Differential; Egashira2007Dietary). Structurally, the enzyme is characterized by a distorted (α/β)8 barrel domain and functions as a homodimer, with its activity being influenced by its oligomeric state and environmental conditions (Garavaglia2009The; Yang2019Quaternary). Mutations in the ACMSD gene have been linked to various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease and major depressive disorder, underscoring its clinical significance (ThirtamaraRajamani2017Is; Chen2022Identification).

## Structure
The human ACMSD protein is a zinc-dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation. Its molecular structure includes a distorted (α/β)8 barrel domain, which is a characteristic fold of the metal-dependent amidohydrolase superfamily (Garavaglia2009The; Li2006αAminoβcarboxymuconicεsemialdehyde). The active site of ACMSD is located at the C-terminal opening of the β-barrel and is coordinated by a zinc ion, which interacts with conserved residues such as His6, His8, His174, and Asp291 (Garavaglia2009The; Huo2014Human).

The enzyme functions as a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of 12 α-helices, 11 β-strands, and connecting loops (Cianci2022Structural; Huo2014Human). The dimer interface is primarily hydrophobic and involves significant hydrogen bonding and salt bridges, which are crucial for maintaining the enzyme's quaternary structure (Huo2014Human).

Key residues such as Arg47 and Arg235* are important for substrate binding and catalytic activity, as mutations in these residues result in loss of function (Huo2014Human). The enzyme's structure and function are further influenced by the presence of a conserved water molecule in the active site, which is involved in the coordination of the zinc ion (Cianci2022Structural).

## Function
The ACMSD gene encodes the enzyme aminocarboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase, which plays a crucial role in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde to produce picolinic acid, thereby regulating the levels of quinolinic acid, a neurotoxic compound. By controlling quinolinic acid levels, ACMSD contributes to maintaining neurological health (Egashira2007Dietary).

ACMSD activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm of cells, where it influences the conversion of tryptophan to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), an essential coenzyme in cellular metabolism. The enzyme's activity is inversely related to NAD production; lower ACMSD activity results in increased NAD synthesis (Egashira2006Differential). This regulation is significant because NAD is vital for various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and DNA repair.

In the liver, ACMSD activity is relatively low, which facilitates the conversion of tryptophan to NAD, highlighting the liver's role in maintaining systemic NAD levels (Egashira2006Differential). The enzyme's function is modulated by various factors, including dietary components and drugs, which can alter its expression and activity (Egashira2007Dietary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ACMSD gene have been implicated in several neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the ACMSD gene, such as rs6430538, which are associated with an increased risk of PD (ThirtamaraRajamani2017Is). Specific mutations, including p.Trp26Stop and p.Glu298Lys, have been linked to familial and sporadic cases of PD, suggesting that reduced ACMSD function might contribute to the disease's pathogenesis (ThirtamaraRajamani2017Is; Venkatesan2020Kynurenine).

The ACMSD gene is also associated with familial cortical myoclonic tremor and epilepsy (FCMTE). A mutation resulting in a premature stop codon, Trp26Stop, leads to impaired enzymatic function and is considered a causative genetic alteration in FCMTE (Boros2018Genetic).

In major depressive disorder (MDD), a SNP in the ACMSD gene, rs12622574, has been associated with the condition, particularly in East Asian populations. This variant may influence ACMSD expression and enzyme activity, potentially linking ACMSD function to NAD deficiency and MDD (Chen2022Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ACMSD in various diseases, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The human gene ACMSD encodes the enzyme α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase, which plays a critical role in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. This enzyme is involved in the decarboxylation of 2-amino 3-carboxymuconate 6-semialdehyde to 2-aminomuconate-6-semialdehyde, influencing NAD+ biosynthesis (Cianci2022Structural). ACMSD functions as a zinc-dependent enzyme, with zinc ions enhancing its catalytic efficiency. The enzyme's active site is characterized by a Zn2+ metal ion coordinated by several histidine residues and an aspartate moiety, which are crucial for its activity (Cianci2022Structural; Huo2014Human).

ACMSD exists in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with the dimeric form being functionally competent. The dimeric structure is necessary for the enzyme's activity, as conserved arginine residues play crucial roles in substrate binding (Huo2014Human). The enzyme's activity is regulated by its oligomeric state, with higher-order structures like tetramers exhibiting higher specific activity than dimers (Yang2019Quaternary). The quaternary structure of ACMSD, particularly its oligomerization, is influenced by environmental conditions such as pH and ionic strength, which affect the distribution of its oligomeric states (Yang2019Quaternary).
