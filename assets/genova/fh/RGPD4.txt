# RGPD4

## Overview
RGPD4 is a gene that encodes the protein RANBP2-like and GRIP domain-containing 4, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those associated with the nuclear envelope. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), RanBD1 domains, and a GRIP domain, which facilitate its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and protein-protein interactions (Van2020Intrinsic). The RGPD4 protein is notable for its high level of intrinsic disorder, especially in its C-terminal region, which contains numerous Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) and post-translational modification sites, indicating a complex interaction network (Van2020Intrinsic). While the gene is expressed at higher levels in the human brain compared to other primates, suggesting a potential role in human-specific brain functions, its precise physiological function remains largely speculative (Tajeddin2023Novel). RGPD4 has been implicated in various diseases, including systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) and potentially in neurodevelopmental disorders, although its role in these conditions requires further investigation (Bruno2021New; Wang2022Exome).

## Structure


## Function
The RGPD4 gene encodes a protein that is involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the context of the nuclear envelope. It plays a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is crucial for the movement of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular signaling pathways (Van2020Intrinsic). The RGPD4 protein contains two tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), two RanBD1 domains, and a GRIP domain. The TPRs facilitate protein-protein interactions, while the RanBD1 domains bind to Ran, a Ras-related GTPase, enhancing the rate of RanGAP1-induced GTP hydrolysis. The GRIP domain is involved in binding to Golgi membranes (Van2020Intrinsic).

RGPD4 is characterized by a high level of intrinsic disorder, particularly in its C-terminal half, which contains numerous Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) that enable intrinsic-disorder-based interactions. This region also hosts many post-translational modification sites, indicating a complex interaction network involving 34 proteins/genes and 235 interactions (Van2020Intrinsic). The gene's expression is notably higher in the human brain compared to other primates, suggesting a potential role in human-specific brain functions (Tajeddin2023Novel). However, the precise physiological function of RGPD4 in healthy human cells remains largely speculative (Tajeddin2023Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RGPD4 gene have been associated with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). Studies have identified rare functional variants in RGPD4, including missense and truncating mutations, particularly in the RanBD1 domain, which are significantly associated with SSc-ILD. These mutations are rare in the general population and show a female predisposition among carriers. The research suggests that RGPD4 mutations may contribute to the development of SSc-ILD and possibly other conditions related to androgen levels, as there is a noted correlation between RGPD4 mutations and lower testosterone levels in affected patients (Wang2022Exome).

RGPD4 has also been mentioned in the context of congenital heart defects, although its association is not significant. A meta-analysis indicated that RGPD4 does not have a substantial link to congenital cardiac defects, as evidenced by its low occurrence in affected cases compared to controls (Thorsson2014Chromosomal).

In the realm of neurodevelopmental disorders, RGPD4 has been identified as a gene of interest in studies on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). Variants of uncertain significance in RGPD4 have been noted, suggesting a potential, albeit unconfirmed, role in these conditions (Bruno2021New).

## Interactions
RGPD4 is involved in a complex network of protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by RGPD4 contains domains such as tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), RanBD1 domains, and a GRIP domain, which facilitate interactions with other proteins and Golgi membranes (Van2020Intrinsic). RGPD4 is part of a highly interconnected protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that includes 34 proteins/genes and 235 interactions, with an average node degree of 13.8, indicating a robust interaction network (Van2020Intrinsic).

RGPD4 interacts with several proteins, including SUMO1, UBE2I, RAN, and XPO1. These interactions are associated with various malignant diseases, such as tumors in the respiratory and urinary systems, and are potentially involved in the negative regulation of the androgen receptor (Wang2022Exome). The protein's interactions are also linked to androgen biosynthesis and metabolism genes, such as CYB5A, CYP3A5, COMT, and STS, mediated by microRNAs (Wang2022Exome). These interactions suggest a role for RGPD4 in hormone regulation and disease pathogenesis, particularly in conditions like systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) (Wang2022Exome).
