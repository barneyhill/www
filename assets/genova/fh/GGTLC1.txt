# GGTLC1

## Overview
GGTLC1 is a gene that encodes the gamma-glutamyltransferase light chain 1, a protein that belongs to the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the metabolism of glutathione, an essential antioxidant that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting cells from oxidative damage. Unlike other GGT family members, GGTLC1 is unique in that it encodes only the light chain of the GGT enzyme, which is the catalytically active component. However, due to the absence of the large subunit, GGTLC1 may not exhibit the same enzymatic activities as full-length GGT proteins (Heisterkamp2008The; Du2022Identification; Ikeda2023The). Despite this, the gene is considered potentially functional, and its precise role in cellular processes remains an area of ongoing research (Heisterkamp2008The).

## Structure


## Function
The GGTLC1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) family, specifically involved in the metabolism of glutathione, a critical antioxidant in cells. GGTLC1 is categorized as a light-chain-only gene, which means it encodes only the light chain of the GGT enzyme. This light chain is the catalytically active part of the GGT1 protein, which plays a significant role in glutathione metabolism and cellular redox status, crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress (Heisterkamp2008The; Du2022Identification).

While the specific function of GGTLC1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, it is suggested that the light-chain-only genes, including GGTLC1, are unlikely to exhibit the same enzymatic activities as full-length GGT proteins. This is because the enzymatic activities typically involve amino acid residues located in the large subunit, which GGTLC1 lacks (Ikeda2023The). Despite this, GGTLC1 is considered potentially functional due to its sequence similarity to other active GGT genes (Heisterkamp2008The). The exact role of GGTLC1 in cellular processes and its impact on organismal outcomes remain areas for further research.
