# GTF2H3

## Overview
GTF2H3 is a gene that encodes the protein known as general transcription factor IIH subunit 3, which is a critical component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the processes of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and nucleotide excision repair (NER) of DNA, making it essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Di2016Transcriptome; Silva2014Evolutionary). As part of the TFIIH complex, GTF2H3 interacts with other subunits to facilitate DNA unwinding and repair, underscoring its importance in both gene expression regulation and DNA damage response (Rimel2018The). The evolutionary conservation of GTF2H3 across various species highlights its fundamental role in cellular processes, and its dysfunction is associated with several clinical conditions, including trichothiodystrophy and xeroderma pigmentosum (Wood2001Human; Silva2014Evolutionary).

## Function
GTF2H3 is a component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of DNA. This gene is involved in unwinding DNA around the transcription start site, facilitating the transcription process (Silva2014Evolutionary). GTF2H3 is essential for DNA repair mechanisms, particularly in repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks and other lesions, thereby maintaining genome stability (Di2016Transcriptome).

In healthy human cells, GTF2H3 is active in the cell nucleus, where it contributes to gene expression regulation and DNA repair processes. It is part of the core subcomplex of TFIIH, which includes other proteins such as p44, p52, and XPB, and is involved in both transcription and DNA repair activities (Silva2014Evolutionary). The evolutionary conservation of GTF2H3 across species, such as humans and zebrafish, underscores its critical function in cellular processes, highlighting its role in transcription and DNA repair (Silva2014Evolutionary).

GTF2H3's involvement in these fundamental processes is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing genomic instability, which can lead to various diseases if disrupted (Wood2001Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the GTF2H3 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. GTF2H3 is a component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which is essential for transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair. Dysregulation of GTF2H3 can lead to disorders such as trichothiodystrophy and xeroderma pigmentosum, characterized by sensitivity to UV light and neurological abnormalities due to impaired DNA repair mechanisms.

In the context of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), a novel fusion gene involving GTF2H3 and SETD1B has been identified in a patient with polycythemia vera (PV). This fusion gene results from a heterozygous deletion at 12q24.31, juxtaposing the SETD1B gene at intron 11 with the GTF2H3 gene at intron 5, creating a fusion transcript with potential implications in disease pathogenesis (Tiziana2014Complex). The presence of this fusion gene suggests a possible role for GTF2H3 in the development or progression of MPNs, although its exact clinical significance requires further investigation (AlDewik2019Clinical; Tiziana2014Complex). The unique genetic pool in Qatar, characterized by high consanguinity, has facilitated the identification of such novel variants, contributing to a better understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations in MPNs (AlDewik2019Clinical).

## Interactions
GTF2H3 is a component of the TFIIH complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription initiation and DNA repair processes. Within the TFIIH complex, GTF2H3 interacts with other subunits such as XPB and XPD, which are essential for the complex's helicase activities and DNA damage response (Rimel2018The). The TFIIH complex is involved in the phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) through the action of CDK7, a kinase associated with TFIIH. This phosphorylation is critical for transcription regulation and is influenced by interactions with histone methyltransferases like SETD2 and SETD1A/B, affecting chromatin marks linked to DNA methylation and splicing (Rimel2018The).

TFIIH also interacts with the TFIIE and Mediator complexes. TFIIE assists in recruiting TFIIH to promoters and facilitates DNA opening, while the Mediator complex stimulates CDK7 activity and may help position the CTD for phosphorylation (Rimel2018The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of GTF2H3 within the TFIIH complex, contributing to its functions in transcription regulation and DNA repair. However, specific interactions of GTF2H3 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its role in the TFIIH complex are not detailed in the provided context.
