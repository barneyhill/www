# TRIB3

## Overview
TRIB3 is a gene that encodes the protein tribbles pseudokinase 3, a member of the pseudokinase family characterized by its lack of catalytic activity despite having a kinase-like structure. The TRIB3 gene is involved in various cellular processes through its regulatory functions, primarily acting as a scaffold protein that influences multiple signaling pathways. The protein encoded by TRIB3, tribbles pseudokinase 3, plays a crucial role in modulating pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK, impacting cell survival, metabolism, and stress responses (HernándezQuiles2021Comprehensive; Mondal2016Tripping). TRIB3's interactions with other proteins, including transcription factors and signaling molecules, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell fate decisions. Dysregulation of TRIB3 expression or function has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Yu2020TRIB3EGFR; Prudente2012The).

## Structure
TRIB3 is a pseudokinase protein encoded by the TRIB3 gene, characterized by a central pseudokinase domain flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal regions. The pseudokinase domain, although structurally similar to active kinases, lacks the conserved motifs necessary for catalytic activity, such as the DFG motif, and is therefore classified as a pseudokinase (Mondal2016Tripping; Lohan2013The). This domain serves as a binding platform for kinase-dependent proteins, influencing their phosphorylation and function (Mondal2016Tripping).

The N-terminal region of TRIB3 contains a PEST sequence, which is involved in protein degradation, and a nuclear localization signal, allowing TRIB3 to interact with nuclear transcription factors (HernándezQuiles2021Comprehensive; Mondal2016Tripping). The C-terminal region includes binding sites for MAPK proteins and the COP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitin-mediated degradation (HernándezQuiles2021Comprehensive; Eyers2017Tribbles).

TRIB3's structure is largely unstructured in the N- and C-terminal domains, making its 3D conformation difficult to predict from the amino acid sequence (HernándezQuiles2021Comprehensive). Despite its lack of catalytic activity, TRIB3 functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes and modulating various signaling pathways (Lohan2013The).

## Function
TRIB3 (tribbles pseudokinase 3) is a regulatory protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with key signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, TRIB3 plays a significant role in modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell survival, metabolism, and stress responses (Mondal2016Tripping). It acts as a negative regulator of AKT, inhibiting insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, which contributes to insulin resistance and affects glucose metabolism (Zhang2017TRIB3).

TRIB3 is also involved in the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, interacting with proteins such as MKNK1 and MKNK2, which are important for cellular stress responses and differentiation (HernándezQuiles2021Comprehensive). In the context of osteogenic differentiation, TRIB3 inhibits cell proliferation and promotes differentiation by regulating ERK1/2 activity, a component of the MAPK pathway (Zhang2017TRIB3).

The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes like apoptosis, autophagy, and transcriptional regulation. TRIB3 interacts with various transcription factors and regulators, such as ATF4 and PPARγ, impacting cellular metabolism and differentiation (Butcher2017Evidence; Mondal2016Tripping). These interactions highlight TRIB3's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell fate decisions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the TRIB3 gene, including mutations and changes in expression levels, have been implicated in various diseases. The Q84R polymorphism in TRIB3 is a gain-of-function mutation associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, which are risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases. This variant is linked to increased risk of myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerosis, as indicated by increased carotid intima-media thickness (Prudente2012The).

In cancer, TRIB3 expression is often dysregulated. High TRIB3 expression correlates with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer, where it promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inhibiting apoptosis. This is linked to the MAPK signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Wang2020Downregulation). In non-small cell lung cancer, TRIB3 enhances EGFR recycling and stability, contributing to cancer progression and resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies (Yu2020TRIB3EGFR).

TRIB3 is also involved in metabolic disorders. Overexpression is observed in tissues of individuals with insulin resistance and T2DM, correlating with decreased insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose metabolism (Prudente2012The). TRIB3's role in endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis further links it to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (Prudente2012The).

## Interactions
TRIB3 (tribbles pseudokinase 3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with β-catenin and TCF4 in colorectal cancer, forming a complex that enhances the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin-TCF4 complex, promoting cancer stem cell features and tumorigenesis (Hua2019TRIB3). This interaction is part of a positive feedback loop where Wnt signaling up-regulates TRIB3, enhancing its stability and promoting cancer progression (Hua2019TRIB3).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TRIB3 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), forming a complex that enhances EGFR recycling and stability. This interaction prevents EGFR degradation and supports NSCLC progression by maintaining EGFR signaling activity (Yu2020TRIB3EGFR).

TRIB3 also interacts with SQSTM1/p62 in liver fibrosis, where it hinders autophagic degradation of late endosomes, leading to the accumulation of SQSTM1 aggregates and promoting exosome secretion. This interaction is linked to the activation of hepatic stellate cells, contributing to liver fibrosis (Zhang2019Disrupting). These interactions highlight TRIB3's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes across different cancer types and fibrotic conditions.
