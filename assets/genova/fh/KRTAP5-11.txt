# KRTAP5-11

## Overview
KRTAP5-11 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 5-11, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral to the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair fibers, interacting with keratin intermediate filaments to form the hair and nails. The KRTAP5-11 gene is specifically expressed in the hair follicle, where it plays a significant role in the formation of the hair shaft, influencing hair texture and strength. The protein encoded by KRTAP5-11 is crucial for maintaining the structural properties of hair, although the precise molecular mechanisms and interactions in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
KRTAP5-11 is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair fibers. These proteins interact with keratin intermediate filaments to form the hair and nails, contributing to their strength and texture. KRTAP5-11 is specifically expressed in the hair follicle, where it is involved in the formation of the hair shaft. This protein influences hair texture and strength by binding to keratin filaments, thereby affecting the overall structure and resilience of hair. The precise molecular processes involving KRTAP5-11 in healthy human cells are not detailed in the provided context, but its role in hair shaft formation suggests it is integral to maintaining the structural properties of hair. The gene's function in healthy cells is primarily associated with its expression in the hair follicle, indicating its importance in hair biology and its potential impact on hair-related traits. The context does not provide specific details on the molecular activities of KRTAP5-11 beyond its involvement in hair structure, nor does it elaborate on its cellular localization or interactions in other tissues. I cannot provide further details on its function in healthy human cells based on the available context.
