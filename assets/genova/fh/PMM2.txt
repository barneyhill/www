# PMM2

## Overview
The PMM2 gene encodes the enzyme phosphomannomutase 2, which is a critical component in the glycosylation pathway of human cells. This enzyme is categorized as an isomerase, specifically involved in the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, a precursor for GDP-mannose synthesis. GDP-mannose is essential for the formation of N-linked glycans, which are crucial for proper protein glycosylation. The PMM2 protein functions as a homodimer, and its activity is vital for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids, impacting cell structure and function. Mutations in the PMM2 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, such as PMM2-CDG, which manifest in a wide range of clinical symptoms due to impaired glycosylation processes (Vega2011Expression; Grünewald2009The; Kjaergaard1999Carbohydratedeficient).

## Structure
The PMM2 protein, encoded by the PMM2 gene, is crucial for glycosylation processes, converting mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate. The primary structure of PMM2 consists of 246 amino acids with a molecular mass of 28,114 Da, sharing approximately 66% sequence similarity with its isoenzyme PMM1 (Thirumal2020Identification). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function.

The tertiary structure of PMM2 is characterized by a conserved dimer interface, active sites, and hinge regions, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Thirumal2020Identification). The protein forms a homodimer, which is a critical aspect of its quaternary structure, allowing it to function effectively in its biological role (Vega2011Expression).

Structurally, PMM2 has a core domain and a cap domain, with the cap domain exhibiting a unique topology conserved across similar enzymes (Kedzierski2006Structure). The dimer interface and active-site motifs are conserved, ensuring the protein's stability and catalytic efficiency (Silvaggi2006The). These structural features are vital for the protein's role in glycosylation and its interaction with substrates and potential inhibitors.

## Function
Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the glycosylation process in human cells. It catalyzes the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, a key step in the synthesis of guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-mannose. GDP-mannose is essential for the formation of N-linked glycans, which are crucial for proper protein glycosylation (Quental2010Evolutionary; Vega2011Expression; Kjaergaard1999Carbohydratedeficient). 

PMM2 is active in the cytoplasm and functions as a dimer, which is necessary for its enzymatic activity (Andreotti2015Heterodimerization). The enzyme's activity is vital for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are important for cell structure and function (PIRARD1999Kinetic). In healthy human cells, PMM2 ensures the proper transfer of N-linked oligosaccharides to proteins, affecting protein folding, stability, and function (Andreotti2015Heterodimerization; Vega2011Expression).

Deficiency in PMM2 activity can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations due to impaired glycosylation of proteins (Grünewald2009The; Vega2011Expression). The enzyme is expressed in most human tissues, although at low levels in the brain (Quental2010Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PMM2 gene are primarily associated with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ia (CDG-Ia), also known as PMM2-CDG. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme phosphomannomutase 2, leading to hypoglycosylation of glycoproteins and affecting multiple body systems (Altassan2019International; Matthijs2000Mutations). Clinical manifestations of PMM2-CDG include developmental delays, neurological symptoms such as cerebellar atrophy, hypotonia, and ataxia, as well as systemic issues like abnormal fat distribution and dysmorphic features (Altassan2019International; Pettinato2021Clinical).

The condition presents a wide phenotypic spectrum, ranging from severe neonatal symptoms to milder adult manifestations. Common neurological features include intellectual disability, peripheral neuropathy, and cerebellar atrophy, which are often associated with functional disabilities (Pettinato2021Clinical). The disorder has a high mortality rate in early childhood due to complications such as severe infections and liver insufficiency (Matthijs2000Mutations).

PMM2 is notably tolerant to missense mutations, and the identification of genetic modifiers could aid in the diagnosis and management of PMM2-CDG (Citro2018The). Despite the large number of mutations identified, establishing a clear genotype-phenotype correlation remains challenging due to clinical heterogeneity and the influence of other genetic factors (YusteCheca2015The).

## Interactions
Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) is known to participate in interactions that are crucial for its function in glycosylation. PMM2 functions as a dimer, and its activity is dependent on this dimeric structure. Mutations in PMM2 can affect its ability to dimerize, which in turn impacts its enzymatic activity. For instance, the F119L mutation affects dimerization when present in both subunits of a homodimer but has a less damaging effect when present in a heterodimer with a wild-type subunit. The R141H mutation, although largely inactive, can enhance the activity of the F119L mutant by promoting the formation of heterodimers, suggesting a compensatory interaction between these two mutants (Andreotti2015Heterodimerization).

The interaction between PMM2 mutants and molecular chaperones is also significant. Proteostasis regulators like celastrol have been shown to stabilize PMM2 mutants by modulating the proteostasis network, which includes molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90. Celastrol increases PMM2 protein concentration and activity, likely through Hsp90-driven modulation, highlighting the role of chaperone interactions in maintaining PMM2 stability and function (Vilas2020Proteostasis). These interactions are essential for the proper folding and function of PMM2, especially in the context of mutations that lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation.
