# CNMD

## Overview
The CNMD gene encodes chondromodulin, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in cartilage homeostasis and angiogenesis inhibition. Chondromodulin is predominantly expressed in avascular tissues such as cartilage and cardiac valves, where it contributes to the regulation of endochondral ossification by preventing vascular invasion. The protein is initially synthesized as a precursor with a transmembrane region and a BRICHOS domain, which is subsequently cleaved to produce a mature form that functions in the extracellular matrix. This mature form is characterized by its anti-angiogenic properties, which are essential for maintaining the avascular nature of cartilage and cardiac valves. The expression of CNMD is regulated by transcription factors like Sox9 and Sp3, which are crucial for chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage integrity (Reyes2024A; Zhu2019Chondromodulin1).

## Structure
The CNMD protein is initially synthesized as a 334 amino acid type II transmembrane glycoprotein. It features a transmembrane region between amino acids 45-65 and a BRICHOS domain from amino acids 104 to 201. The mature form of CNMD begins at the furin cleavage site at position 215 and consists of 120 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 25 kDa (Reyes2024A; Zhu2019Chondromodulin1). The mature CNMD protein is composed of two main domains: a hydrophilic glycosylation domain of 50 amino acids, which includes an N-glycosylated site, and a cysteine-rich hydrophobic domain of 70 amino acids containing four disulfide bonds crucial for its anti-angiogenic function (Reyes2024A).

The secondary structure of CNMD includes alpha-helices in regions 45-65 and 110-120, and three beta-sheets from 70-100. The protein is globular and stable due to disulfide bridges in its C-terminal domain (Reyes2024A). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, but specific details are not extensively covered (Reyes2024A). CNMD is known to function as a monomer, as there is no mention of a quaternary structure (Reyes2024A).

## Function
Chondromodulin (CNMD) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein primarily involved in maintaining cartilage homeostasis and inhibiting angiogenesis. It is predominantly expressed in avascular cartilage and cardiac valves, where it plays a crucial role in endochondral ossification by regulating the formation of new blood vessels (Zhu2019Chondromodulin1). CNMD promotes chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, contributing to cartilage growth and preventing vascular invasion during bone formation (Reyes2024A; Zhu2019Chondromodulin1). 

The mature form of CNMD, a 25 kDa glycoprotein, is found in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of avascular cartilage, where it exerts anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities (Reyes2024A; Zhu2019Chondromodulin1). CNMD's anti-angiogenic properties are crucial for maintaining the avascular nature of cartilage, acting as a barrier against angiogenic factors such as VEGF and FGF-2 (Kusafuka2002Cartilagespecific). 

In addition to its role in cartilage, CNMD is involved in maintaining the avascularity of cardiac valves, preventing neovascularization and calcification (Reyes2024A). Its expression is regulated by transcription factors such as Sox9 and Sp3, which are essential for chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage integrity (Zhu2019Chondromodulin1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CNMD gene, which encodes chondromodulin-I, have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly osteoarthritis (OA). In OA, the expression of CNMD is downregulated, which correlates with increased disease severity and cartilage degradation. This downregulation is associated with increased angiogenesis in cartilage, as CNMD normally inhibits vascular invasion, a process that is disrupted in OA (Reyes2024A). The loss of CNMD expression in OA leads to an increase in angiogenic factors such as VEGFA, contributing to the pathological changes observed in the disease (Reyes2024A).

In addition to its role in OA, CNMD is crucial for proper cartilage callus formation during bone healing processes, such as distraction osteogenesis. In CNMD-deficient mice, there is a delay in bone healing and remodeling, with a tendency for fibrous rather than cartilage callus formation. This suggests that CNMD is essential for chondrogenesis under mechanical stress and that its deficiency can impair bone repair (Yukata2023Chondromodulin). These findings highlight the potential of CNMD as a therapeutic target for conditions involving cartilage degradation and impaired bone healing.
