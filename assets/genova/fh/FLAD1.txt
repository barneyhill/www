# FLAD1

## Overview
The FLAD1 gene encodes flavin adenine dinucleotide synthetase 1 (FADS), an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) from flavin mononucleotide (FMN). FADS is categorized as a synthetase enzyme, essential for mitochondrial energy metabolism and cellular redox processes. The enzyme is characterized by its two main domains: the N-terminal molybdopterin binding (MPTb) domain and the C-terminal 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase domain, which are crucial for its function in FAD synthesis and release (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive). FLAD1 produces multiple isoforms, including mitochondrial and cytosolic forms, which are vital for maintaining cellular FAD homeostasis and the functionality of the flavoproteome (Leone2019Mutation). Mutations in FLAD1 are linked to metabolic disorders such as multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) and have implications in cancer prognosis (Kim2023OGT; Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive).

## Structure
The FLAD1 gene encodes flavin adenine dinucleotide synthetase 1 (FADS), an enzyme crucial for FAD biosynthesis. The FLAD1 protein contains two main domains: the N-terminal molybdopterin binding (MPTb) domain and the C-terminal 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase domain, also known as the FADS domain. The MPTb domain is suggested to have FAD hydrolase activity, which may be important for optimal FAD release to apoproteins, while the FADS domain is sufficient to catalyze FAD synthesis (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive).

FLAD1 produces two protein isoforms: FADS1 and FADS2. FADS1 includes a mitochondrial targeting sequence, whereas FADS2 results from an additional intron interrupting exon 1. Both isoforms contain the MPTb and FADS domains (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive). The existence of different isoforms and their expression levels, particularly in affected tissues, might influence the severity of diseases associated with FLAD1 variants (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive).

The FLAD1 protein binds FAD tightly but not covalently, and FAD release is likely controlled by specific conditions, including the redox state. This binding assists in the folding of apoproteins into stable and functional flavoenzymes (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive). The study of FLAD1 variants has identified frameshift variants and single amino acid changes that affect the protein's function and stability (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive).

## Function
The FLAD1 gene encodes flavin adenine dinucleotide synthetase 1 (FADS), an enzyme crucial for the synthesis of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) from flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in human cells. FAD is an essential cofactor involved in various enzymatic reactions, particularly those related to mitochondrial energy metabolism and cellular redox processes (Zhang2021Flavin; Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive). 

In healthy cells, FLAD1 ensures the proper synthesis and supply of FAD, which is vital for the functionality of the flavoproteome, especially in mitochondria (Leone2019Mutation). The enzyme is involved in the electron transport chain and fatty acid oxidation, playing a significant role in energy production and metabolic regulation (Kim2023OGT; Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive). 

FLAD1 produces different isoforms of FAD synthase, including mitochondrial and cytosolic forms, each with specific domain structures and functions. The most abundant isoform, hFADS2, is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes FAD synthesis through a bi-bi ordered kinetics mechanism (Leone2019Mutation). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular FAD homeostasis, which is necessary for the proper function of mitochondrial dehydrogenases and other flavoproteins (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FLAD1 gene are associated with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) and combined respiratory-chain deficiency. These conditions are characterized by metabolic myopathy, lipid storage, and respiratory-chain dysfunction, often presenting with symptoms such as hypotonia, swallowing and speech difficulties, scoliosis, and respiratory insufficiencies (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive). Some individuals with FLAD1 mutations respond to riboflavin treatment, which can improve protein stability and ameliorate symptoms, although the effectiveness varies among individuals (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive).

The clinical heterogeneity observed in patients with FLAD1 mutations is linked to an allelic series of variants, including transcript-specific frameshift variants and single amino acid changes. Frameshift variants affecting the MPTb domain result in more severe disease compared to single amino acid changes in the FADS domain (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive). Despite reduced FAD synthesis rates in fibroblasts from affected individuals, some mutations allow for the expression of functional FADS from FLAD1 variants predicted to cause complete loss of function (Olsen2016RiboflavinResponsive).

In addition to metabolic disorders, FLAD1 has been implicated in cancer, where its expression is associated with the survival of malignant tumor cells in several cancers, including prostate cancer, where it serves as a prognostic marker (Kim2023OGT).
