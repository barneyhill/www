# DCDC2C

## Overview
DCDC2C is a gene that encodes the protein doublecortin domain containing 2C, which is part of the doublecortin (DCX) protein family. This family is characterized by its role in microtubule dynamics, crucial for maintaining cell structure and facilitating intracellular transport. The DCDC2C protein is involved in stabilizing microtubules, acting as a balancing system for their depolymerization and polymerization, which is essential for proper cell function and structure (Gòdia2019Identification). Additionally, DCDC2C is implicated in neuronal migration, a key process in brain development, although its specific functions in this context are not fully understood (Schormair2017Identification). The gene's involvement in these cellular processes highlights its potential significance in developmental pathways and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

## Function
DCDC2C is a gene that encodes a protein involved in microtubule dynamics, which are crucial for various cellular processes. Proteins with doublecortin domains, such as DCDC2C, typically play roles in stabilizing microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cell structure and facilitating intracellular transport. In healthy human cells, DCDC2C is suggested to influence microtubule dynamics by acting as a depolymerization/polymerization balancing system, which is important for maintaining proper cell function and structure (Gòdia2019Identification).

DCDC2C is also implicated in neuronal migration, a critical process in brain development. Although the specific function of DCDC2C in neuronal migration is not fully detailed, it is part of the doublecortin (DCX) protein family, which is known to be involved in cell adhesion and axonal growth, processes that are vital for neurodevelopmental outcomes (Schormair2017Identification). The gene's role in these processes suggests its potential involvement in developmental pathways and its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. However, the exact molecular activities and cellular localization of DCDC2C in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.
