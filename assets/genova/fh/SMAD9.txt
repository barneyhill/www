# SMAD9

## Overview
SMAD9 is a gene that encodes the SMAD family member 9 protein, a critical component of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which is part of the larger transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. The SMAD9 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator and is distinct from other receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) due to its role as a transcriptional repressor. It achieves this by forming complexes with other SMAD proteins, such as SMAD1 and SMAD4, to modulate the expression of target genes in response to BMP signals. The protein is characterized by its two MAD-homology (MH) domains, which are essential for DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, respectively. SMAD9 is expressed in various tissues, including bone, where it plays a significant role in bone formation and maintenance. Mutations in the SMAD9 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as high bone mass phenotype and pulmonary arterial hypertension, highlighting its importance in human health and disease (McDonald2021Pharmacological; Gregson2019A; Tsukamoto2014Smad9).

## Structure
The SMAD9 protein, encoded by the human SMAD9 gene, is a member of the SMAD family involved in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. It consists of 467 amino acids and features two MAD-homology (MH) domains: the MH1 domain, responsible for DNA binding, and the MH2 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions (Aashaq2021TGF‐β; Gregson2019A). These domains are connected by a linker region, which is shorter in SMAD9 compared to other SMAD proteins like SMAD1 and SMAD5, contributing to its unique functional properties (Tsukamoto2014Smad9).

The MH1 domain of SMAD9 is located at the N-terminal and is crucial for its DNA-binding capability. A specific mutation, p.Leu22Pro, within this domain disrupts the α-helical fold, potentially leading to a loss of DNA binding and protein instability (Gregson2019A). SMAD9 undergoes phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification, which is essential for its activation and function in signaling pathways (Aashaq2021TGF‐β).

SMAD9 can form complexes with other SMAD proteins, indicating a quaternary structure that is vital for its role as a transcriptional regulator in BMP signaling (Tsukamoto2014Smad9). The protein exists in two isoforms, Smad9a and Smad9b, which differ in their linker regions (Tsukamoto2014Smad9).

## Function
SMAD9, also known as SMAD8, is a member of the SMAD family involved in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which is part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. In healthy human cells, SMAD9 functions as a transcriptional regulator, modulating the expression of target genes in response to BMP signals. It is activated by phosphorylation through BMP-bound type I receptor kinases, allowing it to form complexes with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (Gregson2019A; Tsukamoto2014Smad9).

SMAD9 plays a unique role in BMP signaling by acting as a transcriptional repressor, unlike other receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) such as SMAD1 and SMAD5, which typically activate transcription. This repression is achieved through its interaction with SMAD1 and SMAD4, forming complexes that bind to DNA and suppress the transcription of BMP target genes (McDonald2021Pharmacological; Tsukamoto2014Smad9).

SMAD9 is expressed in various tissues, including bone, where it is involved in bone formation and maintenance. It is particularly active in osteocytes and osteochondral precursor cells, indicating its role in bone biology and development (McDonald2021Pharmacological; Gregson2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SMAD9 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. A rare mutation, specifically the c.65T>C, p.Leu22Pro variant, is linked to a high bone mass (HBM) phenotype. This mutation disrupts the MH1 DNA binding domain of SMAD9, leading to increased bone mineral density (BMD) and a musculoskeletal phenotype characterized by high BMD Z-scores, increased fat and lean mass, and larger muscle size. The mutation results in enhanced bone formation due to reduced BMP inhibition, suggesting SMAD9 as a potential target for osteoporosis treatment (Gregson2019A).

In the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), SMAD9 mutations, such as the R294X mutation, have been associated with impaired BMP signaling in pulmonary artery endothelial cells, contributing to a hyperproliferative phenotype. A deletion on chromosome 13, which includes the SMAD9 gene, has been observed in patients with PAH associated with congenital heart disease, leading to dysregulated BMP signaling and increased cell proliferation (Drake2015Endothelial).

Additionally, decreased expression levels of SMAD9 have been noted in lung carcinoma, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. This reduced expression is associated with poor prognosis, affecting overall survival and progression-free survival in lung cancer patients (Pan2020SMAD‑6).

## Interactions
SMAD9, a member of the SMAD family, participates in several interactions within the BMP signaling pathway. It forms complexes with other SMAD proteins, such as SMAD1 and SMAD5, acting as a transcriptional repressor. Unlike SMAD1 and SMAD5, which activate transcription, SMAD9 represses transcription within the R-SMAD complex (McDonald2021Pharmacological). SMAD9 also interacts with SMAD4, a common partner in BMP signaling, and binds to target DNA. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that more endogenous SMAD4 is associated with FLAG-Smad9 than with FLAG-Smad1, indicating a strong interaction between SMAD9 and SMAD4 (Tsukamoto2014Smad9).

SMAD9 forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with SMAD1 or SMAD5, reducing their transcriptional activity in a dominant negative manner. This interaction is facilitated by the shorter linker region of SMAD9, which interacts with co-repressors such as ANA, part of the TOB/BTG family, potentially affecting BMP signaling negatively (Tsukamoto2014Smad9). SMAD9 binds to a BMP-responsive element (BRE) in DNA, independent of SMAD4, and forms a complex with SMAD1. This SMAD9-SMAD1 complex binds to the BRE in response to BMP signaling, suggesting that SMAD9 modulates BMP signaling through its interaction with SMAD1 and its ability to bind DNA (Tsukamoto2014Smad9).
