# CHRNG

## Overview
The CHRNG gene encodes the gamma (γ) subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a pentameric transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in neuromuscular transmission during fetal development. This subunit is integral to the fetal form of the nAChR, which is predominantly expressed in developing muscle tissue and is essential for synaptic transmission and muscle contraction during embryogenesis (Bouzat1994Structural; Morgan2006Mutations). The γ subunit is eventually replaced by the epsilon (ε) subunit in the adult form of the receptor, marking a developmental transition in muscle function (Vogt2008Mutation). Mutations in the CHRNG gene are associated with congenital conditions such as multiple pterygium syndromes, which include joint contractures and other anomalies due to impaired receptor function (Hoffmann2006Escobar; Morgan2006Mutations). The γ subunit's interactions with other nAChR subunits and its involvement in neuromuscular signaling underscore its significance in both normal development and disease (Du2023Overexpression; Sun2024Exploring).

## Structure
The CHRNG gene encodes the gamma (γ) subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which is a crucial component of the receptor's pentameric structure. This subunit is part of the fetal form of the AChR, which is later replaced by the epsilon (ε) subunit in the adult form (Cetin2020The; Morgan2006Mutations). The γ-subunit features a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains (M1-M4), and a significant cytoplasmic loop between the M3 and M4 helices (Cetin2020The). The cytoplasmic loop domain of the γ-subunit contains 145 amino acids, contributing to the receptor's structural and functional properties (Cetin2020The).

The primary structure of the γ-subunit includes specific amino acids that are essential for the receptor's function, such as αY93, αW149, αY190, αY198, and γW55, which stabilize the agonist at the αγ binding site (Cetin2020The). The secondary structure involves loops and helices that rearrange upon agonist binding, affecting the receptor's affinity and open-channel lifetime (Cetin2020The). The quaternary structure of the AChR involves the assembly of five subunits, with the γ-subunit playing a role in the fetal receptor's distinct conductance and open-channel times (Cetin2020The). 

Mutations in the CHRNG gene can lead to structural changes, such as truncation, affecting the receptor's function and leading to conditions like multiple pterygium syndrome (Morgan2006Mutations).

## Function
The CHRNG gene encodes the gamma (γ) subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which is a pentameric transmembrane protein crucial for neuromuscular transmission in skeletal muscle. In healthy human cells, the embryonic form of AChR, which includes the γ subunit, is predominantly expressed in fetal and denervated muscle. This receptor is composed of two alpha (α) subunits, and single beta (β), gamma (γ), and delta (δ) subunits (Vogt2008Mutation; Morgan2006Mutations).

The γ subunit is essential during prenatal muscle development, facilitating synaptic transmission by allowing ion flow upon acetylcholine binding. This process is vital for muscle contraction and development during embryogenesis. The embryonic AChR, with the γ subunit, has longer channel open times, which are characteristic of fetal AChRs, aiding in the depolarization of the developing postsynaptic membrane (Bouzat1994Structural). The switch from the γ to the epsilon (ε) subunit occurs by 31 weeks of gestation, marking the transition to the adult form of AChR, which is predominant in innervated adult muscle (Vogt2008Mutation; Morgan2006Mutations). The γ subunit is not required postnatally, as its role is replaced by the ε subunit in adult muscle function (Vogt2008Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHRNG gene, which encodes the gamma subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, are associated with multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS), including both lethal and non-lethal forms such as Escobar syndrome. These conditions are characterized by joint contractures, pterygia, and other congenital anomalies. The mutations disrupt the assembly and surface expression of the fetal acetylcholine receptor, leading to reduced prenatal muscle strength and movement, which results in physical deformities like contractures and pterygia (Hoffmann2006Escobar; Morgan2006Mutations).

Escobar syndrome, a non-lethal variant of MPS, is caused by recessive mutations in the CHRNG gene. It is characterized by joint contractures, skin webbing, and other congenital anomalies. The condition is associated with transient inactivation of the neuromuscular end plate during early development, but patients do not exhibit myasthenic symptoms later in life due to the limited expression of CHRNG to early development (Schaaf2014Nicotinic).

Lethal multiple pterygium syndrome (LMPS) is another condition linked to CHRNG mutations, often resulting in severe phenotypes such as hydrops and muscle abnormalities. These mutations can lead to early-onset fetal akinesia and are implicated in the etiology of MPS (Morgan2006Mutations).

## Interactions
The CHRNG gene encodes the gamma subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a component of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family involved in neuromuscular transmission. This subunit interacts with other nAChR subunits, including alpha, beta, and delta, to form the fetal muscle acetylcholine receptor, which is crucial for synaptic signaling (Du2023Overexpression). 

In the context of treating respiratory depression caused by snake venom, CHRNG is identified as a key target due to its involvement in acetylcholine receptor signaling pathways. The study by Sun et al. highlights that CHRNG interacts with cytisine, a compound that can mitigate the effects of neurotoxins from snake venom by binding effectively to several cholinergic receptor subunits, including CHRNG. This interaction is significant in maintaining neuromuscular transmission and alleviating respiratory depression (Sun2024Exploring).

In the inner ear, CHRNG is co-expressed with the alpha1 subunit (CHRNA1) and is involved in forming a functional receptor complex with other muscle-type subunits like beta1 and delta. This expression is regulated by the transcription factor ATOH1, which is crucial for hair cell development (scheffer2007alpha1).
