# TANGO6

## Overview
TANGO6 (Transport and Golgi Organization 6 Homolog) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in cellular transport processes, particularly in the regulation of cell proliferation. The protein encoded by TANGO6 is characterized by six putative transmembrane domains and a signal anchor, which facilitate its localization to COPI vesicles. These structural features are crucial for its function in the retrograde transport of RPB2, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, from the Golgi apparatus to the nucleus. This transport is essential for the nuclear entry of RPB2, particularly during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, thereby influencing cell cycle progression and proliferation. TANGO6 interacts with several proteins, including karyopherin subunit beta-1 (KPNB1) and the ER resident protein LRRC59, to mediate its nuclear import. The gene's role in cellular transport and its implications in diseases such as cancer highlight its biological and clinical significance (Feng2024TANGO6; São2023Combined).

## Structure
TANGO6 is a protein characterized by six putative transmembrane (TM) domains and a signal anchor (SA), which are crucial for its localization and function. These structural elements tether TANGO6 to COPI vesicles, with the N- and C-termini located in the cytoplasm (Feng2024TANGO6). The signal anchor and specific TM domains, particularly TM2 and TM5, are essential for the protein's proper localization on COPI vesicles (Feng2024TANGO6). 

TANGO6 is not a secretory protein and is likely matured in the Golgi apparatus (Feng2024TANGO6). It contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) at its N-terminus, with the arginine at position 252 being critical for its interaction with karyopherin subunit beta-1 (KPNB1), facilitating nuclear transport (Feng2024TANGO6). The protein's interaction with RPB2, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, is vital for RPB2's nuclear entry, particularly during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle (Feng2024TANGO6). 

The study does not provide detailed information on the tertiary or quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of TANGO6.

## Function
TANGO6 (Transport and Golgi Organization 6 Homolog) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell proliferation through its role in COPI vesicle-mediated nuclear entry of RPB2, a subunit of RNA polymerase II. TANGO6 functions as a specific cargo for COPI vesicles, tethering to them via a signal anchor and transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its proper localization and function within the cell (Feng2024TANGO6). The protein is active in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in the retrograde transport of RPB2 from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequently to the nucleus, particularly during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle (Feng2024TANGO6).

TANGO6's interaction with karyopherin subunit beta-1 (KPNB1) and its nuclear localization sequence (NLS) are essential for its nuclear translocation, facilitating the transport of RPB2 to the nucleus (Feng2024TANGO6). This process is critical for maintaining the proper function of RNA polymerase II and ensuring cell cycle progression, as TANGO6 deficiency leads to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase due to impaired RPB2 nuclear import (Feng2024TANGO6). The TANGO6-RPB2 axis is conserved across various cellular systems, highlighting its fundamental role in cell proliferation and development (Feng2024TANGO6).

## Clinical Significance
TANGO6 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular transport and nuclear entry processes. Alterations in TANGO6 expression or function can significantly impact cell proliferation and are associated with various diseases, including cancer. In glioma, TANGO6 is highly expressed, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis through its involvement in the nuclear transport of RPB2, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for cell cycle progression (Feng2024TANGO6).

In the context of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), a deletion involving the CDH1 and TANGO6 genes has been linked to early-onset diffuse gastric cancer. This deletion affects the expression of CDH1 and the 3D chromatin structure, potentially exacerbating the clinical presentation of the disease. The CDH1-TANGO6 deletion is associated with increased cancer aggressiveness, characterized by decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation and invasion in gastric cancer cells (São2023Combined).

Additionally, TANGO6 has been identified as a prognosis-related gene in gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Its role in regulating cell proliferation and hematopoiesis further underscores its clinical significance (Feng2024TANGO6; Zhou2021Derivation).

## Interactions
TANGO6 interacts with several proteins to facilitate its role in cellular processes. It is involved in the nuclear entry of RPB2, the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, by capturing and transporting it from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This interaction is particularly strong during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. TANGO6 does not interact with RPB1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, indicating a specific role in RPB2 transport (Feng2024TANGO6).

TANGO6's nuclear import is assisted by KPNB1, a member of the karyopherin-β family, which interacts with the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of TANGO6. The arginine at position 252 of TANGO6 is crucial for this interaction and subsequent nuclear translocation (Feng2024TANGO6).

TANGO6 is also associated with COPI vesicles, interacting with COPA/B, components of the COPI complex. This interaction is essential for the transport of RPB2 to the nucleus and is disrupted when COPA is knocked down, leading to RPB2 accumulation in the cytoplasm (Feng2024TANGO6).

Additionally, TANGO6 interacts with the ER resident protein LRRC59, which mediates its nuclear import. Knockdown of LRRC59 results in the accumulation of TANGO6 in the cytoplasm, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Feng2024TANGO6).
