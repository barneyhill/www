# OR8B8

## Overview
OR8B8 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily B member 8, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. It is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction cascade that ultimately leads to the perception of smell (Horowitz2014Olfactory). The OR8B8 protein is also implicated in potential non-olfactory roles, as it has been detected in other tissues such as the human tongue, although these functions are not yet fully understood (Foster2014Extrasensory).

## Function
OR8B8 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. In healthy human cells, OR8B8 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the sense of smell (Horowitz2014Olfactory).

The protein encoded by OR8B8 is involved in the canonical olfactory signal transduction pathway. This process begins when an odorant binds to the receptor, causing a conformational change that activates associated G-proteins. This activation triggers a cascade of intracellular events, ultimately resulting in neuronal activation and the transmission of olfactory information to the brain (Behrens2018Structure–Function).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR8B8 has been identified in other tissues, such as the human tongue, suggesting potential functions outside the traditional olfactory system (Foster2014Extrasensory). However, the specific roles and mechanisms of OR8B8 in these non-olfactory contexts remain to be fully elucidated.
