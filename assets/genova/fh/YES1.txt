# YES1

## Overview
YES1 is a gene that encodes the YES proto-oncogene 1, a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cytoskeleton remodeling, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell-cell adhesion. As a kinase, YES1 is involved in phosphorylating target proteins, thereby modulating signaling pathways critical for normal cellular function and development. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it forms complexes with other proteins to influence cellular signaling. Dysregulation of YES1 has been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its significance in oncogenic pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target (Roskoski2004Src; Gregersen2010MicroRNA145; Nisar2020Linkage).

## Structure
The YES1 protein, a member of the Src family tyrosine kinases, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by several distinct domains. It includes an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, a kinase domain, and a regulatory C-terminal tail. The SH3 domain is known for binding to proline-rich sequences, while the SH2 domain interacts with phosphorylated tyrosines, playing a crucial role in protein-protein interactions (Superti‐Furga1995Structure‐function; Roskoski2004Src).

The SH3 domain of YES1 shares a β-barrel fold common to other SH3 domains, consisting of two orthogonal β-sheets with five anti-parallel strands. This domain also includes a 3_10-helix and three loops: the RT loop, the n-Src loop, and the distal loop. The hydrophobic binding site within the SH3 domain recognizes the PxxP consensus motif in ligands (MartínGarcía2007Crystallographic).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are critical for regulating the activity of YES1. The kinase domain contains specific motifs and residues essential for its function, including a tyrosine residue in the activation loop, which is a site of autophosphorylation (Superti‐Furga1995Structure‐function). The structure of YES1 is conserved among Src family kinases, with nearly identical skeletal assembly residues (Roskoski2015Src).

## Function
The YES1 gene encodes a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, which are non-receptor kinases involved in various cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, YES1 plays a critical role in regulating processes such as cytoskeleton remodeling, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell-cell adhesion. These functions are essential for maintaining normal cellular architecture and function, ensuring proper cell function and homeostasis (Nisar2020Linkage).

YES1 is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it phosphorylates target proteins to modulate signaling pathways. This activity is crucial for normal cellular function and development, as it influences cell growth, differentiation, survival, and migration. In platelets, YES1 is part of a macromolecular complex with membrane glycoprotein IV (CD36) and other Src family kinases, such as Fyn and Lyn. This complex is involved in platelet signaling pathways, suggesting a role in platelet activation and function (Huang1991Membrane).

The interaction of YES1 with other proteins in these complexes may involve sequences within the SH2 or SH3 domains, which are common in Src family kinases, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Huang1991Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
YES1, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, plays a significant role in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In colon cancer, YES1 is a direct target of microRNA-145 (miR-145), which is often downregulated in tumors. The overexpression of miR-145 leads to the downregulation of YES1, suggesting that the loss of miR-145 contributes to the upregulation of YES1, promoting tumor growth and invasion (Gregersen2010MicroRNA145). 

In thyroid cancer, YES1 expression is modulated by the long noncoding RNA H19 and microRNA miR-17-5p. H19 acts as a competitive endogenous RNA, binding to miR-17-5p and affecting YES1 expression. This interaction is crucial for thyroid cancer progression, as H19 overexpression suppresses the miR-17-5p-induced upregulation of YES1, impacting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Liu2016Long). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of YES1 in cancer, where its dysregulation through various molecular interactions contributes to oncogenesis and tumor progression. Targeting these pathways may offer potential therapeutic strategies for cancers involving YES1 dysregulation.

## Interactions
YES1, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling. It interacts with the SMIM30 peptide, which acts as an adaptor to facilitate the membrane anchoring and activation of YES1. This interaction is essential for the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, promoting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development (Pang2020Peptide). 

YES1 also interacts with the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates YES1 at the Tyr426 site, leading to its activation. This interaction is significant in gastric cancer progression, as activated YES1 phosphorylates ANXA2 at the Tyr24 site, enhancing ANXA2's nuclear distribution and promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Mao2021EphA2–YES1–ANXA2).

In addition, YES1 interacts with the Scribble (Scrib) protein, which modulates YAP1 phosphorylation. Scrib's sub-cellular localization affects its interaction with YES1, influencing YAP1's nuclear localization and phosphorylation at the Y357 site, a process implicated in oncogenic signaling pathways (Zhao2021Scribble). These interactions highlight YES1's role in various signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and survival.
