# FAM217B

## Overview
FAM217B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 217, member B. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, although its specific biological role remains to be fully elucidated. The FAM217B protein is implicated in various cellular processes, potentially including signal transduction and cellular communication, given its structural features that suggest a role in these pathways. While the precise function of FAM217B in human physiology is still under investigation, emerging research indicates its involvement in certain signaling pathways, which may have implications for understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies (Qiu2020aarFDC).
