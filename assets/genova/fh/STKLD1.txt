# STKLD1

## Overview
STKLD1, or serine/threonine kinase like domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by a serine/threonine kinase-like domain, suggesting its involvement in phosphorylation processes critical for cellular signaling. The protein is categorized as a kinase-like entity, although its precise enzymatic activity remains to be fully characterized. It is primarily localized in the cytosol, where it is thought to participate in signaling pathways that regulate essential cellular functions such as cell division, growth, and apoptosis (Zhang2021A). While the specific roles of STKLD1 in normal physiology are not completely understood, it has been implicated in genetic conditions such as non-syndromic pre-axial polydactyly, indicating its potential involvement in developmental processes (Umair2019Whole‐exome). Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of its biological functions and its potential implications in various diseases.

## Function
STKLD1, or serine/threonine kinase like domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its serine/threonine kinase-like domain, which suggests a role in phosphorylation processes crucial for regulating various cellular activities such as cell division, growth, and apoptosis. Although the specific functions of STKLD1 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, it is believed to contribute to maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological processes.

The Kinome Atlas (KA) has identified STKLD1 as a cytosolic protein, providing insights into its subcellular localization (Zhang2021A). This cytosolic presence indicates that STKLD1 may participate in signaling pathways that occur in the cytoplasm, potentially influencing cellular responses to external stimuli. The identification of STKLD1's localization complements existing databases and offers new perspectives on its potential roles in cellular processes (Zhang2021A).

Research has also linked STKLD1 to genetic conditions such as non-syndromic pre-axial polydactyly, where a nonsense mutation in the gene was found to affect digit development, highlighting its involvement in limb formation (Umair2019Whole‐exome). However, the precise molecular mechanisms and pathways through which STKLD1 operates in healthy cells remain an area of active investigation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STKLD1 gene have been implicated in non-syndromic pre-axial polydactyly (PPD) type A, a condition characterized by the duplication of the thumb, affecting only the upper limb. This condition is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but a study identified a nonsense mutation, c.84C > A, p.Tyr28*, in STKLD1 associated with an autosomal recessive pattern in two Pakistani families. This finding marks the first direct involvement of STKLD1 in digit development, highlighting its potential importance in genetic screening for non-syndromic recessive PPD (Umair2019Whole‐exome).

While the role of STKLD1 in other diseases is not extensively detailed, its involvement in cellular signaling pathways suggests that alterations in its expression or function could potentially be linked to various conditions, including cancer. The gene's kinase-like domain may play a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, processes that, when disrupted, can contribute to disease progression. However, specific associations with cancer or other conditions beyond PPD have not been explicitly documented in the provided context (Ma2017Genetic).
