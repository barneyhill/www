# OR52E1

## Overview
OR52E1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily E member 1, which is a part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a significant role in the olfactory system by contributing to the perception of human sweat odors. The protein encoded by OR52E1 is expressed in the cell membranes of olfactory sensory neurons, where it binds to specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that leads to the perception of smell. Research has particularly highlighted its interaction with molecules containing carboxylic acid groups, which are crucial for its function in odor detection (Achebouche2022Application).

## Function
OR52E1 is an olfactory receptor involved in the detection of odor molecules, specifically associated with the perception of human sweat odors. This receptor is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the molecular process of olfaction. OR52E1, along with other receptors such as OR52B2 and OR56A5, is implicated in the perception of sweat odors, with chemicals containing carboxylic acid groups potentially related to this sensory process (Achebouche2022Application).

The receptor is located in the cell membranes of olfactory sensory neurons, where it binds specific odorants. This binding initiates a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in the perception of smell. The study of OR52E1 has highlighted its association with specific structural features in molecules, particularly those possessing a carboxylic group, which are linked to its function in odor detection (Achebouche2022Application).

While the primary focus of research on OR52E1 has been its role in olfactory perception, the specific function of OR52E1 in healthy human cells beyond its involvement in sweat odor perception has not been detailed in the available literature (Achebouche2022Application).
