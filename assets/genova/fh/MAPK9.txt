# MAPK9

## Overview
MAPK9, also known as JNK2, is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 9, a member of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) family. This protein is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, which are critical for regulating various cellular processes such as gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Kyriakis2012Mammalian). The MAPK9 gene is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, each with distinct functional roles and expression profiles (Wang2010Molecular). The protein is activated by environmental stresses and proinflammatory stimuli, and it plays a pivotal role in cellular responses by phosphorylating transcription factors like c-Jun and ATF2, thereby influencing the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in inflammation and apoptosis (Wang2010Molecular; Kyriakis2012Mammalian). The diverse interactions and regulatory mechanisms of MAPK9 underscore its significance in both normal physiological processes and various pathological conditions.

## Structure
MAPK9, also known as JNK2, is a protein kinase involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. The primary structure of MAPK9 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, which includes regions such as α and β, dual phosphorylation sites (Thr183, Tyr185), and kinase sub-domains (Wang2010Molecular). The secondary structure is characterized by α helices and β strands, which are common structural motifs in protein kinases (Tian2019Identification). The tertiary structure of MAPK9 is a three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity and is stabilized by various interactions (Tian2019Identification).

MAPK9 contains a kinase domain that is essential for its function, and it undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity (Wang2010Molecular). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including JNK2α1/2, JNK2β1/2, and novel variants like JNK2α3, JNK2α4, JNK2β3, JNK2γ1, and JNK2γ2, each with distinct activities and expression profiles (Wang2010Molecular). These isoforms can have different effects on substrates and cellular processes, highlighting the functional diversity of MAPK9 (Wang2010Molecular).

## Function
MAPK9, also known as JNK2, is a member of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) family, which are part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. JNK2 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is activated by environmental stresses, proinflammatory stimuli, and growth factors, playing a crucial role in the cellular response to these signals (Kyriakis2012Mammalian).

In healthy human cells, JNK2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression by phosphorylating transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2. This phosphorylation is essential for the regulation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) transactivation function, which is involved in controlling the expression of genes related to inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Wang2010Molecular; Kyriakis2012Mammalian).

JNK2 isoforms, such as JNK2α3, have been shown to have distinct effects on substrate phosphorylation, with a higher potential for c-Jun phosphorylation compared to other isoforms. These isoforms also exhibit different autophosphorylation capabilities, which are important for their functional activities in cellular signaling pathways (Wang2010Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
MAPK9, also known as JNK2, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MAPK9 is involved in tumorigenesis through aberrant promoter hypermethylation, which affects its role in the MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways. This aberrant methylation may serve as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and therapy in CRC (Fang2015Screening).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), low expression of MAPK9 is associated with improved outcomes when treated with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, particularly in patients with SMAD4 alterations. This suggests that MAPK9 expression levels can influence the effectiveness of targeted therapies in PDAC (Hoyer2021A).

MAPK9 is also involved in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where its expression is upregulated. Treatment with Xuanfei Pingchuan capsules has been shown to down-regulate MAPK9, indicating a potential therapeutic effect by modulating autophagy-related pathways (Zhang2023Roles).

In Alzheimer's disease, MAPK9 is part of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is significantly enriched in affected brain regions. It acts as a hub protein in the protein-protein interaction network, suggesting its involvement in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Wang2020Identification).

## Interactions
MAPK9, also known as JNK2, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2, which are crucial for its role in stress response and apoptosis (Gupta1996Selective; Dhanasekaran2008JNK). The binding of MAPK9 to these transcription factors is necessary for their phosphorylation, which is a key step in the activation of transcriptional programs involved in apoptosis and other cellular processes (Gupta1996Selective).

MAPK9 is also part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and has been shown to interact with other kinases and phosphatases, influencing its activity and function. For instance, it is involved in the phosphorylation of c-Jun, a process that is essential for the formation of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex, which regulates the expression of pro-apoptotic genes (Dhanasekaran2008JNK).

In the context of H1N1 influenza A infection, MAPK9 has been identified as a potential drug target due to its interactions within the protein-protein interaction networks, suggesting its involvement in the influenza A pathway (Chen#2012Potential). These interactions highlight the importance of MAPK9 in both normal cellular functions and disease processes.
