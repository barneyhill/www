# OR11L1

## Overview
The OR11L1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily L member 1, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in signal transduction. Olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR11L1, play a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules, initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a common feature among many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (Qiu2020aarFDC). The OR11L1 gene is part of a large gene family, which is the largest in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the olfactory system.
