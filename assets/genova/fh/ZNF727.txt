# ZNF727

## Overview
ZNF727 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 727, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression and influencing various cellular processes such as DNA repair, replication, and transcriptional regulation. ZNF727 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin to modulate gene expression patterns, contributing to cellular homeostasis and development (Lovering2021A). The gene exhibits higher expression levels in the brain compared to blood, suggesting a potential involvement in neurological functions, although its precise roles in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Höffler2024EpigenomeWide). ZNF727 has also been implicated in disease contexts, including schizophrenia and cognitive impairment, as well as in cancer-related processes, highlighting its clinical significance and the need for further research to understand its biological functions and potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2024Epigenomewide; Jacob2024Nucleosome).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF727, a member of the zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, replication, and transcriptional regulation, contributing to cellular homeostasis and development. ZNF727 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin to influence gene expression patterns (Lovering2021A).

The gene is more highly expressed in the brain compared to blood, suggesting a potential role in neurological functions, although the specific molecular functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed (Höffler2024EpigenomeWide). The zinc finger domains of ZNF727 facilitate its DNA-binding capability, which is a characteristic feature of the zinc finger protein family, allowing it to act as a transcriptional regulator (Lovering2021A).

Despite its recognized role in transcriptional regulation, the precise biological outcomes of ZNF727's activity in healthy human cells remain under investigation. The gene's involvement in disease contexts, such as schizophrenia and cognitive impairment, has been noted, but its normal cellular functions require further elucidation (Zhang2024Epigenomewide; Höffler2024EpigenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF727 has been implicated in various cancer-related processes due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In breast cancer, ZNF727 is identified as a hub gene with increased nucleosome density in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This increased density is associated with dysregulated cancer-specific pathways, particularly involving zinc-finger transcription factors, which include ZNF727 (Jacob2024Nucleosome). The study suggests that changes in nucleosome positioning at transcription factor binding sites, such as those for the Oestrogen Receptor (ERα), could serve as potential diagnostic markers in breast cancer, highlighting the clinical significance of ZNF727 in this context (Jacob2024Nucleosome).

In colorectal cancer, the noncoding transcript RP11-3N2.1, associated with the ZNF727 gene, is downregulated in tumor tissues. This downregulation suggests a potential role in colorectal cancer tumorigenesis. A novel SNP, rs13230517, located in the promoter region of RP11-3N2.1, may influence transcription by altering regulatory motifs and transcription factor binding, potentially affecting ZNF727 expression (Ye2017A). These findings indicate that ZNF727 and its associated transcripts may play significant roles in cancer development and progression, warranting further research into their mechanisms and potential as therapeutic targets.

## Interactions
ZNF727, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions that may influence its function as a transcription factor. The protein is part of the zinc finger family, which is known for its ability to bind DNA, RNA, or other proteins, often playing roles in gene regulation (Lovering2021A). Although specific interactions of ZNF727 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, it is noted that ZNF727 is a transcription factor that has been associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in studies related to late-stage mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and schizophrenia (SCZ) (Zhang2024Epigenomewide; Höffler2024EpigenomeWide).

In the context of schizophrenia, a DMR in the ZNF727 gene was identified, suggesting potential environmental influences on its methylation status, which may affect its interaction with other genomic elements (Höffler2024EpigenomeWide). The broader zinc finger protein family, to which ZNF727 belongs, often participates in complex regulatory networks, sometimes forming multiprotein complexes or engaging in transient interactions that modulate transcriptional activity (Lovering2021A). However, specific details about ZNF727's interactions remain limited, necessitating further research to elucidate its precise roles and partners in cellular processes.
