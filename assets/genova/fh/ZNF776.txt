# ZNF776

## Overview
ZNF776 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 776, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are known for their role in binding DNA and mediating protein-protein interactions. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its involvement in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. ZNF776 interacts with TRIM28, a known transcriptional co-repressor, suggesting its participation in the formation of multiprotein complexes that modulate gene expression (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). Additionally, ZNF776 is part of a cluster of KRAB zinc finger proteins on chromosome 19, which are implicated in the prognosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), indicating its potential significance in cancer biology (Martins2024A).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF776 is a zinc finger protein that interacts with other proteins, particularly in the context of its association with TRIM28. In leukemic K562 cells, ZNF776 is among the zinc finger proteins that interact with wild-type TRIM28, indicating a role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). The interaction between ZNF776 and TRIM28 suggests that ZNF776 may be involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes that influence gene expression.

In the context of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), ZNF776 is part of a cluster of KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) located on chromosome 19, which are associated with poor prognosis. This cluster of KZFPs, including ZNF776, is highly expressed and may form a gene expression module that contributes to the aggressive nature of DLBCL (Martins2024A). The coexpression of these KZFPs suggests potential interactions that could influence cellular processes such as cell-cycle regulation and DNA repair, although specific physical interactions involving ZNF776 in this context are not detailed. The role of ZNF776 in these processes highlights its potential importance in cancer biology and its contribution to the regulation of gene expression in cancer cells.
