# COL14A1

## Overview
The COL14A1 gene encodes the collagen type XIV alpha 1 chain, a non-fibrillar collagen that is part of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the structural organization and integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by forming interfibrillar connections and influencing matrix density. It is characterized by its unique structure, which includes collagenous and non-collagenous domains, allowing it to associate with collagen fibrils without forming fibrils itself. The protein is expressed in tissues subjected to high mechanical stress, such as skin, tendons, and the myocardium, where it contributes to tissue integrity and function. Additionally, COL14A1 is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including fibrillogenesis, cancer metastasis, and osteoarthritis, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Nizamoglu2023Collagen; Tao2012Collagen; Jiang2022RNABinding).

## Structure
Collagen type XIV alpha 1 chain (COL14A1) is a member of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. The protein structure includes two collagenous domains (COL1 and COL2) and three non-collagenous domains (NC1, NC2, and NC3), which are crucial for forming the triple helical structures and facilitating interactions with other fibrillar collagens (Nizamoglu2023Collagen). The molecular structure of COL14A1 features collagenous domains interspersed with non-collagenous regions, allowing it to associate with the surface of collagen fibrils without forming fibrils itself (Onursal2021Collagen).

The N-terminal region of COL14A1 includes a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting its role as a molecular spacer (Nauroy2019Gene). This domain structure supports the protein's function in organizing the extracellular matrix and maintaining tissue integrity. Post-translational modifications such as hydroxylation and glycosylation are common in collagen proteins, although specific modifications for COL14A1 are not detailed in the provided context.

COL14A1 is also a substrate for the enzymes ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14, with identified cleavage sites within its fibronectin type-III and collagen-like domains, indicating its involvement in extracellular matrix remodeling (Leduc2021In).

## Function
Collagen type XIV alpha 1 chain, encoded by the COL14A1 gene, is a non-fibrillar collagen that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is part of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACITs) family, which are involved in forming interfibrillar connections and influencing fibril and matrix density. This suggests a significant role in fibrillogenesis, the process of collagen fibril formation, which is essential for maintaining the mechanical properties and stability of connective tissues (Calò2021Worldwide).

In healthy human tissues, COL14A1 is expressed in areas subjected to high mechanical stress, such as the skin, tendon, cornea, and lung. It is particularly present near blood vessels, airway smooth muscle cells, and bronchial epithelium, where it helps regulate mechanical stress and impacts the biomechanical properties of the ECM (Nizamoglu2023Collagen). In the myocardium, Collagen XIV is crucial for the assembly of a tightly regulated collagen network, necessary for structural support and cellular processes, particularly during embryonic development and under stress conditions in adult heart function (Tao2012Collagen). The protein's presence in these tissues underscores its role in maintaining tissue integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the COL14A1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In gastric cancer, mutations in COL14A1 are associated with a distinct tumor microenvironment characterized by increased immune cell infiltration and altered extracellular matrix (ECM) expression. These mutations correlate with higher expression of certain ECM gene sets in microsatellite instability-high tumors, leading to shorter overall survival. Tumors with COL14A1 mutations also exhibit higher levels of immunosuppressive cell types, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells, which are linked to poorer outcomes (Brodsky2022Somatic).

In ovarian cancer, particularly in mucinous and clear cell subtypes, COL14A1 mutations are concentrated in the FN3 domain and are associated with advanced stages of the disease, correlating with poor prognosis. The mutation rate of COL14A1 in ovarian cancer is notably high, suggesting its potential as a target for diagnosis and treatment (Li2023Wholeexome).

In the context of cardiac health, the absence of Collagen XIV, encoded by COL14A1, in knockout mice leads to structural and functional changes in the myocardium. These changes include increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume and decreased ejection fraction, indicating the gene's role in maintaining myocardial integrity (Tao2012Collagen).

## Interactions
COL14A1, which encodes collagen type XIV alpha 1 chain, is a fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) that plays a significant role in the structural integrity of various tissues by interacting with other extracellular matrix components. It is known to interact with collagen types I and II, promoting fiber assembly and stabilizing the extracellular matrix structure, which is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and function (Tao2012Collagen).

In the context of gastric cancer, COL14A1 has been identified as an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that may play an adhesive role by integrating collagen bundles. This suggests potential interactions with other matrix molecules or cell surface receptors, which could be associated with cancer cell adhesion and metastasis (Jiang2022RNABinding). The study by Jiang et al. highlights the importance of COL14A1 in predicting peritoneal metastasis in gastric cancer, indicating its involvement in complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment (Jiang2022RNABinding).

In osteoarthritis, COL14A1 is upregulated and may contribute to the fibrillation of cartilage, suggesting its involvement in the disease's molecular pathways and interactions with other cartilage matrix components (Karlsson2010Genome-wide). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of COL14A1 in both normal physiological processes and disease states.
