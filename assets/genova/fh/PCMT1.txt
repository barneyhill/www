# PCMT1

## Overview
The PCMT1 gene encodes the enzyme protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase, a critical component in the maintenance of protein integrity through its role in the repair of damaged proteins. This enzyme is categorized as a methyltransferase and is involved in the methylation of abnormal aspartyl and asparaginyl residues, which can arise from protein aging processes such as deamidation and isomerization. The activity of this enzyme is essential for cellular homeostasis, particularly in neural tissues where it helps prevent apoptosis and supports normal signaling pathways. PCMT1 is ubiquitously expressed across mammalian tissues, with notable expression in the brain, and is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA maturation and histone modification. Its function is crucial for longevity and cellular function, with implications in aging and disease pathogenesis (Amer2014HsamiR195; Ozay2020Protein; DeVry1999Polymorphic).

## Function
The PCMT1 gene encodes the enzyme protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the repair of age-damaged proteins in human cells. This enzyme specifically targets damaged aspartyl and asparaginyl residues, which are prone to deamidation, isomerization, and racemization, processes that can compromise protein function and contribute to aging. The repair mechanism involves the methylation of these residues, which can restore the activity of affected proteins (Amer2014HsamiR195; DeVry1999Polymorphic).

PCMT1 is involved in the one-carbon compound metabolic process and is essential for the posttranslational modification of proteins. It is expressed in all mammalian tissues, with the highest levels in the brain, where it protects neural cells from apoptosis and maintains normal mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (Amer2014HsamiR195). The enzyme is active in the cytosol and nucleus, participating in cellular processes like RNA maturation, stability, and export, as well as histone homeostasis and posttranslational control (Ozay2020Protein).

The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining protein integrity and cellular function, contributing to cellular homeostasis and longevity. Overexpression of PCMT1 is associated with increased cell longevity and lifespan, as seen in studies with model organisms like Drosophila melanogaster and mice (Amer2014HsamiR195).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PCMT1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In mice, the absence of PCMT1 activity leads to severe neurological issues, including fatal seizures, due to the accumulation of damaged proteins in the brain (Kim1997Deficiency). In humans, polymorphisms in the PCMT1 gene, such as the rs4816 variant, have been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, particularly in populations with low folate intake (Wang2013PCMT1).

PCMT1 is also implicated in age-related diseases. Decreased expression of PCMT1 is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (Ogasawara2016The). Additionally, PCMT1 polymorphisms have been studied in the context of healthy aging, with certain variants potentially influencing longevity and the risk of age-related diseases like Alzheimer's (DeVry1999Polymorphic).

In cancer, PCMT1 expression is linked to poorer prognosis in several malignancies, including bladder and ovarian cancer, where it influences tumor metastasis and resistance to apoptosis (Liu2024PCMT1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PCMT1 in various diseases.

## Interactions
PCMT1, or protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase, engages in several significant interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In cardiomyocytes, PCMT1 interacts with the proapoptotic kinase Mst1. This interaction occurs specifically with the N-terminal catalytic domain of Mst1, inhibiting its kinase activity and reducing apoptosis in response to hypoxic conditions (Yan2013ProteinLisoaspartate). The interaction between PCMT1 and Mst1 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, demonstrating a direct binding (Yan2013ProteinLisoaspartate).

In regulatory T cells (iTregs), PCMT1 interacts with the FOXP3 gene, a critical regulator of iTreg function. This interaction affects the methylation status of FOXP3, influencing its stability and expression. PCMT1's role in this context is modulated by Protein Kinase C theta (PKCθ) and its association with hnRNPL, which affects the export of PCMT1 mRNA from the nucleus (Ozay2020Protein). PCMT1 also interacts with histone H4, specifically methylating it at aspartate 24 (H4D24me). This modification is recognized by the chromo domain-containing protein VprBP, suggesting a role in histone degradation and protein homeostasis (Biterge2014Methylation). These interactions highlight PCMT1's involvement in diverse cellular processes, including apoptosis regulation and gene expression modulation.
