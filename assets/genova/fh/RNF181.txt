# RNF181

## Overview
RNF181 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 181, which is a member of the RING finger protein family and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification that regulates protein turnover and activity within cells. The RING finger domain of RNF181 facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin molecules, marking proteins for degradation or modulating their function through non-degradative ubiquitination. RNF181 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a significant role in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cell cycle control. It is involved in stabilizing key proteins, such as the Yes-associated protein (YAP) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), through specific ubiquitination pathways, thereby influencing cellular migration, proliferation, and signaling pathways (Zhu2020The; Zhou2020RNF181).

## Structure


## Function
RNF181, also known as ring finger protein 181, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein turnover and regulation within cells. This protein contains a RING finger domain that facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin molecules, tagging proteins for degradation or modulating their activity through non-degradative ubiquitination processes (Zhu2020The).

In healthy human cells, RNF181 is involved in stabilizing key proteins by inhibiting their degradation. For instance, it stabilizes the YAP protein by inhibiting K48-linked poly-ubiquitination, which is typically associated with protein degradation. This stabilization enhances YAP target gene expression, which is important for cellular processes such as migration and proliferation (Zhou2020RNF181).

RNF181 is also active in the regulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) through K63-linked poly-ubiquitination, a non-degradative form of ubiquitination that stabilizes ERα and enhances its signaling. This process is significant in maintaining normal cellular functions related to ERα signaling pathways (Zhu2020The).

RNF181 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle control, by regulating the stability and activity of its target proteins (Zhu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNF181 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably coronary artery disease (CAD) and certain types of cancer. In the context of CAD, RNF181 expression is significantly decreased, suggesting its involvement in the progression of the disease. The gene is part of the E3 ubiquitination ligase protein family, and its altered expression affects pathways such as the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and cardiac health. This alteration may contribute to CAD by impacting cell proliferation and cardiac efficiency (Dang2022Weighted).

In cancer, RNF181 has been associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. In TNBC, RNF181 interacts with the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell migration and invasion. Elevated levels of RNF181 correlate with poor prognosis in TNBC patients (Zhou2020RNF181). In estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, RNF181 stabilizes ERα, enhancing its signaling and promoting cancer cell proliferation. This stabilization is linked to poor survival outcomes in patients undergoing endocrine therapy (Zhu2020The). These findings suggest that RNF181 could serve as a potential therapeutic target in these conditions.

## Interactions
RNF181, a member of the RING finger protein family, is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In breast cancer, RNF181 interacts with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), stabilizing it through K63-linked poly-ubiquitination. This interaction is mediated by the AF1 domain of ERα and the RING domain of RNF181, which enhances ERα signaling and promotes breast cancer progression (Zhu2020The).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RNF181 interacts with the Yes-associated protein (YAP), a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway. RNF181 stabilizes YAP by inhibiting its K48-linked poly-ubiquitination, which prevents proteasomal degradation. This interaction promotes YAP's nuclear localization and activity, contributing to cancer cell migration and invasion (Zhou2020RNF181).

In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), RNF181 is implicated in interactions with several E3 ubiquitin ligase family members, such as UBE2N and UBC, which are involved in the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. These interactions suggest a role for RNF181 in regulating protein degradation processes related to heart-associated diseases (Dang2022Weighted).
