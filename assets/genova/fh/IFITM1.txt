# IFITM1

## Overview
The IFITM1 gene encodes the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1, a crucial component of the immune system's antiviral defense mechanism. This protein is part of the broader family of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins, which are characterized by their role in inhibiting viral entry into host cells. IFITM1 is a transmembrane protein that is primarily located on the cell surface and is involved in various cellular processes, including immune response modulation, cell migration, and maintenance of cellular barriers (Friedlová2022IFITM). The expression of IFITM1 is upregulated by type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, enhancing its antiviral and antibacterial functions (Friedlová2022IFITM). Beyond its role in immunity, IFITM1 is implicated in cancer progression, where its altered expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness and resistance to treatment (Xu2023Invasive; Ogony2016Interferoninduced).

## Structure
The IFITM1 protein is a member of the interferon-induced transmembrane proteins, characterized by its involvement in antiviral defense and cancer progression. Structurally, IFITM1 is composed of several distinct domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), intramembrane domain (IMD), conserved intracellular loop (CIL), transmembrane domain (TMD), and C-terminal domain (CTD) (Nekulová2024Biochemical). The NTD is located intracellularly, while the CTD is extracellular, as confirmed by various studies (Sun2020Topology; Weston2014A).

IFITM1 can exist in multiple conformational states, including monomers, dimers, and oligomers. The oligomeric state is particularly significant for its function, potentially affecting membrane fluidity and viral restriction (Nekulová2024Biochemical). The GXXXG motif, especially the glycine residues, is crucial for oligomerization, which is important for its antiviral properties (Nekulová2024Biochemical).

Post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation, are common in IFITM1 and influence its localization and function. These modifications are essential for the protein's role in inhibiting viral entry into host cells (Nekulová2024Biochemical). The protein's structure and oligomerization are critical for its biological activities, highlighting the importance of understanding its molecular architecture.

## Function
IFITM1, a member of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein family, plays a significant role in various cellular and immune processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily located on the cell surface, where it is involved in immune responses and antiviral defense by inhibiting viral entry into host cells (Friedlová2022IFITM). IFITM1 is constitutively expressed in certain cell types, such as stem cells and specific immune cells, providing intrinsic immunity against viral infections (Friedlová2022IFITM).

In the immune system, IFITM1 is present on T cells and is part of a signaling complex in B cells, contributing to immune responses. Its expression is induced by type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines in monocytes and macrophages, enhancing antiviral and antibacterial defenses (Friedlová2022IFITM). IFITM1 also plays a role in cell migration and is involved in maintaining cellular barriers as a tight junction protein, affecting membrane structure and function (Friedlová2022IFITM).

Additionally, IFITM1 is implicated in the regulation of protein synthesis in response to interferon-gamma (IFNγ), influencing the expression and localization of proteins involved in antigen presentation, such as MHC Class I molecules (GómezHerranz2019The). This highlights its role in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IFITM1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, contributing to tumor progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high IFITM1 expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes and resistance to therapies such as aromatase inhibitors and chemotherapy (Lui2017IFITM1; Ogony2016Interferoninduced). IFITM1 overexpression enhances the aggressive phenotype of inflammatory breast cancer cells, promoting proliferation, migration, and invasion (Ogony2016Interferoninduced).

In cervical cancer, IFITM1 is linked to immune evasion and metastasis, with its expression potentially correlating with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation (GómezHerranz2019The). In lung adenocarcinoma, high IFITM1 expression is associated with shorter overall survival and is involved in tumor-associated macrophage polarization, promoting invasiveness (Xu2023Invasive).

IFITM1 also plays a role in glioma, where its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenicity (Yu2010Knockdown). Across various cancers, IFITM1 overexpression is linked to increased tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and resistance to therapies, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Liang2020Deciphering).

## Interactions
IFITM1, a member of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein family, engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in antiviral defense and cellular processes. It interacts with CD81, a coreceptor for the hepatitis C virus (HCV), and occludin, a tight junction protein, to inhibit HCV entry by disrupting the necessary coreceptor associations for viral entry (Wilkins2012IFITM1). IFITM1 also associates with ZO-1, promoting the relocalization of CD81 to tight junctions, which is crucial for its antiviral activity (Wilkins2012IFITM1).

In the context of Zika virus infection, IFITM1 interacts with TLR7 and CD81, potentially mediating its inhibitory action through natural killer (NK) cell effector functions (Ganapathiraju2017Predicted). It also interacts with proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements, such as FNDC3B, SPTA1, ARPC1B, and AGTR2, which may facilitate host invasion by the virus (Ganapathiraju2017Predicted).

IFITM1 interacts with the cytosolic isoform of SRSF1, a translation factor, suggesting a role in mRNA transport and protein synthesis regulation, particularly in response to IFNγ stimulation (GómezHerranz2022SRSF1). This interaction is linked to the modulation of HLA-B expression and ribosomal integrity, highlighting its involvement in both antiviral and cancer-associated gene product synthesis (GómezHerranz2022SRSF1).
