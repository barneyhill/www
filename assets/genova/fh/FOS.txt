# FOS

## Overview
The FOS gene encodes the Fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit, a critical component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in response to a variety of stimuli, including growth factors and cytokines. The Fos protein, characterized by its basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, forms heterodimers with members of the Jun family, facilitating DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Verma1987The; O’Shea1992Mechanism). Through these interactions, the Fos protein influences cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and is implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Preston1996Induction; Knebel2013A). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are tightly regulated by post-translational modifications, which modulate its function as a transcriptional activator or repressor (Preston1996Induction).

## Structure
The FOS protein, encoded by the FOS gene, is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. It contains a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for dimerization and DNA binding. The primary structure of FOS includes a sequence of 380 amino acids, with a high proline content contributing to its unique properties (Verma1987The). The secondary structure features continuous alpha-helices, with the carboxy-terminal regions forming an asymmetric coiled-coil structure (Glover1995Crystal). 

In terms of tertiary structure, the FOS protein interacts with the JUN protein to form a heterodimer, which grips the DNA major groove like forceps. This interaction is facilitated by the leucine zipper regions, which fold as two-stranded, parallel coiled coils (O’Shea1992Mechanism). The quaternary structure of the FOS-Jun complex is characterized by an asymmetric coiled coil, with the Jun chain bending more than the Fos chain, maintaining the 'knobs-into-holes' packing of the coiled-coil residues (Glover1995Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in the activity and stability of the FOS protein (Verma1987The). These modifications can influence the protein's function in gene regulation.

## Function
The FOS gene encodes a protein that is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, which includes members of the Jun family. This complex is involved in regulating gene expression in response to various stimuli, playing a crucial role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Preston1996Induction). In healthy human cells, c-Fos functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, with its activity modulated by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. The phosphorylated form of c-Fos acts as a transcriptional activator, while the dephosphorylated form serves as a transcriptional repressor (Preston1996Induction).

c-Fos is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in response to growth factors. It is rapidly induced in many cell types upon stimulation and can regulate gene expression by forming transcription factor complexes with Jun proteins (Field1992Growth). In the context of hematopoietic cells, c-Fos is expressed in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes, suggesting its role in the regulation of granulocyte functions (Colotta1987Expression). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences cellular responses and organismal development through its role in signal transduction and gene expression regulation (Preston1996Induction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FOS gene, which encodes a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. A notable mutation in the c-fos gene, specifically a point mutation c.-439 T→A in the 5'UTR, is associated with congenital generalized lipodystrophy. This mutation impairs promoter activity, leading to reduced basal and inducible expression of the c-fos gene, which affects metabolic and transcriptional processes, as well as genes involved in cell cycle control and differentiation (Knebel2013A). The mutation results in the formation of a novel protein/DNA complex that alters normal interactions, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of congenital generalized lipodystrophy (Knebel2013A).

In cancer, alterations in c-fos expression have been observed in colorectal tumors, with 29% of tumors showing changes in expression levels. However, these alterations do not significantly correlate with clinical outcomes (Nagai1992Association). In breast cancer, c-fos expression is significantly associated with disease recurrence and decreased survival, highlighting its role as a prognostic factor (Bland1995Oncogene). Additionally, increased c-fos expression is linked to poor prognosis in glioma and breast cancer, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Koul2007PTEN).

## Interactions
The FOS protein, encoded by the FOS gene, is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. FOS forms heterodimers with JUN proteins, such as c-Jun, to bind the AP-1 consensus site (TGACTCA) with high affinity, influencing gene expression (Blanar1992Interaction; Rauscher1988Common). This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.

FOS also interacts with Fos-related antigens (FRAs) and Fos-associated proteins (FAPs), including p39, which is the product of the jun proto-oncogene. This interaction is significant for the formation of the AP-1 complex, which binds to DNA regulatory elements containing AP-1 sites (Vosatka1989Dynamic; Rauscher1988FosAssociated). The FOS-p39/Jun complex is formed in the nucleus and is involved in chromatin association and DNA binding, playing a role in transcriptional regulation (Rauscher1988FosAssociated).

FOS undergoes posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its interactions and function. These modifications may alter the protein's ability to form complexes with other proteins, such as p39, and influence its role in gene expression (Vosatka1989Dynamic). The interactions of FOS with other proteins and nucleic acids highlight its role as a key regulator in cellular signaling pathways.
