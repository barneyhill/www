# PPDPF

## Overview
The PPDPF gene encodes the pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of mTOR signaling pathways. This protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in modulating lipid metabolism and cellular growth by interacting with Raptor, a key component of the mTOR complex. Through its interaction with Raptor, PPDPF negatively regulates ubiquitination, thereby influencing mTOR signaling and lipid metabolism. The protein's regulatory functions are crucial in preventing hepatic steatosis and have implications in various diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and certain cancers (Ma2021PPDPF).

## Function
The PPDPF gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating mTOR signaling, which is crucial for various biological processes, including lipid metabolism and cellular growth. In healthy human cells, PPDPF is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and interacts with Raptor, a component of the mTOR complex, to negatively regulate its ubiquitination. This interaction is essential for modulating mTOR signaling, particularly in response to lipid signals, and is mediated by specific amino acid residues (51-64aa) in PPDPF (Ma2021PPDPF).

PPDPF's interaction with Raptor prevents excessive ubiquitination, thereby maintaining normal mTOR signaling. Overexpression of PPDPF in cells has been shown to reduce the activation of mTOR signaling pathways, as evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of p70 S6K and reduced expression of lipogenic genes such as SREBP1 and FASN. This suggests that PPDPF is important for regulating lipid metabolism and preventing hepatic steatosis (Ma2021PPDPF).

PPDPF also inhibits hepatic steatosis by suppressing mTORC1 activity through interference with the Raptor-DDB1 interaction, which is crucial for mTORC1 activation. This disruption leads to reduced mTOR-S6K-SREBP1 signaling, associated with decreased de novo lipogenesis (Ma2021PPDPF).

## Clinical Significance
The PPDPF gene is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), PPDPF plays a crucial role by negatively regulating the mTORC1-S6K-SREBP1 signaling pathway, which is involved in lipid metabolism. Downregulation of PPDPF is observed in NAFLD patients, and its deficiency in mice leads to increased hepatic steatosis, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance (Ma2021PPDPF). Overexpression of PPDPF has been shown to alleviate these symptoms by inhibiting lipogenic signaling, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for NAFLD (Ma2021PPDPF).

In cancer, PPDPF is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In NSCLC, PPDPF expression is upregulated through the circ-FOXM1/miR-1304-5p axis, promoting tumor progression by enhancing cell proliferation and migration (Liu2019Circular). The gene's expression is also linked to ovarian cancer, where it is overexpressed and contributes to tumorigenesis by upregulating the DNA replication pathway (Xiao2021The).

In sepsis, PPDPF is abnormally expressed, potentially contributing to an immunosuppressive environment by reducing immune cell activation and infiltration (Shen2024Key). These findings highlight the diverse roles of PPDPF in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PPDPF interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in regulating mTOR signaling and lipid metabolism. It directly interacts with Raptor, a component of the mTOR complex, and negatively regulates its ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of mTOR signaling, which is involved in various biological processes and diseases (Ma2021PPDPF). PPDPF disrupts the interaction between Raptor and DDB1, a protein involved in cellular processes, thereby inhibiting the ubiquitination of Raptor by the CUL4B-DDB1 E3 ligase complex. This disruption affects the interaction between Raptor and mTOR, which is essential for mTORC1 activation (Ma2021PPDPF).

The critical amino acid residues responsible for the interaction between PPDPF and Raptor are identified as 51-64aa of PPDPF. Mutating these residues to alanine disrupts the interaction with Raptor, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Ma2021PPDPF). PPDPF's ability to interfere with the Raptor-DDB1 interaction is crucial for its role in modulating mTOR signaling and lipid metabolism, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Ma2021PPDPF).
