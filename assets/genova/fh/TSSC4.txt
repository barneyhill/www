# TSSC4

## Overview
TSSC4 is a gene that encodes the tumor suppressing subtransferable candidate 4 protein, which plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, a critical component of the spliceosome involved in pre-mRNA splicing. The TSSC4 protein is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, allowing it to interact with multiple spliceosomal components simultaneously, thereby facilitating the assembly and stability of the spliceosome (Bergfort2022The; Klimešová2021TSSC4). As a helicase inhibitor and multi-interaction coordinator, TSSC4 ensures the proper recruitment of splicing factors during specific phases of the splicing cycle, maintaining the integrity of the splicing machinery (Bergfort2022The). Clinically, TSSC4 has been implicated in various cancers, including glioblastoma and adrenocortical carcinoma, where its expression levels and interactions can influence tumor suppression and drug resistance (Gara2015Integrated; Chen2022Tumor).

## Structure
The TSSC4 protein is characterized by its intrinsic disorder, lacking any known folded domains as indicated by fold prediction algorithms and BLAST searches (Bergfort2022The). It is a 329-residue protein that does not adopt regular secondary structures upon binding, which suggests that its binding mechanism does not involve a rate-limiting folding step (Bergfort2022The). The protein's disordered nature allows it to bridge large distances within complexes, facilitating interactions with multiple components simultaneously (Bergfort2022The).

TSSC4 interacts with spliceosomal components through four conserved, non-contiguous regions in its C-terminal half, engaging in aromatic stacking, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions (Bergfort2022The). These regions are highly conserved, indicating a similar mode of interaction across different organisms (Bergfort2022The). The C-terminal region of TSSC4 is involved in binding interfaces of the PRP8 JAB1/MPN-BRR2 helicase domains, which assists in organizing the U5 snRNP architecture (Riabov2024Structural).

The protein's interactions with other spliceosomal proteins, such as SNRNP200 and PRPF8, are crucial for its role as a helicase inhibitor and multi-interaction coordinator during snRNP assembly and recycling (Bergfort2022The). The intrinsic disorder of TSSC4 supports the formation of the PRPF8-SNRNP200 complex and the assembly of the U5 snRNP sub-module (Bergfort2022The).

## Function
The TSSC4 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing in human cells. TSSC4 acts as a chaperone, facilitating the association of U5 snRNP with the U4/U6 di-snRNP to form the U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP complex, a critical component of the spliceosome (Klimešová2021TSSC4). This process is vital for the proper assembly and stability of the spliceosome, ensuring accurate mRNA splicing (Klimešová2021TSSC4).

TSSC4 interacts with several components of the U5 snRNP, including PRPF8, SNRNP200, and EFTUD2, and is involved in specific steps of U5 snRNP maturation (Klimešová2021TSSC4). It also associates with the PRPF19 complex, suggesting a role in post-splicing U5 snRNP recycling (Klimešová2021TSSC4). The protein is mainly nuclear but shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, indicating a dynamic role in snRNP assembly and function (Klimešová2021TSSC4).

TSSC4 acts as a helicase inhibitor and multi-interaction coordinator, preventing premature interactions during U5 snRNP assembly and ensuring that splicing factors are recruited only during specific phases of the splicing cycle (Bergfort2022The). Its function is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the splicing machinery, and its downregulation leads to defects in tri-snRNP formation, affecting RNA splicing efficiency (Klimešová2021TSSC4).

## Clinical Significance
TSSC4 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in tumor suppression and autophagy regulation. In glioblastoma (GBM), TSSC4 expression is associated with increased drug resistance to temozolomide (TMZ), a common chemotherapy drug. TSSC4 inhibits TMZ-induced autophagy, which is a mechanism that can lead to cell death in cancer cells. Knockout of TSSC4 in GBM cells increases autophagy and cell death, suggesting that downregulation of TSSC4 could sensitize GBM cells to TMZ treatment (Chen2022Tumor).

In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), TSSC4 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene that is often lost due to copy number variations. The loss of TSSC4, along with other tumor suppressor genes, is suggested to contribute to the malignancy of ACC (Gara2015Integrated).

TSSC4 is also involved in the assembly and function of the U5 snRNP, a component of the spliceosome. Alterations in TSSC4 interactions with spliceosomal components can affect RNA splicing, although the clinical implications of these interactions are not fully understood (Klimešová2021TSSC4).

## Interactions
The TSSC4 protein is involved in several interactions with components of the spliceosomal machinery, particularly within the U5 snRNP complex. It interacts with the spliceosomal SNRNP200 RNA helicase and PRPF8, forming stable complexes with these proteins. TSSC4 binds to the helicase region of SNRNP200, specifically the C-terminal cassette, which regulates the active N-terminal cassette (Bergfort2022The). TSSC4 also interacts with the PRPF8 Jab1 domain, which regulates SNRNP200's helicase activity by inserting a tail into its RNA-binding tunnel. This interaction is stable and independent of SNRNP200 (Bergfort2022The).

TSSC4 acts as a helicase inhibitor, reducing the unwinding rate of U4/U6 di-snRNA by up to 50% in the presence of PRPF8 Jab1, and it plays a crucial role in U5 snRNP and U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP assembly and recycling (Bergfort2022The). It also interacts with U5-specific proteins such as PRPF8, EFTUD2, and SNRNP200, and associates with U5 snRNP chaperones and the U5/PRPF19 particle, promoting the formation of the U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP necessary for splicing (Klimešová2021TSSC4). These interactions suggest that TSSC4 functions as a multi-interaction coordinator during snRNP assembly and recycling.
