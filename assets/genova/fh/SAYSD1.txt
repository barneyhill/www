# SAYSD1

## Overview
SAYSD1 is a gene that encodes the protein SAYSVFN motif domain containing 1, which is a membrane protein primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis through its involvement in the translocation-associated quality control (TAQC) mechanism, which is essential for the degradation of translation-stalled proteins at the ER. SAYSD1 is characterized by a kinked transmembrane domain and a highly conserved SAYSvFN-containing domain, which are vital for its function in protein translocation and quality control. The protein interacts with the Sec61 translocon and UFMylated ribosomes, facilitating the elimination of misfolded proteins and preventing ER stress. SAYSD1's role in cellular health extends to its potential involvement in collagen biogenesis and its implications in diseases such as ovarian cancer and prostate cancer, where it may serve as a biomarker for prognosis (Wang2022SAYSD1; Li2021Screening; De2021Long).

## Structure
The SAYSD1 protein is a membrane protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and partially in perinuclear puncta associated with the Golgi apparatus (Wang2022SAYSD1). Structurally, SAYSD1 is predicted to have a kinked transmembrane domain (TMD) with both N- and C-termini facing the cytosol. This TMD may bind to the Sec61 translocon, a key component of the ER translocon (Wang2022SAYSD1). The protein contains a short helical segment preceding the TMD and a highly conserved SAYSvFN-containing domain (SACD) (Wang2022SAYSD1).

The middle helical (MH) segment of SAYSD1 is crucial for its interaction with UFM1, acting as a UFM1 binding site (Wang2022SAYSD1). The N17 domain, predicted to form a helix with a conserved phenylalanine followed by four positively charged residues, binds directly to ribosomes independent of UFMylation (Wang2022SAYSD1). This ribosome binding is essential for the Translocation-Associated Quality Control (TAQC) process (Wang2022SAYSD1).

Mutations in the SAYSvFN motif or deletions in specific regions of SAYSD1 impair its function, highlighting the importance of these conserved motifs (Wang2022SAYSD1). The protein's role in collagen biogenesis and potential involvement in neuronal dysfunctions related to the UFMylation system have also been noted (Wang2022SAYSD1).

## Function
The SAYSD1 gene encodes a membrane protein that plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in healthy human cells. SAYSD1 is involved in the translocation-associated quality control (TAQC) mechanism, which is essential for the elimination of translation-stalled proteins at the ER. This process is crucial for safeguarding collagen biogenesis and preventing ER stress, thereby ensuring proper protein folding and assembly (Wang2022SAYSD1).

SAYSD1 functions by sensing UFMylated ribosomes, a post-translational modification similar to ubiquitination, and interacts with the Sec61 translocon, a key component of the ER translocation machinery. This interaction is enhanced under conditions that cause ribosome UFMylation, such as treatment with anisomycin (Wang2022SAYSD1). The N-terminal domain of SAYSD1 binds directly to ribosomes, promoting the degradation of misfolded proteins in the ER (Wang2022SAYSD1).

SAYSD1 is localized mainly in the ER and partially in perinuclear puncta, indicating it may cycle between these compartments (Wang2022SAYSD1). Its role in protein translocation and quality control is vital for cellular health, as it helps prevent the accumulation of faulty proteins and maintains ER protein homeostasis (Wang2022SAYSD1).

## Clinical Significance
SAYSD1 has been identified as a protective gene in ovarian cancer, with high expression levels associated with improved survival rates. It is considered a potential biomarker for ovarian cancer prognosis, suggesting that SAYSD1 may play a role in inhibiting cancer progression (Li2021Screening). 

In the context of protein homeostasis, SAYSD1 is involved in the UFMylation pathway, which is crucial for the quality control of protein translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations or disruptions in this pathway can lead to defects in collagen biogenesis and increased endoplasmic reticulum stress, as observed in Drosophila models. These defects may have broader implications for diseases related to collagen and potentially central nervous system disorders, although specific clinical associations in humans remain unclear (Wang2022SAYSD1).

SAYSD1 has also been implicated in the regulation of long non-coding RNAs in prostate cancer, particularly in the ERG-positive subtype. The lncRNA lnc-SAYSD1-1 is associated with low-grade ERG-positive prostate cancer, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (De2021Long). However, the precise clinical significance of SAYSD1 mutations in other diseases is not well-documented, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in human health.

## Interactions
SAYSD1 is a protein that interacts with several key components involved in co-translational protein translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It binds to the Sec61 translocon, a critical part of the ER translocon complex, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and co-sedimentation studies (Wang2022SAYSD1). SAYSD1 also interacts with the UFMylation ligase UFL1, although this interaction is not significant with ribosomes unless ribosome UFMylation is induced by anisomycin treatment (Wang2022SAYSD1).

The N17 domain of SAYSD1 is crucial for its ribosome binding capability. This domain can bind to ribosomes independently of UFMylation, interacting with both UFM1-conjugated and unmodified RPL26. This interaction is specific to the N17 domain and is essential for the efficient turnover of ER GFP_K20, a process related to translationally associated quality control (TAQC) (Wang2022SAYSD1).

SAYSD1 also plays a role in sensing UFMylated ribosomes, facilitating the engagement with stalled nascent chain-ribosome complexes in a UFM1-dependent manner. This interaction is reduced in UFM1 knockout cells and in cells lacking the UFMylation site on RPL26, highlighting the importance of UFM1 in this process (Wang2022SAYSD1).
