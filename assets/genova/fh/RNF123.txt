# RNF123

## Overview
RNF123 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 123, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, essential for its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. RNF123 is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and immune responses, by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal health. The protein is part of the Kip1 ubiquitylation-promoting complex (KPC), which regulates the degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, thereby influencing cell cycle dynamics. Additionally, RNF123 has been implicated in the degradation of proteins involved in immune signaling pathways, such as the NF-kB precursor p105, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Cai2022The; Sun2020Cyclin; Tognon2018Insulinlike).

## Structure
RNF123, also known as KPC1, is a protein characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, which is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This domain is located in the C-terminal region of the protein and is essential for its catalytic activity, particularly in the degradation of target proteins such as heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) isoforms and ATR kinase (Chaturvedi2012Ubiquitin; Muralikrishna2012Lamin). The protein also contains an N-terminal SPRY domain, which, along with the RING finger domain, is necessary for its function in protein degradation (Chaturvedi2012Ubiquitin).

RNF123 includes a canonical HP1 binding sequence, PTVLL, which facilitates its interaction with HP1 proteins. Mutation of this sequence affects its ability to deplete HP1 isoforms, although it does not impact its overall catalytic activity (Chaturvedi2012Ubiquitin). The protein is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and its activity is regulated through interactions with other proteins and possibly through post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination. While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of these domains and motifs highlights the structural complexity of RNF123 and its role in cellular processes (Sun2020Cyclin).

## Function
RNF123, also known as ring finger protein 123, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a crucial pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. This protein is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination, which can lead to their proteasomal degradation or modulation of their activity (Cai2022The). RNF123 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular homeostasis and organismal health by regulating cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and immune responses.

In the context of cell biology, RNF123 is part of the Kip1 ubiquitylation-promoting complex (KPC), which is known to regulate the degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 at the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Tognon2018Insulinlike). This regulation is essential for maintaining proper cell cycle progression and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation. Additionally, RNF123 has been implicated in the degradation of various proteins, including the NF-kB precursor p105, which is involved in immune signaling pathways (Sun2020Cyclin). These activities highlight RNF123's role in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis through its involvement in protein degradation and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNF123 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Sézary syndrome, an aggressive form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, RNF123 expression is altered, suggesting its potential role in the disease's pathogenesis. The study identified genetic rearrangements involving RNF123, which may contribute to the altered gene expression observed in patients (Iżykowska2017Genetic).

RNF123 is also involved in the degradation of heterochromatin proteins HP1α and HP1β, particularly in the context of lamin A/C knock-down cells. This degradation process is significant in conditions related to laminopathies, which include muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies. The upregulation of RNF123 in these conditions leads to increased proteasomal degradation of HP1 proteins, potentially affecting chromatin organization and gene regulation (Chaturvedi2012Ubiquitin).

In cancer, RNF123, also known as KPC1, plays a role in the degradation of oncogenic proteins. It is involved in the proteasomal degradation of the ETV6-NTRK3 chimeric oncoprotein, a process that is crucial for regulating cell transformation and tumorigenesis. This suggests that RNF123 may be a potential therapeutic target in cancers where this oncoprotein is expressed (Tognon2018Insulinlike).

## Interactions
RNF123, also known as KPC1, is a ubiquitin ligase that participates in several protein interactions, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) isoforms, specifically HP1α and HP1β, facilitating their proteasomal degradation in the context of lamin A/C knockdown in HeLa cells. This interaction is mediated through a canonical HP1 binding sequence, PTVLL, in RNF123, which is essential for its activity in degrading HP1 proteins (Chaturvedi2012Ubiquitin). Mutations in this motif reduce RNF123's binding and degradation capabilities, although its overall catalytic activity remains unaffected (Chaturvedi2012Ubiquitin).

RNF123 also interacts with the ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) chimeric oncoprotein, where it mediates EN's degradation. This process is inhibited by the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), which stabilizes EN by blocking RNF123-mediated degradation (Tognon2018Insulinlike). The interaction between RNF123 and EN is enhanced when IGF1R activity is inhibited, leading to increased polyubiquitylation and degradation of EN (Tognon2018Insulinlike).

In the context of preeclampsia, RNF123 interacts with the protein Dvl2, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is regulated by Cyclin G2 (CCNG2), which enhances the binding between RNF123 and Dvl2, affecting the Wnt/PCP-JNK signaling pathway (Sun2020Cyclin).
