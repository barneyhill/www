# PRKAG2

## Overview
The PRKAG2 gene encodes the protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit gamma 2, a regulatory component of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex, which plays a pivotal role in cellular energy homeostasis. This protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit within the kinase family, specifically involved in energy sensing and metabolic regulation. The gamma 2 subunit, characterized by its cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains, is essential for binding nucleotides such as AMP and ATP, thereby modulating AMPK activity in response to cellular energy levels (CHEUNG2000Characterization; Xu2017A). Mutations in PRKAG2 are linked to various pathological conditions, including cardiac hypertrophy and glycogen storage diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Ahmad2005Increased; Arad2002Constitutively). The gene's expression and the resulting protein interactions underscore its critical role in maintaining energy balance and cardiac function (Song2023Abnormal; Xu2017A).

## Structure
The PRKAG2 gene encodes the γ2 subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a crucial regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. The γ2 subunit is a protein composed of 569 amino acids with a molecular mass of 63 kDa (CHEUNG2000Characterization). Its primary structure includes four consecutive cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains, which are characteristic of AMPK γ subunits (Lang2000Molecular). These domains are involved in nucleotide binding, which is essential for the protein's regulatory function.

The γ2 subunit has a long N-terminal extension compared to the γ1 isoform, which is not present in the γ1 subunit (CHEUNG2000Characterization). This extension includes a potential nuclear localization signal, suggesting a role in subcellular targeting (CHEUNG2000Characterization). The γ2 subunit's tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these domains into a functional unit that interacts with the catalytic α and regulatory β subunits of AMPK, forming a heterotrimeric complex (CHEUNG2000Characterization).

The PRKAG2 gene produces two splice variant isoforms, PRKAG2-a and PRKAG2-b, which may have different transcription initiation sites and potentially distinct roles in vivo (Lang2000Molecular). These isoforms contribute to the diversity of AMPK complexes and their regulatory functions.

## Function
The PRKAG2 gene encodes the gamma-2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. In healthy human cells, AMPK functions as an energy sensor, activated by an increased AMP/ATP ratio during low energy states. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of the AMPK complex, which subsequently activates catabolic pathways that generate ATP and inhibits anabolic processes that consume ATP, thereby restoring energy balance (Xu2017A).

The gamma-2 subunit, encoded by PRKAG2, contains cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) motifs that form Bateman domains, which are crucial for binding AMP and ATP. These interactions regulate AMPK activity by modulating its sensitivity to changes in cellular energy levels (Xu2017A; Steinberg2009AMPK). The PRKAG2 gene is involved in various metabolic processes, including glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis, primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Kim2012AMPK).

Mutations in PRKAG2 can disrupt these processes, leading to altered AMPK activity and associated pathological conditions, such as cardiac phenotypes and glycogen storage diseases (Kahn2005AMP-activated; Xu2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKAG2 gene are associated with a distinct cardiac syndrome known as PRKAG2 syndrome. This condition is characterized by cardiac hypertrophy, conduction system abnormalities, and glycogen storage disease, which can mimic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (Ahmad2005Increased; Arad2002Constitutively). The syndrome often presents with ventricular pre-excitation, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and can lead to severe cardiac hypertrophy and conduction defects (Blair2001Mutations; Porto2016Clinical).

Specific mutations, such as Arg302Gln and Asn488Ile, have been identified as causing increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, leading to glycogen accumulation in cardiac myocytes (Ahmad2005Increased; Banankhah2018Cardiac). This accumulation results in cardiac hypertrophy and conduction system disease, with symptoms including arrhythmias and heart failure (Ahmad2005Increased; Porto2016Clinical).

PRKAG2 mutations can also affect skeletal muscle, as seen in cases of muscular glycogenosis, where glycogen accumulates in skeletal muscle, leading to symptoms such as muscle stiffness and elevated serum creatine kinase levels (Laforêt2006A). The clinical spectrum of PRKAG2 syndrome is broad, with some patients experiencing sudden cardiac death or requiring pacemaker implantation due to advanced conduction system disease (Porto2016Clinical).

## Interactions
PRKAG2, a regulatory subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular energy homeostasis. It interacts with other AMPK subunits, such as the catalytic alpha subunit (PRKAA) and the beta subunit (PRKAB), to form a functional enzyme complex that regulates energy balance in cells (LindholmPerry2014DNA).

PRKAG2 also interacts with proteins involved in glycogen metabolism and cardiac function. Mutations in PRKAG2, such as the K475E mutation, have been shown to affect AMPK activity and influence pathways related to cardiac hypertrophy through the mTOR signaling pathway (Xu2017A). This mutation leads to increased basal AMPK activity and affects the phosphorylation of proteins involved in cell growth, such as p70S6K and 4E-BP1, indicating its role in activating cell growth pathways (Xu2017A).

Additionally, PRKAG2 is involved in interactions with transcription factors like PPARγ, which positively regulates PRKAG2 transcription. The long non-coding RNA PRKAG2-AS interacts with PPARγ to regulate the expression of PRKAG2b and PRKAG2d, impacting cardiomyocyte survival under hypoxic conditions (Song2023Abnormal). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PRKAG2 in cellular processes and its importance in maintaining cardiac function.
