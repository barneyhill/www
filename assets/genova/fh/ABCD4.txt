# ABCD4

## Overview
ABCD4 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 4 (ABCD4) protein, which is a crucial component of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein is primarily localized on the lysosomal membrane and plays a significant role in the transport of cobalamin (vitamin B12) from the lysosome to the cytosol. ABCD4 is characterized by its transmembrane domain and nucleotide-binding domain, which facilitate its function as a transporter. The protein's activity is essential for the conversion of cobalamin into its active forms, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, which are vital for DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation. Mutations in the ABCD4 gene can lead to metabolic disorders, such as cblJ disorder, due to impaired cobalamin processing and transport (Coelho2012Mutations; Imanaka2019Biogenesis). The interaction of ABCD4 with other proteins, such as LMBD1 and MMACHC, underscores its importance in maintaining proper vitamin B12 metabolism (Deme2014Purification; Kawaguchi2016Translocation).

## Structure
The ABCD4 protein is a human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter localized on the lysosomal membrane, essential for the efflux of cobalamin (vitamin B12) from the lysosome to the cytosol. It is composed of 606 amino acids and features a transmembrane domain (TMD) with six transmembrane helices, followed by a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) (Xu2019CryoEM). The cryo-EM structure of ABCD4 reveals a lysosome-open conformation with two ATP molecules binding at the interface between two NBDs. The NBDs form a head-to-tail dimer via extensive contacts, with ATP molecules stabilized by the Walker A motif of one NBD and the ABC signature motif of the other. The transmembrane helices pack closely at the cytosolic side and diverge into two 'wings' facing the lysosomal matrix (Xu2019CryoEM).

The ABC signature motif of ABCD4 is LSPGE, differing from the canonical LSGGQ, which may influence its ATPase activity. The ATP-binding site involves interactions with residues such as Pro397, Val523, Arg508, and Glu528 (Xu2019CryoEM). The structure also maps clinically identified pathogenic mutations, such as N141K, F319C, and R432Q, to specific regions of the protein (Xu2019CryoEM).

## Function
ABCD4 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically subfamily D, and plays a crucial role in vitamin B12 (cobalamin) metabolism in healthy human cells. The protein is localized to lysosomes, where it is involved in the transport of vitamin B12 from the lysosome to the cytosol. This process is essential for the conversion of cobalamin into its active cofactors, methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), which are vital for DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation (Imanaka2019Biogenesis).

ABCD4 is synthesized and initially inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes before being translocated to lysosomes. This translocation is facilitated by the lysosomal membrane protein LMBD1, with which ABCD4 forms a complex. The lysosomal localization of ABCD4 is significantly reduced in LMBD1 knockout cells, indicating LMBD1's role in ABCD4 localization (Imanaka2019Biogenesis).

Mutations in ABCD4 can lead to the accumulation of cobalamin in lysosomes, resulting in lower intracellular levels of enzyme-bound cobalamin and reduced synthesis of MeCbl and AdoCbl. This highlights the importance of ABCD4's ATPase activity in cobalamin processing (Coelho2012Mutations; Imanaka2019Biogenesis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCD4 gene are associated with several metabolic disorders, primarily affecting vitamin B12 (cobalamin) metabolism. These mutations can lead to cblJ disorder, characterized by methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, due to impaired cobalamin processing and transport (Fettelschoss2017Clinical; Kitai2021The). Specific mutations, such as N141K, Y319C, and R432Q, have been identified to disrupt the ATPase activity of ABCD4, which is crucial for its function in cobalamin transport. The R432Q mutation, in particular, results in significantly reduced ATPase activity, leading to defects in cobalamin metabolism (Kitai2021The).

The interaction between ABCD4 and the protein LMBD1 is essential for the proper lysosomal export of cobalamin to the cytosol. Mutations in the ATPase domain of ABCD4 can disrupt this interaction, leading to impaired cobalamin metabolism and associated symptoms such as hypotonia, poor feeding, and unusual pigmentation defects (Fettelschoss2017Clinical). In zebrafish models, loss of ABCD4 results in vitamin B12-deficiency anemia, demonstrating the gene's critical role in red blood cell development and function (Choi2019Loss).

## Interactions
ABCD4 interacts with the escort protein LMBD1, which is crucial for its translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to lysosomes. This interaction is essential for the proper lysosomal targeting and function of ABCD4, particularly in the context of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) metabolism (Fettelschoss2017Clinical; Kawaguchi2016Translocation). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed a physical interaction between ABCD4 and LMBD1, with LMBD1 binding to ABCD4 dimers rather than monomers (Kawaguchi2016Translocation). 

Mutations in the ATPase domain of ABCD4 can disrupt its interaction with LMBD1, affecting the protein's function and lysosomal targeting. These mutations can lead to disorders in cobalamin metabolism, such as cblJ deficiency (Fettelschoss2017Clinical). The interaction between ABCD4 and LMBD1 is characterized by high affinity and slow dissociation kinetics, suggesting a stable complex formation that is crucial for intracellular vitamin B12 transport (Deme2014Purification).

ABCD4 also interacts with the cytoplasmic vitamin B12-processing protein MMACHC, forming a complex that facilitates the delivery of lysosomal vitamin B12 to the cytoplasm (Deme2014Purification). These interactions highlight the role of ABCD4 in the lysosomal cobalamin pathway and its importance in maintaining proper vitamin B12 metabolism.
