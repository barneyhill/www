# PSMF1

## Overview
PSMF1 is a gene that encodes the proteasome inhibitor subunit 1, also known as PI31, a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of proteasomal activity. The proteasome is a crucial multicatalytic enzyme complex responsible for degrading intracellular proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes such as the cell cycle and stress responses. PI31 functions as an inhibitor by binding to the 20S core particle of the proteasome, potentially acting as a cap to block substrate entry and inactivate the proteasome. This inhibition is counteracted by interactions with valosin-containing protein (VCP), which sequesters PI31, allowing the reassembly of the active 26S proteasome. The balance between PI31 and VCP is essential for proper proteasome function, and dysregulation of this balance has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (McCutchenMaloney2000cDNA; Clemen2015VCP).

## Function
PSMF1 encodes the proteasome inhibitor subunit 1, also known as PI31, which plays a critical role in regulating proteasomal activity in human cells. The proteasome is a multicatalytic enzyme complex responsible for degrading intracellular proteins, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, cell cycle progression, and stress responses. PSMF1 functions as a potent inhibitor of the proteasome by binding to the outer rings of the 20S proteasome core, potentially acting as a cap that blocks substrate entry, thereby inactivating the proteasome (McCutchenMaloney2000cDNA; Clemen2015VCP).

The inhibitory action of PSMF1 is counteracted by valosin-containing protein (VCP), which sequesters PSMF1, allowing the reassembly of the active 26S proteasome. This interaction highlights the antagonistic roles of PSMF1 and VCP in proteasome regulation, with PSMF1 inhibiting and VCP promoting proteasomal activity (Clemen2015VCP; Albornoz2019Cellular). PSMF1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes and contributing to organismal health by maintaining the balance of protein degradation and synthesis (Gomes2013Genetics). The regulation of proteasomal activity by PSMF1 is crucial for cellular homeostasis and is implicated in various human diseases when dysfunctional (Clemen2015VCP).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PSMF1 gene, which encodes the proteasome inhibitor subunit 1, have been associated with various clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), higher mRNA expression levels of PSMF1 in tumor tissues, especially in lung squamous cell carcinoma, have been linked to better survival outcomes. This suggests a potential tumor suppressor role for PSMF1 in NSCLC, with the rs13040574A allele being associated with increased expression and a lower risk of death (Yang2021Potentially). 

PSMF1 also interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP) to regulate proteasomal activity. This interaction is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, and disruptions can contribute to disease pathogenesis. In particular, PSMF1 acts as a potent inhibitor of proteasomal activity, and its interaction with VCP can modulate this effect, potentially impacting conditions like neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (Clemen2015VCP). 

Additionally, PSMF1 is part of a 12-gene risk signature associated with amino acid metabolism and immune response in gliomas, where its expression levels can influence patient prognosis and response to immunotherapy (Xu2021Development).

## Interactions
PSMF1, also known as proteasome inhibitor subunit 1, interacts with various proteins to regulate proteasomal activity. It is known to form a complex with the 20S core particle of the proteasome, inhibiting its proteolytic activity by preventing the assembly of the active 26S proteasome from the 19S and 20S particles (Clemen2015VCP). PSMF1 can also form multimers that bind to the 20S proteasome, creating inactive complexes (Clemen2015VCP).

The interaction between PSMF1 and VCP (valosin-containing protein) is particularly significant. VCP can sequester PSMF1 from the 20S proteasome, allowing the reassembly of the active 26S proteasome, thus counteracting the inhibitory effect of PSMF1 (Clemen2015VCP). This interaction has been confirmed through pull-down assays and luminescence-based methods, showing that VCP binds to PSMF1 with a strength comparable to its known partners Ufd1 and Npl4 (Clemen2015VCP).

PSMF1 also shares a conserved PI31 proteasome regulator domain with Fub1p, a yeast protein, suggesting a functional correlation. This domain is crucial for binding the 20S core particle and inhibiting proteasome activity (Hatanaka2011Fub1p).
