# PDK3

## Overview
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (PDK3) is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3, which is a member of the kinase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism by regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) through phosphorylation, thereby modulating the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and influencing energy production pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Anwar2020Effect; Baker2000Marked). PDK3 is particularly significant in tissues that rely on fatty acid oxidation and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including metabolic regulation during starvation, cancer metabolism, and certain neurodegenerative diseases (Narayanan2021Charcot–Marie–tooth; Baker2000Marked). The enzyme's unique regulatory properties and its role in disease make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Dahiya2019Investigation; Liu2024PDK3).

## Structure
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (PDK3) is a member of the GHKL ATPase/kinase superfamily and plays a crucial role in regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) by phosphorylating its E1α subunit, leading to its inactivation (Anwar2020Effect). The molecular structure of PDK3 includes two primary domains: the N-terminal lipoate and pyruvate-binding regulatory domain (R-domain) and the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (K-domain) (Anwar2020Effect). 

The secondary structure of PDK3 is characterized by a significant α-helix content, maintaining a native-like structure with 63% α-helix and 4% β-sheet content in neutral to slightly alkaline pH conditions (Anwar2020Effect). The tertiary structure of PDK3 involves a three-dimensional folding that includes a kinase domain responsible for its enzymatic activity. The crystal structure of PDK3 reveals that it can form a complex with the L2 domain, which binds to the lipoyl-binding pocket in the N-terminal domain (Anwar2020Effect).

PDK3's quaternary structure may involve homodimer formation, which is common among kinases, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect PDK3's activity and stability, although specific sites and effects are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (PDK3) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which is essential for glucose and fat metabolism, aerobic respiration, and maintaining glucose homeostasis in healthy human cells (Mohammad2020Identification). PDK3 achieves this by phosphorylating the E1 component of PDC, thereby inhibiting its activity and controlling the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and NADH, which are crucial for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and energy production (Patel2001Regulation; Baker2000Marked).

PDK3 is activated by the L2 domain of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component of PDC, which significantly increases its catalytic activity (Baker2000Marked). This activation is crucial for tissues that rely on fatty acid oxidation, such as during starvation or in diabetic states, where PDK3 overexpression limits glucose oxidation (Baker2000Marked). PDK3 is relatively insensitive to inhibition by pyruvate or dichloroacetate, which are known effectors of PDK activity, highlighting its unique regulatory properties (Baker2000Marked).

The enzyme is primarily expressed in the testis, although its physiological significance in other tissues is not fully determined (KOLOBOVA2001Regulation). PDK3's activity is modulated by thiamine pyrophosphate, which affects the rate and extent of phosphorylation, thereby influencing the reactivation of phospho-PDC by phosphatases (KOLOBOVA2001Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PDK3 gene have significant clinical implications. The p.R158H mutation in PDK3 is associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type X6 (CMTX6), a neurological disorder characterized by axonal degeneration and mitochondrial dysfunction. This mutation leads to increased kinase activity, resulting in hyperphosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, mitochondrial dysfunction, and energy deficits, which contribute to neurodegeneration (Narayanan2021Charcot–Marie–tooth; PerezSiles2020Energy).

In cancer, PDK3 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in urothelial carcinoma and colorectal cancer. In urothelial carcinoma, elevated PDK3 expression is associated with tumor invasiveness and metabolic reprogramming, suggesting its role as a biomarker for poor prognosis (Kuo2021Overexpression). In colorectal cancer, PDK3 acts as a pro-oncogene, promoting cell proliferation and immune evasion through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Knockdown of PDK3 in cancer cell lines results in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2024PDK3).

These findings highlight the diverse roles of PDK3 in disease, from contributing to neurodegenerative conditions to promoting cancer progression and immune evasion.

## Interactions
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (PDK3) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) by phosphorylating its E1 component, thereby inhibiting its activity. This regulation is essential for controlling the metabolic switch in cancer cells, known as the Warburg effect, where cells favor glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation even in the presence of oxygen (Dahiya2019Investigation; Anwar2020Discovery).

PDK3 interacts with the E2 component of the PDC, which is part of its regulatory function in glucose metabolism. The enzyme's activity is not subject to feedback inhibition, unlike other PDK isoforms, making it a unique target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Anwar2020Discovery). PDK3's interactions are significant in the context of cancer metabolism, as its overexpression is linked to drug resistance and early recurrence in certain cancers, such as colon cancer (Mohammad2020Identification).

Inhibitors targeting PDK3, such as quercetin and hordenine, have been studied for their potential to disrupt these interactions by binding to the ATP-binding site of PDK3, thereby inhibiting its kinase activity and affecting cancer cell metabolism (Dahiya2019Investigation; Anwar2020Discovery). These interactions highlight the importance of PDK3 as a target in cancer therapy.
