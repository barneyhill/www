# ICMT

## Overview
The ICMT gene encodes the enzyme isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase, a critical component in the post-translational modification of prenylated proteins. This enzyme is categorized as an integral membrane protein and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the methylation of isoprenylated cysteine residues. This modification is essential for the proper localization and function of proteins involved in key cellular processes, such as signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization. The enzyme's activity is crucial for the stability and membrane association of proteins like Ras and Rho GTPases, which play significant roles in cell growth and apoptosis (Anderson20069; Wright2009Topology). ICMT's function is highly conserved across species, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal organismal development (Bergo2001Isoprenylcysteine).

## Structure
The isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is characterized by a multi-pass transmembrane structure, traversing the membrane eight times, with both the N and C termini oriented towards the cytosol (Wright2009Topology). The protein features a helix-turn-helix structure formed by the final two transmembrane segments, which are crucial for maintaining its topology (Wright2009Topology).

The enzyme's active site spans both cytosolic and membrane-embedded regions, allowing it to interact with both water-soluble and lipophilic substrates (Diver2014Mutational). Specific conserved residues, such as E107, F124, W241, and E251, are essential for its catalytic activity (Wright2009Topology). The AdoMet binding site is located in the C-terminal third of the sequence, involving the cytosolic M6-M7 loop, the M8 extension, and the C-terminal helix (Diver2014Mutational).

ICMT shares structural similarities with other methyltransferases, such as PEMT, and uses S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor (Diver2014Mutational). The enzyme's structure is highly conserved across species, indicating its critical function in the post-translational modification of prenylated proteins (Wright2009Topology).

## Function
The ICMT gene encodes the enzyme isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins containing a C-terminal CaaX motif. This enzyme is responsible for the methylation of the isoprenylated cysteine residue, a modification essential for the proper localization and function of these proteins within the cell. ICMT is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the final step in the prenylation pathway (Diver2014Mutational; Anderson20069).

The methylation process carried out by ICMT neutralizes the negative charge on the carboxylate group of the isoprenylated cysteine, increasing the hydrophobicity of the protein and promoting its association with lipid membranes. This modification is critical for the correct membrane localization of proteins such as Ras and Rho GTPases, which are involved in key cellular signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis (Kramer2003Isoprenylcysteine; Wright2009Topology).

In healthy human cells, ICMT activity is essential for maintaining the proper localization and function of its protein substrates, ensuring effective signal transduction and cellular homeostasis. The enzyme's role is underscored by the severe developmental defects observed in organisms lacking ICMT, highlighting its importance in normal cellular and organismal development (Bergo2001Isoprenylcysteine; Anderson20069).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ICMT gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly cancer. ICMT is associated with tumor aggressiveness in cancers such as breast and lung cancer. Its expression is regulated by the p53 tumor suppressor, with wild-type p53 repressing ICMT transcription and mutant p53 enhancing its expression. This differential regulation suggests that ICMT overexpression, often seen in the presence of mutant p53, contributes to tumor progression by enhancing tumor-associated phenotypes like clonogenicity and tumorigenic potential (Borini2019Isoprenylcysteine).

In cancer models, ICMT overexpression correlates with poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target. High ICMT mRNA levels are associated with decreased metastasis-free survival in breast cancer and reduced overall survival in lung cancer (Borini2019Isoprenylcysteine).

ICMT also plays a role in progeroid disorders, such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Inhibition of ICMT in a mouse model of progeria improved disease phenotypes, suggesting that targeting ICMT could be beneficial for treating prelamin A-associated disorders (Ibrahim2013Targeting).

## Interactions
Isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) is involved in the post-translational modification of prenylated proteins, which is crucial for their proper localization and function. ICMT methylates the carboxyl group of prenylated proteins, such as Ras and Rho GTPases, enhancing their membrane affinity and interaction with other proteins (Borini2019Isoprenylcysteine; Wright2009Topology). This methylation process is essential for the stability and membrane anchorage of isoprenylated proteins, including the G-protein transducin complex and cone phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) (Christiansen2016Deficiency).

ICMT-mediated methylation is necessary for the interaction of cone PDE6 and GRK1 with PrBPδ, a prenyl-binding protein, which is crucial for their stability and trafficking in photoreceptors (Christiansen2016Deficiency). The enzyme's activity is also linked to the regulation of actin distribution, possibly through interactions with RHO GTPases, affecting the cytoskeleton (Borini2019Isoprenylcysteine). ICMT's role in these interactions highlights its importance in maintaining photoreceptor function and its potential impact on tumor phenotypes through altered protein interactions (Borini2019Isoprenylcysteine; Christiansen2016Deficiency).
