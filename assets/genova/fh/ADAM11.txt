# ADAM11

## Overview
ADAM11 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 11 protein, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family. This family is characterized by proteins that typically possess both disintegrin and metalloprotease domains, although ADAM11 itself lacks proteolytic activity due to an altered metalloprotease consensus motif (Sagane1999Cloning; Rybnikova2002Developmental). The ADAM11 protein is primarily expressed in the nervous system and is involved in cell adhesion and signaling pathways, playing a crucial role in synaptic transmission and neural development (Hsia2019Functions; Pandey2023ADAM11). It interacts with key signaling pathways, such as Wnt and BMP4, influencing processes like neural crest cell migration and neural tube closure (Pandey2023ADAM11). Clinically, ADAM11 is implicated in neurological disorders and various cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and outcomes (Kole2015Selective; Pandey2023ADAM11).

## Structure
ADAM11 is a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family, characterized by a complex domain structure. The protein includes a signal sequence, a propeptide domain, a metalloprotease-like domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Stone1999Structure–Function). Despite the presence of a metalloprotease-like domain, ADAM11 lacks proteolytic activity due to an altered metalloprotease consensus motif (Sagane1999Cloning; Rybnikova2002Developmental).

The disintegrin domain is involved in cell adhesion, potentially acting as an integrin ligand, which is significant for its role in cell-cell interactions (Sagane1999Cloning; Rybnikova2002Developmental). ADAM11 is expressed in various tissues, including the central nervous system, where it may play roles in neural adhesion and axon guidance (Rybnikova2002Developmental).

ADAM11 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, including a membrane-bound form and a soluble isoform lacking the C-terminal transmembrane portion (Rybnikova2002Developmental). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, contributing to its functional diversity (Sagane1999Cloning).

## Function
ADAM11 is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, which is primarily expressed in the nervous system, including both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although it lacks proteolytic activity, ADAM11 plays a significant role in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. It is involved in synaptic transmission by regulating the trafficking of Kv1-potassium ion channels to the presynaptic side of specific synapses in the cerebellum, particularly those involving cerebellar basket cells and Purkinje cells. This regulation is crucial for inhibitory synaptic transmission and ultrarapid electrical signaling (Hsia2019Functions).

ADAM11 also interacts with signaling pathways such as Wnt and BMP4, influencing processes like neural crest cell migration and neural tube closure. It modulates β-catenin activity and BMP4 signaling, which are essential for proper neural development. Loss of ADAM11 can lead to increased β-catenin activity and altered BMP4 signaling, affecting the expression of transcription factors critical for neural tube closure (Pandey2023ADAM11).

In terms of organismal outcomes, ADAM11 is implicated in spatial learning and motor coordination, with its expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum being crucial for these functions (Takahashi2006Deficits).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ADAM11 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders and cancers. In the nervous system, ADAM11 is crucial for the proper localization of voltage-gated potassium channels at the cerebellar basket cell terminal pinceau. Mutations in ADAM11, such as those leading to the loss of these potassium channel clusters, disrupt the ephaptic control of Purkinje cell firing. This disruption is associated with neurological symptoms, including stress-induced tremors and seizures, suggesting that ADAM11 could be a candidate gene for these disorders (Kole2015Selective).

In cancer, ADAM11 is identified as a potential tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly reduced in most solid tumors, including melanoma and invasive breast carcinoma, where its loss may contribute to increased β-catenin activity and CyclinD1 expression, promoting cell proliferation and tumor progression (Pandey2023ADAM11). Conversely, in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer, ADAM11 expression is increased, which is associated with changes in signaling pathways that may maintain cells in a more stem-like state, potentially contributing to malignancy (Pandey2023ADAM11). These findings highlight the dual role of ADAM11 in different cancer types, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts and potentially promoting malignancy in others.

## Interactions
ADAM11 is a non-proteolytic member of the ADAM family that interacts with components of the BMP4 and Wnt signaling pathways. It has been shown to bind to BMP4 and the BMP receptor 1A (BMPR1A) in human Hek293T cells, enhancing BMP4 signaling, which is crucial for processes such as neural tube closure (Pandey2023ADAM11). ADAM11 also interacts with the Wnt receptor Frizzled7 (Fz7), a key component of the β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting a regulatory role in neural crest and cancer cells (Pandey2023ADAM11).

The interactions of ADAM11 with these signaling pathways have been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating its involvement in modulating signaling activities. These interactions suggest that ADAM11 may play a role in maintaining the balance between stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer, as its expression levels correlate with Wnt or BMP4 activation levels in tumors (Pandey2023ADAM11). Despite its lack of proteolytic activity, ADAM11's interactions with these pathways highlight its potential as a regulatory protein in both neural development and cancer progression (Wolfsberg1995ADAM).
