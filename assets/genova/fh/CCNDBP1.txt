# CCNDBP1

## Overview
CCNDBP1, or cyclin D1 binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The protein, also referred to as GCIP, functions primarily as a negative regulator of cell proliferation by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 promoter, thereby reducing cyclin D1 protein expression (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1). This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining genome stability and controlling cell cycle progression. CCNDBP1 is predominantly expressed in differentiating or terminally differentiated cells and is active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional regulation (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1). The protein interacts with various partners, including Sirtuin 6 (SirT6) and TFPT, suggesting its role in transcriptional repression and DNA repair (Yachie2016Pooled‐matrix; Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1). Alterations in CCNDBP1 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its significance as a tumor suppressor and its potential impact on cancer prognosis and treatment strategies (Yang2021CCNDBP1).

## Function
CCNDBP1, also known as GCIP, is a helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein that plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in healthy human cells. It is predominantly expressed in differentiating or terminally differentiated cells, with reduced expression in proliferating cells (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1). CCNDBP1 functions as a negative regulator of cell proliferation by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 promoter, thereby reducing cyclin D1 protein expression (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1). This regulatory activity is crucial for maintaining genome stability and controlling cell cycle progression.

The protein interacts with Sirtuin 6 (SirT6), a class III HDAC protein, suggesting a role in transcriptional repression independent of class I and II HDACs (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1). This interaction is thought to contribute to the protein's function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell growth and promoting differentiation (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1). CCNDBP1 is active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional regulation, impacting cellular growth and development processes (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1). Its expression is highest in tissues such as the heart, muscle, peripheral leukocytes, and brain, indicating its widespread role in maintaining normal cellular functions (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCNDBP1 gene have been linked to various cancers, including dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and colon cancer. In DDL, low expression of CCNDBP1 is associated with poor prognosis and is an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival. The gene acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis through the repression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Yang2021CCNDBP1). DNA methylation at specific sites can decrease CCNDBP1 expression, worsening the prognosis for DDL patients (Yang2021CCNDBP1).

In HCC, CCNDBP1 contributes to chemoresistance by activating the ATM-CHK2 pathway, which is crucial for resistance to DNA damage. This pathway is activated through the inhibition of EZH2 expression, aiding in the survival of cancer cells under chemotherapy-induced stress (Niwa2022Cyclin). In colon cancer, decreased expression of CCNDBP1 is linked to increased tumorigenesis. Overexpression of CCNDBP1 in colon cancer cells inhibits tumor cell colony formation, suggesting its role as a negative regulator of cell proliferation (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CCNDBP1 in cancer prognosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
CCNDBP1, also known as cyclin D1 binding protein 1, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with cyclin D1, playing a role in cell cycle regulation by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 promoter and reducing cyclin D1 protein expression (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1). CCNDBP1 also interacts with Sirtuin 6 (SirT6), a class III HDAC protein, which is important for maintaining genome stability. This interaction suggests that CCNDBP1 may act as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting SirT6, independent of class I and II HDACs (Ma2006GCIPCCNDBP1).

In addition, CCNDBP1 interacts with TFPT, a protein involved in DNA repair and apoptosis, potentially regulating cell death during cell cycle progression (Yachie2016Pooled‐matrix). It also recruits OLIG1, interfering with the OLIG1-SMAD interaction, which affects the transcription of TGF-β-induced genes (Meijer2012Separated). Furthermore, CCNDBP1 interacts with the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an epigenetic silencer, and negatively regulates its expression, particularly in response to DNA damage (Niwa2022Cyclin). These interactions highlight CCNDBP1's role in modulating various signaling pathways and cellular functions.
