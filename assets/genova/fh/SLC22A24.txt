# SLC22A24

## Overview
SLC22A24 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 24, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family 22. This family is known for its role in the transport of organic ions across cell membranes. The SLC22A24 protein is categorized as an organic anion transporter and is distinct within its family due to its unique structure, possessing only six transmembrane regions compared to the typical twelve found in other family members. This structural deviation suggests alternative transport mechanisms and substrate selectivity. SLC22A24 is primarily expressed in the human kidney, specifically in segment 3 of the proximal tubule, where it plays a crucial role in the reabsorption of steroid conjugates, contributing to steroid homeostasis. The protein's function is chloride-dependent and involves the transport of various anionic substrates, including steroid sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, bile acids, and dicarboxylic acids (Yee2021Emerging; Yee2019Unraveling; Jacobsson2007Identification).

## Structure
The SLC22A24 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 22, which is known for its role in transporting organic ions across cell membranes. Unlike most SLC22 family members, which typically have 12 transmembrane domains, SLC22A24 has a deviant topology with only 6 transmembrane regions, suggesting alternative transport mechanisms and binding sites (Jacobsson2007Identification). This unique structure may influence its function and substrate selectivity.

Comparative structure modeling of SLC22A24, using the crystal structure of human GLUT3 as a template, indicates that the protein has an affinity for anionic compounds, consistent with its role in transporting steroid conjugates. The electrostatic potential within the SLC22A24 binding pocket is positively charged, aligning with the transport of anionic substrates (Yee2019Unraveling).

SLC22A24 is part of the OATS4 subgroup, which is associated with the transport of conjugated sex hormones, particularly etiocholanolone glucuronide (Engelhart2020Systems). The protein is expressed in the human kidney, specifically in segment 3 of the proximal tubule, and is Cl-dependent, similar to other transporters like URAT1 and OAT4 (Yee2019Unraveling). The molecular structure of SLC22A24 has been analyzed using comparative structure models, but specific details about its molecular structure, such as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
SLC22A24 is a member of the solute carrier family 22, functioning primarily as an organic anion transporter. It is involved in the transport of steroid conjugates, including steroid sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, bile acids, and dicarboxylic acids. The transporter operates independently of sodium and exchanges with glutaric acid (Yee2019Unraveling; Yee2021Emerging). SLC22A24 is expressed in the renal proximal tubule, specifically in segment 3, where it plays a role in the reabsorption of steroid glucuronides, contributing to steroid homeostasis (Yee2019Unraveling; Yee2021Emerging).

The gene's function is influenced by a common nonsense mutation, p.Tyr501Ter, which is associated with lower plasma levels of certain steroid metabolites, suggesting its role in maintaining steroid homeostasis (Yee2021Emerging). SLC22A24's activity is chloride-dependent, and its uptake of steroid conjugates is enhanced under chloride-free conditions (Yee2019Unraveling). The transporter is also involved in the reabsorption of organic anions in the kidney, contrasting with other transporters like SLC22A8, which are involved in secretion (Yee2019Unraveling). These functions highlight SLC22A24's role in the transport and homeostasis of specific substrates in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and genetic variations in the SLC22A24 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily through their impact on steroid metabolism. A common nonsense variant, p.Tyr501Ter, is associated with significant inter-individual variation in plasma levels of steroid conjugates, such as androsterone glucuronide and etiocholanolone glucuronide. This variant leads to reduced reabsorption capabilities, resulting in lower plasma levels of these metabolites (Yee2019Unraveling; Yee2021Emerging). The presence of this variant is linked to conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and acne, which are associated with dysregulated steroid metabolism (Yee2019Unraveling).

The SLC22A24 gene is expressed specifically in the S3 segment of the human kidney, suggesting a specialized function in this organ. Alterations in its expression or function can affect steroid homeostasis, potentially contributing to conditions like acne, hirsutism, and cardiovascular disease (Yee2019Unraveling). The gene's role in reabsorbing steroid glucuronides in the kidney highlights its importance in maintaining systemic metabolite levels, and its mutations may have broader implications for diseases related to steroid hormone metabolism (Yee2019Unraveling). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of these mutations and their potential impact on drug disposition and therapeutic outcomes (Yee2021Emerging).
