# CCDC121

## Overview
The CCDC121 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 121 protein, which is a member of the coiled-coil domain-containing protein family. These proteins are characterized by their structural motif, the coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and is involved in various cellular processes. Although the specific biological functions of CCDC121 are not fully elucidated, proteins with coiled-coil domains are often implicated in cellular architecture, signaling, and transport. The CCDC121 protein may play a role in these processes, contributing to the regulation of cellular dynamics and integrity. Further research is needed to fully understand the functional implications of CCDC121 in human health and disease.
