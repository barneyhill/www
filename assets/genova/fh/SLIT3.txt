# SLIT3

## Overview
SLIT3 is a gene that encodes the protein slit guidance ligand 3, which is a member of the Slit family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, including leucine-rich repeat domains, epidermal growth factor-like domains, and a laminin G domain, which facilitate its role as a signaling molecule. SLIT3 is primarily involved in axon guidance and cell migration, functioning through interactions with Robo receptors. It plays a crucial role in bone remodeling by influencing osteoblast and osteoclast activities, thereby maintaining bone mass and structure. Additionally, SLIT3 is implicated in angiogenesis and has been studied for its potential tumor suppressor functions, particularly in the context of cancer where it is often epigenetically silenced. The gene's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes makes it a significant focus of research in developmental biology and disease therapeutics (Marulanda2021Controlled; Dickinson2004Epigenetic; Kim2018Osteoclastsecreted).

## Structure
SLIT3 is a protein that belongs to the Slit family, characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of SLIT3 includes four leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, 7-9 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, a laminin G domain, and a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (SCHUBERT2012Fragments). The second LRR domain is particularly important as it mediates interaction with Robo receptors, which are involved in cellular signaling (SCHUBERT2012Fragments).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which affects its size and function. For instance, in lung carcinoma A549 cells, SLIT3 is slightly larger than its theoretical size due to glycosylation (ZHANG2015Effects). SLIT3 is also known to be proteolytically cleaved into a large N-terminal fragment and a shorter C-terminal fragment, with the N-terminal fragment being membrane-associated (ZHANG2015Effects).

SLIT3 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, which may be relevant for its function in axon guidance and cell migration. The protein's modular structure allows it to interact with various proteins, although the full functional significance of these interactions is not completely understood (Holmes2001Expression).

## Function
SLIT3 (slit guidance ligand 3) is a protein that plays a significant role in bone remodeling by coordinating bone resorption and formation. It is secreted by osteoclasts and influences osteoblast migration and proliferation through the activation of β-catenin, suggesting its role as a coupling factor in bone remodeling (Kim2018Osteoclastsecreted). SLIT3 interacts with ROBO receptors, specifically ROBO1 and ROBO3 in osteoclasts, and ROBO1 and ROBO2 in osteoblasts, which is crucial for the suppression of preosteoclast migration and osteoclastogenesis (Kim2018Osteoclastsecreted). 

In the context of bone metabolism, SLIT3 stimulates the migration and proliferation of osteoblast lineages, which are essential for bone formation, and functions as an angiogenic factor, influencing the formation of type H endothelial cells that provide niche signals for osteoprogenitors in the bone microenvironment (Kim2018Osteoclastsecreted). SLIT3 also affects the fusion of preosteoclasts, reducing their fusion without affecting their proliferation, which is linked to decreased expression of the dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (Dc-stamp), essential for preosteoclast fusion (Kim2018Osteoclastsecreted). These activities highlight SLIT3's crucial role in maintaining normal bone mass and its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic bone diseases (Kim2018Osteoclastsecreted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLIT3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In hereditary breast cancer, SLIT3 mutations, specifically the p.Arg154Cys variant, have been identified as having a predisposing role. This mutation is associated with multifocal breast cancer and is found at a higher frequency in high-risk groups compared to healthy individuals (Zagorodnev2021New).

SLIT3 is also involved in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). In mice, the absence of SLIT3 leads to the development of CDH due to defects in diaphragm morphogenesis, resulting in the liver herniating into the thoracic cavity (Yuan2003A). This condition mirrors human CDH, suggesting a significant role for SLIT3 in diaphragm development.

In cancer, SLIT3 is frequently epigenetically silenced through promoter methylation, particularly in breast, colorectal, and glioma cancers. This silencing correlates with its reduced expression in tumor cell lines, and its re-expression has shown growth-inhibitory effects, indicating a potential tumor suppressor role (Dickinson2004Epigenetic).

SLIT3 also affects bone metabolism, where it regulates osteoclastogenesis and bone mass. Variants in SLIT3 are associated with bone mineral density, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for osteoporosis (Kim2018Osteoclastsecreted).

## Interactions
SLIT3 interacts with ROBO receptors, specifically ROBO1, ROBO2, and ROBO3, to mediate its effects on cell migration and bone metabolism. In osteoblasts, SLIT3 directly associates with ROBO1 and ROBO2, stimulating osteoblast migration and proliferation, which is crucial for bone formation (Kim2018Osteoclastsecreted). In osteoclasts, SLIT3 interacts with ROBO1 and ROBO3, where it suppresses osteoclastogenesis and preosteoclast migration, thereby inhibiting bone resorption (Kim2018Osteoclastsecreted).

SLIT3 also plays a role in angiogenesis through its interaction with ROBO4, influencing endothelial cell proliferation and motility. This interaction is significant in the context of diseases characterized by abnormal angiogenesis, such as cancer (Marulanda2021Controlled). The SLIT3-ROBO1 axis is particularly important in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, where it enhances motility and invasion capabilities, contributing to angiogenic processes (Wang2020Tissuespecific).

In the context of cancer, SLIT3 interacts with the β-catenin pathway, acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting this pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression (Ng2018Suppression). These interactions highlight SLIT3's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
