# ZNF711

## Overview
ZNF711 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 711, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is the largest family of transcription factors in humans. This protein is characterized by its 12 C2H2-like zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (AlNaama2020C2H2Type; van2017Mutations). Zinc finger protein 711 is predominantly expressed in the brain and testis, indicating its significant role in these tissues (p&gt; Clinical; Li2020&lt). Functionally, it acts as a transcription factor involved in brain development and cognitive function, interacting with other proteins such as PHF8 to regulate gene expression critical for neurodevelopmental processes (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). Mutations in ZNF711 have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability and other neurodevelopmental disorders, while its expression levels have implications in cancer, particularly in epithelial ovarian cancer, where it influences drug resistance (van2017Mutations; Wu2021ZNF711).

## Structure
ZNF711 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of 12 C2H2-like zinc finger domains, which are classical zinc finger motifs where two cysteine and two histidine residues coordinate a zinc ion, facilitating DNA binding (van2017Mutations; p&gt; Clinical; Li2020&lt). These domains are involved in sequence-specific DNA binding, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (p&gt; Clinical; Li2020&lt). The protein also contains two Zfx/Zfy transcription activation regions, which are typically located N-terminal to the zinc finger domains and have been shown to activate transcription (van2017Mutations).

ZNF711 is predominantly expressed in the brain and testis, indicating its importance in these tissues (p&gt; Clinical; Li2020&lt). The exact tertiary structure of ZNF711 is not detailed in the available literature, but zinc finger proteins generally fold into a stable configuration that allows for DNA interaction. There is no specific information on the quaternary structure of ZNF711, as zinc finger proteins often function as monomers. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination are common in zinc finger proteins, although specific modifications for ZNF711 are not detailed in the provided context. Splice variants of ZNF711 may exist, potentially altering its function or localization, but specific isoforms are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
ZNF711 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in brain development and cognitive function. It is part of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is the largest transcription factor family in humans, known for regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences (AlNaama2020C2H2Type; van2017Mutations). ZNF711 contains two Zfx/Zfy transcription activation regions and 12 C2H2-like domains, which are classical zinc fingers coordinating a zinc ion through two cysteine and two histidine residues (van2017Mutations).

In healthy human cells, ZNF711 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the expression of genes critical for brain development and function. It interacts with the PHD finger protein 8 (PHF8), a histone demethylase highly expressed in neurons, to influence neuronal migration and other neurodevelopmental processes (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). The protein's activity is essential for the regulation of neural stem cell activities, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, which are vital for normal brain function (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). Mutations in ZNF711 can disrupt these processes, leading to intellectual disabilities and other neurodevelopmental disorders (van2017Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF711 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. ZNF711 is associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), specifically non-syndromic forms such as MRX97. Mutations in ZNF711 can lead to mild to moderate intellectual disability, motor delay, poor speech, and sometimes autistic features. These mutations are rare and have been identified in several families, with affected individuals often exhibiting mild facial dysmorphisms (van2017Mutations; Liang2017A).

In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), down-regulation of ZNF711 is linked to increased resistance to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin (CDDP). This resistance is due to decreased expression of the SLC31A1 gene, which is crucial for CDDP uptake. Lower levels of ZNF711 result in reduced CDDP influx, promoting drug resistance and affecting patient survival. Conversely, overexpression of ZNF711 enhances CDDP sensitivity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in overcoming drug resistance in EOC (Wu2021ZNF711). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF711 in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer treatment.

## Interactions
ZNF711 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with the histone demethylase PHF8. This interaction is crucial in the context of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), where ZNF711 acts as a recruiter or cofactor for PHF8, facilitating its binding to target genes marked by H3K4me3 and aiding in the demethylation of H3K9me2 (KleineKohlbrecher2010A). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the physical interaction between ZNF711 and PHF8, suggesting a functional complex that influences gene expression (KleineKohlbrecher2010A).

In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), ZNF711 interacts with another histone demethylase, JHDM2A. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional activation of the SLC31A1 gene, which is involved in cisplatin resistance. ZNF711 and JHDM2A form a complex on the SLC31A1 promoter, influencing its expression and impacting drug resistance (Wu2021ZNF711). The interaction between ZNF711 and JHDM2A has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, highlighting its role in modulating gene expression in cancer cells (Wu2021ZNF711).
