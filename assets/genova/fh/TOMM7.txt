# TOMM7

## Overview
TOMM7 is a gene that encodes the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 7, a protein integral to the mitochondrial import machinery. This protein is a component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, which is crucial for the import of preproteins into mitochondria. TOMM7 is characterized by a long kinked α-helix structure and plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the TOM complex, thereby facilitating the efficient translocation of proteins across the mitochondrial outer membrane. It acts as an inhibitory subunit within the complex, modulating the import dynamics by stabilizing interactions between receptors and the import pore. The protein's function is particularly significant in cellular processes such as endothelial cell signaling and mitochondrial health, where it influences the import and activation of key proteins like Rac1 and PINK1 (Shi2018Endothelial; Sekine2019Reciprocal; Garg2022Autosomal).

## Structure
TOMM7 is a protein composed of 55 amino acids and is highly conserved across species from yeast to mammals (Garg2022Autosomal). The primary structure of TOMM7 includes a proline at position 29, which is completely conserved among mammals and other species, indicating its importance in the protein's function (Garg2022Autosomal). The secondary structure of TOMM7 is primarily composed of a long kinked α-helix, which interacts with the TOMM40 pore protein (Garg2022Autosomal). Proline 29 is noted to break an α-helix in the kinked transmembrane segment of the protein, suggesting a critical role in its structural conformation (Garg2022Autosomal).

In terms of quaternary structure, TOMM7 is part of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, interacting with other components such as TOMM40, TOMM22, TOMM5, and TOMM6 to stabilize the complex (Bogorodskiy2021Role). The TOM complex serves as the main entry gate for mitochondrial proteins, with TOMM7 contributing to the stability and assembly of this complex (Haastrup2023The). The interaction of TOMM7 with other core-channel proteins is crucial for its function, as evidenced by studies on the TOMM7 P29L variant, which shows altered interactions and impacts mitochondrial function (Garg2022Autosomal).

## Function
TOMM7 encodes a protein that is a component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, which is essential for the import of proteins into mitochondria. In healthy human cells, TOMM7, along with other components like TOMM40, TOMM5, TOMM6, and TOMM22, forms a complex that facilitates the transport of preproteins into mitochondria (Garg2022Autosomal). TOMM7 is composed of a long kinked α-helix that interacts with the TOMM40 pore protein, and the proline at position 29 is highly conserved among mammals, indicating its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function (Garg2022Autosomal).

TOMM7 acts as an inhibitory subunit within the TOM complex, affecting the import of mitochondrial preproteins by stabilizing the interaction between receptors and the import pore (Shi2018Endothelial). This process is particularly significant in endothelial cells, where TOMM7 influences cerebrovascular network formation by promoting the mitochondrial import of Rac1 and enhancing Rac1-coupled signaling (Shi2018Endothelial). TOMM7 is also involved in the import and activation of PINK1, a kinase crucial for mitochondrial health, by facilitating its accumulation on the outer mitochondrial membrane in response to mitochondrial depolarization (Sekine2019Reciprocal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TOMM7 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome, a condition characterized by severe growth retardation and progeroid features. The specific mutation, a homozygous variant leading to a p.Pro29Leu substitution, results in decreased interaction with core TOMM complex proteins, affecting mitochondrial function. This mutation is associated with increased basal and maximal oxygen consumption rates and changes in the mitochondrial proteome, including upregulation of electron transport chain components and downregulation of proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism (Garg2022Autosomal).

Alterations in TOMM7 expression have also been observed in Rett Syndrome (RTT) patients, where the gene is upregulated. This upregulation is part of a broader pattern of altered gene expression related to mitochondrial functions, protein degradation, and chromatin folding in RTT, suggesting a compensatory response to increased reactive oxygen species production and protein oxidation (Pecorelli2013Genes).

In neurodegenerative disorders, TOMM7 is implicated in mitochondrial protein-protein interactions crucial for mitophagy. Its role in PINK1 accumulation on the outer mitochondrial membrane suggests potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like Parkinson's disease, where impaired mitophagy is a concern (Zilocchi2020Misconnecting).

## Interactions
TOMM7 is a component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, which is essential for the import of proteins into mitochondria. It interacts with other core components of the TOM complex, including TOMM40 and TOMM22. The TOMM7 P29L variant has been shown to affect its interaction with these proteins, leading to altered mitochondrial function (Garg2022Autosomal). Despite this variant, TOMM7 still localizes correctly to the mitochondria, indicating that its primary role involves interactions within the TOM complex rather than affecting its localization (Garg2022Autosomal).

TOMM7 also plays a role in modulating the dynamics of the TOM complex. It is involved in the assembly and disassembly of the complex, with evidence suggesting that TOMM7 promotes disassembly, which is crucial for the import of certain proteins (Pitt2021A). This function is opposite to that of Tom6, which promotes assembly, highlighting the antagonistic roles of these two proteins in the biogenesis of the TOM complex (Pitt2021A). These interactions are vital for maintaining the efficiency of mitochondrial protein import and overall mitochondrial function.
