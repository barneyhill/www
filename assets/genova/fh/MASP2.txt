# MASP2

## Overview
MASP2 is a gene that encodes the protein MBL-associated serine protease 2, a serine protease enzyme integral to the lectin pathway of the complement system, which is a key component of the innate immune response. The MASP2 gene is primarily expressed in the liver, and its protein product is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme that becomes active upon binding to mannose-binding lectin (MBL) when MBL recognizes specific carbohydrate patterns on pathogens. The active form of MASP-2 cleaves complement proteins C4 and C2, leading to the formation of the C3 convertase, which is essential for the progression of the complement cascade and the eventual formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that targets pathogens (Yongqing2012Mannosebinding; Héja2012Revised). MASP-2 is structurally characterized by several domains, including CUB, EGF-like, and serine protease domains, which facilitate its function and interactions within the complement system (Harmat2004The; Feinberg2003Crystal). The protein's activity and interactions are crucial for immune defense, and variations in the MASP2 gene have been linked to susceptibility to various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Boldt2013Leprosy; Goeldner2014Association).

## Structure
MASP2, or MBL-associated serine protease 2, is a protein involved in the lectin pathway of the complement system. It has a modular structure comprising several domains: two CUB domains, an EGF-like domain, two complement control protein (CCP) modules, and a serine protease (SP) domain (Harmat2004The; Feinberg2003Crystal). The CUB1-EGF-CUB2 region is crucial for homodimerization and binding to mannose-binding protein (MBP), with calcium ions playing a key role in stabilizing the structure and relative orientations of these domains (Feinberg2003Crystal).

The CUB domains are characterized by a β-sandwich structure with antiparallel β-sheets and disulfide bonds, contributing to their stability (Feinberg2003Crystal). The EGF-like domain features a characteristic fold with anti-parallel β-sheets and disulfide bridges, binding a calcium ion coordinated by seven oxygen ligands (Gaboriaud2021Structures). The SP domain has a conserved chymotrypsin fold with catalytic residues Ser633, His483, and Asp532, and is involved in substrate specificity (Harmat2004The).

MASP2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, with glycosylation observed at Asn84 in the CUB1 domain (Feinberg2003Crystal). The protein can form dimers via interactions in the N-terminal CUB1-EGF-CUB2 region, which is essential for its function in the complement system (Harmat2004The).

## Function
MASP2 (MBL-associated serine protease 2) is a critical enzyme in the lectin pathway of the complement system, an essential component of the innate immune response. It is synthesized as a proenzyme and becomes active upon binding to mannose-binding lectin (MBL) when MBL recognizes pathogenic carbohydrates. This binding leads to the autoactivation of MASP-2, which involves the cleavage of an arginine-isoleucine peptide bond at the N-terminal of its serine protease domain (Yongqing2012Mannosebinding).

Once activated, MASP-2 cleaves complement proteins C4 and C2, forming the C4b2a complex, which acts as a C3 convertase. This convertase is crucial for the continuation of the complement cascade, ultimately leading to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that targets and destroys pathogens (Héja2012Revised; Degn2012MannanBinding). MASP-2's activity is primarily located in the bloodstream and extracellular spaces, where it plays a significant role in pathogen recognition and complement activation, contributing to immune defense (Degn2012MannanBinding).

MASP-2 is homologous to the protease C1s of the classical pathway but is unique in its ability to autoactivate and activate prothrombin. Its gene is primarily expressed in the liver (Yongqing2012Mannosebinding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the MASP2 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions due to their impact on the lectin pathway of the complement system. Low levels of MASP-2, influenced by specific MASP2 haplotypes, are linked to increased susceptibility to leprosy, particularly the lepromatous form. Variants such as p.126L and p.439H are more frequent in leprosy patients, suggesting a genetic predisposition (Boldt2013Leprosy).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), MASP-2 levels are lower in patients compared to controls, with certain MASP2 haplotypes like *2A1 and *2B1-i associated with increased susceptibility to RA and articular symptoms (Goeldner2014Association). The p.120G and p.439H substitutions are linked to a higher risk of articular symptoms among relatives of RA patients (Goeldner2014Association).

MASP2 polymorphisms also play a role in rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), where certain SNPs like p.377A and p.439H are negatively associated, suggesting a protective effect against these conditions (Catarino2014Association). In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), higher MASP-2 levels and specific polymorphisms, such as rs7548659, are associated with increased disease risk (Xu2020Association).

## Interactions
MASP2 (MBL-associated serine protease 2) is a crucial component of the lectin pathway of the complement system, interacting with several proteins to facilitate immune responses. MASP2 forms complexes with mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins, which are essential for the activation of the complement cascade. Upon binding to pathogenic carbohydrates, MASP2 autoactivates and cleaves complement components C4 and C2, leading to the formation of the C3 convertase (Yongqing2012Mannosebinding; VorupJensen2000Distinct).

MASP2 also interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N protein). The N protein binds to the proenzyme form of MASP2, but not to its catalytic domain, suggesting that additional N-terminal domains of MASP2 might be involved in this interaction. MASP2 can cleave the N protein, indicating a transient interaction between the active protease and its substrate (Bally2024Revisiting).

MASP2's interactions are influenced by its structural features, such as the flexibility of its substrate-binding sites, which are crucial for recognizing its natural substrates, including C2, C4, and the C1 inhibitor (Harmat2004The). These interactions highlight MASP2's role in both complement activation and potential cross-talk with viral proteins.
