# JAG2

## Overview
JAG2 is a gene that encodes the protein jagged canonical Notch ligand 2, which is a critical component of the Notch signaling pathway. This protein functions as a transmembrane ligand, playing a pivotal role in cell communication processes that govern cell fate decisions, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The JAG2 protein is particularly significant in the regulation of nucleus pulposus cell proliferation and immune cell differentiation, as well as in the pathogenesis of certain diseases such as liver cirrhosis and medulloblastoma. Through its interactions with Notch receptors and other signaling pathways, JAG2 influences various cellular processes and has been identified as a potential therapeutic target due to its involvement in disease progression (Long2019JAG2Notch2; Fiaschetti2014NOTCH; Schwentner2018JAG2).

## Function
The JAG2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a ligand in the Notch signaling pathway, a critical mechanism for cell communication that influences cell fate decisions. In healthy human cells, JAG2 is involved in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It plays a significant role in the proliferation of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells, which are part of the intervertebral disc. Through its interaction with the Notch2 signaling pathway, JAG2 promotes NP cell proliferation by upregulating cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin D1 and CDK6, while downregulating p21 expression. This facilitates the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, enhancing cell proliferation (Long2019JAG2Notch2).

JAG2 also interacts with other signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin, which are upregulated by JAG2 treatment, indicating its role in maintaining cell proliferation and preventing cell cycle arrest (Long2019JAG2Notch2). Additionally, JAG2 is involved in the differentiation of CD14+ monocytes into Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)-like cells, suggesting its role in immune cell differentiation and potential contribution to the pathogenesis of LCH (Schwentner2018JAG2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the JAG2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly liver cirrhosis and medulloblastoma. In liver cirrhosis, JAG2 expression is significantly higher in cirrhotic liver tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is inversely correlated with miR-541 levels, which directly targets JAG2 to inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The activation of HSCs is a key process in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, suggesting that JAG2 plays a role in the progression of these conditions (Liu2024miR541).

In medulloblastoma, a type of childhood brain cancer, JAG2 is identified as a critical pro-survival factor, particularly in MYC-driven Group 3 tumors. High JAG2 expression is associated with aggressive anaplastic tumors and highly metastatic stages. The study suggests that JAG2 may regulate MYC-controlled apoptosis or proliferation through a mechanism independent of the canonical NOTCH signaling pathway. This indicates that JAG2 is a MYC target gene, and its expression is linked to poor outcomes in medulloblastoma (Fiaschetti2014NOTCH).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of JAG2 in both liver cirrhosis and medulloblastoma, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Interactions
JAG2, a key component of the Notch signaling pathway, engages in several interactions with other proteins. It is known to associate with the adherens junction (AJ) through coimmunoprecipitation with CTNNB1, a protein involved in cell adhesion, indicating a role in maintaining cell structure and signaling (Reynolds2022Assemblies). JAG2 also interacts with Notch receptors, such as Notch2, forming a complex that is crucial for signaling. This interaction involves specific residues, including Phe210, Arg212, Arg214, Asp216, and Phe218 on JAG2, which are critical for binding to Notch2 (Platonova2017Identification).

In the context of liver cirrhosis, JAG2 is a direct target of miR-541, which binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of JAG2 mRNA, leading to decreased JAG2 expression. This interaction highlights the regulatory role of miR-541 in modulating JAG2 levels and its downstream effects on hepatic stellate cell activation (Liu2024miR541). Additionally, JAG2 is involved in a mutual regulatory relationship with JAG1, where depletion of one leads to increased expression of the other, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in certain cellular contexts (Fiaschetti2014NOTCH). These interactions underscore JAG2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and regulation.
