# SULT1E1

## Overview
SULT1E1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme sulfotransferase family 1E member 1, commonly referred to as estrogen sulfotransferase. This enzyme is a member of the sulfotransferase family, which plays a pivotal role in the metabolism and regulation of estrogens and other compounds through the process of sulfation. SULT1E1 is primarily involved in the inactivation of estrogens by catalyzing their sulfation, thereby preventing their interaction with estrogen receptors and maintaining hormonal balance (Yi2021Estrogen; Zhang1998Sulfuryl). The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, endometrium, and placenta, and is crucial for modulating estrogen activity and homeostasis (Yi2021Estrogen). Beyond its role in estrogen metabolism, SULT1E1 also participates in the sulfation of thyroid hormones and flavonoids, indicating its involvement in broader metabolic processes (Yi2021Estrogen). The gene's expression and function are regulated by interactions with nuclear receptors and transcription factors, which can influence its transcriptional activity (Kodama2011Liganded). Variations in the SULT1E1 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, including hormone-dependent cancers and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Kurogi2021SULT; Choi2005Genetic).

## Structure
The human SULT1E1 protein is a member of the sulfotransferase enzyme family, which is involved in the metabolism of estrogens and other compounds. The primary structure of SULT1E1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes a central four-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices and loops, which are often disordered in the absence of ligands (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The tertiary structure of SULT1E1 features a common fold among sulfotransferases, known as the Rossmann fold, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (AllaliHassani2007Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, SULT1E1 typically functions as a homodimer, with a dimerization interface identified at the carboxyl terminus containing the KXXXTVXXXE sequence. This dimerization is thought to contribute to the structural stability of the enzyme, although it may not directly affect substrate activity or inhibition (Stjernschantz2010Comparison). The presence of ligands such as PAP or PAPS can order the loops around the active site, suggesting a role for these cofactors in priming the conformation of substrate-binding loops (AllaliHassani2007Structural).

## Function
SULT1E1, or estrogen sulfotransferase, is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in the sulfation of estrogens, such as estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), at the 3-hydroxyl site using 3-phosphoadenosine 5-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as a sulfate donor. This sulfation process inactivates estrogens, preventing them from binding to and activating estrogen receptors, thereby regulating estrogen activity and maintaining hormonal balance in the body (Yi2021Estrogen; Zhang1998Sulfuryl). SULT1E1 is highly efficient in catalyzing the sulfation of estrogens due to its low Km values, indicating a high affinity for its substrates (Yi2021Estrogen; Riches2009Quantitative).

The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, endometrium, and placenta, and is involved in modulating estrogen's action and homeostasis (Yi2021Estrogen). In healthy human cells, SULT1E1 contributes to the regulation of estrogen levels, which is important for preventing excessive estrogen activity that could lead to conditions such as breast carcinogenesis (Yi2021Estrogen). Additionally, SULT1E1 is involved in the sulfation of other compounds, including thyroid hormones and various flavonoids, highlighting its role in broader metabolic processes (Yi2021Estrogen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SULT1E1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. Genetic variations in SULT1E1 are associated with increased risks for hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast and endometrial cancer. In breast cancer, certain SULT1E1 polymorphisms, like the *959 A allele, are associated with a decreased risk, while others, such as the IVS4-1653 TC/CC genotypes, are linked to increased recurrence risk and poorer survival outcomes (Choi2005Genetic). In endometrial cancer, specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SULT1E1 are associated with altered risk and disease progression (Yi2021Estrogen).

SULT1E1 polymorphisms also affect bone mineral density and are linked to ischemic stroke risk due to their influence on serum estradiol levels (Kurogi2021SULT). In prostate cancer, variations in SULT1E1 are associated with shorter time to treatment failure in patients undergoing abiraterone therapy, suggesting a role in therapeutic response (Agarwal2016Inherited). Alterations in SULT1E1 expression are implicated in liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cystic fibrosis, where its activity affects disease progression and response to inflammatory conditions (Xie2020The).

## Interactions
SULT1E1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in its regulation and function. The pregnane X receptor (PXR) represses the SULT1E1 promoter by disrupting its chromatin structure. This repression involves PXR's interaction with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4a), which normally facilitates the formation of an active chromatin structure by bringing the enhancer close to the proximal promoter. PXR, upon activation by rifampicin, interacts with HNF4a to prevent this chromatin structure formation, thereby repressing SULT1E1 transcription (Kodama2011Liganded). 

PXR does not directly bind to the DNA within the enhancer but likely interacts through protein-protein interactions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays did not confirm direct interaction of PXR with the enhancer or promoter, suggesting a transient interaction. PXR can also induce histone deacetylation of the SULT1E1 gene, contributing to transcriptional repression (Kodama2011Liganded). 

HNF4a and HNF3b are involved in the activation of the SULT1E1 gene. Knockdown experiments showed that both transcription factors bind to the enhancer region and are involved in its activation, with HNF4a playing a more critical role (Kodama2011Liganded).
