# HDAC1

## Overview
HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme histone deacetylase 1, a member of the class I histone deacetylase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation by removing acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. HDAC1 is integral to various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and DNA repair, by modulating the expression of key transcription factors and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The protein is characterized by a conserved deacetylase domain and functions within multiprotein complexes such as Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST, which are essential for its deacetylase activity (RUIJTER2003Histone; Hassig1998A). HDAC1's activity and interactions are regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influence its enzymatic function and complex formation (Pflum2001Histone). The dysregulation of HDAC1 expression and activity is implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Fan2021Comprehensive; Halkidou2004Upregulation).

## Structure
HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) is a member of the class I HDAC family, characterized by a conserved deacetylase domain. The primary structure of HDAC1 includes 483 amino acids, with a catalytic domain located at the N-terminus, which forms the major part of the protein (RUIJTER2003Histone). The secondary structure features a single R/β domain with an eight-stranded parallel β sheet sandwiched between 13 and 17 helices (Wang2005Toward). 

The tertiary structure of HDAC1 is compact and globular, with a catalytic site that contains zinc atoms crucial for its enzymatic activity (Sixto-López2018Insights). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, as HDAC1 functions within multiprotein complexes such as Sin3, NuRD, and Co-REST, which are necessary for its deacetylase activity (RUIJTER2003Histone).

HDAC1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulates its activity and complex formation. Hyperphosphorylation increases deacetylase activity and disrupts complex formation, while hypophosphorylation decreases activity but enhances complex formation (RUIJTER2003Histone). The enzyme also features an 11 Å channel critical for its deacetylase activity, with specific residues lining this channel that influence substrate binding and catalytic function (Weerasinghe2008Residues).

## Function
Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is a crucial enzyme involved in the regulation of gene expression through its role in chromatin remodeling. HDAC1 functions by removing acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. This activity is essential for maintaining transcriptional repression necessary for various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and differentiation (Lagger2002Essential; Hassig1998A).

In healthy human cells, HDAC1 is part of several corepressor complexes, such as Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST, which modulate gene expression by deacetylating histone tails. This leads to tighter nucleosomal arrays and transcriptional repression, playing a significant role in regulating chromosomal gene transcription (Jamaladdin2014Histone; Hassig1998A). HDAC1 is also involved in the repression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as p21 and p27, facilitating cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase (Yamaguchi2010Histone; Lagger2002Essential).

HDAC1's activity is crucial for accurate cell division and the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency, as it regulates the expression of key transcription factors like Oct4 and Nanog (Jamaladdin2014Histone). The enzyme is active in the nucleus and is involved in DNA repair processes, contributing to chromatin maturation during DNA replication (Jamaladdin2014Histone).

## Clinical Significance
HDAC1 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, particularly hormone refractory prostate cancer (HR CaP), HDAC1 overexpression is linked to a shift from a differentiated luminal phenotype to a de-differentiated basal phenotype, contributing to a more aggressive cancer form and potential androgen independence (Halkidou2004Upregulation). In glioma, HDAC1 is significantly overexpressed, with higher levels associated with increased tumor grade and poorer prognosis, particularly in IDH1 wildtype gliomas (Fan2021Comprehensive). 

In pancreatic cancer, HDAC1 is involved in the repression of E-cadherin, a tumor suppressor, through recruitment by transcriptional repressors like ZEB1, which is linked to cancer progression (Aghdassi2011Recruitment). HDAC1 also plays a role in neuroblastoma, where its increased expression is associated with multidrug resistance, and its knockdown can restore drug sensitivity (Hagelkruys2011The). In hematological malignancies, HDAC1 overexpression is noted in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and peripheral T-cell lymphomas, contributing to the repression of growth-regulatory genes (Hagelkruys2011The). These findings highlight HDAC1 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions across various cancers.

## Interactions
Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is involved in numerous protein interactions that are crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. HDAC1 forms complexes with histone acetyltransferases (HATs) such as PCAF and GCN5, indicating direct interactions. FRET analysis and coimmunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that HDAC1 can bind to PCAF, while its interaction with GCN5 is modulated during cellular differentiation (Yamagoe2003Interaction). HDAC1 is also part of several multiprotein complexes, including the Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST complexes, which are involved in transcriptional repression. These complexes include proteins like RbAp48, mSin3A, Mi-2, and CoREST, which help target HDAC1 to specific DNA promoters (Kelly2013The; Pflum2001Histone).

Phosphorylation of HDAC1 at serine residues 421 and 423 is essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with associated proteins. Mutations at these sites reduce HDAC1's ability to bind with proteins such as RbAp48, MTA2, and mSin3A, highlighting the importance of phosphorylation in HDAC1's function (Pflum2001Histone). HDAC1 can also form homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with HDAC2 and HDAC3, with the N-terminal domain being crucial for these interactions (Taplick2001Homo-oligomerisation).
