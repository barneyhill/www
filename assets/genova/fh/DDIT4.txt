# DDIT4

## Overview
DDIT4, or DNA damage inducible transcript 4, is a gene that encodes a protein known as REDD1, which is a critical regulator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a stress response regulator and plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by inhibiting mTORC1 activity, thereby influencing cell growth, metabolism, and survival under stress conditions such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and DNA damage (Sofer2005Regulation; Gharibi2016DDIT4). DDIT4 is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, where it is involved in managing oxidative stress and autophagy (Lee2022Histone). The gene's expression is highly responsive to cellular stress, making it a significant factor in maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity. Its dysregulation is associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2023Identification; Kim2023The).

## Structure


## Function
DDIT4, also known as REDD1, is a crucial regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is involved in controlling cell growth and metabolism. In healthy human cells, DDIT4 acts as an inhibitor of mTORC1, leading to decreased phosphorylation of mTOR substrates such as S6K1 and 4E-BP1, which results in reduced protein synthesis and cell growth (Sofer2005Regulation). This inhibition is essential for cellular responses to energy stress, hypoxia, and nutrient deprivation, helping to maintain cellular homeostasis and function (Gharibi2016DDIT4).

DDIT4 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, particularly in the basal epidermal layer of the skin, where it plays a role in regulating oxidative stress, autophagy, and mitochondrial function (Lee2022Histone). It is involved in the cellular response to stress, including DNA damage and hypoxia, by modulating mTORC1 activity, which affects processes like autophagy and apoptosis (Ricci2019DDIT4). DDIT4's expression is stress-responsive and changes during development and DNA damage responses, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Lee2022Histone).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DDIT4 gene, also known as REDD1, have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In cancer, DDIT4 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior in several malignancies. In melanoma, it is linked to a 94% increased risk of death (Pinto2017In). In colorectal cancer, high DDIT4 expression correlates with advanced pathological features, such as higher TNM stages and decreased tumor differentiation, although it does not significantly affect survival outcomes (Fattahi2021High). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), DDIT4 overexpression is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis, including shorter relapse-free and overall survival (Chen2023Identification).

DDIT4 also plays a role in metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. In diabetes, it is involved in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes through atypical NF-κB activation, leading to proinflammatory cytokine production (Kim2023The). In neurological disorders, DDIT4 is upregulated in diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where it inhibits mTOR signaling, contributing to synaptic dysfunction and memory impairment (Kim2023The). These findings highlight DDIT4's potential as a therapeutic target in various conditions.

## Interactions
DDIT4, also known as REDD1, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in cellular stress responses. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis has shown that DDIT4 interacts directly with several proteins, including structural maintenance of chromosomes 3 (SMC3), ectodermal-neural cortex 1 (ENC1), vimentin (VIM), E2F7, intracellular Notch receptor 2 (NOTCH2-IC), keratin 17 (KRT17), and prohibitin 1 (PHB1). These interactions suggest a role for DDIT4 in diverse cellular processes, such as chromosomal maintenance and cytoskeletal organization (Naki2022APEX2Mediated).

DDIT4 also exhibits a weaker interaction with proteins like tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein theta (YWHAQ, 14-3-3θ) and NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 (NME1), indicating potential indirect or transient interactions (Naki2022APEX2Mediated). The protein is known to sequester 14-3-3 proteins, which may activate TSC1/2, a component of the mTOR pathway, thereby inhibiting mTORC1 signaling (Naki2022APEX2Mediated).

DDIT4's interactions extend to ribosomal proteins and keratins, which are involved in mTORC1 signaling and translation, particularly under stress conditions. These interactions highlight DDIT4's role in regulating cellular responses to stress and its involvement in mTORC1 signaling pathways (Naki2022APEX2Mediated).
