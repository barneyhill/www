# TMEM87A

## Overview
TMEM87A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 87A, also known as GolpHCat, which is a voltage-dependent cation channel primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus. This protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and a GOLD domain, which are integral to its function in ion conduction and protein trafficking. TMEM87A plays a critical role in maintaining Golgi pH homeostasis, essential for proper protein trafficking and glycosylation processes. It is highly expressed in neurons and astrocytes, with implications in hippocampus-dependent memory and broader cognitive functions. Additionally, TMEM87A is involved in mechanoelectrical transduction pathways, influencing cell adhesion and migration, particularly in cancer cells. Mutations and alterations in TMEM87A expression have been linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in cellular physiology and potential as a therapeutic target (Kang2023GolpHCat; Patkunarajah2020TMEM87aElkin1; Kang2024GolpHCat).

## Structure
TMEM87A, also known as GolpHCat, is a voltage-dependent cation channel primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus. The protein is a monomer, contrary to the expectation of forming a tetramer like other K+ channels, and consists of an extracellular loop domain (ELD) and seven transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Kang2024GolpHCat). The ELD contains three N-linked glycans and is stabilized by broad interactions with the TMD, which includes a central cavity for ion conduction (Kang2024GolpHCat). The TMD pocket contains a well-resolved phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which is tightly bound to TMEM87A, suggesting a role in maintaining the protein's structural and functional integrity (Kang2024GolpHCat).

TMEM87A shares structural homology with microbial channelrhodopsin (ChRmine) and has similarities with Wntless and glucagon receptors, although the sequence identity is low (Kang2024GolpHCat). The protein's structure includes a GOLD domain, which is involved in the secretory pathway and suggests a role in protein trafficking (Kang2024GolpHCat). TMEM87A is highly expressed in neurons and astrocytes, with three isoforms: isoform 1 is full-length, isoform 2 lacks transmembrane domains, and isoform 3 lacks the predicted Golgi signal sequence (Kang2023GolpHCat).

## Function
TMEM87A, also known as GolpHCat, is a transmembrane protein primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus of human astrocytes, where it functions as a voltage- and pH-dependent, nonselective cation channel (Kang2023GolpHCat; Kang2024GolpHCat). This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining Golgi pH homeostasis, which is essential for proper protein trafficking and glycosylation processes (Han2023Structural; Kang2023GolpHCat). TMEM87A is involved in regulating ionic and osmotic homeostasis within the Golgi, impacting the distribution and activity of glycosylation enzymes, such as fucosyl-transferase enzymes, which affect the pattern of fucosylated glycans (Kang2023GolpHCat).

The protein's activity is characterized by inwardly rectifying cationic currents, which are sensitive to pH changes and are blocked by gadolinium and gluconate (Kang2024GolpHCat). TMEM87A's structural features include a seven-transmembrane domain and a GOLD domain, which are involved in its ion conduction mechanisms (Han2023Structural). In addition to its role in the Golgi, TMEM87A is implicated in hippocampus-dependent memory, suggesting its broader significance in brain function and cognitive processes (Kang2024GolpHCat).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TMEM87A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly affecting the Golgi apparatus and cellular processes. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TMEM87A, also known as GolpHCat, is crucial for maintaining Golgi pH and morphology. Disruption of TMEM87A leads to altered protein glycosylation and Golgi fragmentation, which are associated with cognitive impairments and may contribute to conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Kang2024GolpHCat).

In cancer, TMEM87A has been identified as part of a novel gene fusion, TMEM87A-RASGRF1, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This fusion activates the MAPK pathway, contributing to oncogenic processes and influencing drug sensitivity, particularly in patients showing exceptional responses to therapies like sunitinib (Cooper2020Identification). Additionally, TMEM87A, referred to as Elkin1, plays a role in mechanoelectrical transduction pathways in melanoma cells, affecting cell adhesion and migration. Alterations in TMEM87A expression can lead to changes in cell motility and tumor metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Patkunarajah2020TMEM87aElkin1).

## Interactions
TMEM87A, also known as Elkin1, is implicated in various cellular interactions, particularly in the context of mechanosensitive pathways and protein trafficking. Although TMEM87A shares structural similarities with proteins involved in the secretory pathway, such as Wntless (WLS), specific direct interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies (Hoel2022Structure). 

In melanoma cells, TMEM87A is part of a novel mechanoelectrical transduction pathway, modulating cell adhesion and migration. It is required for mechano-activated currents distinct from those mediated by PIEZO channels, suggesting a role in transducing mechanical inputs at the cell-substrate interface (Patkunarajah2020TMEM87aElkin1).

TMEM87A is also identified as a Golgi-resident cation channel, GolpHCat, involved in maintaining Golgi pH homeostasis, which is crucial for protein trafficking and glycosylation. Its role in influencing the distribution and activity of glycosylation enzymes, such as fucosyl-transferase, suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in glycosylation processes (Kang2023GolpHCat). However, specific protein or nucleic acid interactions remain to be elucidated.
