# SLC25A45

## Overview
SLC25A45 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 45, which is part of the mitochondrial carrier family. This protein is involved in the transport of various molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane, playing a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. As a transmembrane protein, it facilitates the exchange of metabolites between the mitochondria and the cytosol, which is essential for cellular homeostasis. Mutations or dysregulation of SLC25A45 have been implicated in various metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
