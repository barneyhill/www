# MKS1

## Overview
The MKS1 gene encodes the MKS transition zone complex subunit 1 protein, which is integral to the formation and function of primary cilia in mammalian cells. This protein is a component of the transition zone complex at the base of the cilium, where it acts as a diffusion barrier, regulating the entry and exit of proteins essential for ciliary signaling and structural integrity (Szymanska2020Regulation; Okazaki2020Formation). The MKS1 protein is characterized by the presence of a B9 domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as B9D2, to form a complex crucial for maintaining ciliary membrane integrity (Okazaki2020Formation). Mutations in the MKS1 gene are associated with ciliopathies, including Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Joubert syndrome, highlighting its critical role in ciliary biology and organ development (Tammachote2009Ciliary; Luo2020Novel).

## Structure
The MKS1 protein is composed of 559 amino acids and contains a B9 domain, which is a key structural feature, although its specific function remains unclear (Tammachote2009Ciliary; Dawe2006The). The B9 domain is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as B9D2, forming a complex essential for the function of the transition zone (TZ) in cilia (Okazaki2020Formation). This complex acts as a diffusion barrier for ciliary membrane proteins, highlighting the importance of the B9 domain in maintaining ciliary integrity (Okazaki2020Formation).

The MKS1 protein is localized to the centrosome and basal bodies, suggesting a role in ciliogenesis and cell cycle processes (Tammachote2009Ciliary; Dawe2006The). It interacts with other proteins, such as meckelin, to facilitate primary cilium formation (Dawe2006The). The protein's structure is related to C2 domains, which are known for calcium/lipid binding and membrane trafficking, indicating a potential role in these processes (Williams2011MKS).

Mutations in MKS1 can lead to structural changes, such as the introduction of extra alpha helices, which may affect its function and contribute to ciliopathies (Khan2016Hypomorphic).

## Function
The MKS1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the formation and function of primary cilia, which are microtubule-based organelles involved in sensing and transducing extracellular signals in mammalian cells. MKS1 is a component of the transition zone complex at the base of the cilium, where it acts as a diffusion barrier regulating the entry and exit of proteins, crucial for the translocation of signaling intermediates during processes such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling (Szymanska2020Regulation). The MKS1 protein interacts with other proteins, including B9D1 and B9D2, forming a complex essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the ciliary membrane and ensuring proper ciliary function (Okazaki2020Formation).

In healthy human cells, MKS1 is involved in regulating ciliary INPP5E levels, which is critical for proper ciliary function and maintaining normal cilium length and number (Slaats2015MKS1). It also plays a role in the regulation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and proteasome activity, interacting with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2E1 to regulate β-catenin levels at the ciliary base (Szymanska2020Regulation). Dysfunction in MKS1 can lead to ciliopathies, affecting organ development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MKS1 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, most notably Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) and Joubert syndrome (JS). MKS is a lethal autosomal recessive disorder characterized by renal cystic dysplasia, encephalocele, polydactyly, and biliary dysgenesis. These clinical manifestations are linked to defects in ciliary structure and function due to MKS1 mutations, which disrupt the formation and maintenance of primary cilia (Tammachote2009Ciliary; Dawe2006The). MKS1 mutations can also lead to Bardet-Biedl syndrome, another ciliopathy with overlapping features (Tammachote2009Ciliary).

In Joubert syndrome, MKS1 mutations result in developmental delays and neurological abnormalities. These mutations can lead to truncated forms of the MKS1 protein, impairing its interaction with other proteins and its localization at the ciliary transition zone, which is crucial for ciliary function (Luo2020Novel; Slaats2015MKS1). The disruption of MKS1 interactions and expression levels can contribute to the pathogenesis of these syndromes by affecting ciliary INPP5E levels and other ciliary functions (Slaats2015MKS1). The clinical heterogeneity of MKS1-related ciliopathies underscores the gene's critical role in ciliary biology.

## Interactions
MKS1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of the ciliary transition zone. It interacts with several other proteins to form multiprotein complexes essential for ciliary structure and signaling. MKS1 is part of the MKS complex and interacts with proteins such as B9D1 and B9D2. These interactions are necessary for the formation of a tripartite complex that acts as a diffusion barrier for ciliary membrane proteins, with MKS1 interacting directly with B9D2, while B9D1 and MKS1 do not directly interact (Okazaki2020Formation).

MKS1 also interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2E1, which is involved in the regulation of protein ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for the polyubiquitination of β-catenin, a key component in Wnt signaling, and affects the regulation of β-catenin levels at the primary cilium (Szymanska2020Regulation).

Additionally, MKS1 interacts with components of the BBSome and IFT complexes, such as BBS4, to mediate ciliary trafficking and Hedgehog signaling. These interactions are important for the proper trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins and the assembly of the axoneme, impacting ciliary function and signaling pathways (Goetz2017The).
