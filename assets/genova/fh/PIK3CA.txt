# PIK3CA

## Overview
The PIK3CA gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (p110α), a critical component of the class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). This kinase plays a pivotal role in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism (Fruman2017The). The p110α subunit, characterized by its kinase activity, interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit to form an active enzyme complex, facilitating the conversion of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Jenkins2023Oncogenic). PIK3CA is frequently mutated in various cancers, including breast and colorectal cancers, where it contributes to oncogenic signaling and therapy resistance (Zardavas2014PIK3CA; Liao2012Prognostic). These mutations often lead to aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway, making PIK3CA a significant target for therapeutic intervention (Janku2013PIK3CA).

## Structure
The PIK3CA gene encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is involved in various cellular processes. The p110α subunit is composed of several domains: the Adaptor Binding Domain (ABD), Ras Binding Domain (RBD), C2 domain, helical domain, and a bi-lobal kinase domain (Huang2007The; Jenkins2023Oncogenic). The ABD has a ubiquitin-like fold and interacts with the inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain of the p85α regulatory subunit, forming a heterodimer crucial for PI3K activity (Huang2007The; Miled2007Mechanism).

The secondary structure of p110α includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the C2 domain forming a β-sandwich structure (Huang2007The). The helical domain connects the C2 and kinase domains, which are essential for the enzyme's catalytic function (Huang2007The). The kinase domain is a two-lobed structure typical of kinases, with a conserved architecture among class I PI3Ks (Huang2007The).

In its quaternary structure, p110α interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit, which includes domains such as nSH2, iSH2, and cSH2, facilitating the activation of the catalytic subunit (Huang2007The). Oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA often occur at the interfaces between p110α and p85α or within the kinase domain, affecting the regulation of kinase activity (Huang2007The).

## Function
The PIK3CA gene encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which are integral to the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. In healthy human cells, PI3K is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), leading to the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as a second messenger, recruiting proteins such as AKT and PDK1 to the membrane, where PDK1 phosphorylates and activates AKT. Activated AKT then targets multiple effectors, including GSK3, FoxO proteins, and mTORC1, to control pro-survival cellular processes (Fruman2017The; Papa2019The).

PIK3CA is also involved in regulating glucose homeostasis and insulin responses in tissues like muscle, liver, and fat. It plays a significant role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and driving tissue growth throughout development (Fruman2017The). The PI3K pathway, including PIK3CA, is essential for coordinating glycolysis and cytoskeletal remodeling, which is vital for cellular metabolism and function (Hu2016Phosphoinositide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIK3CA gene are among the most common genetic alterations in breast cancer, occurring in over one-third of cases. These mutations are particularly prevalent in luminal and HER2-positive subtypes and are associated with activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, contributing to resistance against common breast cancer therapies (Zardavas2014PIK3CA). In breast cancer, PIK3CA mutations are linked to AKT activation, growth factor-independent cell proliferation, and increased invasion and cell migration. They also contribute to resistance to therapies such as HER2 and endocrine therapies in preclinical models (Zardavas2014PIK3CA).

The clinical significance of PIK3CA mutations extends to their prognostic implications. Exon 9 mutations are associated with poorer prognosis, while exon 20 mutations are linked to better outcomes (Barbareschi2007Different). In colorectal cancer, PIK3CA mutations, particularly when present alongside BRAF mutations, are associated with shorter cancer-specific and overall survival (Liao2012Prognostic).

PIK3CA mutations are also significant in other cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma, where they often coexist with other oncogene mutations, suggesting a need for comprehensive genotyping in clinical trials (Chaft2012Coexistence). These mutations are considered potential targets for therapeutic interventions, particularly with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors (Janku2013PIK3CA).

## Interactions
PIK3CA, encoding the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit to form the active PI3K enzyme, a critical component in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth and survival (Jenkins2023Oncogenic). 

In breast cancer, PIK3CA has been shown to interact with proteins that modulate the PI3K/AKT pathway. For instance, BPIFA1 and SCGB2A1 are identified as negative regulators of this pathway, inhibiting PIK3CA kinase activity, particularly in its wild-type form (Kim2021A). These interactions are significant as they can alter the pathway's activity, impacting cancer cell proliferation.

PIK3CA also forms part of a novel complex with the actomyosin cytoskeletal component, which has been linked to its signaling functions. This interaction is under mutational pressure in several cancer types and is thought to inhibit PIK3CA signaling, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of AKT and ribosomal protein S6 upon inhibition of the actomyosin complex (Zheng2021Interpretation).

Oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA, such as H1047R, disrupt its interactions, particularly at the PIK3R1-PIK3CA interface, which can contribute to tumorigenesis by altering normal protein interactions (Cheng2021Comprehensive). These mutations often lead to increased membrane recruitment and activation of PI3K, further influencing its interaction dynamics (Jenkins2023Oncogenic).
