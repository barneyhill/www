# MRPS18C

## Overview
The MRPS18C gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18C, which is a vital component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins necessary for cellular energy production and overall mitochondrial function (Cheong2020Expression; RodríguezGarcía2017An). As a member of the ribosomal protein S18P family, MRPS18C shares significant sequence similarity with bacterial S18 proteins and is involved in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, particularly in the aminoacyl-tRNA binding domain (Cheong2020Expression). The protein's role extends to potential compensatory mechanisms in mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by its ability to restore complex I-specific activity in certain pathological conditions (RodríguezGarcía2017An). Additionally, MRPS18C has been implicated in various diseases, including mitochondrial disorders and cancer, where its expression levels may influence disease progression and patient outcomes (RodríguezGarcía2017An; Kovalevska2023Expression).

## Function
The MRPS18C gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18C, which is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by participating in the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, essential for cellular energy production and mitochondrial function (Cheong2020Expression; RodríguezGarcía2017An). MRPS18C is involved in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, which is vital for mitochondrial protein synthesis. It contains an aminoacyl-tRNA binding domain, indicating its importance in the A-site of the mitoribosome, which is essential for protein translation (Cheong2020Expression).

In healthy human cells, MRPS18C is active within the mitochondria, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial function and energy production. It has been suggested that MRPS18C may play a compensatory role in mitochondrial function, as overexpression of MRPS18C in fibroblasts has been shown to recover complex I-specific activity to control levels in patient fibroblasts, despite not significantly altering the levels of mature mitochondrial complexes I, III, and V (RodríguezGarcía2017An). This indicates a potential role in modulating mitochondrial activity and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MRPS18C gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer. MRPS18C has been identified as a suppressor gene for the m.3946G>A mutation in the MT-ND1 gene, which is associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency. This mutation can lead to conditions such as epileptic encephalopathy, including West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Overexpression of MRPS18C has been shown to restore complex I activity and reduce reactive oxygen species levels in affected fibroblasts, suggesting its potential therapeutic role in mitochondrial diseases (RodríguezGarcía2017An).

In cancer, MRPS18C expression levels are altered in various malignancies. It is overexpressed in certain cancers, such as endometrial, prostate, liver, and breast cancers, where it is associated with cell immortalization and transformation (Kovalevska2023Expression). Conversely, MRPS18C mRNA levels are decreased in colorectal cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its potential role as a prognostic factor in this type of cancer (He2021The). These findings suggest that MRPS18C may have diverse roles in cancer biology, potentially influencing tumor progression and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
The MRPS18C protein, also known as mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18C, is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome small subunit (28S) and plays a role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is part of the ribosomal protein S18P family, which includes proteins with significant sequence similarity to bacterial S18 proteins. MRPS18C localizes to distinct sites in the mitochondrial ribosome and forms part of the mRNA exit channel (RodríguezGarcía2017An).

MRPS18C has been studied for its potential interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular processes. In the context of mitochondrial diseases, overexpression of MRPS18C has been shown to restore complex I-specific activity to control levels, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in response to mitochondrial dysfunction (RodríguezGarcía2017An). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving MRPS18C are not detailed in the available context.

In related studies, the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18-2, which shares similarities with MRPS18C, interacts with various proteins such as prohibitin 2 (PHB2) and RNF2, a component of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). These interactions are crucial for maintaining cell stemness and involve the ubiquitination of histone H2A, a modification associated with stem-cell-specific gene expression patterns (Mushtaq2020Cell). However, these interactions are specific to S18-2 and not directly attributed to MRPS18C. 

Overall, while MRPS18C is implicated in mitochondrial function and disease modification, specific details on its protein interactions remain limited in the provided context.
