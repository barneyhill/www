# GPR158

## Overview
GPR158 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 158, a class C orphan receptor involved in various physiological processes. The GPR158 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including a large extracellular domain and a canonical seven-transmembrane domain, which facilitates its role in cellular signaling. Predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, GPR158 is implicated in synapse formation and cognitive functions, as well as in the regulation of intraocular pressure and energy metabolism (Fu2022Research; Itakura2019GPR158). The receptor interacts with several proteins, including the RGS7-Gβ5 complex, influencing GTPase-activating proteins and modulating Gi/o signaling pathways (Lin2022The). Clinically, GPR158 is associated with various conditions, such as prostate cancer, stress-induced depression, and ocular diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Fu2022Research; Watkins2020Orphan).

## Structure
The GPR158 protein is a class C orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a complex molecular structure. It features a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) that includes a Cache domain, which is characteristic of calcium channels and chemotaxis receptors, and a leucine zipper domain that mediates dimerization (Lin2022The; Fu2022Research). The ECD also contains an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like calcium-binding domain, crucial for protein-protein interactions, and several N-glycosylation sites at amino acids 98, 143, 215, and 274 (Lin2022The; Fu2022Research).

The protein's secondary structure includes a canonical seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain with three extracellular and three intracellular loops, forming an elongated shape that dimerizes through both extracellular and transmembrane domains (Hajj2019Nonclassical; Jeong2021Structure). The transmembrane domain features a unique inverted V-shaped arrangement, stabilized by ionic networks and disulfide bonds (Jeong2021Structure).

GPR158 forms a quaternary structure by interacting with the RGS7-Gβ5 complex, which is facilitated by the cytoplasmic coiled-coil region of the C-terminal domain (Orlandi2015Orphan; Jeong2021Structure). This interaction is crucial for its role in noncanonical signaling pathways (Jeong2021Structure). The C-terminal domain also contains conserved regions that are essential for binding to RGS7, enhancing its function in regulating GTPase-activating proteins (Lin2022The).

## Function
GPR158 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, including the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, where it is involved in synapse formation and function, crucial for memory and cognitive processes (Fu2022Research). GPR158 interacts with the RGS7/Gβ5 complex, modulating Gi/o signaling pathways, which are essential for synaptic organization and neurotransmitter signaling (Fu2022Research; Orlandi2015Orphan).

In the visual system, GPR158 is expressed in the trabecular meshwork and retina, where it regulates intraocular pressure and protects against oxidative stress, potentially through the TP53 pathway (Itakura2019GPR158). The receptor is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, with its expression being influenced by glucocorticoid stress hormones (Fu2022Research; Itakura2019GPR158).

GPR158's role extends to the regulation of energy metabolism, where it influences food consumption and energy expenditure, and interacts with proteins like osteocalcin, affecting glucose metabolism (Fu2022Research). These functions highlight GPR158's integral role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on various physiological outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
GPR158 is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, changes in expression levels, or alterations in its interactions. In cancer, GPR158 is associated with prostate cancer, where it promotes cell proliferation and tumor progression, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer by acting as a coactivator of the androgen receptor (Lin2022The; Fu2022Research). It is also linked to gliomas, with varying expression levels correlating with the malignancy of different subtypes (Fu2022Research).

In neurological disorders, GPR158 is associated with stress-induced depression. Its expression is upregulated in the medial prefrontal cortex during chronic stress, contributing to major depressive disorders. Knockdown of GPR158 has shown antidepressant effects, suggesting its role in mood regulation (Watkins2020Orphan; Sutton2018Orphan). GPR158 is also linked to age-related memory loss and Alzheimer's disease, with its expression affecting synaptic function and learning memory (Fu2022Research; Chang2023Expression).

In ocular conditions, GPR158 overexpression is associated with ocular hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma, where it affects intraocular pressure regulation and cell survival under oxidative stress (Lin2022The; Suarez2023Regulatory). These findings highlight GPR158 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions across various conditions.

## Interactions
GPR158, a G protein-coupled receptor, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence its function and signaling pathways. It forms a complex with the regulator of G protein signaling protein 7 (RGS7) and Gβ5, known as the GPR158-RGS7-Gβ5 complex. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of GTPase-activating proteins and is involved in modulating Gi/o signaling (Lin2022The; Fu2022Research). The C-terminal domain of GPR158 directly binds to RGS7, which subsequently binds to Gβ5, facilitating the complex's formation and function (Lin2022The).

GPR158 also interacts with glypican-4 (GPC4), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which is essential for presynaptic differentiation in axons. This interaction is heparan sulfate-dependent and involves the recruitment of co-receptors like LAR and PTPs, organizing the presynaptic architecture and function of hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapses (Condomitti2018An).

Additionally, GPR158 forms homodimers at the cell surface, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. It specifically interacts with RGS7, but not with other similar proteins like RGS4, indicating a selective binding preference that may play a role in G-protein-mediated signaling (Hajj2019Nonclassical).
