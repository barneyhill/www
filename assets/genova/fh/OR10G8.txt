# OR10G8

## Overview
OR10G8 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily G member 8, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it binds specific odorant molecules, initiating a signaling cascade that ultimately results in the perception of smell. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR10G8 may also have additional functions in non-olfactory tissues, although these roles are not yet fully elucidated (Santos2019The).

## Function
OR10G8 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which transduce extracellular signals through interaction with G-proteins. OR10G8 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, contributing to the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response. 

In healthy human cells, OR10G8 is primarily involved in the molecular process of odorant recognition. This process begins when odorant molecules bind to the OR10G8 receptor, which is located on the surface of olfactory sensory neurons in the nasal epithelium. Upon binding, OR10G8 activates a G-protein, which in turn triggers a signaling cascade involving the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP). This cascade ultimately leads to the opening of ion channels, resulting in a change in the membrane potential of the neuron and the generation of an action potential. This action potential is then transmitted to the brain, where it is interpreted as a specific smell (Santos2019The).

OR10G8, like other olfactory receptors, may also have roles beyond olfaction, potentially participating in various cellular functions in non-olfactory tissues, although these roles are not yet fully understood (Santos2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the OR10G8 gene have been associated with several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. In chronic schizophrenia, OR10G8 expression is significantly down-regulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This down-regulation is statistically significant and remains so after correction for a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 0.1. The expression levels of OR10G8 correlate with daily antipsychotic dose and age of onset of the illness, suggesting that its down-regulation may be influenced by antipsychotic treatment and the age at which schizophrenia begins (Ansoleaga2015Decrease).

In the context of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), OR10G8 is significantly upregulated, indicating a potential role in the disorder's pathophysiology. This upregulation is part of a broader pattern of increased expression of odorant receptor-related genes in PTSD, highlighting the importance of olfactory receptor expression in the disorder (Chen2016Expression).

In Alzheimer's disease, OR10G8 is downregulated in the entorhinal cortex at late stages, suggesting a role in disease pathology or progression. The dysregulation of OR10G8 and other olfactory receptors in neurodegenerative diseases may indicate their vulnerability to neurodegenerative processes (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation).
