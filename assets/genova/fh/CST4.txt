# CST4

## Overview
CST4 is a gene that encodes the protein cystatin S, which belongs to the type 2 cystatin family of cysteine protease inhibitors. Cystatin S plays a crucial role in inhibiting papain-like cysteine peptidases, thereby contributing to the maintenance of tissue integrity and homeostasis, particularly in secretory tissues such as the oral cavity (Dickinson2002Expression). The protein is characterized by a specific molecular structure that includes a conserved peptide sequence essential for its function as a protease inhibitor (Zhang2023Type). Although cystatin S is a relatively weak inhibitor of cathepsins due to a specific amino acid substitution, it retains significant antibacterial properties and is involved in oral health by inhibiting proteolytic events and bacterial growth (Zhang2023Type). The expression of CST4 is regulated postnatally, suggesting a protective role during early development (Dickinson2002Expression). Additionally, CST4 has been implicated in various cancers, where alterations in its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Tang2022Recurrent; Zhou2024Clinical).

## Structure
Cystatin S, encoded by the CST4 gene, is a type 2 cystatin characterized by a specific molecular structure. The primary structure of cystatin S includes a conserved peptide sequence, G-QXVXG-VPW, which is crucial for its function as a protease inhibitor (Zhang2023Type). The secondary structure of cystatin S consists of an alpha helix followed by four beta sheets arranged in an antiparallel fashion. These beta sheets cover the alpha helix, forming a wedge-shaped structure that is essential for binding to the active site of cathepsins, thereby inhibiting their proteolytic activity (Zhang2023Type).

Cystatin S is a weak inhibitor of cathepsins due to a substitution of phenylalanine (F) for valine (V) in the QXVXG fragment, which affects its inhibitory potency (Zhang2023Type). Despite this, it retains antibacterial properties and plays a role in oral health by inhibiting proteolytic events and bacterial growth (Zhang2023Type). The tertiary structure of cystatin S is stabilized by its overall 3D folding, although specific details on disulfide bonds or quaternary structure are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CST4 encodes cystatin S, a type 2 cystatin that functions as a cysteine protease inhibitor. This protein is primarily involved in inhibiting papain-like cysteine peptidases, which are enzymes that can contribute to tissue breakdown during processes such as inflammation and cancer (Dickinson2002Expression). By inhibiting these enzymes, cystatin S helps maintain tissue integrity and homeostasis, particularly in the oral cavity and other secretory tissues (Dickinson2002Expression).

Cystatin S is expressed in various tissues, including the submandibular and parotid glands, lacrimal gland, kidney, and seminal vesicle, indicating its role in diverse physiological processes (Dickinson2002Expression). In the oral cavity, it may contribute to mineral homeostasis by binding to hydroxyapatite and inhibiting calcium phosphate crystal growth, thus playing a role in dental health (Dickinson2002Expression).

The expression of CST4 is regulated postnatally, which aligns with the decline in maternal antibodies and the increase in the infant's own antibody production, suggesting a protective role during early development (Dickinson2002Expression). This regulation may provide protection against dietary cysteine peptidases as new foods are introduced.

## Clinical Significance
CST4 (cystatin S) is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In digestive system malignancies, CST4 has been studied for its diagnostic potential. It shows higher sensitivity compared to some traditional tumor markers, although its specificity is lower. Elevated CST4 levels are associated with advanced-stage disease and distant metastasis, particularly in pancreatic cancer, suggesting its role in tumor progression and metastasis (Zhou2024Clinical). 

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CST4 is involved in tumorigenicity and resistance mechanisms. Knockout studies in TNBC cells have shown that the absence of CST4 reduces tumorigenic potential and suppresses key signaling pathways like K-Ras and interferon, which are crucial for cancer progression. Conversely, overexpression of CST4 enhances tumorigenic properties, indicating its role in cancer cell growth and migration (Tang2022Recurrent). 

CST4's expression is also linked to poor prognosis and metastasis in various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer, where high CST4 levels correlate with poor survival outcomes (Zhou2024Clinical). These findings suggest that CST4 may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
