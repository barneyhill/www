# APOL3

## Overview
APOL3 is a gene that encodes the protein apolipoprotein L3, which is part of the apolipoprotein L family. This protein is primarily involved in intracellular lipid transport and membrane dynamics, particularly within the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria. Apolipoprotein L3 functions as an intracellular protein that interacts with other proteins such as neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS1) and calneuron-1 (CALN1) to regulate phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase-IIIB (PI4KB), a kinase crucial for membrane fission processes (Pays2024The). Additionally, APOL3 plays a role in angiogenesis and endothelial cell function, influencing vascular network formation and cell migration (Khalil2018Apoliporotein). It also exhibits bactericidal activity by selectively targeting bacterial membranes, contributing to the immune response (Gaudet2021A). Mutations in the APOL3 gene have been linked to non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Skorecki2017A).

## Function
APOL3 is an intracellular protein that plays a significant role in regulating membrane dynamics and intracellular lipid transport. It is involved in controlling membrane dynamics in the Golgi and mitochondria by interacting with proteins such as neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS1) and calneuron-1 (CALN1) to regulate phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase-IIIB (PI4KB), which is crucial for membrane fission processes (Pays2024The). APOL3's interaction with PI4KB and NCS1 is essential for their association with the Golgi membrane, where it helps maintain proper Golgi and mitochondrial function (Pays2024The).

In endothelial cells, APOL3 is involved in angiogenesis and endothelial permeability. It influences the formation of vascular-like networks and cell migration, and its knock-out leads to increased endothelial permeability and impaired tubulogenesis (Khalil2018Apoliporotein). APOL3 also plays a role in the immune response by exhibiting bactericidal activity against intracellular pathogens. It disrupts bacterial membranes by targeting anionic lipids, a process that is selective for bacterial membranes due to its aversion to cholesterol, which is more common in mammalian membranes (Gaudet2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the APOL3 gene have been associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). A specific null variant, rs11089781, has been linked to an increased risk of ESKD, particularly in African American and Hispanic American populations. This variant shows a statistically significant additive effect on ESKD risk, with higher frequencies observed in affected individuals compared to controls (Skorecki2017A).

APOL3 interacts with APOL1, and this interaction is implicated in kidney disease pathogenesis. Alterations in APOL3 expression or its interaction with APOL1 can affect cellular processes such as actomyosin organization and phosphoinositide synthesis, which are crucial for maintaining kidney function. Specifically, APOL1 C-terminal variants can disrupt APOL3's regulatory role, potentially leading to kidney disease through interference with actomyosin control (Uzureau2020APOL1).

In diseased kidneys, such as those affected by lupus nephritis and diabetic nephropathy, there is a stronger correlation between the expression levels of APOL1, APOL2, and APOL3, suggesting that changes in APOL3 expression may be relevant in these conditions (Skorecki2017A).

## Interactions
APOL3 interacts with several proteins, notably NCS-1 and APOL1. APOL3 binds with high affinity to NCS-1, a calcium-dependent interaction that promotes NCS-1's association with PI4KB, a kinase involved in phosphoinositide metabolism. This interaction is crucial for the activation of PI4KB and is sensitive to non-ionic detergents like NP-40, but not to ionic detergents such as CHAPS (Uzureau2020APOL1). The interaction between APOL3 and NCS-1 does not require NCS-1's N-myristoylation, which is necessary for its interaction with PI4KB, but APOL3 enhances this interaction even when NCS-1 is not myristoylated (Uzureau2020APOL1).

APOL3 also interacts with APOL1, although this interaction occurs at a lower frequency and affinity compared to APOL1's interactions with its own domains. The binding between APOL1 and APOL3 is influenced by alterations in APOL1, such as deletions or distortions in specific regions, which can enhance the interaction (Uzureau2020APOL1). APOL1 variants, such as G1 and G2, can disrupt the interaction between APOL3 and NCS-1, potentially contributing to kidney disease by affecting PI4KB activity (Uzureau2020APOL1). There is no evidence of APOL3 interacting with nucleic acids in the provided context (Uzureau2020APOL1).
