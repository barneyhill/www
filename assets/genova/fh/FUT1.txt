# FUT1

## Overview
The FUT1 gene encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 1, which is integral to the biosynthesis of the H antigen, a precursor for the ABO blood group antigens. This enzyme, categorized as a glycosyltransferase, facilitates the transfer of fucose to precursor oligosaccharides, forming the H antigen through an α(1,2)-linkage. Fucosyltransferase 1 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in glycosylation processes essential for cell-cell recognition, adhesion, and signaling (Isozaki2014Fucosyltransferase). The gene is expressed ubiquitously, with higher expression in erythroid tissues and vascular endothelial cells, and its activity is vital for maintaining proper blood group antigen expression and immune function (KAWAI2012Suppression). Additionally, FUT1 is involved in various protein-protein interactions and is transcriptionally regulated by factors such as c-Jun, highlighting its multifaceted role in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer (Gao2014cJun; Chou2014Protein–Protein).

## Function
Fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of the H antigen, a precursor for the ABO blood group antigens. It catalyzes the transfer of fucose, a hexose sugar, to precursor oligosaccharides, forming the H antigen through an α(1,2)-linkage to galactose on Type 1 or Type 2 precursor substances (KAWAI2012Suppression). This enzymatic activity occurs primarily in the Golgi apparatus of cells, where FUT1 is involved in glycosylation processes that are essential for cell-cell recognition, adhesion, and signaling (Isozaki2014Fucosyltransferase).

FUT1 is ubiquitously expressed in the human body, with preferential expression in erythroid tissues and vascular endothelial cells (KAWAI2012Suppression). In healthy cells, the carbohydrate structures synthesized by FUT1 undergo conformational changes during cellular differentiation and transformation, affecting protein folding, stability, solubility, and function (KAWAI2012Suppression). These processes are crucial for maintaining proper blood group antigen expression and immune system function. The enzyme's activity is vital for the synthesis of the H blood group antigen, which is a key component in the expression of ABO blood group antigens (Isozaki2014Fucosyltransferase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FUT1 gene have significant clinical implications. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FUT1 expression is notably decreased compared to normal lung tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor metastasis, particularly affecting recurrence-free survival in NSCLC patients. The study suggests that FUT1 plays a role in TGFβ signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes, which are critical for cancer metastasis (Park2019Altered). Inhibition of FUT1, along with other fucosylation pathway genes, has been shown to suppress TGFβ-induced cell migration and tumor metastasis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Park2019Altered).

FUT1 expression levels also vary across different cancer types. While it is downregulated in NSCLC, FUT1 expression is elevated in prostate cancer samples, suggesting cancer type-specific roles for FUT1 (Park2019Altered). These findings highlight the complex role of FUT1 in cancer biology, where its expression and function can significantly impact tumor progression and patient outcomes. The study acknowledges limitations such as small sample sizes and heterogeneity in patient datasets, which may affect the generalizability of these results (Park2019Altered).

## Interactions
Fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of xyloglucan biosynthesis. FUT1 forms heterocomplexes with several xyloglucan-synthesizing enzymes, including XXT2, XXT5, MUR3, and XLT2, as demonstrated by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) assays and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments (Chou2014Protein–Protein). These interactions are specific, as FUT1 does not form heterocomplexes with XXT1 or MNS1 (Chou2014Protein–Protein).

FUT1 can also form homocomplexes, as indicated by significant BiFC signals for FUT1-FUT1 pairs (Chou2014Protein–Protein). The protein interacts with CSLC4, another enzyme involved in xyloglucan synthesis, as shown by BiFC assays and competition assays (Chou2014Protein–Protein). These interactions are not covalent, as FUT1 forms homocomplexes through disulfide bonds, but its heterocomplexes with other glycosyltransferases do not involve such bonds (Chou2014Protein–Protein).

In addition to its role in plant cell wall biosynthesis, FUT1 is transcriptionally regulated by c-Jun in ovarian cancer cells. c-Jun binds to the AP-1 site on the FUT1 promoter, enhancing its transcription and subsequently increasing the synthesis of the Lewis y antigen (Gao2014cJun).
