# MBOAT1

## Overview
The MBOAT1 gene encodes the enzyme membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 1, also known as Lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase 1 (LPEAT1). This enzyme is a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (MBOAT) superfamily and is characterized by its multiple transmembrane-spanning domains, which localize it to the plasma membrane (Dauwerse2007A). MBOAT1 is primarily involved in the acylation of lysophospholipids, playing a crucial role in the remodeling of cell membrane phospholipids through the Lands Cycle and the Kennedy pathway (Pierce2023A). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining membrane fluidity and function, which are vital for cellular processes such as signaling and membrane dynamics (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). Disruptions in MBOAT1 have been linked to developmental disorders and infertility, underscoring its importance in human health (Pierce2023A; Dauwerse2007A).

## Function
The MBOAT1 gene encodes the enzyme Lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase 1 (LPEAT1), which is involved in the acylation of lysophospholipids, specifically lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PE) and lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS), using oleoyl-CoA as a substrate. This enzymatic activity is a critical component of the Lands Cycle and the Kennedy pathway, which are essential for the remodeling of cell membrane phospholipids (Pierce2023A). MBOAT1 is a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (MBOAT) superfamily and is predicted to have nine transmembrane-spanning domains, indicating its localization in the plasma membrane (Dauwerse2007A).

In healthy human cells, MBOAT1 plays a significant role in maintaining membrane fluidity and function, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including signaling and membrane dynamics. The enzyme's activity supports neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth, highlighting its importance in neuronal cell function (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). Disruption of MBOAT1 can lead to developmental disorders such as brachydactyly-syndactyly syndrome, indicating its role in normal skeletal development (Dauwerse2007A). Additionally, mutations in MBOAT1 have been associated with infertility, further underscoring its significance in human health (Pierce2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and disruptions in the MBOAT1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Notably, mutations in MBOAT1 can lead to brachydactyly-syndactyly syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by disproportionate short stature, skeletal abnormalities, and partial syndactyly of the hands and feet. This condition has been linked to chromosomal translocations that disrupt the MBOAT1 gene, as observed in a patient with a de novo translocation t(4;6)(q12;p23) (Dauwerse2007A).

MBOAT1 is also implicated in male infertility, specifically nonobstructive azoospermia. Mutations such as the Thr257Met variant in the MBOAT1 gene have been identified in infertile male patients, leading to reduced expression of the enzyme it encodes, LPEAT1, which is crucial for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth (Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Pierce2023A).

There is also evidence suggesting a potential link between MBOAT1 and Alzheimer's disease, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in both developmental and neurological health.
