(methylene-THF) as a cofactor. This function maintains the dTMP (thymidine-5-prime monophosphate) pool critical for DNA replication and repair. The enzyme has been of interest as a target for cancer chemotherapeutic agents. It is considered to be the primary site of action for 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluoro-2-prime-deoxyuridine, and some folate analogs. Expression of this gene and that of a naturally occurring antisense transcript, mitochondrial enolase superfamily member 1 (GeneID:55556), vary inversely when cell-growth progresses from late-log to plateau phase. Polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with etiology of neoplasia, including breast cancer, and response to chemotherapy.
