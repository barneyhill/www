# ADAMTSL4

## Overview
ADAMTSL4 is a gene that encodes the ADAMTS-like 4 protein, a secreted glycoprotein that is part of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs) family. Unlike other members of this family, ADAMTS-like 4 lacks a protease domain, which distinguishes it from its proteolytic counterparts (Chandra2012Focus). The protein is primarily involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the eye, where it plays a critical role in the biogenesis and maintenance of fibrillin-1 microfibrils, essential for the structural integrity of ocular tissues (Gabriel2012ADAMTSL4). Mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene are associated with ocular conditions such as isolated ectopia lentis, characterized by lens dislocation, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining proper eye function (AragonMartin2010Role).

## Structure
The ADAMTSL4 protein is a secreted glycoprotein that is part of the ADAMTS family, characterized by its lack of a protease domain, which distinguishes it from other ADAMTS proteins. It consists of 1074 amino acids and includes several structural domains that contribute to its function. The protein contains seven thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) domains, which are believed to anchor it to the extracellular matrix (ECM) (AragonMartin2010Role; Chandra2012Focus). These TSR domains are clustered towards the C-terminus of the protein (Chandra2012Focus).

ADAMTSL4 also features an ADAMTS spacer 1 domain, an ADAMTS cysteine-rich module, and a protease and lacunin (PLAC) domain, which contains a 6-cysteine conserved repeat (AragonMartin2010Role; Chandra2012Focus). The PLAC domain is important for interactions with matrix proteases and proprotein convertases (AragonMartin2010Role).

Post-translational modifications of ADAMTSL4 include glycosylation, as indicated by the presence of N- and O-linked glycosylation, which affects its electrophoretic mobility (Gabriel2012ADAMTSL4). The protein is widely distributed in the eye and is involved in microfibril biogenesis, interacting with fibrillin-1 microfibrils (Gabriel2012ADAMTSL4).

## Function
The ADAMTSL4 gene encodes a secreted glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the eye, particularly in the biogenesis and maintenance of fibrillin-1 microfibrils. These microfibrils are essential for the structural integrity and function of ocular tissues, including the stable anchorage of zonule fibers to the lens capsule, which is critical for maintaining the lens in the correct position and facilitating accommodation (Gabriel2012ADAMTSL4; Collin2015Disruption). 

ADAMTSL4 is widely distributed in the eye and is associated with various ocular components such as the corneal epithelium, stroma, iris, ciliary body, and retina. It enhances the deposition of fibrillin-1 in the ECM, suggesting its role in accelerating microfibril biogenesis (Gabriel2012ADAMTSL4). The protein is involved in the formation and maintenance of the ocular zonule, a structure that suspends the lens in the optic path, and its disruption can lead to conditions such as ectopia lentis, where the lens is dislocated (Collin2015Disruption). 

In healthy human cells, ADAMTSL4 is necessary for the proper molecular interactions that ensure the zonular fibers remain connected to the lens capsule, maintaining eye structure and function (Collin2015Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene are primarily associated with isolated ectopia lentis (EL), a condition characterized by the dislocation of the eye's lens. These mutations often lead to premature termination codons, resulting in truncated proteins that lack crucial domains for extracellular matrix anchoring, particularly affecting the structural integrity of the zonular fibers that support the lens (AragonMartin2010Role; Ahram2009A). The condition is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is distinguished from syndromic forms of EL, such as those associated with Marfan syndrome, which involve systemic manifestations (Neuhann2015ADAMTSL4‐associated).

Specific mutations, such as a 20 base pair deletion in exon 6, have been identified as founder mutations in certain populations, indicating a potential historical spread of these genetic alterations (Christensen2010A; Neuhann2011A). In addition to isolated EL, ADAMTSL4 mutations have been linked to ectopia lentis et pupillae (ELeP), a rare disorder involving both lens and pupil displacement, along with other ocular abnormalities (Zhao2022Correlation). The gene's role in ocular development underscores the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and differentiation from other connective tissue disorders (Wei2023A).

## Interactions
ADAMTSL4 is known to interact with fibrillin-1 microfibrils, playing a significant role in microfibril biogenesis. This interaction is evidenced by the colocalization of ADAMTSL4 with fibrillin-1 in fibroblast cultures, indicating a physical interaction that enhances the deposition of fibrillin-1 in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Gabriel2012ADAMTSL4). The presence of ADAMTSL4-conditioned medium results in greater deposition and stronger fluorescence intensity of fibrillin-1 compared to controls, suggesting that ADAMTSL4 accelerates the formation or maintenance of fibrillin-1 microfibrils (Gabriel2012ADAMTSL4).

In addition to its interaction with fibrillin-1, ADAMTSL4 is part of a broader network of protein-protein interactions within the ADAMTS-TSL family. It interacts with a variety of proteins, including GLRX3, KRTAP108, EFEMP2, COL5A1, ITGB4, and many others, as identified in phylogenetic studies (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). These interactions suggest that ADAMTSL4 may have roles in ECM remodeling and the regulation of other ECM components, although specific details of these interactions are not fully elucidated in the available literature (Dennler2023Phylogenetic).
