# IP6K1

## Overview
Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1, which belongs to the kinase family. This enzyme is pivotal in the phosphorylation of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) to produce inositol pyrophosphates, molecules that play significant roles in various cellular processes. The IP6K1 gene is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential biological functions. The protein encoded by IP6K1 is involved in critical cellular activities, including neuronal migration, DNA repair, and insulin secretion, by modulating signaling pathways and interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. Alterations in IP6K1 expression or function have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Jadav2013Inositol; Barker2009Inositol; Fu2017Neuronal).

## Structure
The human IP6K1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the phosphorylation of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) to produce inositol pyrophosphates. The primary structure of IP6K1 is highly conserved across species, with 95% amino acid similarity between humans and rodents (Barker2009Inositol). The protein is approximately 50 kDa in size, although alternative splicing can result in a variant with a lower molecular weight of around 31 kDa due to the splicing out of a region in the N-terminal part (Barker2009Inositol).

The secondary and tertiary structures of IP6K1 include conserved elements typical of inositol phosphate kinases, such as an N-lobe with anti-parallel β-strands and a helical C-lobe, which are connected by an adenine-binding hinge (Shears2019Inositol). The protein also features a conserved PxxxDxKxG catalytic signature, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Shears2019Inositol).

Post-translational modifications of IP6K1 include phosphorylation, with serine 151 being a known phosphorylation site within a WW motif, potentially influencing protein-protein interactions (Barker2009Inositol). The enzyme can also be phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro, although this does not alter its activity (Barker2009Inositol). The quaternary structure of IP6K1 is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by converting inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) to diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7). This conversion is essential for several physiological functions, including neuronal migration, DNA repair, and insulin secretion. IP6K1 is involved in the regulation of neuronal migration by interacting with α-actinin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which are critical for cell motility and spreading. The kinase activity of IP6K1 promotes the phosphorylation of FAK, a process necessary for maintaining normal cellular functions related to motility and adhesion (Fu2017Neuronal).

In the context of DNA repair, IP6K1 is vital for homologous recombination repair, a process crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Cells lacking IP6K1 exhibit impaired DNA damage repair and increased susceptibility to chromosomal aberrations (Jadav2013Inositol). Additionally, IP6K1 influences insulin secretion and sensitivity. In pancreatic beta cells, IP6K1 regulates insulin exocytosis, and its disruption can lead to altered insulin levels and increased insulin sensitivity (Bhandari2008Gene). IP6K1 also plays a role in regulating lipolysis through its interaction with perilipin1 in adipocytes, modulating energy metabolism (Ghoshal2016Inositol).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the IP6K1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cancer, particularly aerodigestive tract carcinoma, deletion of IP6K1 in mice has been shown to reduce cell migration and invasion, suggesting a protective role against cancer progression. This is attributed to changes in gene expression that affect cell surface and extracellular matrix signaling, impacting integrin-mediated signaling and actin cytoskeleton remodeling (Jadav2016Deletion). The absence of IP6K1 results in reduced cell spreading, motility, and invasion, indicating its role in promoting carcinogenesis (Jadav2016Deletion).

In the context of metabolic disorders, IP6K1 is involved in energy metabolism and insulin signaling. Its deletion in mice leads to increased energy expenditure and affects insulin signaling by modulating AMPK and Akt activities. This suggests that IP6K1 plays a role in metabolic regulation and insulin sensitivity, with potential implications for type-2 diabetes (Minini2020The).

IP6K1 also plays a critical role in neuronal migration and brain development. Deletion of IP6K1 results in brain malformation and abnormalities in neuronal migration, highlighting its importance in proper neuronal development (Fu2017Neuronal). These findings underscore the clinical significance of IP6K1 in various physiological and pathological processes.

## Interactions
IP6K1 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is involved in the formation of processing bodies (P-bodies) by promoting proteome remodeling on the mRNA cap. IP6K1 interacts with components of the mRNA decapping complex, including EDC4, DCP1A/B, and DCP2, as well as the RNA helicase DDX6. These interactions facilitate translation suppression and mRNA decapping, contributing to P-body formation (Shah2020IP6K1).

IP6K1 also interacts with the eIF4F translation initiation complex, including eIF4E, eIF4A2, and eIF4G1, enhancing the binding of DDX6 and 4E-T to eIF4E, which is crucial for translation inhibition (Shah2020IP6K1). In the context of pyrophosphorylation, IP6K1 supports the pyrophosphorylation of substrate proteins by inositol pyrophosphate 5-IP7. It forms a complex with AP3B1 and CK2α, where it directly binds to AP3B1 and indirectly to CK2α through AP3B1, facilitating the pyrophosphorylation process (Hamid2023Interaction).

IP6K1 is also involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation by interacting with DNA and histone methylation processes, as well as forming complexes with the COP9 signalosome and Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (Minini2020The).
