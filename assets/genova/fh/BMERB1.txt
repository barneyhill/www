# BMERB1

## Overview
BMERB1 is a gene that encodes the protein bMERB domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein interactions and signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its ability to interact with branched ubiquitin chains, particularly K48/K63-linked branched Ub3, suggesting a role in ubiquitin signaling pathways that may influence protein degradation and cellular signaling (Waltho2024K48). Additionally, bMERB domain containing 1 has been implicated in the regulation of cell shape and axonogenesis through its interaction with MICAL1, a protein associated with immune regulation and cancer-related pathways (Song2024MICAL1). The gene has also been identified as a significant locus in genome-wide association studies related to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, indicating potential involvement in intracellular trafficking and sphingolipid metabolism (Jones2020Genomewide; Küçükali2024Multiomic). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and clinical implications of BMERB1 remain subjects of ongoing research.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The BMERB1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In the context of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD), BMERB1 has been identified as a risk gene. Its predicted gene expression is associated with sCJD risk, with significant Z-scores and high FOCUS PIP values indicating a strong association (Küçükali2024Multiomic). Although BMERB1 was identified in the discovery phase of a genome-wide association study for sCJD, it did not show significant association in single SNP tests, and its role remains less clear compared to other genes like STX6 and GAL3ST1 (Jones2020Genomewide).

In a study involving two siblings with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, a duplication of the chromosomal region 16p13.11, which includes BMERB1, was found in one sibling. This duplication was considered possibly associated with the patient's condition, although the specific contribution of BMERB1 was not detailed (Brugger2021Locus).

BMERB1 has also been noted for its negative association with HMGN1 in gastric cancer, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression (Wu2022Expression). However, the specific mechanisms and clinical implications of BMERB1 in these contexts require further investigation.

## Interactions
BMERB1, or bMERB domain containing 1, is involved in various protein interactions. It has been identified as a significant interactor with branched ubiquitin chains, specifically K48/K63-linked branched Ub3, in a study examining ubiquitin chain interactomes. This suggests that BMERB1 may play a role in ubiquitin signaling pathways, potentially influencing processes such as protein degradation or cellular signaling (Waltho2024K48).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), BMERB1 was identified as one of the interacting proteins with MICAL1, a protein associated with immune regulation and cancer-related pathways. This interaction was identified using the Genemania database, indicating BMERB1's potential involvement in processes like cell shape regulation and axonogenesis (Song2024MICAL1).

BMERB1 has also been implicated in the risk of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD). Genome-wide association studies have identified BMERB1 as a significant locus, suggesting its involvement in intracellular trafficking and sphingolipid metabolism, although specific protein interactions in this context have not been detailed (Jones2020Genomewide; Küçükali2024Multiomic).
