# LRRC18

## Overview
The LRRC18 gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 18, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of LRR motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are crucial for various cellular processes. The LRRC18 protein is implicated in several biological functions, although its precise role remains to be fully elucidated. It is thought to participate in cellular signaling pathways and may have a role in modulating immune responses. The study of LRRC18 is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential involvement in disease mechanisms and its interactions with other cellular proteins.
