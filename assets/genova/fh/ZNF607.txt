# ZNF607

## Overview
ZNF607 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 607, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins, including ZNF607, are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes. ZNF607 has been implicated in modulating cellular responses to chemotherapy agents, such as paclitaxel, through its interaction with cellular microtubules (Eng2011Bioinformatic). Additionally, it is associated with TRIM28, a protein involved in chromatin remodeling, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). The gene's expression levels have been linked to cancer prognosis, particularly in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where its upregulation correlates with reduced survival rates (Dastsooz2022LncRNA–miRNA–mRNA). Furthermore, ZNF607 variants are associated with renal disease phenotypes, highlighting its clinical significance in both oncology and nephrology (VallPalomar2023IDENTIFICATION).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF607 has been implicated in several clinical contexts due to its role in gene regulation. In familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), variants in ZNF607 are associated with a more aggressive renal phenotype known as the FAST phenotype. The alternative allele in heterozygosis for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) mapping to ZNF607 is linked to this phenotype, suggesting a role in renal disease progression (VallPalomar2023IDENTIFICATION).

In cancer research, ZNF607 has been identified as having prognostic value in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). Overexpression of ZNF607 is associated with reduced overall survival and a worse prognosis, indicating it may function as a proto-oncogene in this context (Dastsooz2022LncRNA–miRNA–mRNA).

In pharmacogenomics, ZNF607 variants have been studied for their potential impact on drug response, particularly in relation to paclitaxel sensitivity in cancer cell lines. Although the variants are predicted to have benign effects on protein structure, they may influence drug response through changes in splicing regulatory effects and interactions with microtubules (Eng2011Bioinformatic).

These findings highlight the diverse roles of ZNF607 in disease and treatment response, underscoring the need for further research to fully understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
ZNF607, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of paclitaxel sensitivity in cancer cell lines, ZNF607 has been identified to interact with cellular microtubules, potentially affecting the cellular response to the drug (Eng2011Bioinformatic). This interaction suggests a role in modulating the effects of chemotherapy agents.

In the realm of gene regulation, ZNF607 is associated with TRIM28, a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. Although specific interactions between ZNF607 and TRIM28 are not detailed, ZNF607 is mentioned as one of the zinc finger proteins that interact with wild-type TRIM28 (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). This association implies a potential role in transcriptional regulation through interactions with TRIM28.

ZNF607's involvement in cancer prognosis has also been noted, particularly in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where its upregulation is linked to reduced overall survival and worse prognosis (Dastsooz2022LncRNA–miRNA–mRNA). While specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed, the gene's expression levels suggest its participation in complex regulatory networks affecting cancer progression.
