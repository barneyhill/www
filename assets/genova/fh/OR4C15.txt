# OR4C15

## Overview
The OR4C15 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily C member 15, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium (Yin2020Functional). As a transmembrane receptor, OR4C15 is involved in the olfactory transduction pathway, which is essential for the sense of smell. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR4C15 and other olfactory receptors are expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, suggesting additional, yet not fully understood, physiological roles (Grison2014Mesencephalic). The evolutionary dynamics of the OR4C15 gene indicate a relaxation of negative selection, which may contribute to the presence of deleterious polymorphisms (Pierron2013Current).

## Function
The OR4C15 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants and initiate a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional). The olfactory receptors, including OR4C15, are involved in the olfactory transduction pathway, which is essential for the sense of smell (Yin2020Functional).

In addition to their role in the olfactory system, olfactory receptors like OR4C15 are expressed in other tissues, suggesting potential roles beyond odor detection. For instance, olfactory receptors have been identified in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, indicating a possible involvement in neurobiological processes such as movement control and reward behavior (Grison2014Mesencephalic). However, the specific function of OR4C15 in these non-olfactory tissues remains less clear.

The expression of olfactory receptor genes, including OR4C15, is subject to evolutionary pressures, with studies suggesting a relaxation of negative selection, allowing for a higher proportion of deleterious polymorphisms in these genes (Pierron2013Current).
