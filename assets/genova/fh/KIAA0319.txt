# KIAA0319

## Overview
KIAA0319 is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein, which is primarily involved in neuronal migration and cell-cell adhesion processes. The protein, also named KIAA0319, is characterized by the presence of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains, which are implicated in mechanosensing and cell adhesion, and a MANSC domain that contributes to its structural integrity (VelayosBaeza2007The). KIAA0319 is extensively glycosylated and exists in multiple isoforms, some of which are soluble and secreted, reflecting its diverse functional roles in cellular processes (VelayosBaeza2007The). The gene is notably associated with dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder, due to its critical role in neuronal positioning and cortical development (Cope2005Strong; Paracchini2006The). Through interactions with signaling proteins and involvement in endocytic pathways, KIAA0319 influences axon growth and neuronal migration, underscoring its importance in brain development and function (Franquinho2017The; Levecque2009The).

## Structure
The KIAA0319 protein is a type I plasma membrane protein associated with dyslexia, characterized by a single transmembrane (TM) domain, an extracellular N-terminus, and a cytoplasmic C-terminus (VelayosBaeza2007The). It contains several polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains, which are implicated in cell-cell adhesion and neuronal migration (VelayosBaeza2007The). The protein also features a MANSC domain at the N-terminus, which includes seven cysteines, and a C6 domain with six cysteines near the TM domain (VelayosBaeza2007Alternative). These cysteine-rich regions are crucial for dimerization, with disulfide bonds likely forming between cysteine residues (VelayosBaeza2007The).

KIAA0319 undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including N- and O-glycosylation. N-glycosylation occurs primarily in the central region containing the PKD domains, while O-glycosylation is mucin-type and occurs in regions rich in serine, threonine, and proline (VelayosBaeza2007The). The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, such as variants B and C, which lack the TM domain and are soluble, with variant B being secreted (VelayosBaeza2007The). These structural features and modifications are essential for the protein's function in neuronal migration and cell-cell interactions.

## Function
The KIAA0319 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of cilia length, cell migration, and mechanical cell-substrate interactions. The protein contains five PKD domains, similar to those found in Polycystin-1, a known mechanosensor in cilia membranes, suggesting a role in mechanosensing (Diaz2022KIAA0319; Diaz2019KIAA0319). In healthy human cells, KIAA0319 is involved in linking the cellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, influencing processes controlled by the cytoskeleton such as cell migration and the formation of actin-rich cell protrusions (Diaz2022KIAA0319).

KIAA0319 is also implicated in neuronal migration, a critical process for brain development. It interacts with adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) and follows the classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway, which is essential for its role in cell adhesion and neuronal migration (Levecque2009The). The protein's involvement in axon growth inhibition is mediated through the activation of Smad2 signaling via interactions with SH2B1β and JAK2, highlighting its role as a negative regulator of axon growth (Franquinho2017The). These functions suggest that KIAA0319 is crucial for proper neuronal positioning and cortical layering, impacting neurodevelopmental processes (VelayosBaeza2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KIAA0319 gene are significantly associated with dyslexia, a common learning disorder affecting reading and spelling abilities. Dyslexia is characterized by difficulties in phoneme processing and reading, and KIAA0319 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for this condition (Cope2005Strong). Variants in KIAA0319, particularly those affecting its expression, have been linked to impaired neuronal migration during brain development, which is crucial for the formation of the cerebral neocortex (Paracchini2006The). 

Research has shown that reduced expression of KIAA0319 can lead to increased variability in neural responses to speech sounds and impair phoneme discrimination, suggesting a role in auditory processing deficits observed in dyslexia (Centanni2013Knockdown). The gene's expression is regulated by genetic variants in its promoter region, which may affect reading abilities without impacting overall brain development (Paniagua2022Dyslexia). 

Additionally, KIAA0319 is involved in axon growth and regeneration, with its overexpression inhibiting axon growth, while deletion enhances neurite outgrowth (Franquinho2017The). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance in understanding and potentially addressing dyslexia and related cognitive disorders.

## Interactions
The KIAA0319 protein is involved in several interactions that influence its function in neuronal processes. It interacts with the signaling proteins JAK2 and SH2B1β, which are crucial for the activation of Smad2 signaling. This interaction is essential for KIAA0319's role in inhibiting axon growth, as demonstrated by experiments showing that depletion of SH2B1 or JAK2 reverses the inhibitory effect on axon growth (Franquinho2017The).

KIAA0319 also participates in clathrin-mediated endocytosis through its interaction with the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex. This interaction is facilitated by a tyrosine-based motif (YTIL) in the cytoplasmic domain of KIAA0319, which is necessary for its internalization. Mutations in this motif, such as the Y995A mutation, disrupt the interaction with AP-2 and impair endocytosis, highlighting the importance of this interaction for KIAA0319's cellular localization and function (Levecque2009The).

These interactions underscore KIAA0319's role in neuronal migration and axon growth regulation, with its involvement in both signaling pathways and endocytic processes being critical for its function in the nervous system (Franquinho2017The; Levecque2009The).
