# TNFSF18

## Overview
TNFSF18, also known as GITRL, is a gene that encodes the protein TNF superfamily member 18, a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. This protein plays a crucial role in immune regulation by interacting with its receptor, GITR (TNFRSF18), primarily expressed on T cells. The TNFSF18 protein is characterized by its ability to form homotrimers, a structural feature that facilitates its interaction with GITR, thereby modulating T-cell activation, proliferation, and survival. This interaction is vital for immune responses, influencing processes such as inflammation, autoimmunity, and tumor resistance (Dostert2019The; Wiens2011Origin). TNFSF18 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells and endothelial cells, where it contributes to immune homeostasis and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and atherosclerosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2022Identification; Gao2020The).

## Structure
TNFSF18, also known as GITRL, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and is characterized as a type II transmembrane protein. The protein forms homotrimers, a common structural feature among TNF ligands, which facilitates its interaction with the receptor GITR (Dostert2019The). The extracellular domain of TNFSF18 is responsible for receptor binding, which is crucial for its role in immune regulation. This domain may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its stability and function (Dostert2019The).

The TNF homology domain (THD) is a key structural feature of TNFSF18, contributing to its ability to form non-covalent trimers necessary for receptor interaction (Magis2012An). The THD is characterized by a beta jelly roll fold, a conserved structural motif across the TNF ligand family, which is essential for the trimerization process (Magis2012An). This structural arrangement is critical for the physiological function of TNFSF18, as it allows for effective binding to its receptor and subsequent signaling pathways involved in immune responses. The protein's structure and modifications are integral to its function in the immune system, particularly in T-cell regulation and activation.

## Function
TNFSF18, also known as GITRL, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and plays a significant role in immune regulation. It is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells and interacts with its receptor, GITR, which is found on T cells. This interaction is crucial for modulating T-cell activation, proliferation, and survival, thereby influencing immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Wiens2011Origin). TNFSF18 is involved in lowering the threshold for T-cell activation and proliferation, which is essential for effective immune responses (Brandstetter2019FOXO3).

In healthy human cells, TNFSF18 is active in immune cells such as T-cells and antigen-presenting cells, where it contributes to processes like inflammation and autoimmunity. It is involved in the regulation of T-cell responses, which are vital for the body's defense mechanisms against pathogens and in maintaining immune balance (Wiens2011Origin). The protein's activity is linked to the modulation of cytokine production and the activation of regulatory T cells, which are important for controlling immune responses and preventing excessive inflammation (Wiens2011Origin).

## Clinical Significance
TNFSF18, also known as GITRL, is implicated in various diseases due to its role in immune regulation and inflammation. Altered expression of TNFSF18 has been associated with cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In HCC, TNFSF18 is one of the genes found to be up-regulated in tumor tissues, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis and potential as a target for immunotherapy (Hu2022Identification). Although TNFSF18 is part of the TNF family, its specific role in LUAD remains largely unexplored, with studies focusing on broader TNF family signatures rather than individual gene mutations or expression changes (Zhang2020Comprehensive).

In atherosclerosis, TNFSF18 expression is linked to increased inflammation and disturbances in coronary microcirculation. Inhibition of TNFSF18 in an atherosclerotic mouse model led to reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines and proteins involved in leukocyte adhesion, highlighting its role in endothelial inflammation and the potential for therapeutic targeting in atherosclerotic diseases (Gao2020The).

In colorectal cancer, TNFSF18 is mentioned in the context of genetic alterations, although specific details on its disease relevance are not extensively covered (Tang2018The). Overall, TNFSF18's involvement in these conditions underscores its significance in disease pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TNFSF18, also known as GITRL, interacts primarily with its receptor GITR (TNFRSF18) on T cells, playing a significant role in modulating immune responses. The interaction between GITRL and GITR functions as a co-activating signal crucial for the development of immune responses, enhancing resistance to tumors and viral infections, and regulating leukocyte extravasation (Nocentini2007GITRGITRL:). GITRL is expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and endothelial cells, where it can influence T cell activation, proliferation, and survival (Dostert2019The; Gao2020The).

In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), GITRL signaling leads to the upregulation of indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) via the noncanonical NF-B pathway, which has an immunosuppressive effect (Dostert2019The). GITRL also plays a role in coronary endothelial inflammation by promoting p-STAT1 phosphorylation, which leads to the expression of adhesion molecules such as VCAM1 and ICAM1, exacerbating coronary microcirculation disorders (Gao2020The).

The interaction between GITRL and GITR is not limited to T cells; it also affects other immune cells, such as NK cells, where GITR signaling can decrease cytotoxicity in vivo (Dostert2019The).
