# OCM2

## Overview
The OCM2 gene encodes the protein oncomodulin 2, a member of the EF-hand protein family known for its calcium-binding capabilities. Oncomodulin 2 is characterized by its helix-loop-helix structural motifs, which are integral to its function as a calcium-binding protein. This protein plays a role as a Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein or as a specialized cytosolic Ca2+ buffer, contributing to various cellular processes (Henzl1996Introduction; Henzl1998Interconversion). The structural configuration of oncomodulin 2, including its primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, is essential for its ability to bind calcium ions effectively, which in turn influences its regulatory functions within the cell (Henzl2007Solution).

## Structure
Oncomodulin 2 (OCM2) is a calcium-binding protein that belongs to the EF-hand protein family, characterized by its helix-loop-helix structural motifs. The primary structure of OCM2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional properties (Henzl1996Introduction). The secondary structure includes alpha helices typical of EF-hand motifs, which are essential for calcium ion binding. These motifs are organized into a 12-residue binding loop flanked by short helical segments, with ligands positioned at the vertices of an octahedron (Henzl1996Introduction; Henzl2007Solution).

The tertiary structure of OCM2 involves the folding of these helices to form a stable, functional protein. This structure is influenced by the unique ligand arrays and the local environment of its binding sites, which affect its ion-binding properties (Henzl1998Interconversion). The presence of the AB domain, which packs against the CD/EF domain, contributes to the unique tertiary structure of oncomodulin compared to other calmodulin family members (Henzl1996Introduction).

The quaternary structure of OCM2 may involve interactions with other proteins or subunits, although specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context. The protein's structure is crucial for its role as a Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein or a specialized cytosolic Ca2+ buffer (Henzl1998Interconversion).
