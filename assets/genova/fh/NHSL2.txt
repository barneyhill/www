# NHSL2

## Overview
NHSL2 (NHS like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and cytoskeletal organization. The NHSL2 protein is a member of the Nance-Horan Syndrome protein family, which is characterized by the presence of a WAVE homology domain (WHD) crucial for actin remodeling and maintaining cell morphology (Brooks2010The). This protein is implicated in cellular processes such as cell adhesion and migration, and it is active in the cytoplasm, potentially influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular communication (Brooks2010The). NHSL2 is particularly noted for its role in eosinophil activation, where it shows distinct localization patterns upon cytokine activation, suggesting a role in cellular signaling and structure maintenance (Mitchell2022Molecular). Further research is necessary to fully understand the specific functions and mechanisms of NHSL2 in human cells.

## Function
NHSL2 (NHS like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and cytoskeletal organization. The NHSL2 protein is part of the Nance-Horan Syndrome protein family, which includes NHS and NHSL1, and is characterized by the presence of a functional WAVE homology domain (WHD) that is crucial for actin remodeling and maintaining cell morphology (Brooks2010The). This domain allows NHSL2 to interact with components of the WAVE complex, which is involved in actin polymerization and cell motility (Brooks2010The).

NHSL2 is thought to play a role in cytoskeletal rearrangement, potentially contributing to processes such as cell adhesion and migration. Although the precise function of NHSL2 in eosinophil activation and its phosphorylation sites are not fully understood, it is suggested that NHSL2 may influence cytoskeletal dynamics in these cells (Mitchell2022Molecular). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and may be involved in maintaining cell structure and facilitating intracellular communication, which is essential for normal cellular operations and organismal development (Brooks2010The). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific roles and mechanisms of NHSL2 in healthy human cells.

## Interactions
NHSL2, a member of the Nance-Horan Syndrome (NHS) protein family, is involved in cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of eosinophils, and upon activation with cytokines such as IL5 and IL33, NHSL2 shows distinct localization patterns. In IL5-activated eosinophils, NHSL2 is enriched at the nucleopod tip, while in both IL5 and IL33 activated eosinophils, it co-localizes with SON, a nuclear speckle protein, suggesting a potential interaction or association with SON in nuclear speckles (Mitchell2022Molecular).

NHSL2 is also part of the NHS protein family, which includes proteins that interact with components of the actin cytoskeleton. Although specific interactions of NHSL2 with actin-related proteins are not detailed, the family is known to regulate actin dynamics, and NHSL2 is predicted to have a functional WAVE homology domain (WHD) that may be involved in these processes (Brooks2010The). The phosphorylation of NHSL2 by cytosolic kinases such as CMKIIA, PKA, and PKC during eosinophil activation suggests that phosphorylation events might play a role in its interactions and functions, although the exact significance remains to be elucidated (Mitchell2022Molecular).
