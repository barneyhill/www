# ZNF562

## Overview
ZNF562 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 562, a member of the KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box zinc finger) protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and are typically involved in transcriptional regulation. The KRAB-ZNF proteins, including zinc finger protein 562, are implicated in various biological processes, including gene expression modulation and local adaptation. ZNF562, in particular, has been studied for its potential role in the pathogenesis of diabetic foot ulcers, highlighting its involvement in glutamine metabolism. Despite its recognized potential in disease processes, the specific biological functions and pathways of ZNF562 remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its implications in human health and disease (Shi2024A; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF562 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). A study identified ZNF562 as one of the key genes potentially impacting DFU through its involvement in glutamine metabolism. This research utilized machine learning models to highlight ZNF562's role in DFU, although the specific pathways linking ZNF562 to glutamine metabolism and DFU pathogenesis remain unclear (Shi2024A).

While ZNF562 is part of the KRAB-ZNF gene family, which is known for its involvement in local adaptation and potential links to various diseases, specific clinical conditions directly associated with ZNF562 mutations or expression alterations are not well-documented. The KRAB-ZNF genes, including ZNF562, show high genetic differentiation between populations, suggesting potential adaptive roles, but the clinical significance of these variations is not fully understood (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

Overall, while ZNF562 is recognized for its potential role in disease processes like DFU, detailed clinical implications and the mechanisms by which it influences disease remain to be elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify its role in human health and disease.
