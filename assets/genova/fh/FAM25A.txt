# FAM25A

## Overview
FAM25A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 25 member A. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, which suggests a potential role in specific cellular processes, although its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. The FAM25A protein is not currently categorized under well-known protein classes such as kinases, receptors, or transmembrane proteins, indicating that it may have a unique or specialized function within the cell. Research into the gene and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its interactions and potential implications in various biological pathways and diseases.
