# NXT2

## Overview
NXT2 is a gene that encodes the protein nuclear transport factor 2 like export factor 2, which plays a pivotal role in the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of RNA molecules. This protein is categorized as a transport factor due to its involvement in the translocation of RNA across the nuclear envelope, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and gene expression regulation. Structurally, NXT2 shares similarities with NXT1, featuring a β-sandwich fold and an NTF2-like domain crucial for its interaction with nuclear export factors such as NXF2 and NXF3 (Huang2005NXT2; Dicke2024NXT2). Functionally, NXT2 is particularly significant in the human testis, where it is essential for spermatogenesis, interacting with several nuclear export receptors and nucleoporins to facilitate RNA export through the nuclear pore (Dicke2024NXT2). Mutations in the NXT2 gene are linked to male infertility and, in zebrafish, to heart defects, underscoring its critical role in both reproductive and cardiac development (Huang2005NXT2; Dicke2024NXT2).

## Structure
NXT2, or nuclear transport factor 2 like export factor 2, is a protein involved in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. It shares structural similarities with NXT1, featuring a β-sandwich fold typical of transport factors (Huang2005NXT2). The protein's structure includes an NTF2-like domain, which is crucial for its interaction with nuclear export factors such as NXF2 and NXF3 (Dicke2024NXT2). This domain is essential for binding, as evidenced by studies showing that mutations affecting this domain can lead to impaired function (Dicke2024NXT2).

NXT2 may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Huang2005NXT2). The protein can form complexes with other proteins, indicating potential quaternary structures, although specific details on these structures are not provided in the context (Huang2005NXT2).

In zebrafish, alternative splicing variants of NXT2, such as zNXT2a and zNXT2b, have been identified, with zNXT2a being crucial for heart development (Huang2005NXT2). However, specific splice variants in humans are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The NXT2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the nuclear RNA export process in human cells, particularly within the testis. NXT2 is involved in the translocation of RNA molecules across the nuclear envelope, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression. It interacts with nuclear export receptors and is active in both the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (Dicke2024NXT2).

In the human testis, NXT2 is critical for spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. It shows testis-enriched expression and interacts with several proteins, including members of the nuclear export factor protein family (NXF1, NXF2, and NXF3) and nucleoporins (NUP93 and NUP214), suggesting its involvement in RNA export through the nuclear pore (Dicke2024NXT2). NXT2 specifically interacts with NXF2 and NXF3, which are testis-specific, indicating a specialized RNA export pathway in this tissue (Dicke2024NXT2).

The absence of NXT2 in humans is linked to impaired spermatogenesis, highlighting its unique role in testicular function. This gene is essential for maintaining the spermatogonial stem cell niche and providing growth factors necessary for germ cell development (Dicke2024NXT2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NXT2 gene are associated with male infertility, particularly azoospermia, which is characterized by the absence of sperm in semen. Studies have identified loss-of-function variants in NXT2 that lead to a lack of germ cells in the seminiferous tubules, resulting in a Sertoli cell-only phenotype. This indicates that NXT2 is crucial for early germ cell development and spermatogenesis in humans (Dicke2024NXT2). The gene's testis-enriched expression and its interactions with nuclear export factors such as NXF1, NXF2, and NXF3 underscore its specific role in the testis, which cannot be compensated by its paralog NXT1 (Dicke2024NXT2).

In zebrafish, mutations in the NXT2 gene have been linked to heart defects, including dilated heart chambers and impaired cardiac valve formation. These defects are attributed to disruptions in myocardial cell differentiation and endocardial cushion formation, highlighting the gene's role in heart morphogenesis (Huang2005NXT2). The conservation of NXT2 function between zebrafish and humans suggests potential implications for human cardiac development and disease (Huang2005NXT2).

## Interactions
NXT2 is a critical player in the nuclear export of RNA, particularly in the human testis, where it is essential for spermatogenesis. It interacts with several key proteins involved in RNA export. NXT2 forms a core cluster with nuclear export factor proteins NXF1, NXF2, and NXF3, indicating its central role in RNA transport processes (Dicke2024NXT2). The interaction with NXF1 is part of the NXT1-NXF1 export factor complex, while NXT2 also binds specifically to NXF2 and NXF3 through its NTF2-like domain, which is crucial for these interactions (Dicke2024NXT2).

NXT2 also interacts with nucleoporins NUP93 and NUP214, which are involved in the transport of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) through the nuclear pore. NUP214 contains phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeats essential for binding to NXF proteins (Dicke2024NXT2). In addition to its role in mRNA export, NXT2 is associated with ribosome biogenesis factors SPATA5 and SPATA5L1, suggesting a broader role in ribosomal subunit export (Dicke2024NXT2).

The interactions of NXT2 with these proteins are crucial for its function in RNA export and spermatogenesis, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that confirm the specific and direct interactions with NXF2 and NXF3 (Dicke2024NXT2).
