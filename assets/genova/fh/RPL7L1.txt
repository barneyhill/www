# RPL7L1

## Overview
RPL7L1 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein L7-like 1, which is a component of the ribosome, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. This protein is categorized as a ribosomal protein, and it plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of ribosomes. The RPL7L1 gene is expressed in various tissues and is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, which is essential for cell growth and proliferation. Alterations in the expression of RPL7L1 have been associated with several diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, indicating its potential significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Liao2023Prognostic; Deniz2020Endogenous; Grima2023RNA).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The RPL7L1 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), higher expression of RPL7L1 is associated with worse survival outcomes, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker in this type of cancer (Liao2023Prognostic). In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RPL7L1 is upregulated compared to differentiated myeloid cells. The expression of RPL7L1 in AML is influenced by the presence of specific endogenous retroviral elements, which act as enhancers, indicating a regulatory mechanism that may contribute to its oncogenic potential (Deniz2020Endogenous).

In sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (sALS), RPL7L1 has been identified among the top genes for distinguishing sALS patients from controls, highlighting its potential relevance as a biomarker in this neurodegenerative disease (Grima2023RNA). While the precise clinical implications of RPL7L1 mutations or expression alterations are not fully understood, these findings suggest that RPL7L1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of certain cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which RPL7L1 contributes to these conditions.
