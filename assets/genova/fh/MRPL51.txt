# MRPL51

## Overview
MRPL51 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L51, which is a vital component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to mitochondrial translation, facilitating the synthesis of proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA, which are essential for the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. These processes are crucial for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism (RealesCalderón2013Candida; Prokopidis2022Aberrant). MRPL51 is expressed consistently across various tissues, serving as a housekeeping gene, particularly in cardiac tissues, due to its stable expression levels (Caracausi2016Integrated). The protein's role extends to muscle physiology, where it is implicated in myofiber growth and muscle disuse atrophy, with its dysregulation potentially leading to conditions such as ageing and cancer-related cachexia (Prokopidis2022Aberrant). Through its interactions with other mitochondrial components, MRPL51 plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and genomic stability, underscoring its importance in cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic functions.

## Function
MRPL51 encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L51, which is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial translation, facilitating the synthesis of proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA. These proteins are essential for the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, processes critical for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism (RealesCalderón2013Candida; Prokopidis2022Aberrant).

MRPL51 is consistently expressed across various tissues, including the heart, where it is identified as a housekeeping gene. Its stable expression levels make it a suitable reference gene for gene expression studies, particularly in cardiac tissues. This consistent expression underscores its importance in maintaining basic cellular processes and energy homeostasis (Caracausi2016Integrated).

In muscle physiology, MRPL51 is implicated in myofiber growth and muscle disuse atrophy. Its dysregulation can lead to impaired oxidative phosphorylation, contributing to muscle wasting conditions such as ageing and cancer-related cachexia (Prokopidis2022Aberrant). The protein's activity within the mitochondria is vital for maintaining the energy balance and metabolic functions of cells, particularly in tissues with high energy demands like skeletal muscle (Prokopidis2022Aberrant).

## Clinical Significance
MRPL51, a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, has been studied for its role in various diseases and conditions. Alterations in MRPL51 expression have been observed in different contexts, suggesting potential clinical significance. In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MRPL51 was identified as a differentially expressed gene, although its expression was not significantly dysregulated in the validation cohort of patients. In the TCGA dataset for adult AML, MRPL51 showed downregulation, indicating possible differences in expression patterns between pediatric and adult cases (Chaudhary2023Mitochondrial; Chaudhary2022Decoding).

In Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, MRPL51 was found to be upregulated in lymphomonocytes, with a mean fold change of 1.5. This upregulation is part of a broader pattern of increased mitochondrial activity, which may be linked to the pathologic phenotype of Rett syndrome (Pecorelli2013Genes).

The knockout of MRPL51 in mice results in embryonic lethality, particularly at pre-gastrulation stages, highlighting its critical role in early development. This suggests that mutations or disruptions in MRPL51 could potentially lead to severe developmental consequences (Cheong2020Expression). However, specific diseases directly caused by MRPL51 mutations have not been detailed in the available studies.

## Interactions
MRPL51, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome's large 39S subunit, is involved in several interactions critical for mitochondrial function. It is known to physically interact with Mhr1, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome involved in mtDNA repair, suggesting a collaborative role in maintaining genomic stability (Sahu2019Reverse). MRPL51 is also cross-linked to Oxa1p, indicating its involvement in the unique architecture of the mitochondrial ribosome and its peptide exit tunnel (Koc2012Regulation). This interaction is significant for the insertion and synthesis of mitochondrially-encoded proteins.

In mammalian systems, MRPL51 interacts with the C-terminal tail of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Oxa1L (Oxa1L-CTT), which is crucial for the co-translational insertion of proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane (Haque2010Properties). This interaction highlights MRPL51's role in the structural and functional aspects of mitochondrial protein biogenesis. Additionally, MRPL51 is involved in stabilizing the mitoribosomal central protuberance by forming contacts with other ribosomal proteins, such as MRPL38, within the 39S subunit (Richman2014Mitochondria:). These interactions underscore MRPL51's essential role in mitochondrial translation and ribosome assembly.
