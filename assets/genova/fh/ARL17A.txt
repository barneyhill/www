# ARL17A

## Overview
ARL17A is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor-like GTPase 17A, which is a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor-like (ARF-like) sub-family within the larger ARF family of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins are primarily involved in the regulation of membrane trafficking and vesicular transport, processes essential for maintaining cellular organization and function (Allen2016Gene). The ARL17A gene is located on chromosome 17 and has been implicated in various regulatory pathways, including those relevant to human carcinogenesis (Fontana2024Late). The protein encoded by ARL17A plays a significant role in synaptic transmission and is involved in intermolecular or intercellular interactions within the immune and nervous systems (SotoBeasley2020Screening). Additionally, ARL17A is associated with the KANSL1::ARL17A fusion gene, known as KANSARL, which is identified as a cancer predisposition fusion gene, particularly in individuals of European ancestry (Zhou2017Identification; Fontana2024Late).

## Structure


## Function
ARL17A is a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor-like (ARF-like) sub-family, which is part of the larger ARF family of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins are primarily involved in regulating membrane trafficking and vesicular transport, crucial processes for maintaining cellular organization and function (Allen2016Gene). ARL17A, along with other ARF family members, plays a significant role in synaptic transmission by facilitating vesicular trafficking, which is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system (Allen2016Gene).

In addition to its role in membrane dynamics, ARL17A is implicated in intermolecular or intercellular interactions within the immune system and nervous system development (SotoBeasley2020Screening). The gene is located on chromosome 17 and is involved in various regulatory pathways relevant to human carcinogenesis (Fontana2024Late). Although specific details about its function in healthy human cells are limited, ARL17A's involvement in these fundamental cellular processes suggests its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal physiology. The protein's activity is likely concentrated in areas of the cell where vesicle formation and movement are critical, such as the Golgi apparatus and synaptic terminals.

## Clinical Significance
The ARL17A gene, part of the ARF family, is implicated in various cancers due to its involvement in the KANSL1::ARL17A fusion gene, also known as KANSARL. This fusion gene is identified as a cancer predisposition fusion gene, particularly in individuals of European ancestry, and is associated with several cancer types, including glioblastomas, prostate, breast, lung cancer, and lymphomas (Zhou2017Identification; Fontana2024Late). The KANSARL fusion gene results from genomic rearrangements involving ARL17A and KANSL1, leading to the expression of fusion transcripts that may contribute to genomic instability and cancer progression (Zhou2017Identification; Fontana2024Late).

The fusion peptide encoded by the KANSL1::ARL17A transcript lacks certain functional domains, resulting in reduced activities of histone acetyltransferase KAT8 and p53, which may lead to hypermutations or epigenetic changes in cancer cells (Zhou2017Identification; Fontana2024Late). The presence of KANSARL fusion transcripts has been validated in various cancer cell lines and is notably prevalent in glioblastomas, suggesting a significant role in tumorigenesis (Zhou2017Identification). The KANSARL fusion gene's association with cancer predisposition highlights its potential as a biomarker for early cancer diagnosis and therapeutic applications (Zhou2017Identification).
