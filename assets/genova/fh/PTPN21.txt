# PTPN21

## Overview
PTPN21 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 21, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. This family of enzymes is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes through the dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on target proteins. PTPN21 is characterized by the presence of a FERM domain, which facilitates its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton and localization to the plasma membrane, playing a crucial role in cellular mechanics and signaling (Ni2019Ptpn21; Siddiqui2019PTPN21). The protein functions as both a phosphatase and a scaffold, interacting with various proteins such as KIF1C and GRB2, and is implicated in processes like intracellular transport and inflammatory response modulation (Siddiqui2019PTPN21; Sacco2014Combining). PTPN21's activity is significant in stem cell differentiation and has been linked to several diseases, including cancer and schizophrenia, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2019PTPN21; Hendriks2013Protein).

## Structure
PTPN21 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that features a FERM domain, which is crucial for its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton and localization to the plasma membrane (Ni2019Ptpn21; Siddiqui2019PTPN21). The FERM domain is sufficient to interact with other proteins, such as the motor protein KIF1C, and plays a significant role in relieving KIF1C autoinhibition, facilitating intracellular transport (Siddiqui2019PTPN21). 

PTPN21's catalytic activity is essential for its function in maintaining cellular mechanics, as demonstrated by its role in dephosphorylating specific substrates like Septin1 (Ni2019Ptpn21). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may lead to variations in its functional domains and activities (Cho2017Protein). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are likely to regulate PTPN21's activity, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context (Cho2017Protein). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it functions as a scaffold in some contexts, independent of its phosphatase activity (Siddiqui2019PTPN21).

## Function
PTPN21 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes through the dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on target proteins. In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), PTPN21 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular mechanics and retention within bone marrow niches. The loss of PTPN21 results in decreased cell stiffness and increased deformability, leading to enhanced mobilization and egress of HSCs from the bone marrow to peripheral blood and spleen (Ni2019Ptpn21). This is partly due to PTPN21's regulation of the cytoskeleton, specifically through the dephosphorylation of Septin1 at Tyr 246, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton (Ni2019Ptpn21).

In bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), PTPN21 overexpression promotes osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation while inhibiting immunosuppressive functions. This is associated with changes in gene expression affecting pathways such as cell-cell signaling and cell cycle regulation (Wang2019PTPN21). PTPN21's activity in these cells suggests a complex role in regulating differentiation and maintaining stem cell pluripotency, independent of proliferation (Wang2019PTPN21).

## Clinical Significance
PTPN21 has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In schizophrenia, genome-wide association studies have identified two non-synonymous sequence variations in PTPN21, p.L385P and p.V936A, which are significant risk alleles for the disorder. These variations affect the size and hydrophobicity of PTPD1 residues, although their specific contribution to schizophrenia's etiology remains unclear (Hendriks2013Protein).

In cancer, PTPN21 is associated with various malignancies. It is highly expressed in gastric carcinoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin's gastric lymphoma, where it interacts with ErbB4, activating pathways that promote cell survival and proliferation, such as the MEK-Elk-1 and STAT5 pathways (PlaniLam2016High). In colorectal cancer, PTPN21 is frequently affected by frameshift mutations in tumors with high microsatellite instability, suggesting a role in colorectal carcinogenesis (Korff2008Frameshift). Additionally, PTPN21 is downregulated in esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers, with its expression levels potentially serving as diagnostic markers (Chen2020The).

In lung adenocarcinoma, PTPN21 is downregulated, and its high expression is associated with longer overall survival, indicating a potential tumor suppressor role (Wang2022Novel).

## Interactions
PTPN21, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the scaffold protein GRB2, specifically binding to the C-terminal SH3 domain, although it does not dephosphorylate GRB2. This interaction is independent of phosphorylation and suggests that GRB2 may help target PTPN21 to different substrates (Sacco2014Combining).

PTPN21 also interacts with the motor protein KIF1C, relieving its autoinhibition by binding to the stalk region. This interaction is crucial for activating KIF1C's intracellular transport functions, particularly in neurons. The FERM domain of PTPN21 is sufficient for this activation, indicating a scaffold role rather than relying on its phosphatase activity (Siddiqui2019PTPN21).

In human keratinocytes, PTPN21 interacts with IKKβ, acting as a negative regulator by dephosphorylating IKKβ in TNF-α-stimulated cells. This interaction affects ICAM-1 expression and modulates inflammatory responses (Cho2017Protein).

PTPN21 is also associated with vesicular trafficking and cell metabolism, interacting with proteins like DNAJB11, DYNLL1, and UBR, which may copurify through indirect interactions (Sacco2014Combining).
