# RBMXL3

## Overview
RBMXL3 is a gene located on the X chromosome, known for encoding a protein that is part of the RNA binding motif protein family. The protein, RBMX like 3, is involved in RNA binding and splicing regulation, playing a crucial role in post-transcriptional modification processes within the nucleus. This protein is implicated in the assembly of spliceosomes, thereby influencing gene expression and protein synthesis. Although RBMXL3 shares some homology with other members of the RBMX family, its expression at the protein level remains to be fully confirmed. The gene is notably testis-specific, suggesting a potential role in male reproductive biology, although its precise functions in healthy human cells are not yet fully understood (Elliott2019RBMX; Robertson2020Largescale).

## Function
RBMXL3 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA binding and splicing regulation. It plays a significant role in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, influencing gene expression and protein synthesis. The protein is typically active in the nucleus, where it participates in the assembly of spliceosomes, impacting cellular processes and development. RBMXL3 is part of the RBMX family of proteins, which are known for their roles in RNA processing and transcriptional control (Elliott2019RBMX).

RBMXL3 is located on the X chromosome within the first intron of the LRCH2 gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction. It has a reading frame for a longer protein with only 53% identity to RBMX, although it is not yet confirmed if RBMXL3 is expressed at the protein level (Elliott2019RBMX). The gene has been identified as testis-specific, suggesting a role in male reproductive biology, although specific functions in healthy human cells remain unclear (Robertson2020Largescale). The molecular functions of RBMXL3, particularly in RNA-protein interactions and splicing regulation, are areas of ongoing research, with global mapping of these interactions needed to fully understand its roles (Elliott2019RBMX).

## Clinical Significance
RBMXL3 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in RNA binding and splicing. In the context of MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma, RBMXL3 mutations were identified in 19% of the samples, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of this cancer type (Lee2020Genomic). Although the specific impact of these mutations on disease progression is not fully understood, their recurrence indicates a possible clinical significance.

In the study of primary male infertility, RBMXL3 was identified as a candidate gene for further investigation due to its potential role in male infertility, particularly in azoospermia (Zhou2024Whole). The mutation spectrum includes missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, which may affect spermatogenesis.

RBMXL3 was also mentioned in the context of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) as a novel mutation, although the specific effects of these mutations on PTC progression remain unclear (Li2019Detection). Additionally, RBMXL3 was listed among candidate genes in a study involving a patient with a 2q13 microdeletion, but no direct association with specific diseases was established (Yu2016Discovery).
