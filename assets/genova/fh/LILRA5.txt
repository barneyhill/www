# LILRA5

## Overview
LILRA5 is a gene that encodes the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A5, a receptor primarily expressed on myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages. This receptor is involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. LILRA5 is categorized as a receptor due to its role in immune signaling pathways, where it associates with the ITAM-containing common gamma chain of Fc receptors. This interaction leads to the activation of Src family kinases and Syk, which are crucial for downstream signaling events that result in effector functions like cytokine production and calcium influx (Mitchell2008LILRA5). The gene's expression is regulated by various cytokines, and its involvement in immune modulation suggests a potential role in the early phases of immune responses (Lewis2020Leukocyte). Despite its significant role in immune regulation, the specific ligand for LILRA5 remains unidentified, and its precise function in healthy human cells is not fully understood (Lewis2020Leukocyte).

## Function
LILRA5, also known as leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A5, is a receptor involved in immune regulation. It is primarily expressed on myeloid cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, and is involved in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are crucial for initiating immune responses (Mitchell2008LILRA5). LILRA5 is associated with the ITAM-containing common gamma chain of Fc receptors, and its cross-linking leads to the activation of Src family kinases and Syk, triggering downstream signaling events such as phospholipase C-gamma and MAP kinase activation (Mitchell2008LILRA5). This signaling cascade results in effector functions like calcium influx and cytokine production, including TNF-alpha, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-10, while down-regulating IL-12 and IL-13 (Mitchell2008LILRA5).

The expression of LILRA5 is regulated by cytokines, with IL-10 and IFN-gamma upregulating its expression, while TNF-alpha downregulates it (Mitchell2008LILRA5). Although the specific ligand for LILRA5 is not well-characterized, its role in modulating immune cell function and cytokine production suggests it may be involved in the early phases of immune responses (Lewis2020Leukocyte). However, the specific function of LILRA5 in healthy human cells remains largely unassessed (Lewis2020Leukocyte).

## Clinical Significance
LILRA5 has been identified as a significant gene in various diseases due to its role in immune response regulation. Alterations in LILRA5 expression are associated with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NISCM), particularly diabetic cardiomyopathy. The gene's expression is significantly reduced in diabetic, hypertrophic, dilated, and inflammatory cardiomyopathies, suggesting its broad involvement in these conditions. This reduction in expression is linked to a negative correlation with severe insulin-resistant diabetes and heart failure, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Shi2024Identificationa; Shi2024Identification).

In inflammatory conditions, LILRA5 is implicated in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC). It is identified as a feature gene in these diseases, with its expression influencing immune cell infiltration and cytokine production. Although no direct correlation was found between LILRA5 mRNA expression and these diseases, its role in immune pathways suggests it may contribute to disease pathogenesis through cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions (Li2024Regulation).

LILRA5's involvement in these diseases highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in conditions where immune response regulation is disrupted.

## Interactions
LILRA5, a leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in immune response modulation. It is associated with the ITAM-containing common gamma chain of Fc receptors, which is crucial for its signaling functions. This association is suggested by the presence of a charged arginine residue in its transmembrane domain, indicating a potential interaction with an ITAM-containing adaptor protein, although the specific protein is not identified (Mitchell2008LILRA5).

Cross-linking of LILRA5 on monocytes leads to the phosphorylation of Src family kinases and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which are key signaling molecules in tyrosine kinase-mediated activation cascades. This phosphorylation event triggers downstream signaling pathways, including the activation of phospholipase C-gamma and MAP kinases, resulting in effector functions such as calcium influx and cytokine production (Mitchell2008LILRA5).

LILRA5 is also involved in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-1b, and IL-6, as well as the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10. These interactions are mediated by protein tyrosine kinase and MAP kinase pathways, highlighting LILRA5's role in inflammatory signaling (Mitchell2008LILRA5).
