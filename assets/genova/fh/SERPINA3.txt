# SERPINA3

## Overview
SERPINA3 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family A member 3, also known as alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, which is a member of the serpin superfamily of serine protease inhibitors. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating proteolytic processes by inhibiting enzymes such as chymotrypsin and cathepsin G, thereby modulating inflammatory responses and maintaining tissue integrity (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative; Law2006Anoverviewoftheserpinsuperfamily). SERPINA3 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver and lungs, and is involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases (de2023SERPINA3:; DIMBERG2011Expression). The protein's structure, characterized by a conserved serpin fold and a reactive center loop, is essential for its inhibitory function and interaction with target proteases (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative).

## Structure
The SERPINA3 protein, also known as alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, is a member of the serpin superfamily, characterized by a conserved serpin fold crucial for its inhibitory function. The primary structure of SERPINA3 consists of 423 amino acids, with a molecular weight ranging from 55 to 66 kDa due to glycosylation, which is essential for proper folding and secretion (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative). The secondary structure includes three β-sheets and 8-9 α-helices, which are typical features of serpin proteins (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative; Pelissier2008An).

The tertiary structure of SERPINA3 involves a reactive center loop (RCL) near the carboxyl end, which plays a critical role in its function as a protease inhibitor. This loop acts as a 'bait' for target serine proteases, and upon binding, it is inserted into the beta-sheet A, leading to irreversible inactivation of the protease (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative; Pelissier2008An). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are crucial for the protein's stability and activity (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative).

The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein can exist in different conformations, including an inactive δ-conformation due to partial insertion of the RCL (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative).

## Function
SERPINA3, also known as alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a significant role in regulating proteolytic processes in the human body. It primarily inhibits serine proteases such as pancreatic chymotrypsin and leukocyte cathepsin G, which are involved in inflammatory responses (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative; DIMBERG2011Expression). The protein is active in the extracellular matrix, where it contributes to tissue remodeling and protection against protease-mediated damage (Law2006Anoverviewoftheserpinsuperfamily).

SERPINA3 is synthesized by various cell types, including hepatocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and monocytes, and is expressed in organs such as the liver, kidneys, and pancreas (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative; DIMBERG2011Expression). It is regulated by cytokines like IL1, IL6, and oncostatin M, which influence the translocation of transcription factors to the nucleus (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative).

In healthy human cells, SERPINA3's inhibition of proteases helps maintain the balance of proteolytic activity, preventing excessive tissue damage during inflammatory processes. Its role in inhibiting cathepsin G, a protease secreted during inflammation, is particularly crucial in modulating immune responses and maintaining tissue integrity (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative; Li2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SERPINA3 gene are implicated in various diseases. In cancer, increased SERPINA3 expression is associated with poor prognosis in several types, including colon, breast, lung, and gastric cancers. It promotes tumor development by regulating oncogene transcription and enhancing cell proliferation and migration, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (de2023SERPINA3:). In triple-negative breast cancer, SERPINA3 overexpression enhances invasion and migration through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and contributes to chemoresistance (Zhang2021Overexpression). In colorectal cancer, high SERPINA3 levels correlate with poorer survival outcomes, and its silencing reduces cell proliferation and migration (Liu2023Unveiling).

In neurodegenerative diseases, elevated SERPINA3 levels are found in Alzheimer's disease, where it is a component of senile plaques and associated with an earlier onset of symptoms (de2023SERPINA3:). In prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, increased SERPINA3 may contribute to prion formation (de2023SERPINA3:). SERPINA3 is also linked to inflammatory responses in heart failure and viral infections, such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV2, where its levels are associated with disease severity and immune response modulation (de2023SERPINA3:).

## Interactions
SERPINA3, also known as alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, is a serine protease inhibitor that interacts with various enzymes and proteins. It forms stable complexes with proteases such as chymotrypsins, cathepsin G, and mast cell chymase, inhibiting their proteolytic activity and preventing changes in the extracellular matrix (de2023SERPINA3:). SERPINA3 also interacts with DNA, possessing a unique DNA-binding domain that allows it to bind DNA, leading to chromatin condensation and inhibition of DNA polymerase, which affects cell cycle progression (de2023SERPINA3:).

In the context of lung cancer, SERPINA3 overexpression has been shown to modulate the SPOP/NF-κB pathway. It upregulates speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) and inhibits NF-κB, a key factor in cancer progression (Jin2023Overexpression). This interaction suggests a role in suppressing tumor progression by affecting signal transduction and immune response pathways (Jin2023Overexpression).

In neurodegenerative diseases, SERPINA3 is a major component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, where it interacts with β-amyloid (Ab) and activates transcription factors such as PPARγ and NF-κB (de2023SERPINA3:). This interaction indicates its involvement in the regulation of inflammatory responses and plaque formation.
