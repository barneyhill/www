# GBP3

## Overview
GBP3, or guanylate-binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, which is involved in immune responses, particularly in antiviral defense. The protein encoded by GBP3 is an interferon-induced GTPase that plays a crucial role in the cellular response to cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (Tripal2007Unique). Structurally, GBP3 consists of an N-terminal globular GTPase domain and a C-terminal α-helical regulatory domain, which are essential for its function in hydrolyzing GTP to GDP and GMP, processes vital for vesicle trafficking and pathogen defense (Vestal2011The; Nordmann2011A). GBP3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and associated with cellular membranes, where it inhibits viral transcription and replication, particularly against influenza viruses (Nordmann2011A). The protein's activity and localization are influenced by its interactions with other guanylate-binding proteins, highlighting its role in immune response and pathogen defense (Britzen-Laurent2010Intracellular).

## Structure
The human guanylate-binding protein 3 (GBP3) is a member of the guanylate-binding proteins family, characterized by its role in immune response and antiviral activity. GBP3 is composed of an N-terminal globular GTPase domain and a C-terminal α-helical regulatory domain, connected by a short middle domain (Nordmann2011A). The globular domain is responsible for binding and hydrolyzing GTP to GDP and GMP, which is crucial for its antiviral function (Nordmann2011A). 

A notable splice variant of GBP3, known as hGBP-3ΔC, lacks 81 nucleotides of exon 7 and the entire exon 11, resulting in a protein that is 554 amino acids long, compared to the 595 amino acids of the full-length GBP3. This variant also includes an insertion of 103 base pairs from the intron region between exons 10 and 11, translating into 18 unique amino acids (Nordmann2011A). The hGBP-3ΔC variant exhibits enhanced antiviral activity against influenza virus by inhibiting viral transcription and replication (Nordmann2011A).

The GTP-binding capacity of the globular domain is essential for GBP3's antiviral action, and mutational analysis has shown that this domain is more critical for antiviral activity than the C-terminal domain (Nordmann2011A).

## Function
GBP3 (guanylate-binding protein 3) is a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, which is involved in immune responses, particularly in antiviral defense. GBP3 is an interferon-induced protein that plays a role in the cellular response to cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (Tripal2007Unique). It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and associated with cellular membranes, where it participates in hydrolyzing GTP to GDP and GMP, a process crucial for various cellular functions, including vesicle trafficking and pathogen defense (Vestal2011The).

GBP3 contains specific regulatory elements, such as ISRE (Interferon-Stimulated Response Element) and GAS (Gamma-Activated Sequence) elements, which suggest its regulation by interferon signaling pathways (Olszewski2006In). The protein is involved in inhibiting viral transcription and replication, contributing to its antiviral activity, particularly against influenza viruses (Nordmann2011A). The globular domain of GBP3 is essential for its antiviral function, as it binds and hydrolyzes GTP, influencing the protein's catalytic activity and cellular localization (Nordmann2011A). While GBP3's specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in immune response and pathogen defense is well-documented.

## Clinical Significance
Guanylate binding protein 3 (GBP3) has been implicated in various human cancers and immune-related conditions due to alterations in its expression and mutations. In cancer, high GBP3 expression is associated with increased risk in Brain Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC), while it is linked to decreased risk in Sarcoma (SARC) and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) (Jiang2023The). GBP3 expression levels correlate with overall survival rates in these cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Jiang2023The). Specific mutations in GBP3, such as R151Q/* and K380N, have been identified, particularly in cancers like Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC), Glioblastoma (GBM), and Colon Adenocarcinoma (COAD) (Jiang2023The).

In the context of immune response, GBP3 is part of the interferon-stimulated GTPases, which play a role in antiviral defense. A splice variant of GBP3, hGBP-3ΔC, exhibits significant antiviral activity against influenza virus by inhibiting viral transcription and replication (Nordmann2011A). This variant is more effective than other GBP isoforms in reducing viral replication, underscoring GBP3's role in host defense against viral infections (Nordmann2011A). However, the specific mechanisms by which GBP3 mutations contribute to disease remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
GBP3, a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, is known to interact with other proteins, particularly within its family, to influence its localization and function. When expressed alone, GBP3 localizes diffusely in the cytoplasm. However, it can form heterodimers with prenylated GBPs such as GBP-1, GBP-2, and GBP-5. These interactions result in GBP3 localizing to the compartments associated with the prenylated GBPs: with GBP-1 in a vesicle-like compartment, with GBP-2 around the nucleus, and with GBP-5 at the Golgi apparatus. This suggests that GBP3's localization is significantly influenced by its interaction with other GBPs, particularly those that are prenylated (Britzen-Laurent2010Intracellular).

In the context of viral infections, GBP3 and its splice isoform GBP3ΔC have been reported to inhibit the replication of the influenza virus. This inhibition is dependent on their LG domain and GTP-binding activity, although not on GTP hydrolysis. GBP3ΔC, in particular, shows strong anti-influenza activity by reducing viral RNA and protein synthesis through the inhibition of the viral polymerase complex. This indicates that the C terminus of GBP3 may inhibit the antiviral activity of the LG domain (Zhang2021When).
