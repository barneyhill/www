# KCNJ13

## Overview
The KCNJ13 gene encodes the protein potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 13, commonly referred to as Kir7.1. This protein is a transmembrane channel that belongs to the family of inwardly rectifying potassium channels, which are integral to maintaining the ionic balance across cellular membranes. Kir7.1 is characterized by its unique structural features, including two transmembrane domains and a pore-forming loop, which facilitate its function in ion transport. The protein is predominantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and plays a crucial role in retinal health by regulating potassium ion flow, which is essential for photoreceptor function. Mutations in the KCNJ13 gene can lead to significant ocular disorders, such as Leber congenital amaurosis and snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration, underscoring its importance in visual physiology (Hejtmancik2008Mutations; Jiao2022Retinal).

## Structure
The KCNJ13 gene encodes the Kir7.1 protein, a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel family. The primary structure of Kir7.1 includes two transmembrane regions, M1 and M2, and a pore-forming loop known as H5, along with cytosolic NH2 and COOH termini (Sergouniotis2011Recessive). The secondary structure features an alpha-helical integral membrane domain and an intracellular domain primarily composed of beta sheets (Hejtmancik2008Mutations). 

The tertiary structure of Kir7.1 involves the arrangement of these helices around the pore, facilitating its function as a potassium channel. The quaternary structure is characterized by the formation of a homotetramer, which is essential for its function in ion transport (Toms2019Missense). The COOH terminus is crucial for the assembly of functional homotetramers and proper targeting to the apical membrane of epithelial cells (Sergouniotis2011Recessive).

Mutations in KCNJ13, such as R162W, can disrupt the channel's structure and function, leading to conditions like autosomal-dominant snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration (Hejtmancik2008Mutations). These mutations can alter the protein's ion selectivity and stability, impacting its physiological role (Hejtmancik2008Mutations).

## Function
The KCNJ13 gene encodes the Kir7.1 protein, a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium (K+) channel family. This channel is characterized by its low single-channel conductance and low sensitivity to external Ba2+ blockade, and it operates relatively independently of voltage and K+ concentration (Jiao2022Retinal). In healthy human cells, Kir7.1 channels facilitate the efflux of intracellular K+ at physiological membrane potentials and exhibit a large inward K+ current at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. This function is crucial for maintaining potassium and ionic balance across the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is essential for the survival and function of photoreceptors (Jiao2022Retinal).

Kir7.1 is expressed in various tissues, including the apical membrane of the RPE and the choroid, where it is co-expressed with the Na+/K+ pump. The channel is regulated by membrane phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, which is cleaved upon binding of oxytocin by the oxytocin receptor (Jiao2022Retinal). Proper function of Kir7.1 is crucial for the maintenance of photoreceptors in the retina, as evidenced by the degeneration of photoreceptors in Kcnj13 knockout mice (Jiao2022Retinal). Mutations in KCNJ13 can lead to retinal diseases such as Snowflake Vitreoretinal Degeneration (SVD) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), highlighting its importance in retinal health (Jiao2022Retinal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNJ13 gene are associated with two primary ocular disorders: Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration (SVD). LCA is a severe early-onset retinal dystrophy characterized by significant visual impairment or blindness from birth. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and results from a complete loss of channel function. Patients with LCA due to KCNJ13 mutations exhibit symptoms such as sensory nystagmus, amaurotic pupils, and absent electrical signals on an electroretinogram. Retinal features include macular atrophy, pigment deposits, and vessel attenuation (Toms2019Missense; Jiao2022Retinal).

SVD, on the other hand, is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by fibrillar vitreous degeneration, peripheral retinal abnormalities, early-onset cataracts, and corneal guttae. It is often associated with the R162W mutation in the KCNJ13 gene, which affects the resting membrane potential of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) (Hejtmancik2008Mutations; Jiao2022Retinal). This mutation leads to a loss of potassium selectivity and increased permeability to sodium ions, resulting in depolarization and increased cell fragility (Hejtmancik2008Mutations). These conditions highlight the critical role of KCNJ13 in maintaining retinal health.

## Interactions
The KCNJ13 gene encodes the Kir7.1 channel, which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. Kir7.1 interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR). These interactions affect the glycosylation and activity of Kir7.1. Co-expression with β2AR reduces the complex glycosylation of Kir7.1, leading to decreased channel activity without altering its surface expression (Carrington2018G). In contrast, MC4R slightly increases the complex glycosylation of Kir7.1 in some experiments (Carrington2018G).

Kir7.1 also interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a phospholipid crucial for its activity. Mutations at specific residues, such as R162, can disrupt this interaction, leading to channel inactivation and associated retinal diseases (Vera2020Altered). The R162W mutation, for example, abolishes Kir7.1 activity by disrupting the PI(4,5)P2 binding site (Vera2020Altered). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing Kir7.1 function and its role in cellular signaling pathways.
