# AASDH

## Overview
The AASDH gene encodes the enzyme aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, which is integral to the lysine degradation pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydrogenase and is primarily located in the mitochondria, where it facilitates the conversion of aminoadipate semialdehyde to aminoadipate. This reaction is a critical step in the catabolism of lysine, an essential amino acid, contributing to cellular energy production and nitrogen balance. The proper function of the AASDH enzyme is vital for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and supporting various cellular processes. Disruptions in the AASDH gene can lead to metabolic disorders and have been implicated in certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Wang2021CircAASDH).

## Function
AASDH (aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the lysine degradation pathway. It catalyzes the conversion of aminoadipate semialdehyde to aminoadipate, a key step in the metabolic process that breaks down lysine into energy. This enzymatic activity occurs within the mitochondria, where it contributes to cellular energy production and maintains nitrogen balance in healthy human cells. The proper functioning of AASDH is essential for the efficient metabolism of lysine, an important amino acid, which is vital for various cellular processes and overall organismal health. The enzyme's activity ensures that lysine is effectively converted into energy, supporting the energy needs of cells and maintaining metabolic homeostasis. The role of AASDH in these molecular processes highlights its importance in cell biology and its contribution to the organism's metabolic functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AASDH gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, which is caused by disrupted lysine catabolism. This condition results from the impaired function of the AASDH enzyme, which is crucial for the degradation of lysine. Alterations in AASDH expression or function may also impact neurological development and function, potentially leading to other neurological disorders.

In the context of cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), alterations in the expression of circ-AASDH, a circular RNA derived from the AASDH gene, have been implicated in disease progression. Circ-AASDH is significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues and cells compared to normal tissues, and its increased expression is associated with larger tumor size, advanced clinical stage, and poorer overall survival rates in patients (Wang2021CircAASDH). Circ-AASDH functions as a competitive endogenous RNA by sponging miR-140-3p, which affects the expression of E2F7, a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation. This interaction promotes LUAD progression by enhancing cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting apoptosis (Wang2021CircAASDH). Targeting the circ-AASDH/miR-140-3p/E2F7 axis may offer new therapeutic strategies for LUAD (Wang2021CircAASDH).
