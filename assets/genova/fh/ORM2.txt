# ORM2

## Overview
ORM2, or orosomucoid 2, is a gene that encodes the acute-phase protein orosomucoid 2, which is primarily synthesized in the liver. This protein is categorized as an acute-phase reactant and plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and maintaining capillary permeability. ORM2 is involved in sphingolipid metabolism, acting as a negative regulator of sphingolipid synthesis, which is essential for lipid homeostasis and protein quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum (Luo2015Orosomucoid). The protein also contributes to the functional integrity of the blood-brain barrier, influencing the distribution and efficacy of drugs targeting the central nervous system (Luo2015Orosomucoid). ORM2's expression is regulated by cytokines during the acute-phase response, and it interacts with various proteins to modulate sphingolipid metabolism, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological processes (Breslow2010Orm; Luo2015Orosomucoid).

## Function
ORM2 (orosomucoid 2) is an acute-phase protein primarily synthesized in the liver, with significant roles in modulating immune responses and maintaining capillary permeability. It is involved in sphingolipid metabolism, acting as a negative regulator of sphingolipid synthesis, which is crucial for coordinating lipid homeostasis and protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (Luo2015Orosomucoid). ORM2 also plays a role in maintaining the functional integrity of the blood-brain barrier and reinforcing brain endothelial function, which is essential for preventing the transfer of drugs from the blood to the brain, thereby influencing the therapeutic effects of drugs targeting the central nervous system (Luo2015Orosomucoid).

In healthy human cells, ORM2 is involved in the acute-phase response, where its expression is regulated by cytokines such as interleukin-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 (Luo2015Orosomucoid). The protein is active in the bloodstream, where it binds various drugs and hormones, affecting their distribution and availability in the body (Luo2015Orosomucoid). ORM2's role in maintaining capillary barrier function and its involvement in immune homeostasis highlight its importance in physiological processes (Luo2015Orosomucoid).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in ORM2 expression have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ORM2 is significantly upregulated compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with worse overall survival in patients. The elevated levels of ORM2 in TNBC suggest its involvement in cancer cell viability and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Chen2023Quercetin). ORM2 has also been linked to colon cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer (Chen2023Quercetin).

In yeast, ORM2 is part of a conserved family of proteins that regulate sphingolipid homeostasis. Dysregulation of ORM2 can lead to increased sphingolipid synthesis and accumulation of long-chain bases, which are associated with stress sensitivity and impaired protein transport (Han2010Orm1). In humans, ORM2's homolog, ORMDL3, is linked to asthma susceptibility, suggesting that alterations in ORM2 expression or function could be related to conditions involving sphingolipid metabolism, such as asthma (Han2010Orm1).

ORM2's role in the immune system and inflammation, as an acute-phase reactant, further underscores its clinical significance in inflammatory diseases and its potential impact on drug binding and efficacy (Chen2023Quercetin).

## Interactions
ORM2, a member of the Orm family of proteins, is involved in regulating sphingolipid metabolism through its interactions with the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex. In yeast, ORM2 interacts with the SPT complex subunits Lcb1, Lcb2, and Tsc3, forming a regulatory complex that modulates sphingolipid synthesis. This interaction is crucial for ORM2's inhibitory role on SPT activity, which is the first step in sphingolipid biosynthesis (Davis2018OrmORMDL; Körner2024The; Breslow2010Orm).

ORM2 also interacts with Sac1, a phosphoinositide phosphatase, as part of the SPOTS complex, which includes SPT, ORM1/2, Tsc3, and Sac1. This complex is involved in coordinating sphingolipid metabolism and phosphoinositide signaling (Davis2018OrmORMDL; Breslow2010Orm). The interactions of ORM2 with these proteins are maintained even in phospho-mutant forms, indicating that phosphorylation affects the regulation of these interactions rather than their existence (Breslow2010Orm).

In Arabidopsis, ORM2 interacts with the small subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (ssSPT), as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting a conserved role in sphingolipid homeostasis across species (Li2016Orosomucoid).
