# CPXM1

## Overview
CPXM1 is a gene that encodes the protein carboxypeptidase X, M14 family member 1, which is a secreted, collagen-binding glycoprotein involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Although it is categorized within the carboxypeptidase E protein family, CPXM1 lacks enzymatic activity. Instead, it plays a crucial role in adipogenesis, the process of fat cell differentiation, by influencing ECM remodeling and cell adhesion. The protein is upregulated in response to proadipogenic stimuli and is expressed in adipose tissue, with increased expression observed in conditions such as obesity. CPXM1's interactions, including its binding to collagen and interaction with MAPK3, underscore its significance in cellular processes related to adipocyte function and tissue remodeling (Wang2008Protein; Kim2016Identification).

## Function
Carboxypeptidase X, M14 family member 1 (CPXM1) is a protein involved in adipogenesis, the process by which preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes, or fat cells. CPXM1 is a secreted, collagen-binding glycoprotein that plays a significant role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which is crucial for adipocyte differentiation and function (Kim2016Identification). The protein is upregulated in response to proadipogenic stimuli such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 and is involved in the regulation of genes associated with ECM formation and cell adhesion (Kim2016Identification).

CPXM1 is expressed in adipose tissue and its expression is increased in conditions of adipose tissue expansion, such as obesity, suggesting its role in tissue remodeling and expansion (Kim2016Identification). Knockdown of CPXM1 impairs adipogenesis by reducing the expression of key adipogenic markers and proteins, indicating its essential role in the early stages of adipocyte differentiation (Kim2016Identification). Although CPXM1 lacks enzymatic activity, it is part of a subset of carboxypeptidase E proteins that influence ECM remodeling and adipocyte function through collagen binding (Kim2016Identification).

## Clinical Significance
CPXM1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In melanoma, CPXM1 expression is associated with poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy and is linked to worse overall survival. Its expression increases from normal skin to melanoma samples, suggesting a role as a pro-cancer molecule. CPXM1 is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with cancer progression (Tian2022A). In systemic sclerosis (SSc), CPXM1 expression is elevated, indicating its potential role in disease progression and as a biomarker (Yan2021Insulinlike). 

In the context of obesity, CPXM1, also known as CPX-1, is a positive regulator of adipogenesis. Its expression is increased in adipose tissue from obese mice and humans, suggesting involvement in adipose tissue expansion and potentially contributing to obesity-related conditions (Kim2016Identification). 

In breast cancer, CPXM1 is part of an epigenetic marker panel for early diagnosis, where it may act as a tumor suppressor gene, although its function in cancer cells is not well understood (Uehiro2016Circulating). CPXM1 is also noted as a putative tumor suppressor gene in gastric linitis plastica, a type of gastric cancer (Liu2022Comprehensive).

## Interactions
CPXM1, also known as carboxypeptidase X, M14 family member 1, has been identified to interact with MAPK3, a protein involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction was discovered using yeast two-hybrid screening and is considered reliable, with a PRINCESS score of 20.6, indicating a high-confidence interaction (Wang2008Protein).

In the context of adipogenesis, CPXM1, referred to as CPX-1 in some studies, is a secreted collagen-binding glycoprotein that plays a role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Although specific protein-protein interactions beyond MAPK3 are not detailed, CPX-1 is suggested to bind collagen through its discoidin domain (DSD), a known binding module in various proteins. This binding is crucial for its function in adipogenesis, as it influences ECM remodeling, which is essential for adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity (Kim2016Identification).

The studies do not provide specific details on CPXM1's interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond MAPK3 and collagen. Further research is needed to explore additional interactions and their biological significance.
