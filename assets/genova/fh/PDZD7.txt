# PDZD7

## Overview
PDZD7 is a gene that encodes the PDZ domain containing 7 protein, a scaffolding protein characterized by the presence of multiple PDZ domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for the organization and function of the Usher syndrome protein network, particularly in the inner ear and retina. The PDZD7 protein plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of cochlear hair cells and photoreceptor cells, contributing to normal hearing and vision. It is involved in the assembly of multiprotein complexes at the ankle-link region of stereocilia, essential for mechanotransduction in auditory hair cells. Mutations in the PDZD7 gene are associated with auditory and visual disorders, including Usher syndrome type 2 and non-syndromic hearing loss, highlighting its importance in sensory perception (Ebermann2010PDZD7; Delmaghani2022The; Grati2012Localization).

## Structure
The PDZD7 protein is characterized by the presence of multiple PDZ domains, which are crucial for its role in protein interactions. It contains three PDZ domains and a harmonin homology domain (HHD) located between the PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains. The HHD features a unique five-helix fold, with the α1N and α5C regions contributing to the hydrophobic core, which is essential for its stability and function (Lin2021Structure). The PDZ domains, particularly PDZ1 and PDZ2, have C-terminal folded extensions that adopt a compact conformation with a hairpin-mediated interface, similar to the PDZ tandem supramodule in whirlin (ColcombetCazenave2022Deciphering).

PDZD7 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including a 561 amino acid variant due to modifications in splicing at intron 8 and exons 9 and 10 (Ebermann2010PDZD7). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and function.

The PDZD7 protein localizes to the ciliary base and interacts with Usher proteins GPR98 and USH2A, with the PDZ2 domain specifically interacting with the C-terminal intracellular domain of GPR98 (Ebermann2010PDZD7). This interaction is crucial for its role in the molecular mechanisms underlying hearing and vision processes.

## Function
PDZD7 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the organization and function of the USH2 protein complex in cochlear hair cells, which is essential for normal hearing. The protein contains multiple PDZ domains that facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as usherin, ADGRV1, whirlin, harmonin, and MYO7A, which are part of the Usher syndrome protein network. These interactions are crucial for the development, maintenance, and function of stereocilia and synapses in inner ear sensory hair cells (Zou2013Deletion; Du2018Identification).

PDZD7 localizes to the ankle-link region of stereocilia, where it acts as a scaffolding component, contributing to the morphogenesis of stereocilia hair bundles. It binds to the intracellular tails of GPR98 and usherin, suggesting its role in the assembly and scaffolding of the USH2 complex (Grati2012Localization). The protein's presence is required for the proper localization of USH2 proteins at ankle links, which is necessary for the structural integrity of hair bundles and mechanotransduction, a process critical for hearing (Zou2013Deletion).

In addition to its role in the auditory system, PDZD7 is involved in cellular signaling and structural organization, with its harmonin homology domain (HHD) mediating localization to the plasma membrane, which is necessary for its function in healthy cells (Lin2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PDZD7 gene are associated with several auditory and visual disorders, most notably Usher syndrome type 2 and non-syndromic hearing loss. Usher syndrome is characterized by a combination of hearing loss and progressive vision impairment. PDZD7 acts as a modifier gene in Usher syndrome, where its mutations can exacerbate the severity of the condition, particularly when combined with mutations in other Usher syndrome genes such as USH2A and GPR98 (Delmaghani2022The; Grati2012Localization). 

Specific mutations in PDZD7, such as G103R and G228R, disrupt its interaction with ADGRV1, leading to hereditary sensory diseases, including Usher syndrome type 2 and Autosomal Recessive Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss (ARNSHL) (ColcombetCazenave2022Deciphering). These mutations affect the protein's stability and binding affinity, which are crucial for maintaining proper auditory function.

In addition to its role in syndromic conditions, biallelic mutations in PDZD7 can cause non-syndromic recessive sensorineural hearing loss (Delmaghani2022The). Disruption of PDZD7 in animal models, such as zebrafish and mice, results in phenotypes that mimic Usher syndrome, including disorganized stereocilia and hearing loss, underscoring its critical role in auditory function (Zou2013Deletion; Schneider2008Homozygous).

## Interactions
PDZD7 is a scaffolding protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its PDZ domains. It is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes essential for sensory perception, particularly in the inner ear. PDZD7 interacts with ADGRV1, a known binding partner, through its PDZ domains, which bind to the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of ADGRV1. This interaction is crucial for the function of the Usher syndrome protein network, particularly in the stereocilia of hair cells (ColcombetCazenave2022Deciphering; Du2018Identification).

PDZD7 also forms a quaternary protein complex with WHRN (whirlin), USH2A, and GPR98, which is associated with Usher syndrome type 2. This complex is important for the organization and function of hair cell stereocilia. PDZD7 and WHRN heterodimerize and interact with USH2A and GPR98, respectively, facilitating the assembly of this complex (Chen2014Whirlin).

In addition, PDZD7 interacts with MYO7A, a motor protein, and is essential for the localization of protein complexes containing ADGRV1 and USH2A at the ankle links of stereocilia. This interaction suggests a role for PDZD7 in the transport and localization of these complexes within hair cells (Morgan2016PDZD7-MYO7A).
