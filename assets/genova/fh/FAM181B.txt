# FAM181B

## Overview
FAM181B is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 181, specifically member B. This protein is primarily characterized by its interactions with the TEAD family of transcription factors, which are crucial in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and cell growth. Unlike other co-regulators that bind to TEAD, FAM181B lacks the typical α helix structural element, indicating a unique mode of interaction. The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, suggesting a role in nuclear signaling pathways, potentially linked to the Hippo signaling pathway. FAM181B has been implicated in glioma, a type of brain tumor, through genome-wide association studies, highlighting its potential significance in cancer biology. However, the precise biological functions and clinical implications of FAM181B remain to be fully elucidated (Zhao2023Leveraging; EckelPassow2022Inherited; Liberelle2022Toward; Marks2016Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
FAM181B has been implicated in the context of glioma, a type of brain tumor. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified FAM181B as one of the genes associated with an increased risk of developing glioma. However, the specific clinical significance of FAM181B in glioma remains unclear, as detailed information about its role in disease mechanisms or potential as a therapeutic target is not provided (EckelPassow2022Inherited).

In addition to its association with glioma, FAM181B interacts with the TEAD family of transcription factors, which are involved in various diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. The interaction of FAM181B with TEADs occurs at the same C-terminal domain as other coactivators like YAP, TAZ, and VGLLs. This suggests that alterations in FAM181B expression or its interactions with TEADs could potentially influence disease processes, although the exact implications are not fully understood (Liberelle2022Toward).

Overall, while FAM181B is associated with glioma risk and interacts with key transcription factors involved in disease, further research is needed to elucidate its precise role and clinical significance in these conditions.

## Interactions
FAM181B is a protein that has been identified as interacting with the TEAD family of transcription factors. This interaction occurs at the C-terminal domain of TEAD, which is the same region where other coactivators such as YAP, TAZ, and VGLL proteins bind (Liberelle2022Toward). Despite this interaction, FAM181B lacks the α helix structural element that is crucial for binding in other co-regulators, suggesting that its mode of interaction with TEAD may differ from that of YAP and TAZ (Zhao2023Leveraging).

The structural homology of FAM181B includes a region similar to a motif from the Hippo signaling effector YAP1, which is involved in recognition by the DNA-binding protein TEAD4. This suggests a potential link to the Hippo signaling pathway, although direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been fully evaluated (Marks2016Analysis). FAM181B has been shown to localize predominantly to the nucleus in various cell types, but the specific domains responsible for this localization and any associated interactions remain to be clarified (Marks2016Analysis).
