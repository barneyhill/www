# ACOX3

## Overview
ACOX3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA oxidase 3, pristanoyl, which is a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids, such as pristanic acid. This enzyme catalyzes the initial step in the metabolic pathway, converting acyl-CoA substrates into trans-2-enoyl-CoA, which is crucial for lipid metabolism and energy production (Kim2020ACOX3). ACOX3 is one of three acyl-CoA oxidases in humans, alongside ACOX1 and ACOX2, and is specifically involved in the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids (Kim2020ACOX3). The protein is expressed in various tissues and interacts with other proteins located in peroxisomes and mitochondria, suggesting a role in cellular energy metabolism and vascular smooth muscle function (Kim2020ACOX3). Mutations in the ACOX3 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as recurrent spontaneous vasospasm of the internal carotid artery, highlighting its significance in maintaining vascular function (Kim2020ACOX3).

## Function
ACOX3 (acyl-CoA oxidase 3, pristanoyl) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the peroxisomal β-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids, such as pristanic acid. It catalyzes the initial step in this metabolic pathway, converting acyl-CoA substrates into trans-2-enoyl-CoA, which is essential for lipid metabolism and energy production (Kim2020ACOX3). ACOX3 is one of three peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases in humans, alongside ACOX1 and ACOX2, and is specifically involved in the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids (Kim2020ACOX3).

In healthy human cells, ACOX3 is expressed in various tissues and is predicted to interact with proteins primarily located in peroxisomes or mitochondria. These interactions suggest a role in cellular energy metabolism and contractility, potentially affecting vascular smooth muscle function (Kim2020ACOX3). Dysfunctional peroxisomes, due to impaired ACOX3 activity, can lead to the accumulation of longer acyl chain lipids and reactive oxygen species, which may damage mitochondria and affect energy production in muscle cells (Kim2020ACOX3). This enzyme's activity is particularly significant in maintaining the basal myogenic tone of human arterial smooth muscle, which is crucial for proper vascular function (Kim2020ACOX3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACOX3 gene have been implicated in recurrent spontaneous vasospasm of the internal carotid artery (RSV-eICA), a rare cause of ischemic stroke in young adults. The study identified two compound heterozygous missense variants, c.235 T > G (p.F79V) and c.665G > A (p.G222E), in affected individuals. These mutations were found to significantly reduce ACOX3 enzyme activity, leading to a dysfunction in peroxisomal metabolism (Kim2020ACOX3). The p.G222E variant was predicted to be deleterious, while the p.F79V variant was considered benign; however, both were classified as pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines (Kim2020ACOX3).

The dysfunction of ACOX3 is suggested to cause peroxisomal dysfunction, resulting in the accumulation of longer acyl chain lipids and reactive oxygen species. This accumulation can damage mitochondria and contribute to myopathy, affecting vascular smooth muscle function (Kim2020ACOX3). In vitro studies demonstrated that ACOX3 mutations suppress contraction in human aortic smooth muscle cells, potentially leading to a prolonged loss of basal aortic myogenic tone and hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic stimuli, which may cause recurrent vasospasm (Kim2020ACOX3). These findings highlight the potential role of ACOX3 dysfunction in vascular conditions due to its impact on smooth muscle function and peroxisomal activity.

## Interactions
ACOX3, a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids, participates in interactions with proteins primarily located in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Protein-protein interaction analysis using the STRING database has identified that ACOX3 interacts with several peroxisomal proteins, including HSD17B4, EHHADH, CROT, and ACAA1, as well as mitochondrial proteins such as CPT2 and ECH1. These interactions suggest that ACOX3 is involved in broader metabolic processes related to peroxisomal and mitochondrial functions (Kim2020ACOX3).

The study of ACOX3's role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) also highlights its involvement in a network of protein-protein interactions, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Sui2022Altered). Despite the lack of explicit details on direct physical interactions, the involvement of ACOX3 in these networks indicates its potential role in complex cellular processes. The dysfunction of ACOX3, particularly due to mutations such as p.F79V and p.G222E, has been linked to impaired enzymatic activity and effects on smooth muscle contraction, further implicating its role in cellular interactions and metabolic pathways (Kim2020ACOX3).
