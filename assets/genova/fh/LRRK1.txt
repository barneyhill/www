# LRRK1

## Overview
Leucine-rich repeat kinase 1 (LRRK1) is a gene that encodes a multidomain protein belonging to the ROCO family, characterized by its kinase activity. The LRRK1 protein, also known as leucine-rich repeat kinase 1, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including endosomal trafficking and bone development. It is involved in the phosphorylation of target proteins, which influences cellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics. LRRK1 is distinct from its closely related counterpart, LRRK2, in terms of its structural domains and functional roles, particularly in its interactions with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its involvement in osteoclast function. While LRRK1 has been studied for its potential implications in diseases such as Parkinson's disease and bone disorders, its exact clinical significance remains an area of active research (Civiero2012Biochemical; Metcalfe2022Structure; Langston2016The).

## Structure
Leucine-rich repeat kinase 1 (LRRK1) is a multidomain protein that belongs to the ROCO family, characterized by the presence of several distinct domains. The primary structure of LRRK1 includes leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), ankyrin repeats, a Ras-like GTPase domain (ROC), a C-terminal of ROC domain (COR), a serine/threonine kinase domain, and WD40 repeats (Metcalfe2022Structure; Xing2017Role). The LRRK1 protein is composed of 2,015 amino acids, with an estimated molecular weight of 250 kDa (Xing2017Role).

The secondary structure of LRRK1 is predominantly alpha-helical, as indicated by its folding pattern (Civiero2012Biochemical). The tertiary structure, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy, shows an 'O-shaped' monomer with the ROC, COR, kinase, and WD40 domains forming a 'J-shape' (Metcalfe2022Structure). The LRRK1 dimer is formed through the ankyrin repeats, which create the dimerization interface, resulting in an inactive conformation (Metcalfe2022Structure).

LRRK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its regulatory functions. For instance, phosphorylation of residues S1074 and T1075 by protein kinase C (PKC) near the αC helix is known to activate the kinase (Metcalfe2022Structure). The protein's structure and regulatory mechanisms are distinct from those of LRRK2, another member of the ROCO family, highlighting its unique functional roles (Metcalfe2022Structure).

## Function
LRRK1 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 1) is involved in several cellular processes, primarily through its role as a kinase. It phosphorylates target proteins, influencing their activity and thereby regulating various cellular functions. LRRK1 is known to interact with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and this interaction is crucial for its role in endosomal trafficking. Upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, LRRK1 translocates to endosomes, suggesting its involvement in receptor trafficking and signaling pathways mediated by EGFR (Reyniers2014Differential).

In terms of cellular localization, LRRK1 is predominantly cytoplasmic and is involved in processes related to the plasma membrane and early recycling endosomes. It regulates EGFR trafficking through phosphorylation of its substrate CLIP-170, a microtubule plus-end protein, indicating its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane trafficking (Langston2016The).

LRRK1 also plays a significant role in bone development and maintenance. It influences osteoclast function and bone resorption, as evidenced by severe osteopetrosis observed in Lrrk1 knockout mice, highlighting its importance in bone mass regulation (Langston2016The). Despite its structural similarities with LRRK2, LRRK1 has distinct functional roles, particularly in kinase activity and cellular signaling pathways (Civiero2012Biochemical).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRK1 gene has been investigated for its potential role in Parkinson's disease (PD), although no mutations in LRRK1 have been conclusively linked to the disease. Studies have suggested that rare variants in LRRK1 may modify the PD phenotype, but their exact contribution remains unclear (Schulte2013Rare). In a study involving a family with a history of PD, non-synonymous variants in the kinase domain of LRRK1 were found exclusively in PD cases, indicating a potential association, though no single variant was identified as a definitive causal factor (Schulte2013Rare). Despite these findings, the presence of LRRK1 variants in both PD cases and controls suggests that these variants may not be directly causative but could require a specific genetic context to influence disease development (Schulte2013Rare).

In contrast, research on essential tremor (ET) in a Han Chinese population found no significant association between LRRK1 variants and ET, suggesting that these variants do not contribute to ET susceptibility in this cohort (Chen2018Genetic). Overall, while LRRK1 variants have been implicated in modifying disease phenotypes, their clinical significance in PD and other disorders requires further investigation.

## Interactions
LRRK1 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that suggest its role in distinct cellular signaling pathways. It specifically interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), which is unique to LRRK1 and not shared with its closely related counterpart, LRRK2 (Reyniers2014Differential). This interaction is significant for receptor trafficking in endosomes, highlighting LRRK1's role in vesicular physiology (Reyniers2014Differential).

LRRK1 does not interact with 14-3-3 proteins, which are specific to LRRK2, indicating distinct regulatory mechanisms between the two kinases (Reyniers2014Differential). Despite some shared interactors, such as chaperone proteins Hsc70, Hsp90, and BAG proteins, LRRK1 and LRRK2 mediate different cellular processes without evidence of signaling crosstalk (Reyniers2014Differential).

The protein is also involved in the phosphorylation of Rab7, a key player in lysosomal biogenesis and trafficking, further implicating LRRK1 in the regulation of autophagy and mitophagy (Metcalfe2022Structure). These interactions and functions underscore LRRK1's involvement in critical cellular processes and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and bone disorders.
