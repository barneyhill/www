# TIMM21

## Overview
TIMM21 is a gene that encodes the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 21 protein, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial presequence translocase system. This protein is specifically associated with the TIM23 complex, a key player in the import and sorting of nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondria. TIMM21 is involved in modulating the activity of the TIM23 complex, facilitating the transition from matrix translocation to inner membrane insertion, which is essential for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase subunits, a component of the oxidative phosphorylation system (Aiyar2014Mitochondrial). The protein's interactions with other mitochondrial complexes, such as the TOM complex and respiratory chain supercomplexes, highlight its role in maintaining mitochondrial function and bioenergetic capacity (van2006A; Chacinska2005Mitochondrial). The evolutionary conservation of TIMM21 underscores its fundamental importance in cellular energy metabolism across species.

## Function
TIMM21 is a component of the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM) complex, specifically associated with the TIM23 pathway. This complex is essential for the import and sorting of nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondria, a critical process for mitochondrial biogenesis and function. TIMM21 plays a significant role in modulating the activity state of the TIM23 complex, shifting it from matrix translocation towards inner membrane insertion. This modulation is crucial for the assembly of nuclear-encoded subunits into cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), a component of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, which is vital for ATP production and overall mitochondrial function (Aiyar2014Mitochondrial).

In healthy human cells, TIMM21's involvement in the TIM23 complex helps maintain mitochondrial function by ensuring the proper assembly and stability of OXPHOS complexes. This is particularly important under conditions where ATP synthase function is compromised, as TIMM21 can enhance cell survival by improving the bioenergetic capacity of the mitochondria. The evolutionary conservation of TIMM21's function between yeast and humans underscores its fundamental role in cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial health (Aiyar2014Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
TIMM21 is a component of the mitochondrial presequence translocase system, specifically interacting with the TIM23 complex. It plays a role in the formation of the TOM-TIM23-PAM supercomplex by directly interacting with the TOM complex, particularly with Tom22, and facilitating the release of preproteins from the TOM complex to engage with the Tim23 channel (Chacinska2005Mitochondrial). TIMM21 is not a structural component of the Oxa1 TOM complex but functions antagonistically to Tim50 in the preprotein-TOM interaction (Chacinska2005Mitochondrial).

TIMM21 is also involved in the interaction between the TIM23 complex and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It copurifies with subunits of complexes III and IV, suggesting a role in linking the presequence translocase to the respiratory chain (van2006A). The intermembrane-space domain of TIMM21 binds to respiratory-chain supercomplexes, indicating its involvement in membrane-potential-dependent preprotein sorting (van2006A).

TIMM21's interaction with the TIM23 complex is antagonistic to PAM, as increased levels of TIMM21 lead to a shift towards TIM23* complexes, which lack PAM components (Chacinska2005Mitochondrial). This suggests that TIMM21 influences the architecture and function of the TIM23 complex, particularly in the absence of PAM components.
