# CAMP

## Overview
The CAMP gene encodes the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, a crucial component of the innate immune system. This gene is responsible for producing the peptide LL-37, which is the only cathelicidin identified in humans. LL-37 is a cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptide that exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It is primarily expressed in neutrophils, epithelial cells, and certain lymphocytes, and is upregulated in response to infection and inflammation. LL-37 not only disrupts microbial membranes but also plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, promoting wound healing, and acting as a chemoattractant for immune cells. Its interactions with various receptors and proteins underscore its multifaceted role in host defense mechanisms (Yang2000Ll37; Vandamme2012A; Nagaoka2006An).

## Function
The CAMP gene encodes the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by providing antimicrobial defense against a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The primary active form of this peptide in humans is LL-37, which is derived from the precursor protein hCAP18. LL-37 is expressed in various cells, including neutrophils, epithelial cells, and specific lymphocytes, and is upregulated at sites of inflammation and infection (Yang2000Ll37; Nagaoka2006An).

LL-37 exhibits broad antimicrobial activity and is involved in several molecular processes. It binds and neutralizes lipopolysaccharides, acts as a chemoattractant for immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells, and suppresses neutrophil apoptosis by activating specific receptors like formyl-peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) and P2X7 (Yang2000Ll37; Nagaoka2006An). LL-37 also plays a role in wound healing by promoting keratinocyte migration through the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which involves the phosphorylation of signaling molecules like STAT3 (Tokumaru2005Induction).

In the respiratory tract, LL-37 is secreted onto the airway surface, contributing to the antimicrobial defense of the lung epithelia (Bals1998The). The peptide's activity is modulated by factors such as NaCl concentration, which can affect its antimicrobial efficacy (Bals1998The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAMP gene, which encodes the hCAP-18/LL-37 antimicrobial peptide, have been linked to periodontal diseases. A novel missense mutation, p.S34N, resulting from a single base substitution (c.101G>A) in exon 1, has been identified as significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis. This mutation was found to be more prevalent in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis compared to those with chronic periodontitis or healthy controls. Logistic regression analysis indicated that individuals with generalized aggressive periodontitis were 5.32 times more likely to carry the p.S34N mutation. The mutation may contribute to the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis by potentially affecting the expression of hCAP-18/LL-37, which plays a role in oral health by defending against microbial pathogens. This alteration in the host immune response could increase disease severity (Türkoğlu2011A). The study highlights the potential role of genetic factors, such as mutations in the CAMP gene, in determining susceptibility to periodontal diseases, suggesting that genetic screening could be beneficial in identifying individuals at higher risk for developing generalized aggressive periodontitis (Türkoğlu2011A).

## Interactions
The human gene CAMP encodes the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37, which participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. LL-37 is known to form complexes with self-RNA, activating human dendritic cells through Toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8, highlighting its role in immune signaling pathways (Vandamme2012A). It also interacts with U1 dsRNA, forming supramolecular structures that activate Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), which is crucial for immune activation (Kulkarni2021Sequence).

LL-37 binds to the acyl carrier protein (AcpP) in bacteria, a key component in fatty acid synthesis, indicating a novel mechanism of antimicrobial activity beyond membrane disruption (Chung2015Acyl). This interaction is specific to cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptides like LL-37 and SMAP-29, forming stable complexes with AcpP (Chung2015Acyl).

In human cells, LL-37 utilizes the formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) to chemoattract immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells, demonstrating its role in both innate and adaptive immunity (Yang2000Ll37). These interactions underline LL-37's multifaceted role in immune defense, including antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and wound healing activities (Vandamme2012A).
