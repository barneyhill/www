# HDHD3

## Overview
The HDHD3 gene encodes the protein haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain containing 3, which is part of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. This family is characterized by its role in catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphoric acid monoesters, and members often function as hydrolases. The HDHD3 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in tumor suppression, particularly in colorectal cancer, through mechanisms such as DNA methylation (Liu2019DNA). Additionally, genetic studies have explored its variations in relation to other conditions, although definitive associations are yet to be established (Morimoto2018Wholeexome; Locke2015Genomic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The HDHD3 gene has been implicated in the progression of sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) to colorectal cancer (CRC) through DNA methylation changes. Studies have shown that HDHD3 is among the genes with hypermethylated promoters in CRC, leading to decreased expression, which may contribute to tumor progression (Liu2019DNA). This methylation and subsequent gene silencing suggest a potential role for HDHD3 as a tumor suppressor gene in the context of colorectal cancer.

In a separate study focusing on genetic variants related to panic disorder, a one-base deletion in HDHD3 was identified as a potential deleterious mutation. However, this variant did not show a significant association with panic disorder in a case-control group, indicating that while HDHD3 may harbor mutations, its direct link to panic disorder remains unconfirmed (Morimoto2018Wholeexome).

Additionally, genomic studies in mice have identified copy number variations (CNVs) in the Hdhd3 gene, although these studies did not directly associate these variations with specific diseases or conditions (Locke2015Genomic). Overall, while HDHD3 is involved in certain pathological processes, its clinical significance requires further investigation.
