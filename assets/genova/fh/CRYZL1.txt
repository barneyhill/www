# CRYZL1

## Overview
CRYZL1 is a gene that encodes the protein crystallin zeta like 1, which is part of the crystallin family known for their structural roles in the eye lens and potential involvement in other cellular processes. Although the precise function of the CRYZL1 protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is categorized as a non-lens crystallin, suggesting roles beyond the eye, possibly in cellular stress responses or metabolic pathways. The gene is located on chromosome 21, and its expression has been linked to various biological processes and potential clinical implications, including congenital heart defects and neurodevelopmental disorders. Research indicates that CRYZL1 may interact with other genes and proteins, contributing to complex networks associated with conditions such as Down syndrome and Parkinson's disease, although its direct involvement in these diseases is still under investigation (Hu2023Rare; GhaziNader2023Novel; CruzMonteagudo2016Efficient).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
CRYZL1 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, although its direct association with specific diseases is still under investigation. In the context of congenital heart defects, particularly atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD), large segment duplications on chromosome 21, including the CRYZL1 gene, have been identified. These duplications may contribute to phenotypes associated with Down syndrome, such as craniofacial and cardiac maldevelopment, due to the overexpression of genes in this region (Hu2023Rare).

CRYZL1 is also noted for its potential functional connections within a network related to Parkinson's disease (PD). Although it is not directly associated with PD, CRYZL1 has functional connections with important biological processes or genes directly related to the disease (CruzMonteagudo2016Efficient).

In the realm of neurodevelopmental disorders, CRYZL1 has been predicted to have strong associations with the PPP1R21 gene, which is linked to intellectual disability phenotypes such as microcephaly and short stature disorders. This suggests that CRYZL1 may play a role in developmental delay and intellectual disability phenotypes (GhaziNader2023Novel). However, specific mutations or expression changes in CRYZL1 directly causing these conditions have not been conclusively identified.
