# EIF2S1

## Overview
The EIF2S1 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eIF2α), a critical component of the eIF2 complex involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. As a regulatory protein, eIF2α plays a pivotal role in the translation initiation phase by forming a ternary complex with GTP and initiator methionyl-tRNA, facilitating the binding of the ribosome to mRNA. This process is essential for the accurate translation of genetic information into proteins. The activity of eIF2α is tightly regulated through phosphorylation, particularly at serine 51, which modulates its interaction with the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor eIF2B, thereby controlling protein synthesis rates in response to cellular stress conditions. Beyond its role in translation, eIF2α is implicated in broader cellular stress responses, including the activation of transcription factors like NF-kB, and is involved in various signaling pathways that influence cellular metabolism and stress responses (Liu2024Protein; Pang2022ERH; Abbott2004Translation).

## Structure
EIF2S1, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha, is a protein integral to the initiation of protein synthesis. The primary structure of EIF2S1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function within the eIF2 complex. The secondary structure of EIF2S1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure represents the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, crucial for its interaction with other molecular components.

In terms of quaternary structure, EIF2S1 interacts with other subunits within the eIF2 complex, facilitating the recruitment of the initiator tRNA to the ribosome. This interaction is essential for the proper initiation of translation. EIF2S1 contains specific domains, such as the S1 domain, which are critical for its function and interaction with other proteins.

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating the activity of EIF2S1. Phosphorylation can alter the protein's function, impacting the initiation of protein synthesis. These modifications are crucial for the dynamic regulation of EIF2S1 activity in response to cellular conditions.

## Function
The EIF2S1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which is pivotal in the regulation of protein synthesis in healthy human cells. eIF2 is involved in the initiation phase of mRNA translation, where it forms a complex with GTP and initiator methionyl-tRNA, facilitating the binding of the ribosome to mRNA. This process is crucial for the accurate translation of genetic information into proteins (Abbott2004Translation).

A key regulatory mechanism of eIF2 involves the phosphorylation of its alpha subunit at serine 51. This phosphorylation event inhibits the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor eIF2B, preventing the recycling of eIF2 between its GDP and GTP-bound forms, thereby attenuating protein synthesis. This regulation is essential for controlling the rate of protein synthesis in response to various cellular conditions, such as stress (Abbott2004Translation).

The phosphorylation of eIF2α also plays a role in broader cellular stress responses, including the activation of NF-kB, a transcription factor that responds to a range of cellular stresses. This indicates that eIF2α phosphorylation is not only crucial for protein synthesis regulation but also impacts cellular stress responses and metabolic processes like glucose metabolism (Abbott2004Translation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EIF2S1 gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), have significant clinical implications. In the context of vanishing white matter (VWM) disease, mutations in EIF2S1, such as the S51A mutation, impair the integrated stress response (ISR), leading to hypersensitivity to stress and affecting cellular survival under stress conditions. This mutation blocks signaling to the ISR, which is crucial for managing cellular stress, and its effects are particularly pronounced in cells with severe VWM mutations (Sekine2016Paradoxical).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EIF2S1 is part of a five-gene signature identified as a prognostic biomarker. Its expression levels, influenced by methylation and copy number variations, significantly impact cancer progression and patient survival. The gene's role in endoplasmic reticulum stress and protein folding is crucial in the context of HCC (Liu2021Establishment).

In glioma, EIF2S1 is included in a prognostic model based on ferroptosis-related genes. Its expression is associated with clinical features and overall survival, indicating its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in glioma (Yun2022A).

## Interactions
EIF2S1, also known as eIF2α, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular stress responses and translation regulation. EIF2S1 interacts with the p54-S6K2 protein, suggesting a connection between the mTOR/S6K signaling pathway and eIF2α. This interaction is significant in the context of stress granule formation, where EIF2S1 is phosphorylated to decrease global protein synthesis while selectively promoting the translation of specific mRNAs (Pavan2016Different).

In bladder cancer cells, EIF2S1 interacts with the enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH) protein. This interaction is part of the EIF2α-ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway, which affects the expression of downstream molecules like ATF4 and CHOP, potentially influencing cancer development (Pang2022ERH).

EIF2S1 also interacts with protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (PPP1R15A), which regulates its phosphorylation state. PPP1R15A dephosphorylates EIF2S1 at the S51 residue, reversing translational arrest and promoting translation initiation. This interaction is particularly relevant during cuproptosis, a form of cell death induced by copper ions, where PPP1R15A's activity leads to increased translation rates and proteotoxic stress (Liu2024Protein).
