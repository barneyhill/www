# MROH9

## Overview
The MROH9 gene encodes the protein maestro heat-like repeat family member 9, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by the presence of heat-like repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the MROH9 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through such interactions. Although the specific biological functions of the MROH9 protein are not fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several genetic and clinical studies, indicating its potential involvement in diverse physiological and pathological contexts. The gene has been associated with genetic heterogeneity in cancers such as osteosarcoma and head and neck squamous carcinomas, as well as with traits like central corneal thickness and autoinflammatory conditions (Sangiorgi2023Identification; Ye2023Cuproptosisrelated; Xu2018Genetic; Ashraf2015Two; Choquet2020A). Further research is needed to clarify the specific roles and mechanisms of MROH9 in these contexts.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The MROH9 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, although specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations or expression alterations are not fully detailed. In osteosarcoma, MROH9 was identified as one of the genes with mutations in at least two patients, suggesting a role in the genetic heterogeneity of this cancer (Xu2018Genetic). In head and neck squamous carcinomas, a study found that the low-risk group had a higher mutation frequency of MROH9 compared to the high-risk group, indicating a potential association with better prognosis and higher immune cell infiltration (Ye2023Cuproptosisrelated).

MROH9 was also identified as a novel locus associated with central corneal thickness, although specific expression data in ocular tissues was not detailed (Choquet2020A). In the context of autoinflammatory recurrent fevers, MROH9 was mentioned as a variant in one family, but no specific conditions were directly linked to it (Sangiorgi2023Identification). Additionally, MROH9 was part of a chromosomal deletion in a patient with 1q24 deletion syndrome, but the study did not specify conditions directly associated with MROH9 alterations (Ashraf2015Two). Overall, while MROH9 is associated with various genetic studies, its precise clinical significance requires further investigation.
