# POGLUT1

## Overview
Protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 (POGLUT1) is a gene that encodes an enzyme of the same name, which is integral to the post-translational modification of proteins, particularly through the addition of O-linked glucose to serine residues in epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats. This enzyme is categorized as a glucosyltransferase and is crucial for the proper functioning of the Notch signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Mehboob2021Structure; Yu2019Protein). POGLUT1 operates within the endoplasmic reticulum, where it ensures the stability and correct trafficking of EGF-like domains by utilizing uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose as a substrate (Mehboob2021Structure; Li2017Structural). Beyond its role in Notch signaling, POGLUT1 is involved in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, which is significant for muscle cell function and regeneration (ServiánMorilla2020POGLUT1). Mutations in the POGLUT1 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including primary biliary cholangitis, muscular dystrophy, and Dowling-Degos disease, highlighting its importance in human health and disease (Hitomi2019POGLUT1; Basmanav2014Mutations; Servián‐Morilla2016A).

## Structure
POGLUT1 is a protein that functions as a glucosyltransferase, specifically modifying epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats by adding O-linked glucose to serine residues. The protein contains a catalytic CAP10 domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, and a KDEL-like localization signal that facilitates its function in the endoplasmic reticulum (Mehboob2021Structure). 

Structurally, POGLUT1 is characterized by an inverting GT-B fold, which is typical of glycosyltransferases. It has two main domains: an N-terminal domain (residues 1-180) and a C-terminal domain (residues 182-392). These domains form a UDP-Glc substrate-binding pocket crucial for its glucosylation activity (Mehboob2021Structure; Li2017Structural). The enzyme's specificity for serine residues is due to the catalytic base, Asp133, which activates the serine hydroxyl group through an SN2 inversion mechanism (Mehboob2021Structure; Li2017Structural).

POGLUT1 interacts with EGF-like domains through multiple points of contact, involving specific loops and residues that facilitate substrate recognition and binding (Li2017Structural). The enzyme can utilize both UDP-glucose and UDP-xylose as substrates, allowing it to perform both O-glucosylation and O-xylosylation (Li2017Structural). The presence of specific motifs, such as the WXGG and DXD-like motifs, is critical for its function and substrate modification (Mehboob2021Structure).

## Function
POGLUT1, or protein O-glucosyltransferase 1, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats in proteins, particularly through the addition of O-linked glucose to serine residues. This modification is essential for the proper functioning of the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis in healthy human cells (Mehboob2021Structure; Yu2019Protein). POGLUT1 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it uses uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose as a substrate to glucosylate properly folded EGF-like domains, ensuring their stability and proper trafficking to the cell surface (Mehboob2021Structure; Li2017Structural).

In addition to its role in Notch signaling, POGLUT1 is involved in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, which is important for muscle cell function and regeneration (ServiánMorilla2020POGLUT1). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal Notch signaling, which affects satellite cell maintenance and muscle regeneration, highlighting its importance in muscle development and repair (Mehboob2021Structure; Servián‐Morilla2016A). POGLUT1's function extends to regulating cellular processes through pathways like transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), influencing cell proliferation in a cell type-dependent manner (Mehboob2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POGLUT1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. One notable condition is primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), where the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2293370 on chromosome 3q13.33 is linked to increased susceptibility. The C allele of this SNP enhances POGLUT1 expression by binding with the transcription factor RUNX1, potentially leading to excessive Notch signaling. This dysregulation may result in inappropriate immune responses and bile duct loss, characteristic of PBC (Hitomi2019POGLUT1).

POGLUT1 mutations also cause a form of muscular dystrophy. The D233E mutation, located in the CAP10 domain, significantly reduces the enzyme's activity, leading to decreased Notch signaling and satellite cell loss. This mutation impairs myogenesis, contributing to muscle weakness and degeneration (Servián‐Morilla2016A).

Additionally, POGLUT1 mutations are implicated in Dowling-Degos disease (DDD), an autosomal-dominant skin disorder characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation. Mutations such as c.11G>A (p.Trp4*), c.652C>T (p.Arg218*), and c.798-2A>C disrupt the Notch signaling pathway, affecting pigmentation and keratinocyte morphology (Basmanav2014Mutations). These findings underscore the critical role of POGLUT1 in various pathologies through its influence on the Notch signaling pathway.

## Interactions
Protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 (POGLUT1) is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role in the post-translational modification of epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) domains. POGLUT1 interacts with the Notch receptor, facilitating its proper conformation for cleavage by metalloproteases and presenilin, which is essential for Notch signaling. This interaction is crucial for the activation of NOTCH1, as POGLUT1's activity influences the levels of the active form of NOTCH1, known as the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (Ramkumar2015Protein).

POGLUT1 also interacts with the apical transmembrane protein CRUMBS2, modifying it by adding a glucose-xylose-xylose trisaccharide to its EGF repeats. This modification is necessary for CRUMBS2's localization to the apical membrane, and in its absence, CRUMBS2 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (Ramkumar2015Protein).

Structurally, POGLUT1 interacts with EGF-like domains through specific loops and residues, requiring these domains to be properly folded for glucosylation and xylosylation. The enzyme's specificity is due to shape complementarity and interactions with the C1C2 and C2C3 loops of the EGF-like domains (Mehboob2021Structure; Li2017Structural).
