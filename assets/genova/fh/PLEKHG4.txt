# PLEKHG4

## Overview
PLEKHG4 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and RhoGEF domain containing G4, which is a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This protein is characterized by the presence of a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are essential for its role in modulating Rho family GTPases, such as Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac1 (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B; Reinhard2019Identification). The DH domain facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho GTPases, while the PH domain is involved in membrane localization and potentially modulating the DH domain's activity (Reinhard2019Selectivity). PLEKHG4 plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly in actin cytoskeletal remodeling and cell-cell junction formation, which are crucial for maintaining cellular morphology and integrity (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as annexin A2 and RhoA-targeting GEFs, underscore its importance in processes like cell adhesion and migration, contributing to vascular homeostasis and epithelial junction integrity (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B).

## Structure
PLEKHG4, also known as puratrophin-1, is a protein that contains a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, classifying it as a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (Reinhard2019Identification). These domains are crucial for its role in modulating Rho family GTPases, including Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac1 (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B). The DH domain is primarily responsible for the catalytic activity of the protein, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho GTPases, while the PH domain is involved in membrane localization and possibly in modulating the activity of the DH domain (Reinhard2019Selectivity).

The molecular structure of PLEKHG4 is illustrated using the SMART database, which provides a schematic overview of its domain organization (Reinhard2019Identification). Unlike PLEKHG4B, PLEKHG4 lacks the N-terminal Solo domain but shares other structural features such as spectrin repeats in the medial region and a C-terminal DH-PH domain (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various cellular components, influencing processes like cell adhesion and migration, which are vital for maintaining vascular homeostasis and endothelial barrier function (Reinhard2019Identification).

## Function
PLEKHG4 is a gene encoding a protein involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly in actin cytoskeletal remodeling and cell-cell junction formation. The protein contains pleckstrin homology and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) domains, which facilitate interactions with phosphoinositides and activate Rho family GTPases, such as Cdc42. This activation is crucial for cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and cellular morphology (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4).

In epithelial cells, PLEKHG4B, a protein encoded by PLEKHG4, plays a significant role in the maturation of cell-cell junctions by promoting the transition from open to closed junctions with packed actin bundles. It is involved in the regulation of myosin activity, which is essential for junction maturation (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B). PLEKHG4B also interacts with RhoA-targeting GEFs, such as LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF, affecting the RhoA-ROCK pathway and thus influencing junctional integrity (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B).

The protein is localized to cell-cell adhesions and is necessary for the proper organization of actin filaments and β-catenin, contributing to the stability and integrity of epithelial junctions (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B). PLEKHG4B's interaction with ANXA2 is crucial for its localization to cell-cell adhesions, further supporting its role in maintaining epithelial junction integrity (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLEKHG4 gene have been investigated for their potential role in neurological disorders, particularly cerebellar ataxias. A specific single-nucleotide substitution, c.À16C>T, in the 5' untranslated region of PLEKHG4 was previously linked to autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) in Japanese families. This mutation was associated with decreased mRNA expression and the formation of protein aggregates in Purkinje cells, which are critical for motor coordination (Wieczorek2006Mutations). However, a study screening 537 unrelated European patients with cerebellar ataxia found no carriers of the c.À16T allele, suggesting that this mutation is not a common cause of cerebellar ataxia in the European population (Wieczorek2006Mutations).

In another study, a nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant (SNV) in PLEKHG4, c.3476C>T, resulting in an amino acid change p.S1159L, was identified in the context of spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 (SCA4). This variant is classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), indicating that its pathogenic role is not yet clear (Kim2020Clarification). These findings highlight the genetic diversity and complexity of cerebellar ataxias and the need for further research to clarify the clinical significance of PLEKHG4 mutations.

## Interactions
PLEKHG4 interacts with various proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling. It is known to interact with annexin A2 (ANXA2), a phospholipid- and actin-binding protein. This interaction is crucial for the localization of PLEKHG4B to cell-cell junctions, as ANXA2 acts as a scaffold for actin dynamics at these sites. The interaction between PLEKHG4B and ANXA2 was confirmed through co-precipitation assays, which demonstrated that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of ANXA2 are necessary for full binding activity (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B).

PLEKHG4B also interacts with RhoA-targeting guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF. These interactions are significant in the context of actin cytoskeletal remodeling during epithelial cell-cell junction formation. PLEKHG4B suppresses the activation of these GEFs, thereby decreasing myosin activity and facilitating junction maturation through the RhoA-ROCK pathway (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B).

These interactions highlight PLEKHG4's role in modulating actin dynamics and cell adhesion processes, which are essential for maintaining epithelial integrity and function.
