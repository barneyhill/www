# SCNN1G

## Overview
The SCNN1G gene encodes the gamma subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a critical component in the regulation of sodium ion transport across epithelial cells. This gene is integral to the formation of a heterotrimeric channel, which includes alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, with the gamma subunit playing a pivotal role in channel function and regulation (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; LemmensGruber2023The). The protein encoded by SCNN1G is a transmembrane protein that is predominantly expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in tissues such as the kidney, lung, and colon. It is essential for sodium reabsorption, thereby contributing to fluid balance, blood pressure regulation, and electrolyte homeostasis (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; LemmensGruber2023The). The gamma subunit is involved in the proteolytic activation of ENaC, a process necessary for maintaining sodium balance, and contains domains that influence the channel's gating and activity (LemmensGruber2023The). Mutations in SCNN1G are linked to disorders such as Liddle syndrome and pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal physiological function (Kozina2019Liddle; Hanukoglu2016Epithelial).

## Structure
The SCNN1G gene encodes the gamma subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is essential for sodium transport across epithelial cells. The primary structure of the gamma subunit consists of 649 amino acids with a molecular mass of 74,270 Daltons (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial). The secondary structure includes two transmembrane segments, TM1 and TM2, and a large extracellular domain that comprises about 70% of the amino acid sequence (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial).

The tertiary structure of the gamma subunit features a conserved palm domain and a TM2 region, which are crucial for channel function, including the channel gate, amiloride binding site, and selectivity filter (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the gamma subunit with the alpha and beta subunits to form a functional heterotrimeric channel (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; Hanukoglu2023Epithelial).

Post-translational modifications of the gamma subunit include palmitoylation at the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, which stabilizes the open state of the channel (LemmensGruber2023The). The gamma subunit also contains conserved serine protease cleavage sites in its extracellular segment, which are important for ENaC activation (Hanukoglu2023Epithelial).

## Function
The SCNN1G gene encodes the gamma subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is essential for sodium ion transport across epithelial cells. ENaC is a heterotrimeric channel composed of α, β, and γ subunits, with the γ subunit playing a critical role in the channel's function and regulation (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; LemmensGruber2023The). This channel is primarily active in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in tissues such as the kidney, lung, and colon, where it facilitates sodium reabsorption, contributing to fluid balance, blood pressure regulation, and electrolyte homeostasis (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; LemmensGruber2023The).

The γ subunit is involved in the proteolytic activation of ENaC, a process necessary for maintaining sodium balance. Proteases like furin cleave the γ subunit, releasing inhibitory tracts and activating the channel (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; LemmensGruber2023The). The γ subunit also contains GRIP domains that influence the channel's gating and activity (LemmensGruber2023The). Additionally, the γ subunit's extracellular loop is involved in the channel's self-inhibition response to high extracellular sodium concentrations, a mechanism that allows cells to adjust sodium influx (LemmensGruber2023The). These molecular processes underscore the importance of SCNN1G in maintaining sodium homeostasis and normal physiological function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCNN1G gene, which encodes the gamma subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), are associated with several inherited diseases. One such condition is Liddle syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. This syndrome results from mutations that lead to increased sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, often due to alterations in the Proline-Tyrosine (PY) motif, which is crucial for ENaC regulation (Kozina2019Liddle; Zhang2022Pathogenicity). 

Another condition linked to SCNN1G mutations is pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1B), an autosomal recessive disorder marked by salt wasting, hyperkalemia, and aldosterone resistance. This condition is caused by mutations that impair sodium transport across epithelial tissues, affecting fluid balance in organs such as the kidney and respiratory tract (Yin2019A; Hanukoglu2016Epithelial).

Mutations in SCNN1G can also lead to nephropathy, as seen in a study where a specific deletion in the gene was associated with kidney damage and metabolic disturbances in an infant patient (Yin2019A). These mutations can exacerbate renal damage by promoting inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis (Yin2019A).
