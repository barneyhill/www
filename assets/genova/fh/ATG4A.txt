# ATG4A

## Overview
ATG4A is a gene that encodes the protein autophagy related 4A cysteine peptidase, which is a crucial component of the autophagy pathway, a cellular process responsible for degrading and recycling cellular components. The protein is categorized as a cysteine protease and is involved in the processing of LC3B2 family proteins, facilitating their conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine on autophagosomal membranes, a step essential for autophagosome formation and maturation (Hait2020Defects). ATG4A operates primarily in the cytoplasm, where it regulates autophagic flux, contributing to cellular homeostasis and defense mechanisms, including antiviral responses (Hait2020Defects). Mutations in ATG4A have been linked to various diseases, including certain cancers and immunodeficiencies, underscoring its clinical significance (Hait2020Defects; Wolf2013A).

## Function
The ATG4A gene encodes a cysteine protease that plays a crucial role in the autophagy process, a cellular degradation pathway essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, ATG4A is involved in the cleavage of the C-terminal amino acid of LC3B2 family proteins, a necessary step for their conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on autophagosomal membranes. This conjugation is vital for the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, which are responsible for sequestering and degrading cellular debris and pathogens (Hait2020Defects).

ATG4A is active in the cytoplasm, where it regulates autophagic flux, contributing to cellular quality control and survival. The protein's activity is essential for the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, a key step in autophagy that facilitates the elongation and closure of autophagosomes (Hait2020Defects). This process is critical for cellular responses to stress and nutrient availability, impacting cellular health and defense mechanisms, including antiviral immunity (Hait2020Defects). Defects in ATG4A can impair autophagy induction, leading to increased viral load and cell death, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and defense against infections (Hait2020Defects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATG4A gene have been implicated in several diseases, highlighting its clinical significance. In the context of recurrent lymphocytic meningitis caused by HSV2, rare genetic variants in ATG4A have been identified in patients with Mollaret's meningitis. These variants lead to impaired autophagy induction, resulting in increased viral load and cell death, suggesting that defects in autophagy due to ATG4A mutations may represent a novel class of primary immunodeficiencies (Hait2020Defects).

In cancer, ATG4A plays a role in maintaining cancer stem-cell properties in breast cancer. Alterations in ATG4A expression influence the levels of CD24/EpCAM, affecting the cancer stem-cell sub-population. Overexpression of ATG4A is associated with increased tumorigenicity and aggressive tumor characteristics, as seen in breast cancer models where it accelerates tumor formation and leads to extensive necrosis and inflammation (Wolf2013A).

Additionally, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATG4A have been linked to cervical cancer risk. Certain SNPs are associated with either increased or decreased risk of cervical cancer, and their interaction with HPV infection suggests a potential role in influencing susceptibility to cervical cancer (Mao2017Nucleotide).

## Interactions
ATG4A is involved in various interactions with proteins that are crucial for its role in autophagy. It interacts with LC3 and GABARAP proteins through its COOH-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is essential for its delipidation activity. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation of adjacent serine or threonine residues, affecting its efficiency in substrate capture (Nguyen2020The). ATG4A also interacts with proteins such as ARFIP2, TBC1D5, PIK3C3 (Vps34), WDR11, FYCO1, and NBR1, indicating its involvement in vesicle transport and autophagy-related processes (Nguyen2020Atg4).

The proximity interaction networks of ATG4A, mapped using an APEX2-based proximity biotinylation system, identified 124 unique proteins biotinylated by ATG4A. These interactions suggest ATG4A's role in pathways related to autophagy, endosomal and vesicle transport, and protein transport (Nguyen2020Atg4). Despite its interactions, ATG4A alone is insufficient to support full autophagic processes, likely due to inefficient priming and failure to incorporate proteins into mature autophagosomes (Nguyen2020The). The structural differences between ATG4A and other homologues, such as Atg4B, affect its interaction with substrates like LC3B, influencing its catalytic efficiency (Li2011Kinetics).
