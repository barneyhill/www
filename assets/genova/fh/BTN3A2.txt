# BTN3A2

## Overview
BTN3A2 is a gene that encodes the protein butyrophilin subfamily 3 member A2, which is part of the butyrophilin family within the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein and plays a crucial role in immune regulation, particularly in the modulation of T cell activity. BTN3A2 is expressed on various immune cells and is involved in the activation and modulation of gamma delta T cells, which are essential for immune surveillance and response. The protein structure of BTN3A2 includes two extracellular domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region, but it notably lacks the intracellular B30.2 domain found in other BTN3A proteins, which is important for phosphoantigen binding (Karunakaran2023A; Afrache2017Evolutionary). BTN3A2's interactions with other proteins, such as BTN3A1 and BTN3A3, are vital for its function in immune cell activation and regulation, highlighting its significance in both health and disease contexts, including cancer and neurological disorders (Cano2021BTN2A1; Wu2019Identification).

## Structure
BTN3A2 is a member of the butyrophilin family, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein structure of BTN3A2 includes two extracellular domains, an IgV-like domain and an IgC-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region. Unlike BTN3A1 and BTN3A3, BTN3A2 lacks the intracellular B30.2 domain, which is crucial for phosphoantigen binding in other BTN3A proteins (Karunakaran2023A; Afrache2017Evolutionary).

The IgV domain of BTN3A2 is highly conserved and identical to that of BTN3A1, while BTN3A3 differs by a single conservative substitution (Karunakaran2023A). The conservation of the IgV domain suggests active homogenization among BTN3A family members (Afrache2017Evolutionary). BTN3A2 forms more stable heterodimers with BTN3A1 due to favorable electrostatic interactions in the juxtamembrane region, which contribute to its structural stability (Karunakaran2023A).

BTN3A2 is expressed on various cell types, including immune cells, and is involved in T cell proliferation and cytokine production. It may require co-expression with other BTN3A molecules for optimal function (de2019Analysis). The protein is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms (de2019Analysis).

## Function
BTN3A2, a member of the butyrophilin family, plays a significant role in immune regulation and modulation. It is involved in the activation and modulation of T cells, particularly influencing gamma delta T cells, which are crucial for immune surveillance and response (Lin2022BTN3A2; Le2012BTN3A2). BTN3A2 is expressed on the surface of various immune cells, including endothelial cells and some tumor cell lines, where it acts as an immune checkpoint modulator (Le2012BTN3A2). This expression pattern suggests its involvement in maintaining immune homeostasis and self-tolerance in healthy tissues (Lin2022BTN3A2).

In healthy human cells, BTN3A2 is upregulated, which contrasts with its downregulation in certain cancers like lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (Lin2022BTN3A2). The gene's expression is regulated by stress and may prevent T-cell recognition, contributing to immune escape mechanisms (Lin2022BTN3A2). BTN3A2's role in immune cell activity is further supported by its high expression in cells with elevated CD3 expression, indicating its involvement in modulating immune responses (Lin2022BTN3A2). Despite its established role in cancer, the specific functions of BTN3A2 in non-cancerous contexts remain less clear and warrant further investigation (Le2012BTN3A2).

## Clinical Significance
The BTN3A2 gene has significant clinical implications due to its role in immune regulation and its expression patterns in various diseases. In cancer, BTN3A2 is highly expressed in certain tumors, such as acute myeloid leukemia and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis. Its overexpression is linked to increased proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells, suggesting a role in immune escape mechanisms (Blazquez2018New). In contrast, high BTN3A2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma is associated with a favorable prognosis, likely due to enhanced immune cell infiltration, including T cells and B cells, which are linked to better clinical outcomes (Lin2022BTN3A2).

In schizophrenia, BTN3A2 is identified as a risk gene, with its expression significantly higher in patients compared to controls. This upregulation is associated with the risk allele G of rs1979 and is linked to altered synaptic transmission, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Wu2019Identification). BTN3A2's interaction with presynaptic neurexins may regulate glutamate release, affecting the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain (Wu2019Identification). These findings highlight BTN3A2's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in both cancer and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
BTN3A2, a member of the butyrophilin family, participates in several interactions that are crucial for immune regulation. BTN3A2 forms noncovalently linked homodimers in solution, with a molecular weight of approximately 46-48 kDa, similar to its isoforms BTN3A1 and BTN3A3 (Palakodeti2012The). These dimers can bind two single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of specific antibodies, indicating that each BTN3A monomer has one antibody epitope (Palakodeti2012The). BTN3A2 interacts with BTN3A1 and BTN3A3, and these interactions are essential for the plasma membrane export of BTN3A2 and BTN3A3, which in turn regulate BTN3A1 trafficking, facilitating Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation (Cano2021BTN2A1).

BTN3A2 also interacts with BTN2A1, which enhances the plasma membrane exposure of BTN3A2 and BTN3A3. This interaction is crucial for the cytotoxic response of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells against cancer cells (Cano2021BTN2A1). The BTN3A2 isoform, along with BTN3A1 and BTN3A3, is involved in the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, playing a role in immune regulation as part of the B7 superfamily (Palakodeti2012The). These interactions highlight BTN3A2's role in modulating immune responses through its involvement in multiprotein complexes and its interactions with other proteins.
