# CPLANE1

## Overview
CPLANE1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as ciliogenesis and planar polarity effector complex subunit 1, which is integral to the function and structure of cilia in human cells. This protein is categorized as a component of the ciliary transition zone, where it plays a pivotal role in mediating the recruitment of intraflagellar transport proteins, essential for processes such as cell polarity, migration, and ciliogenesis (Wang2023Novel). The CPLANE1 protein is involved in the assembly of the cilia transition zone complex and is crucial for neurodevelopment, particularly in the pathfinding of commissural axons and neural circuit formation (Wang2023Novel). Mutations in the CPLANE1 gene are linked to ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome and Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome type VI, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental disorders (Bonnard2018Novel; Wang2023Novel).

## Function
The CPLANE1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ciliary function and cellular processes. In healthy human cells, the CPLANE1 protein localizes to the ciliary transition zone, where it mediates the recruitment of peripheral IFT-A proteins to basal bodies, essential for cell polarity, migration, and ciliogenesis (Wang2023Novel). This protein is necessary for the assembly of the cilia transition zone complex, which is critical for proper ciliary function. CPLANE1 is also involved in the pathfinding of commissural axons and neural circuit formation, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopment (Wang2023Novel).

CPLANE1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, eye, kidneys, and connective tissues, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes (Fang2024Exome). The protein interacts with the NPHP3 protein, forming a complex that acts as a bridge between cilia and the extracellular matrix, suggesting a role in maintaining cilia structure and function (Fang2024Exome). Additionally, CPLANE1 is involved in cell-cycle-dependent proteolysis, regulating its localization to the mitotic kinetochore, which is crucial for normal cellular processes and development (Wang2023Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CPLANE1 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, most notably Joubert syndrome (JS) and Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome type VI (OFD6). Joubert syndrome is characterized by neurological abnormalities, including the molar tooth sign, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and agenesis, as well as symptoms like oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, and polydactyly (Liu2021Molecular; Wang2023Novel). CPLANE1 mutations in JS often result in compound heterozygous variants that lead to a loss of function, affecting ciliary protein encoding and disrupting ciliary functions (Wang2023Novel). 

OFD6, also known as Varadi Syndrome, is linked to CPLANE1 mutations and is characterized by cerebellar defects, metacarpal abnormalities, and central polydactyly. The severity of phenotypes in OFD6 can range from mild to severe, depending on the specific mutations and their combinations (Bonnard2018Novel). 

CPLANE1 mutations can also lead to other developmental issues, such as defective radial migration of postmitotic cells, contributing to the diverse clinical manifestations observed in these syndromes (Wang2023Novel). The gene's involvement in ciliogenesis and planar cell polarity underscores its critical role in maintaining normal cellular signaling pathways, with alterations potentially leading to various developmental disorders (Fang2024Exome).

## Interactions
CPLANE1, also known as C5orf42, is a crucial component of the ciliary transition zone, where it plays a significant role in mediating interactions with other proteins essential for ciliary function. It is involved in the recruitment of peripheral IFT-A proteins to basal bodies, which are vital for cell polarity, migration, and ciliogenesis (Wang2023Novel). The protein encoded by CPLANE1 is part of the CPLANE complex, which includes other genes such as Gabpa and Dzip1l, and is implicated in the regulation of planar cell polarity and ciliogenesis (Chee2023Genomewide).

CPLANE1 interacts with components of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, which is crucial for the assembly and maintenance of cilia. These interactions facilitate the proper functioning of cilia, impacting various cellular signaling pathways, including the hedgehog and WNT pathways (Chee2023Genomewide). The protein's involvement in ciliogenesis suggests potential interactions with other components of the ciliary machinery, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context (Moll2020Genetic; Rasheed2021Exome).
