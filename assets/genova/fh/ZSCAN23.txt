# ZSCAN23

## Overview
ZSCAN23 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 23, which is part of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are involved in DNA binding and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation. The SCAN domain is a protein-protein interaction domain that facilitates the formation of protein complexes, potentially influencing various cellular processes. ZSCAN23 has been implicated in several biological functions and disease contexts, including cancer and neurological disorders, due to its regulatory roles in gene expression and its involvement in epigenetic modifications (Karadag2023Identification; Park2024Genetic; Zhong2021Prognostic).

## Clinical Significance
ZSCAN23 has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression and methylation patterns. In breast cancer, ZSCAN23 is identified as a methylation-driven gene that is hypermethylated and lowly expressed in tumor samples. This hypermethylation is associated with lower survival rates in patients, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker. A prognostic nomogram incorporating ZSCAN23 has been developed to predict overall survival in breast cancer patients, highlighting its clinical significance in this context (Zhong2021Prognostic).

In the context of longevity, ZSCAN23 has been associated with increased expression in pancreatic tissue, particularly in minor allele carriers. This association suggests a potential link between ZSCAN23 and pancreatic cancer, although its exact role remains unclear and requires further research (Park2024Genetic).

ZSCAN23 has also been identified as a novel risk locus for epilepsy, indicating its potential involvement in the genetic basis of epilepsy and its overlap with psychiatric disorders (Karadag2023Identification). Despite these associations, ZSCAN23 does not show signs of balancing selection in autoimmune diseases, suggesting its variants are likely evolving neutrally in this context (Cagliani2011Balancing).
