# PPP4R3C

## Overview
PPP4R3C is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 3C, a regulatory component of the serine/threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase 4 (PP4). This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, apoptosis, and immune response regulation. Notably, PPP4R3C is involved in the homologous recombination repair pathway by facilitating the dephosphorylation of RPA2, which is essential for RAD51 recruitment during DNA double-strand break repair (Kadri2022High). The gene is predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a specialized function in male reproductive biology, and is considered a potential target for male contraceptive development due to its specific expression pattern (Robertson2020Largescale). Additionally, PPP4R3C has been implicated in immune response regulation in dairy cattle and is associated with traits linked to udder health (Sanchez2023Xlinked). Its involvement in diverse biological pathways underscores its significance in both cellular and organismal health.

## Function
PPP4R3C is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway, specifically in homologous recombination repair. PPP4R3C facilitates the dephosphorylation of RPA2, which is crucial for the recruitment of RAD51 to chromatin, a key step in the repair process (Kadri2022High). This function underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability.

PPP4R3C is preferentially expressed in the testis and is classified as a male reproductive tract-specific gene in cattle, humans, and mice. Its expression pattern suggests a role in male-specific reproductive traits, although no obvious candidate coding variant has been identified in association with PPP4R3C (Kadri2022High). The gene is also part of a list of genes encoding proteins of unknown drug target type, indicating potential for future research in drug development (Robertson2020Largescale).

In terms of cellular localization, PPP4R3C is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it modulates PP4 activity, influencing processes such as apoptosis and immune responses. Its involvement in these pathways highlights its broader role in cell biology and organismal health.

## Interactions
PPP4R3C, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and specificity. In the context of reproductive biology, PPP4R3C has been identified as a potential target for male contraceptive drugs due to its expression in the male reproductive tract. This specificity is crucial for minimizing off-target effects, as PPP4R3C has ubiquitously expressed paralogs with 50-60% protein sequence similarity, necessitating careful consideration in drug targeting to avoid unintended interactions (Robertson2020Largescale).

In dairy cattle, PPP4R3C is associated with quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to udder health, specifically somatic cell score (SCS), which is an indicator of immune response and mammary infection resistance. This suggests a role for PPP4R3C in regulating immune-related processes through its interactions with other proteins involved in these pathways (Sanchez2023Xlinked).

In the context of epilepsy research, PPP4R3C was found to be downregulated in a study investigating the reversal of drug resistance. This downregulation was observed in the presence of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) combined with carbamazepine, indicating a potential interaction with pathways involved in drug resistance modulation (Xia2023Study).
