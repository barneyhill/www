# DOCK1

## Overview
DOCK1, or dedicator of cytokinesis 1, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), specifically targeting the small GTPase Rac1. The DOCK1 protein is integral to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating processes such as cell migration, invasion, and adhesion, which are essential for various physiological and pathological contexts (Benson2021The). It is expressed in a wide range of tissues, with significant roles in endothelial cells and extravillous trophoblasts, where it influences vascular development and placental function, respectively (Benson2021The; Xu2023DOCK1). The protein's interaction with ELMO proteins and its involvement in signaling pathways like DUSP4-ERK underscore its importance in cellular dynamics and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (Veyssiere2024MYLK*FLNB; Xu2023DOCK1).

## Structure


## Function
DOCK1, also known as dedicator of cytokinesis 1, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes by activating the small GTPase Rac1. This activation is crucial for actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which is necessary for cell migration, invasion, and adhesion (Benson2021The). DOCK1 is widely expressed across different tissues, with notable expression in endothelial cells, where it facilitates cell migration and actin reorganization, essential for directional cell movement and vascular development (Benson2021The).

In the context of pregnancy, DOCK1 is vital for the function of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), which are critical for placental development and successful pregnancy outcomes. It regulates EVT proliferation, migration, and invasion, processes that are essential for placental fixation and immune protection (Xu2023DOCK1). DOCK1 also modulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in trophoblasts, enhancing their motility and invasiveness (Xu2023DOCK1).

At the molecular level, DOCK1 interacts with ELMO proteins to facilitate Rac1 activation, which is necessary for its GEF activity (Benson2021The). It also plays a role in the regulation of the DUSP4-ERK signaling pathway, influencing cell migration and invasion through posttranslational modifications (Xu2023DOCK1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DOCK1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In claudin-low triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), DOCK1 is a critical regulator of cancer metastasis. Its high expression levels are strongly correlated with poor survival rates in TNBC patients. The gene mediates growth and motility by down-regulating claudin-1 expression through the RRP1B-DNMT-claudin-1 pathway. Interference with DOCK1 expression leads to the re-expression of claudin-1, which inhibits cell viability and motility, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for TNBC treatment (Chiang2019DOCK1).

In addition to breast cancer, DOCK1 is implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through its interaction with the LAMA2 gene. This interaction is associated with the focal adhesion pathway, which is crucial for cell migration and survival. The DOCK1*LAMA2 interaction has been found to decrease the risk of developing RA, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease (Veyssiere2024MYLK*FLNB).

These findings underscore the importance of DOCK1 in both cancer progression and autoimmune disease, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
DOCK1, also known as DOCK180, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It forms complexes with ELMO1 or ELMO2, which induce a conformational change in DOCK1, releasing an auto-inhibitory mechanism and enabling it to function as a RAC1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). This interaction promotes the translocation of DOCK1 to the plasma membrane, where the DOCK1/ELMO1/RHOG complex activates RAC1, facilitating actin reorganization necessary for cell movement (Benson2021The).

DOCK1 also interacts with the P130CAS (BCAR1) and CRK scaffold proteins upon phosphorylation by Src family kinases, which is promoted by integrin stimulation. This complex formation is involved in axonal outgrowth and cell migration (Benson2021The). Additionally, DOCK1 associates with the Dbl-RhoGEFs Intersectin-1 and -2 (ITSN1/2), contributing to intercellular endothelial adhesions, and interacts with G-protein coupled receptor 124 (GPR124), aiding cell adhesion (Benson2021The).

The SH3 domain of DOCK1 binds to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of ELMO proteins, which is necessary for the activation of DOCK GEF activity. The DHR-1 domain mediates membrane localization through interaction with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), a product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation (Benson2021The).
