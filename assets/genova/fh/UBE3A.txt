# UBE3A

## Overview
UBE3A is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, also known as E6-associated protein (E6AP), which is a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system is responsible for tagging proteins with ubiquitin to signal their degradation, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell. UBE3A is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, characterized by its HECT domain, which facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzymes to target substrates. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including synaptic function, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair, and is expressed in multiple cell types, particularly neurons. Dysregulation of UBE3A is implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably Angelman syndrome, due to its critical role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal development (Burette2018Subcellular; Buiting2016Angelman; Tomaić2015Angelman).

## Structure
The UBE3A protein, also known as E6AP, is a ubiquitin ligase with a complex molecular structure. It features a HECT (Homologous to E6AP Carboxyl Terminus) domain located at the C-terminus (residues 545-875), which is crucial for its catalytic activity. This domain is responsible for transferring ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to target proteins, facilitating polyubiquitin chain assembly (Ronchi2017In). The HECT domain folds into two lobes forming an L shape, with the active site residue Cys 820 playing a key role in the ubiquitination process (Ronchi2017In).

The N-terminal region of UBE3A contains a novel Zn-binding fold known as AZUL (Amino-terminal Zn-finger of Ube3a Ligase), which has a helix-loop-helix architecture. This domain is involved in substrate specificity and is characterized by a zinc ion coordinated by four cysteine residues (Lemak2011Znbinding). The AZUL domain interacts with the proteasome through the substrate receptor hRpn10, forming a structured 4-helix bundle essential for ubiquitination (Buel2020Structure).

UBE3A exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its function and localization. These isoforms can differ in their N-terminal sequences, affecting their interaction with other proteins and cellular components (Ronchi2017In).

## Function
UBE3A, also known as E6-associated protein (E6AP), is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, UBE3A is involved in tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular function (Tomaić2015Angelman). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as synaptic function, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair (Sirois2020Abundance).

UBE3A is expressed in various cell types, including glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and to a lesser extent in glial cells. It is particularly concentrated in euchromatin-rich domains within the nucleus and in the head and neck of dendritic spines, but is excluded from the postsynaptic density (Burette2018Subcellular). UBE3A's precise localization is integral to its function, as it modulates synaptic transmission and plasticity by targeting specific proteins for degradation, such as the synaptic protein Arc, which is involved in AMPA receptor trafficking (Greer2010The).

UBE3A also interacts with various substrates and proteins, influencing cellular functions and potentially affecting sociability through regulation of Cbln1 levels in excitatory neurons (Burette2018Subcellular). Its role in regulating mitochondrial function and Golgi acidification further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular health and function (Burette2018Subcellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UBE3A gene are primarily associated with Angelman syndrome (AS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, speech impairment, seizures, and a distinctive happy demeanor. AS is caused by the loss of function of the maternally inherited UBE3A allele, often due to deletions, uniparental disomy, or imprinting defects in the 15q11-q13 region (Buiting2016Angelman; Sadikovic2014Mutation). Approximately 5-10% of AS cases are due to UBE3A mutations, with most being de novo and affecting the HECT ligase domain (Buiting2016Angelman).

UBE3A mutations are also linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), accounting for 1%-2% of ASD cases. These mutations can disrupt synaptic function by altering the degradation of synaptic proteins, contributing to cognitive impairments (Greer2010The). Hyperactivating mutations in UBE3A have been associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes distinct from AS, including intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and ASD (Weston2021Identification).

UBE3A's role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal development is significant, and its dysfunction can lead to various neurological symptoms, including impaired synaptic transmission and plasticity, which are central to the pathogenesis of AS and related disorders (Ambrozkiewicz2020Molecular).

## Interactions
UBE3A, also known as E6AP, is a ubiquitin ligase that interacts with a wide array of proteins, forming part of several multiprotein complexes. It is notably associated with the HUN complex, which includes proteins such as HERC2, NEURL4, MAPK6, ECH1, and ECI2. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including transcription, translation, vesicle formation, and metabolism (MartínezNoël2018Network). UBE3A also interacts with proteasome subunits, such as PSMD4, suggesting a role in proteasomal turnover and autophagy (MartínezNoël2018Network).

UBE3A's interaction with MCM6 indicates its involvement in DNA replication and repair, potentially in conjunction with HERC2 (MartínezNoël2018Network). It also interacts with ASPP2, which may link UBE3A to CAMKII signaling pathways, affecting synaptic plasticity and cell signaling (MartínezNoël2018Network). The protein's association with HIF1AN, a regulator of HIF1A and NOTCH signaling, further implicates it in cell differentiation processes (MartínezNoël2018Network).

UBE3A's interactions extend to centrosomal functions, associating with proteins like ASPM, CEP97, and CEP170, which are crucial for centrosome organization (MartínezNoël2018Network). These interactions highlight UBE3A's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers.
