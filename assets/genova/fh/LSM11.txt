# LSM11

## Overview
LSM11 is a gene that encodes the LSM11 protein, a crucial component of the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. This protein is integral to the 3' end processing of histone pre-mRNAs, a process essential for the maturation of histone mRNAs, which are unique in their lack of introns and poly(A) tails. The LSM11 protein is characterized by its unique structure, including two Sm motifs separated by a long spacer, and it forms a distinctive Sm core with Lsm10 within the U7 snRNP, replacing the typical SmD1 and SmD2 proteins found in other snRNPs (Pillai2003Unique). The N-terminal region of LSM11 is crucial for its function, interacting with proteins such as ZFP100 and FLASH to facilitate histone RNA processing (Aik2017The; Schümperli2004The). LSM11's role in histone mRNA processing is vital for proper cell cycle progression, particularly during the S phase, and its expression levels have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential significance in tumor progression and treatment resistance (Zhuang2022Identification; Schümperli2004The).

## Structure
The LSM11 protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes two Sm motifs separated by a long spacer of 138 amino acids in humans (Pillai2003Unique). This separation is atypical for Sm/Lsm proteins. The N-terminal region of LSM11 is extended and contains four patches of evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues, likely forming alpha-helices crucial for its function (Sch�mperli2004The). The N-terminal domain is essential for histone RNA processing and interacts with processing factors such as ZFP100 and FLASH, forming a 2:1 heterotrimer complex that recruits the histone cleavage complex (Aik2017The; Pillai2003Unique).

LSM11 lacks a C-terminal tail following the second Sm motif, which is common in other Sm proteins (Pillai2003Unique). The protein is part of the U7 snRNP, where it replaces the typical SmD1 and SmD2 proteins, forming a unique Sm core structure with Lsm10 (Pillai2003Unique). Post-translational modifications include methylation of arginine residues in the N-terminal region by the PRMT5/MEP50/pICln methylosome complex, which may play a crucial role in U7 snRNP assembly (Yang2023In).

## Function
LSM11 is a critical component of the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which plays a vital role in the 3' end processing of histone pre-mRNAs. This process is essential for the maturation of histone mRNAs, which are unique in lacking introns and poly(A) tails. The U7 snRNP, containing LSM11, facilitates the endonucleolytic cleavage required to generate mature histone mRNA, a crucial step for proper cell cycle progression, particularly during the S phase when histone synthesis is upregulated (Schümperli2004The).

LSM11, along with Lsm10, forms a unique Sm core structure within the U7 snRNP, replacing the typical Sm D1 and D2 proteins found in other snRNPs. The N-terminal extension of LSM11 is essential for its function, as it interacts with the zinc finger protein ZFP100, forming a molecular bridge that stabilizes the RNA:RNA interaction necessary for histone RNA processing (Pillai2003Unique). The assembly of the U7 snRNP, including LSM11, is mediated by a specialized SMN complex, which ensures the correct incorporation of Lsm10 and LSM11, preventing the formation of non-functional snRNPs (Pillai2003Unique; Schümperli2004The).

## Clinical Significance
LSM11 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LSM11 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with advanced TNM stages and higher histological grades, suggesting a link to tumor progression (Zhuang2022Identification). In breast cancer, low expression levels of LSM11 are associated with longer recurrence metastasis-free survival, indicating that its downregulation may be beneficial for patient outcomes (Ta2021Potential). Conversely, in gastric cancer, LSM11 is associated with poor overall survival in patients undergoing 5-FU based chemotherapy, highlighting its potential role in chemoresistance (Liu2023Identification).

In skin cutaneous melanoma, LSM11 does not show significant differential expression between cancerous and normal tissues, nor is it significantly correlated with pathological stages or overall survival, suggesting a limited role in this cancer type (Sun2022Expression). These findings underscore the complex role of LSM11 in cancer, where its expression levels and interactions may contribute to disease progression and treatment resistance in a context-dependent manner.

## Interactions
LSM11 is a component of the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is essential for histone pre-mRNA processing. It interacts directly with U7 snRNA, forming a photoadduct upon UV irradiation, indicating a stable association within the U7 snRNP complex (Pillai2003Unique). LSM11 also interacts with the zinc finger protein ZFP100, which stabilizes the interaction between histone pre-mRNA and the U7 snRNP, suggesting that LSM11 may form a bridge with ZFP100 and HBP/SLBP to stabilize the U7-histone pre-mRNA complex (Pillai2003Unique).

In Drosophila, LSM11 interacts with the FLASH protein, a critical interaction for histone pre-mRNA processing. Specific residues in the N terminus of LSM11 are crucial for binding FLASH, and mutations in these residues can disrupt the interaction, leading to defects in histone mRNA processing (Burch2011Interaction). The interaction between LSM11 and FLASH is necessary for the recruitment of factors required for histone pre-mRNA cleavage, highlighting its importance in the processing pathway (Burch2011Interaction).

LSM11 is also part of a unique Sm core structure in U7 snRNPs, formed with LSM10, which is distinct from the canonical Sm proteins found in other snRNPs. This specificity is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the U7 snRNP (Pillai2003Unique).
