# CELF5

## Overview
CELF5 is a gene that encodes the protein CUGBP Elav-like family member 5, which is part of the CELF family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, where it plays a critical role in RNA processing activities such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA editing, and mRNA stability. These functions are essential for the regulation of gene expression and the generation of protein diversity, which are vital for neuronal development and function (GROMAK2003Antagonistic; Dasgupta2011The). CELF5, like other CELF proteins, contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that facilitate its binding to RNA and influence splicing activity (Dasgupta2011The). The protein's involvement in alternative splicing and its expression pattern suggest its importance in neurosynaptic transmission and the maintenance of normal cellular functions, with potential implications in various neurological and oncological conditions (Huang2020Germ).

## Structure


## Function
CELF5, a member of the CUGBP Elav-like family of RNA-binding proteins, is primarily detected in the nervous system, indicating its role in neuronal function (GROMAK2003Antagonistic; Dasgupta2011The). CELF proteins, including CELF5, are involved in various RNA processing steps such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA editing, deadenylation, mRNA stability, and translation (Dasgupta2011The). These processes are crucial for generating protein diversity and modulating protein expression levels, impacting cellular differentiation and function.

CELF proteins, in general, have a common domain structure with three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a unique divergent domain that separates RRM2 and RRM3, which plays a significant role in RNA binding and splicing activity (Dasgupta2011The). While specific functions of CELF5 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its expression pattern suggests a role in the regulation of gene expression in the nervous system, potentially influencing neurosynaptic transmission and neuronal development (GROMAK2003Antagonistic; Dasgupta2011The). CELF proteins are also implicated in the misregulation of alternative splicing in diseases, highlighting their importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (GROMAK2003Antagonistic).

## Clinical Significance
CELF5 (CUGBP Elav-like family member 5) is implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing events, which are crucial in various biological processes and disease states. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly malignant brain tumor, CELF5 has been identified as a significant splicing factor that regulates specific splicing events associated with cancer status and survival-related pathways. The study by Huang et al. highlights CELF5's role in the regulation of the germ cell-specific gene 1-like protein (GSG1L) and its involvement in pathways such as primary bile acid synthesis and steroid hormone biosynthesis, which are linked to GBM prognosis (Huang2020Germ).

Alterations in CELF5 expression or mutations can impact neurological development and function, potentially contributing to conditions like myotonic dystrophy and other neurodegenerative disorders. Its dysregulation may affect muscle and brain tissue integrity, although specific diseases directly resulting from CELF5 mutations are not detailed in the provided context (Huang2020Germ). The study underscores the potential of CELF5 as a prognostic indicator in glioma patients, suggesting its significant role in tumorigenesis and progression through posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms (Huang2020Germ).
