# C6orf47

## Overview
C6orf47 is a gene located on chromosome 6 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 6 open reading frame 47. This protein is characterized by its unique interaction with the intracellular tail of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor involved in various cellular processes and associated with conditions such as achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia. Despite its specific interaction with FGFR3, C6orf47 does not exhibit significant similarity to other known proteins, except for its mouse orthologue, suggesting a potentially unique function that remains to be fully elucidated. The protein's role in FGFR3 signaling pathways underscores its potential importance in cellular signaling and disease mechanisms, although further research is needed to fully understand its biological functions and implications (Lehner2004Analysis).

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
C6orf47, a protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome 6, has been identified to interact specifically with the intracellular tail of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). This interaction was discovered using a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system, which is a method used to study protein-protein interactions. The interaction between C6orf47 and FGFR3 suggests a potential role for C6orf47 in FGFR3 signaling pathways, which are significant due to FGFR3's involvement in conditions such as achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia (Lehner2004Analysis).

Despite this identified interaction, C6orf47 does not show significant similarity to any other known proteins except for its mouse orthologue, indicating a unique function or role that is not yet fully understood. The study that identified this interaction aimed to predict the functions of uncharacterized proteins by identifying their interaction partners, but for C6orf47, only limited information is available regarding its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Lehner2004Analysis). The specificity of the interaction with FGFR3 highlights the potential importance of C6orf47 in specific cellular processes related to FGFR3 signaling.
