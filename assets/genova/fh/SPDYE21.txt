# SPDYE21

## Overview
SPDYE21 is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E21, which is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. The protein belongs to the speedy/RINGO family, known for its role in modulating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity, which is crucial for cell cycle progression. Members of this family are characterized by their ability to bind and activate CDKs, thereby influencing various phases of the cell cycle, including the transition from G1 to S phase and the G2/M transition. The SPDYE21 gene, through its encoded protein, plays a significant role in ensuring proper cell division and proliferation, which is essential for normal cellular function and organismal development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
