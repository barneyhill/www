# MAP2

## Overview
MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the stabilization and organization of microtubules in neuronal cells. The protein, also named MAP2, is predominantly expressed in the dendrites of neurons, where it plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton and facilitating intracellular transport. As a member of the microtubule-associated protein family, MAP2 is involved in various cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity and neuronal development. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interaction with microtubules and other proteins. MAP2's interactions extend to F-actin and several signaling proteins, underscoring its role as a scaffolding protein in cellular signaling pathways. Dysregulation of MAP2 expression and function has been implicated in several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in neuronal health and disease (Dehmelt2004TheMAP2Taufamilyofmicrotubuleassociatedproteins; Sánchez2000Phosphorylation; Cabrera2016MAP2).

## Structure
MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) is a protein primarily expressed in neurons, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing microtubules. The molecular structure of MAP2 is characterized by its large size and asymmetric shape, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 198,978 daltons, although it appears larger in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis due to its elongated and unordered structure (Lewis1988MicrotubuleAssociated; Vallee1984MAP2).

MAP2 contains several functional domains, including a COOH-terminal domain rich in basic amino acids, which facilitates binding to the acidic COOH-terminal regions of tubulin. This domain includes three imperfect 18-amino acid repeats that are homologous to sequences in tau protein, suggesting a shared microtubule binding motif (Lewis1988MicrotubuleAssociated). The protein's NH2-terminal domain contains a binding site for the regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (Johnson1992The).

MAP2 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which modulate its interaction with microtubules and other proteins (Johnson1992The). The protein exists in several isoforms, including MAP2a, MAP2b, MAP2c, and MAP2d, which result from alternative splicing and differ in the length of their projection domains and the number of microtubule-binding repeats (Dehmelt2004TheMAP2Taufamilyofmicrotubuleassociatedproteins; Kindler1990Molecular).

## Function
Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) plays a critical role in the stabilization and organization of microtubules within neurons, primarily in dendrites. It is involved in the nucleation and stabilization of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining neuronal structure and facilitating intracellular transport (Dehmelt2004TheMAP2Taufamilyofmicrotubuleassociatedproteins; Sánchez2000Phosphorylation). MAP2's interaction with microtubules is regulated by its phosphorylation state, which affects its ability to bind and stabilize these structures. Phosphorylation at specific sites can modulate MAP2's interaction with microtubules, influencing microtubule assembly and stability (Sánchez2000Phosphorylation).

MAP2 is also involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal development. During early neuronal outgrowth, high levels of MAP2 phosphorylation correlate with axonal and dendritic growth, contributing to a dynamic cytoskeleton necessary for rapid growth. As neurons mature, dephosphorylation of MAP2 stabilizes the cytoskeleton, supporting synaptic junctions and plasticity, which are crucial for learning and memory (Sánchez2000Phosphorylation). Additionally, MAP2 interacts with F-actin, which is significant for neurite initiation and dendritic development (Dehmelt2004TheMAP2Taufamilyofmicrotubuleassociatedproteins).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the MAP2 gene have been implicated in various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. In Huntington's disease, MAP2 splicing is altered, leading to a shift towards low molecular weight isoforms and a reduction in high molecular weight isoforms, which contributes to dendritic atrophy and synaptic dysfunction (Cabrera2016MAP2). In schizophrenia, reduced MAP2 immunoreactivity is observed, particularly in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which correlates with decreased dendritic and synaptic structures. This reduction is attributed to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, rather than a decrease in MAP2 protein levels (Marchisella2016Microtubule; DeGiosio2022More).

MAP2 is also implicated in mood disorders like major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, where alterations in MAP2 expression and phosphorylation are noted in specific brain regions, potentially affecting dendritic growth and synaptic plasticity (DeGiosio2022More). In autism spectrum disorders, reduced MAP2 expression is linked to cognitive deficits, likely due to its impact on synaptic plasticity (DeGiosio2022More). These findings suggest that MAP2 dysregulation plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of these disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in neuronal cells. MAP2 interacts with microtubules through its microtubule-binding domain (MTBD), which is essential for stabilizing microtubule structures. This domain also facilitates the binding and bundling of F-actin, distinguishing MAP2 from tau, which does not share this capability (Roger2004MAP2c).

MAP2 interacts with the protein phosphatase PP2A/Bα, which binds to a proline-rich motif within MAP2. This interaction is significant for the dephosphorylation of MAP2, influencing its activity and function in neurons. The binding involves a conserved proline-rich sequence, RTPPKSP, which is also recognized by the kinase Fyn. This motif is crucial for the interaction with PP2A/Bα, and phosphorylation of this motif can modulate the binding affinity (Sontag2012The).

MAP2 also acts as a scaffolding protein, interacting with proteins such as Src and Grb2, which are involved in cellular signaling pathways. These interactions are facilitated by the proline-rich domain of MAP2, which binds to SH3 domain-containing proteins (Lim2000Regulated). Additionally, MAP2 is associated with RNA-binding proteins like FMR1 and hnRNPK, which play roles in regulating translation and synaptic plasticity (DeGiosio2022More).
