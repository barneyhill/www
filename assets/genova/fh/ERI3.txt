# ERI3

## Overview
The ERI3 gene encodes the ERI1 exoribonuclease family member 3 protein, which is a putative 3′-5′ RNA exonuclease involved in RNA processing and degradation. This protein is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role in intracellular membrane dynamics and RNA processing activities associated with this organelle (Ward2016The). ERI3 is characterized by its interactions with viral RNA, particularly in the context of flavivirus replication, where it binds specifically to the genomic RNA of certain viruses, facilitating viral replication (Ward2016The). Despite its proposed exonuclease activity, this function is not required for its role in viral replication, indicating a complex involvement in RNA-related processes (Ward2016The). The protein's structure and function are influenced by potential splice variants and post-translational modifications, which may affect its stability and activity (Mylonas2022A).

## Structure
The ERI3 protein, encoded by the ERI3 gene, is a member of the exoribonuclease family involved in RNA processing and degradation. It has a theoretical molecular weight of 37.2 kDa and consists of 337 amino acids. However, electrophoretic migration studies have identified a main peak for ERI3 at 21 kDa, suggesting the presence of a splice variant or a cleavage product. This variant, possibly corresponding to splice variant 3, is expressed in all cell lines and covers amino acids 224 to 321, indicating a shorter chain than expected (Mylonas2022A).

The structure of ERI3 may include specific domains typical of exoribonucleases, although detailed structural information such as secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures is not provided in the available data. The presence of splice variants and potential novel processing events suggests that ERI3 may undergo differential splicing, which could influence its function and stability (Mylonas2022A). The protein's migration behavior in electrophoretic studies indicates that it might be subject to post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided (Mylonas2022A).

## Function
ERI3, also known as ERI1 exoribonuclease family member 3, is a protein that functions as a putative 3′-5′ RNA exonuclease, suggesting a role in RNA processing or turnover in healthy human cells. It is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its involvement in intracellular membrane dynamics and possibly RNA processing activities associated with this organelle (Ward2016The). The protein's localization is driven by sequences in its N-terminal region, and it shows partial overlap with COPII vesicle markers, suggesting a close association with Golgi structures (Ward2016The).

While the specific functions of ERI3 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its exonuclease activity implies a role in the regulation of RNA stability and turnover, contributing to RNA quality control and gene expression regulation (Ward2016The). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus supports its involvement in these processes. Although its exact role in normal cellular processes remains to be elucidated, ERI3's association with the Golgi apparatus and its potential exonuclease activity suggest it may play a significant role in RNA processing pathways (Ward2016The).

## Interactions
ERI3, also known as ERI1 exoribonuclease family member 3, is involved in interactions with viral RNA, particularly in the context of flavivirus replication. It preferentially binds to the genomic RNA of Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and Yellow Fever Virus 17D (YFV17D), but not to subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) or RNA from other viruses like Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Mumps virus (MuV) (Ward2016The). This binding is crucial for the accumulation of viral RNA and the production of infectious particles, indicating a specific role in flavivirus replication (Ward2016The).

ERI3 is also associated with the Golgi apparatus in uninfected cells and relocates to sites near DENV-2 replication during infection, suggesting a role in the relocalization of Golgi proteins to facilitate viral replication (Ward2016The). Although ERI3 is proposed to be a 3′-5′ exonuclease, its exonuclease activity is not required for its pro-viral function (Ward2016The). The protein's interaction with viral RNA is supported by RNA immunoprecipitation experiments, which show a significant enrichment of ERI3 with DENV-2 genomic RNA (Ward2016The).
