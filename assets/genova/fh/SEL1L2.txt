# SEL1L2

## Overview
SEL1L2 is a gene that encodes the SEL1L2 adaptor subunit of the SYVN1 ubiquitin ligase, a protein integral to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This protein functions as an adaptor subunit, facilitating the recognition and ubiquitination of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum. The SEL1L2 protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in linking the SYVN1 ubiquitin ligase to its substrates. Its activity is crucial for preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which can lead to cellular stress and disease. The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's Disease, melanoma, and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (SalasPerez2023Crosstalk; Lai2022Identification; Suzuki2020A).

## Function
SEL1L2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This protein functions as an adaptor subunit for the SYVN1 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial for the recognition and ubiquitination of misfolded proteins. The ERAD pathway is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum, ensuring that only properly folded proteins proceed to their cellular destinations. By facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins, SEL1L2 helps prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates, thereby contributing to cellular stress responses and overall cell health.

In healthy human cells, the SEL1L2 protein is active within the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a significant role in the cellular machinery that manages protein folding and degradation. This activity is vital for the proper functioning of cells, as it helps maintain the balance of protein synthesis and degradation, which is necessary for normal cellular operations and organismal health. The precise molecular activities of SEL1L2, including its interaction with the SYVN1 complex, underscore its importance in the broader context of cellular homeostasis and stress response mechanisms. The context does not provide specific details on the function of the SEL1L2 gene in healthy human cells (SalasPerez2023Crosstalk).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SEL1L2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), SEL1L2 is significantly overexpressed in patients compared to non-AD individuals. This overexpression is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and immune cell activation, suggesting that SEL1L2 may play a role in the pathological mechanisms underlying AD progression (Lai2022Identification). Machine learning models have identified SEL1L2 as a key feature in predicting AD, indicating its potential as a biomarker for the disease (Lai2022Identification).

In melanoma, a duplication at chromosome 20p12.1, which includes the SEL1L2 gene, has been identified in individuals predisposed to the disease. This duplication is considered a rare germline copy number variation (CNV) and is associated with a lower age of onset in melanoma patients, highlighting its potential role in cancer susceptibility (Fidalgo2016Role).

SEL1L2 has also been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). De novo truncation variants in SEL1L2 have been identified in patients with NDDs, including those with epilepsy and craniofacial malformations, suggesting a possible involvement in these conditions (Suzuki2020A).
