# ANKRD12

## Overview
ANKRD12 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 12, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for their role in mediating protein-protein interactions, contributing to the protein's involvement in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and apoptosis (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a critical role in cellular functions, including the regulation of cell cycle and response to oxidative stress (Voellenkle2022CircANKRD12). ANKRD12 is also implicated in the regulation of the p53 and FOXO pathways, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Voellenkle2022CircANKRD12). Clinically, mutations in the ANKRD12 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both cognitive and physical health (Sakamoto2020Functional; Chen2022The).

## Structure
ANKRD12 is a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat (ANK) motifs, which are known for their role in mediating protein-protein interactions. The ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) is composed of multiple repeats, each typically consisting of 30-34 amino acids, forming a helix-turn-helix conformation with short loops at the N and C termini (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). These repeats stack to form an elongated structure with a left-handed twist, creating concave and convex surfaces. The concave surface is often involved in protein-protein interactions, while the convex surface contributes to structural stability (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).

The ANK motifs in ANKRD12 contain conserved residues, such as Glycine at specific positions and the TPLH motif, which are crucial for the stability and folding of the ARD (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). The TPLH motif initiates the first α-helix and forms a turn stabilized by hydrogen bonds, contributing to the domain's stability (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). The hydrophobic core of the ARD is formed by conserved hydrophobic residues in the anti-parallel helices, further enhancing stability (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).

While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of ANKRD12 are not provided, the protein's structure is likely influenced by its ankyrin repeat motifs, which are common in proteins that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The presence of these motifs suggests a potential for diverse interactions and functional versatility. However, ANKRD12 has less than 5% coverage of the ankyrin region, indicating a limited extent of these motifs within the protein (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).

## Function
ANKRD12, a gene encoding a protein with ankyrin repeat motifs, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and protein-protein interactions. These ankyrin repeat motifs are crucial for facilitating interactions that influence cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, contributing to organismal development and homeostasis (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).

The protein encoded by ANKRD12 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in critical cellular functions. In endothelial cells, the circular RNA form of ANKRD12, known as circANKRD12, is induced under oxidative stress conditions, such as exposure to hydrogen peroxide. This induction suggests a protective role in regulating cell proliferation and tubulogenesis, which are essential for angiogenesis (Voellenkle2022CircANKRD12). The circular form of ANKRD12 is more resistant to exonuclease digestion compared to its linear counterpart, indicating a structural advantage that may be relevant to its function in stress responses (Voellenkle2022CircANKRD12).

In the context of oxidative stress, circANKRD12 is involved in the regulation of the p53 and FOXO pathways, both of which are crucial for cellular responses to redox imbalance (Voellenkle2022CircANKRD12). These pathways are integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stressors.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANKRD12 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. ANKRD12 is associated with cognitive phenotypes such as educational attainment and verbal-numerical reasoning, with rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in this gene linked to reduced cognitive function (Chen2022The). It has also been identified as a risk gene for bipolar disorder and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, suggesting a genetic correlation between these conditions and cognitive decline (Fei2024Exome; Smirnova2019The). 

ANKRD12 has been associated with autism spectrum disorders, particularly in individuals with deletions on chromosome 18p, which includes this gene (Hasi‐Zogaj2015A). Additionally, ANKRD12 is linked to sleep-related traits such as daytime sleepiness and napping, which may have implications for neuropsychiatric diseases (Fei2024Exome). 

In the context of cancer, ANKRD12 expression is downregulated in colorectal cancer, and its reduced expression is associated with poor survival and liver metastasis (Sakamoto2020Functional). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance across a range of disorders, emphasizing its role in both cognitive and physical health conditions.

## Interactions
ANKRD12, also known as ANCO-2, is a nuclear protein that interacts with p160 coactivators, as demonstrated in a GST pull-down assay, suggesting a functional relationship with ANKRD11 (ANCO-1) (Bai2013Clinical). ANKRD12 is involved in recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the p160 coactivators/nuclear receptor complex, inhibiting ligand-dependent transactivation (Smirnova2019The). This interaction is significant in the regulation of gene expression, as HDACs play a crucial role in modifying chromatin structure and gene transcription (Smirnova2019The).

The protein's ankyrin repeat domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, which are essential for its role in various cellular processes, including transcription and signal transduction (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). Although specific physical interactions of ANKRD12 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its involvement in multiprotein complexes and potential as a nuclear receptor corepressor by interfering with coactivator functions is noted (Smirnova2019The). The protein's interactions are crucial for its regulatory functions, particularly in the context of mental health disorders and cancer, where its expression levels have been linked to disease progression and prognosis (Smirnova2019The; Bai2013Clinical).
