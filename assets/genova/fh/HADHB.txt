# HADHB

## Overview
The HADHB gene encodes the beta subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP), a critical enzyme complex involved in the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. This process is essential for energy production in cells, as it converts fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle to generate ATP. The protein encoded by HADHB, known as hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit beta, exhibits thiolase activity, facilitating the thiolysis of 3-ketoacyl-CoA, a pivotal step in fatty acid metabolism (Dagher2021MTP; Liang2018CryoEM). The TFP complex, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, functions as a heterotetramer composed of two alpha and two beta subunits, with the beta subunit playing a vital role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Orii1999Genes; Liang2018CryoEM). Proper functioning of the HADHB gene is crucial for preventing metabolic disorders and ensuring efficient energy production (Boutron2011Comprehensive).

## Function
The HADHB gene encodes the beta subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP), which plays a crucial role in the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids within the mitochondria. This protein complex is essential for energy production, as it catalyzes the last three steps of the beta-oxidation pathway, converting fatty acids into acetyl-CoA units that enter the citric acid cycle to produce ATP (Dagher2021MTP; Liang2018CryoEM). The beta subunit, specifically, contains the thiolase activity responsible for the thiolysis of 3-ketoacyl-CoA, a critical step in the breakdown of fatty acids (Liang2018CryoEM).

In healthy human cells, the TFP complex is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions as a heterotetramer composed of two alpha and two beta subunits (Liang2018CryoEM). The beta subunit's activity is vital for maintaining normal cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis, as it facilitates the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into energy-rich molecules (Orii1999Genes). Proper functioning of the HADHB-encoded subunit is essential for preventing metabolic disorders and ensuring efficient energy production in cells (Boutron2011Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HADHB gene are associated with mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting long-chain fatty acid oxidation. This deficiency manifests in various phenotypes, including early-onset cardiomyopathy, recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and sensorimotor neuropathy with episodic rhabdomyolysis (Dagher2021MTP). The severity of these conditions is linked to the expression levels of HADHB, with complete deficiency leading to severe neonatal cardiomyopathy and partial deficiency associated with neuromyopathic phenotypes (Dagher2021MTP).

HADHB mutations can also lead to axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, characterized by progressive muscle weakness and sensory loss. This condition is linked to compound heterozygous mutations in the HADHB gene, which result in reduced protein stability and expression (Hong2013A). The clinical presentation of MTP deficiency can include symptoms resembling CMT, such as peripheral neuropathy and episodic rhabdomyolysis (Ishikawa2023Case).

The accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitine due to HADHB mutations may contribute to axonal degeneration by altering membrane properties, potentially leading to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration and axonal degeneration (Dagher2021MTP). This accumulation is a key factor in the pathophysiology of MTP deficiency-related neuropathy.

## Interactions
The HADHB gene encodes the beta-subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), which is essential for the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. HADHB forms a homodimer with another beta-subunit, which binds to the mitochondrial inner membrane and interacts with alpha-subunits encoded by the HADHA gene to form the active MTP complex. This complex is crucial for enzymatic functions, with the octomer (α4β4) being the active form (Dagher2021MTP).

HADHB also interacts with estrogen receptors in mitochondria. Specifically, estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) is associated and colocalized with HADHB, and its silencing enhances HADHB activity, suggesting an inhibitory role of ERβ on HADHB in breast cancer cells. This interaction highlights the complex roles of estrogen receptors in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress (Zhou2012Estrogen).

In the context of stomach adenocarcinoma, HADHB is involved in the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Upregulation of HADHB leads to reduced expression of YAP and TEAD4, indicating a tumor-suppressive effect. The transcription factor KLF4 regulates HADHB expression by binding to its promoter region, and this interaction is significant in counteracting tumor-promoting effects (Li2022HydroxyacylCoA).
