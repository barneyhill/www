# HPN

## Overview
The HPN gene encodes hepsin, a type II transmembrane serine protease that plays a significant role in various physiological and pathological processes. Hepsin is characterized by its structural components, including a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a serine protease domain, which facilitate its localization and function at the cell membrane (Tsuji1991Hepsin). As a membrane-associated serine protease, hepsin is involved in the activation of pro-matrix metalloproteinases, contributing to extracellular matrix turnover and tissue remodeling (Wilkinson2017The). It also participates in inflammatory processes and has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, where its expression levels can serve as potential prognostic biomarkers (ZaragozaHuesca2022Implication; Fang2022The). The structural and functional attributes of hepsin make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by aberrant protease activity.

## Structure
Hepsin (HPN) is a type II transmembrane serine protease characterized by a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a serine protease domain. The primary structure of hepsin includes these distinct regions, which are crucial for its localization and function. The secondary structure of hepsin features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and enzymatic activity. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are important for maintaining the protein's conformation and function. Hepsin may form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that could be relevant for its biological activity.

Hepsin's catalytic domain is positioned flat against the plasma membrane, a common feature among membrane-associated serine proteinases (MASPs), facilitating interactions with substrates such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (FuentesPrior2021Priming). This structural arrangement allows hepsin to efficiently cleave specific peptide bonds, such as the Arg815-Ser816 bond in the spike protein, which is crucial for viral activation (FuentesPrior2021Priming).

Common post-translational modifications of hepsin include glycosylation, which may affect its stability and interactions with other molecules. These structural features and modifications are essential for hepsin's role in physiological processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Function
Hepsin (HPN) is a type II transmembrane serine protease primarily associated with the cell membrane, where its catalytic subunit is exposed to the extracellular space, while the amino-terminal portion faces the cytosol (Tsuji1991Hepsin). This orientation allows hepsin to participate in various extracellular processes, including the activation of pro-matrix metalloproteinases (proMMPs), which are crucial for extracellular matrix turnover and tissue remodeling (Wilkinson2017The). Hepsin is involved in the degradation of cartilage components, such as collagen and aggrecan, by activating proMMP-1 and proMMP-3, which are essential for collagen breakdown (Wilkinson2017The).

Hepsin also plays a role in inflammation, as its expression is correlated with synovial inflammation and is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1 and OSM (Wilkinson2017The). Despite being a weak activator of the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), hepsin's interaction with this receptor suggests a role in extracellular matrix turnover and inflammation (Wilkinson2017The). Overall, hepsin's activities contribute to maintaining epithelial cell integrity and facilitating tissue remodeling processes.

## Clinical Significance
Hepsin (HPN) is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the A allele of the rs10954732 polymorphism is associated with increased HPN expression, which correlates with decreased susceptibility to HCC and improved prognosis. Lower HPN expression is linked to worse outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Fang2022The). HPN expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration in HCC, indicating its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Fang2022The).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), HPN expression varies with tumor differentiation. High HPN expression is associated with increased risk of recurrence and thrombotic complications in localized CRC, while low expression is linked to poor differentiation and metastasis in advanced stages. This suggests HPN as a potential biomarker for CRC prognosis and thrombotic risk (ZaragozaHuesca2022Implication).

In melanoma, an HPN mutation signature is associated with increased lung metastasis in UV-induced models, highlighting its role in metastatic progression (Leonard2021Comprehensive). These findings underscore the complex role of HPN in cancer, with its expression influencing tumor progression and patient outcomes across different cancer types.
