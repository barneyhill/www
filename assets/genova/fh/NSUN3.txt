# NSUN3

## Overview
NSUN3 is a gene that encodes the NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 3, a mitochondrial RNA methyltransferase enzyme. This enzyme is primarily involved in the methylation of cytosine at position 34 in the anticodon loop of mitochondrial tRNA Met, a modification crucial for mitochondrial translation and cellular energy production (Murakami2023NSUN3mediated; Van2016Deficient). The NSUN3 protein plays a vital role in the formation of 5-formylcytidine (f5C), which is essential for the accurate decoding of mitochondrial codons during protein synthesis (Trixl2017RNA). Dysfunction or mutations in the NSUN3 gene are linked to various mitochondrial diseases and conditions, including mitochondrial myopathy and inherited optic neuropathies, due to impaired mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation (de2024Mutations; Van2016Deficient). Additionally, NSUN3 is implicated in cancer, particularly lung squamous cell carcinoma, where its upregulation affects cell proliferation (Pan2021m5C).

## Function
The NSUN3 gene encodes a mitochondrial methyltransferase responsible for the methylation of cytosine at position 34 in the anticodon loop of mitochondrial tRNA Met, forming 5-methylcytosine (m5C) (Murakami2023NSUN3mediated; Van2016Deficient). This modification is a precursor to the formation of 5-formylcytidine (f5C), which is crucial for the proper decoding of both the universal AUG codon and the non-universal AUA codon in mitochondrial translation (Van2016Deficient; Trixl2017RNA). NSUN3's activity is essential for efficient mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiratory function, impacting cellular energy production and metabolic homeostasis (Murakami2023NSUN3mediated; Van2016Deficient).

In healthy human cells, NSUN3 is localized in the mitochondria, where it plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function by ensuring the correct epitranscriptome modifications of mt-tRNA Met (Van2016Deficient). The absence or dysfunction of NSUN3 leads to impaired mitochondrial translation and is associated with mitochondrial diseases, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal energy metabolism (Murakami2023NSUN3mediated; Van2016Deficient). NSUN3's role extends to embryonic development, as evidenced by its necessity for proper mitochondrial activity during embryonic stem cell differentiation (Trixl2017RNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NSUN3 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial diseases due to its role in mitochondrial tRNA methylation. These mutations can lead to impaired mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in conditions such as mitochondrial myopathy and combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency (Van2016Deficient). Patients with NSUN3 mutations often present with symptoms like lactic acidosis, muscle weakness, developmental delays, and neurological issues such as seizures and encephalomyopathy (Paramasivam2020Novel; Van2016Deficient).

NSUN3 mutations have also been linked to inherited optic neuropathies (IONs), characterized by progressive visual loss due to optic nerve atrophy. A specific homozygous variant in NSUN3 has been identified in patients with optic atrophy, leading to decreased mitochondrial complex IV levels and reduced cell respiration rates (de2024Mutations).

In cancer, NSUN3 is significantly upregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), where it is involved in the deposition of m5C on mitochondrial tRNA. Mutations in NSUN3 in LUSC tissues are associated with altered cell proliferation and are considered important pathogenic factors (Pan2021m5C). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NSUN3 in various diseases linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.

## Interactions
NSUN3 is a mitochondrial RNA methyltransferase that primarily interacts with mitochondrial tRNA, specifically mt-tRNA Met. It catalyzes the methylation of cytosine at position 34 in the anticodon loop, a modification crucial for mitochondrial translation efficiency (Van2016Deficient). This interaction is highly specific, as NSUN3 predominantly targets mt-tRNA Met, with significant enrichment of reads mapping to this tRNA in miCLIP analyses (Van2016Deficient).

The methylation activity of NSUN3 involves two conserved cysteine residues necessary for transferring the methyl group to RNA, highlighting its role in post-transcriptional cytosine-5 methylation (Van2016Deficient). NSUN3's function is critical for the formation of 5-formylcytosine (f5C) at the same position, a modification that is absent in NSUN3-null cells, indicating a precursor-product relationship between NSUN3-mediated methylation and f5C formation (Van2016Deficient).

While NSUN3's primary interaction is with mitochondrial tRNA, the study did not identify direct interactions with other proteins or cytoplasmic tRNAs, as NSUN3 does not methylate cytoplasmic tRNA Met, which is instead modified by NSUN2 (Van2016Deficient).
