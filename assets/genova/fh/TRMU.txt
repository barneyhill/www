# TRMU

## Overview
The TRMU gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme tRNA 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridylate methyltransferase, which is essential for the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs. This enzyme, categorized as a methyltransferase, specifically catalyzes the 2-thiolation of uridine at the wobble position of certain mitochondrial tRNAs, a modification crucial for maintaining tRNA stability and function. The proper functioning of TRMU is vital for mitochondrial translation and efficient protein synthesis, thereby supporting cellular energy metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. TRMU's activity is particularly significant in tissues with high metabolic demands, such as the liver, kidney, heart, and brain. Mutations in the TRMU gene have been linked to mitochondrial disorders, including acute infantile liver failure and other mitochondrial DNA diseases, underscoring its clinical importance (Boczonadi2013Altered; Meseguer2017microRNAmediated; Zeharia2009Acute).

## Function
The TRMU gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme known as tRNA 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridylate methyltransferase, which is crucial for the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs. This enzyme specifically catalyzes the 2-thiolation of uridine at the wobble position of mitochondrial tRNAs, including mt-tRNA Lys, mt-tRNA Gln, and mt-tRNA Glu (Boczonadi2013Altered; Zeharia2009Acute). This modification is essential for maintaining the stability and function of tRNAs, which in turn supports accurate mitochondrial translation and efficient protein synthesis (Meseguer2017microRNAmediated; Yan2004Identification).

TRMU activity is localized within the mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in cellular energy metabolism by ensuring proper mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation (Boczonadi2013Altered; Meseguer2017microRNAmediated). The enzyme's function is particularly important in tissues with high metabolic rates, such as the liver, kidney, heart, and brain (Yan2004Identification). In healthy human cells, TRMU's role in tRNA thiolation is critical for maintaining mitochondrial function and efficient protein synthesis, which are essential for overall organismal health (Powell2015Nuclearencoded; Boczonadi2013Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRMU gene are associated with acute infantile liver failure, a condition characterized by symptoms such as poor feeding, vomiting, jaundice, and irritability. Laboratory findings often include elevated liver transaminases, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, hyperammonemia, and direct hyperbilirubinemia. These mutations lead to reduced 2-thiouridylation levels of mitochondrial tRNAs, which are crucial for mitochondrial translation. The condition typically presents during a critical neonatal period when patients are at increased risk due to limited sulfur availability, a substrate for TRMU. While some affected infants may die during acute episodes, survivors often do not experience recurrence, with some being followed for up to 14 years without further incidents (Zeharia2009Acute).

Alterations in TRMU expression are also implicated in mitochondrial DNA diseases such as MELAS and MERRF. In these conditions, TRMU expression is regulated by microRNAs, which can exacerbate disease phenotypes by affecting mitochondrial tRNA modifications. For instance, miR-9 and miR-335 have been shown to influence TRMU expression, impacting mitochondrial function and contributing to the severity of these diseases (Meseguer2017microRNAmediated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TRMU in mitochondrial disorders, where its dysfunction can lead to severe metabolic consequences.

## Interactions
The TRMU protein, encoded by the TRMU gene, is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNA, specifically catalyzing the 2-thiolation of uridine at the wobble position of tRNA. This modification is crucial for mitochondrial translation and proper protein synthesis. TRMU interacts with mitochondrial tRNAs, including tRNA-Lys, tRNA-Gln, and tRNA-Glu, facilitating their thio-modification, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Zeharia2009Acute).

In the context of mitochondrial DNA diseases, TRMU expression is regulated by microRNAs, such as miR-9 and miR-335, which modulate its levels in response to oxidative stress and other cellular signals. These miRNAs can influence TRMU's role in mitochondrial tRNA modification, affecting mitochondrial translation and stress responses (Meseguer2017microRNAmediated). The regulation of TRMU by miRNAs highlights its involvement in a complex network of interactions that respond to mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostasis stress (Meseguer2017microRNAmediated).

TRMU's interactions with mitochondrial tRNAs and its regulation by miRNAs underscore its critical role in mitochondrial biology and its potential impact on mitochondrial diseases.
