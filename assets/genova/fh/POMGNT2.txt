# POMGNT2

## Overview
POMGNT2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme protein O-linked mannose N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (beta 1,4-), a glycosyltransferase involved in the O-mannosylation pathway. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of the core M3-type glycan on α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a process essential for the functional glycosylation of α-DG in human cells. The POMGNT2 protein is characterized by its dimeric structure, comprising an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal fibronectin type III (FnIII) domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity and substrate recognition (Imae2021The). The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining the integrity of the extracellular matrix, as it facilitates the binding of α-DG to extracellular matrix proteins. Mutations in the POMGNT2 gene are linked to a range of muscular dystrophies, known as dystroglycanopathies, highlighting its importance in muscle and brain function (Nakagawa2015Ectopic; Endo2015Milder).

## Structure
The POMGNT2 protein is a glycosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of core M3-type glycan on α-dystroglycan (α-DG). It is characterized by a dimeric structure, with each monomer comprising an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal fibronectin type III (FnIII) domain (Imae2021The). The catalytic domain features two Rossmann-like folds, known as the N-lobe and C-lobe, typical of GT-B fold glycosyltransferases (Imae2021The). The FnIII domain is crucial for substrate recognition and enzymatic activity, interacting with the N-lobe of another protomer to form a domain-swapped dimer (Imae2021The).

Key residues such as His166, Arg294, and Arg298 are involved in the enzymatic reaction, with His166 initiating the reaction and Arg294/Arg298 stabilizing the UDP molecule (Imae2021The). The TPT motif and mannose are essential for substrate recognition, while the N-terminal RXR motif and C-terminal hydrophobic interactions determine the specific O-Man positions on α-DG recognized by POMGNT2 (Imae2021The). The protein's structure allows it to selectively glycosylate specific sites on α-DG, a process critical for its function in the O-mannosylation pathway (Halmo2017Protein).

## Function
POMGNT2 is a crucial enzyme in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a process essential for the functional glycosylation of this protein in healthy human cells. It catalyzes the addition of a β-1,4 linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the initial mannose residue on α-DG, forming the core M3 glycan structure. This structure is vital for binding extracellular matrix proteins and certain viruses, playing a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the extracellular matrix (Halmo2017Protein).

POMGNT2 acts as a gatekeeper enzyme, ensuring that only specific O-mannosylated sites on proteins are modified with glycan structures capable of binding LG-domain containing proteins. This selectivity is based on the primary amino acid sequence near the site of O-mannosylation, which is crucial for the proper formation of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex. This complex links the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, preventing congenital muscular dystrophies (Halmo2017Protein).

The enzyme shows a preference for specific acceptor substrates, particularly those with mannosylated residues at positions Thr317 and Thr379, and is highly specific to α-DG due to a unique amino acid motif, R-X-R-X-X-I-X-X-T-P-T (Halmo2017Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POMGNT2 gene are associated with a spectrum of muscular dystrophies, collectively known as dystroglycanopathies. These conditions are characterized by defects in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a crucial component for muscle and brain function. POMGNT2 mutations can lead to severe conditions such as Walker-Warburg syndrome, which involves significant brain malformations and eye abnormalities, as well as milder forms like limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) with intellectual disabilities but without brain malformations (Nakagawa2015Ectopic; Endo2015Milder).

In patients with milder forms of muscular dystrophy, POMGNT2 mutations result in elevated creatine kinase levels, muscle weakness, and developmental delays, but typically do not cause ocular defects (Endo2015Milder). The mutations often involve missense variants that affect the glycosyltransferase domain of the POMGNT2 protein, leading to impaired enzymatic activity and altered glycosylation patterns (Imae2021The; Endo2015Milder).

In Pomgnt2-knockout mouse models, the absence of functional POMGNT2 disrupts brain development, leading to neuronal migration defects and structural brain abnormalities, such as cobblestone lissencephaly, due to the loss of basement membrane integrity (Nakagawa2015Ectopic). These findings underscore the critical role of POMGNT2 in maintaining normal muscle and brain function.

## Interactions
POMGNT2 interacts with α-dystroglycan (α-DG) as part of its role in glycosylation, specifically adding N-acetylglucosamine to O-linked mannose residues on α-DG. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the core M3 glycan structure, which is essential for α-DG's function in binding to extracellular matrix proteins (Imae2021The; Halmo2017Protein). POMGNT2 functions as a dimer, with each molecule consisting of an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal fibronectin type III (FnIII) domain. The FnIII domain is involved in substrate recognition and is necessary for the enzyme's activity, as mutations in this domain lead to a loss of function (Imae2021The).

The enzyme's interaction with α-DG is highly selective, influenced by specific amino acid motifs such as the TPT motif and the RXR motif, which contribute to the recognition and modification of O-mannosylation sites on α-DG (Imae2021The; Halmo2017Protein). These interactions are primarily hydrophobic and involve CH-π interactions, which are essential for the binding of the acceptor substrate (Imae2021The).
