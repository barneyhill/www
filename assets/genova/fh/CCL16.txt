# CCL16

## Overview
C-C motif chemokine ligand 16 (CCL16) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CC chemokine family, which is primarily expressed in the liver. The protein, also known as liver-expressed chemokine (LEC), plays a crucial role in immune responses by mediating leukocyte activation and migration, particularly during inflammation and immune surveillance. CCL16 is characterized as a chemokine due to its ability to interact with specific receptors, including CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, and CCR8, facilitating chemotaxis of various immune cells such as monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and dendritic cells. The protein's structure includes a distinctive dimeric arrangement and a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding site, which is significant for its function and regulation in the bloodstream (Weiergräber2022Structure; Cappello2006CCChemokine). CCL16 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including angiogenesis, tumor progression, and immune cell maturation, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in diseases such as cancer and inflammatory disorders (Strasly2004CCL16; Dai2024Characterizing).

## Structure
The CCL16 protein, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 16, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by distinct features across its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The primary structure of CCL16 is highly basic, with an isoelectric point of 9.4 and a net charge of +7.0 at pH 7. It includes a BBxB motif in the 40s loop, which serves as a principal glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding site (Weiergräber2022Structure).

The secondary structure of CCL16 consists of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a single α-helix, classifying it as an α+β protein. A distinctive feature is its C-terminal segment, which contains a type-I β-turn instead of a final helical turn, extending perpendicularly from the helix and aligning parallel to strand β1 (Weiergräber2022Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, CCL16 forms a dimer, with each chain featuring an extended N-terminus involved in dimerization via a small intermolecular β-sheet. The quaternary structure is characterized by this dimeric arrangement, with two chains per asymmetric unit in the crystal structure (Weiergräber2022Structure). The presence of disulfide bonds is confirmed by electron density maps, indicating cystine entities (Weiergräber2022Structure).

## Function
CCL16, also known as liver-expressed chemokine (LEC), is a member of the CC chemokine family primarily synthesized by hepatocytes and circulates in the blood as a full-length protein. It plays a role in leukocyte activation and migration during inflammation and immune surveillance (Weiergräber2022Structure). CCL16 is chemotactic for monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and dendritic cells, and is involved in the maturation and migration of human immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) (Cappello2006CCChemokine). It induces a novel maturation program in these cells, characterized by increased expression of costimulatory molecules and MHC class II molecules, enhancing their ability to prime T cell responses (Cappello2006CCChemokine).

CCL16 interacts with multiple receptors, including CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, and CCR8, to mediate its effects. It is involved in the chemotaxis of endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis by enhancing endothelial cell motility and proliferation (Strasly2004CCL16). The protein's high plasma levels in healthy individuals suggest a potential housekeeping role, possibly linked to its regulatory role in glycosaminoglycan interactions (Weiergräber2022Structure). CCL16's expression is constitutive in the liver, indicating its involvement in maintaining normal physiological processes in the liver and circulation (Nomiyama2001Human).

## Clinical Significance
CCL16, also known as liver-expressed chemokine, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in immune responses and cancer progression. In ovarian cancer, CCL16 is identified as a regulatory gene influencing multiple gene modules, contributing to tumor progression and inflammation (Lu2017Driver). It is prominently expressed in the liver and associated with ovarian and breast cancer, highlighting its role in cancer biology (Lu2017Driver).

In colorectal cancer, CCL16 acts as a chemoattractant for monocytes and lymphocytes, enhancing tumor rejection and immune responses. Its expression is linked to tumor location and stage, influencing antigen presentation and T cell cytotoxicity (Kim2008Gene). This suggests that CCL16 may play a role in the immune response alterations observed in colorectal cancer.

In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), studies have investigated polymorphisms in the CCL16 gene, although no significant association with MS was found in Australian cohorts (Bugeja2006An). Despite this, the gene's involvement in immune cell migration suggests potential implications in inflammatory diseases. Overall, CCL16's dysregulation may influence tumor microenvironments and inflammatory pathways, contributing to disease progression.

## Interactions
CCL16, also known as liver-expressed chemokine (LEC), primarily interacts with the CCR1 receptor on macrophages and vascular endothelial cells. This interaction is crucial for its role in recruiting and polarizing macrophages in the tumor microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma, promoting tumor progression by enhancing M2 macrophage infiltration (Dai2024Characterizing). CCL16's interaction with CCR1 also induces angiogenic responses in endothelial cells, facilitating their migration and differentiation into capillary-like structures (Strasly2004CCL16). 

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed that CCL16 predominantly binds to the CCR1 receptor, with minimal interaction with other receptors such as CCR2, CCR5, and CCR8 (Dai2024Characterizing). Cross-linking experiments with iodinated CCL16 have demonstrated a direct physical interaction with CCR1 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), further supporting its role in endothelial cell activation and angiogenesis (Strasly2004CCL16). 

CCL16 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), with its C-terminal region playing a significant role in modulating these interactions. The C-terminal extension of CCL16 can interfere with GAG binding, allowing the chemokine to circulate in the bloodstream without strong biological responses until activated by local inflammatory processes (Weiergräber2022Structure).
