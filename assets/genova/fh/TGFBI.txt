# TGFBI

## Overview
The TGFBI gene encodes the transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBIp), an extracellular matrix protein that plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion and migration. TGFBIp is characterized by its structural components, including an N-terminal secretory signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain, and four fasciclin 1 (FAS1) domains, which facilitate its interaction with integrins and other extracellular matrix components (Nielsen2020Biochemical; SKONIER1992cDNA). This protein is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues, particularly the corneal stroma, and is involved in processes such as wound healing and tissue remodeling (Yellore2011TGFB1Induced). Mutations in the TGFBI gene are linked to various corneal dystrophies, while alterations in its expression are associated with cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Du2020Identification; GarcíaCastellanos2017Structural).

## Structure
The TGFBI gene encodes the transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBIp), which is composed of 683 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 68 kDa (Ween2012Transforming; Corona2021The). The primary structure includes an N-terminal secretory signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain known as the CROPT domain, and four fasciclin 1 (FAS1) domains (FAS1-1 to FAS1-4) (Nielsen2020Biochemical; SKONIER1992cDNA). The CROPT domain contains six of the 11 cysteine residues in TGFBIp and is involved in disulfide bridge formation, contributing to the protein's structural stability (Nielsen2020Biochemical).

The secondary structure of TGFBIp includes beta-sheets and alpha-helices, particularly within the FAS1 domains, which are known for their role in mediating interactions with extracellular matrix proteins (Kannabiran2006TGFBI; Corona2021The). The tertiary structure of TGFBIp is characterized by an elongated banana shape, with the FAS1 domains arranged like pearls on a string, divided into a more compact left moiety and a flexible right moiety (Nielsen2020Biochemical).

TGFBIp can multimerize into dimers, trimers, and tetramers, indicating a quaternary structure, although it remains monomeric at low concentrations (Nielsen2020Biochemical). The protein also contains integrin-binding motifs, such as the RGD sequence, which are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and migration (Ween2012Transforming).

## Function
The TGFBI gene encodes the Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1-Induced (TGFBI) protein, which is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein widely expressed in human tissues. TGFBI plays a crucial role in mediating cell adhesion and migration by interacting with integrins, serving as a ligand for various integrin types such as αvβ3, αvβ5, α3β1, and α6β4 (Lee2011Accessible). The protein structure includes an N-terminal secretory signal peptide, a cysteine-rich EMI domain, four tandem repeats of fasciclin-1-like domains, and a C-terminal Arg-Gly-Asp integrin-binding sequence, which facilitates its interaction with ECM components like fibronectin, biglycan, decorin, and collagen (Lee2011Accessible).

In healthy tissues, TGFBI is ubiquitously expressed and contributes to maintaining normal cellular functions, including the structural integrity and function of the corneal stroma (Yellore2011TGFB1Induced). The protein is involved in extracellular matrix interactions, influencing processes such as wound healing and tissue remodeling, and is essential for maintaining corneal transparency (Yellore2011TGFB1Induced). TGFBI expression is regulated by chromatin structure and transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, which bind to the TGFBI promoter region, ensuring its constitutive expression (Lee2011Accessible).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TGFBI gene are primarily associated with various forms of corneal dystrophies, which are autosomal dominant disorders affecting the corneal stroma. These include granular corneal dystrophy types 1 and 2 (GCD1 and GCD2), lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD), Reis-Bücklers corneal dystrophy (RBCD), and Thiel-Behnke corneal dystrophy (TBCD) (Nielsen2020Biochemical; ChaoShern2019Evaluation; GarcíaCastellanos2017Structural). These conditions are characterized by the accumulation of insoluble mutated TGFBI protein in the cornea, leading to opacification and vision loss (GarcíaCastellanos2017Structural). Specific mutations, such as R124H, R124C, R124L, R555W, and R555Q, are linked to particular dystrophies, demonstrating a genotype-phenotype correlation (Nielsen2020Biochemical; ChaoShern2019Evaluation).

Alterations in TGFBI expression are also implicated in cancer progression. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high TGFBI expression is associated with worse survival outcomes and higher tumor stages (Du2020Identification). In gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, elevated TGFBI expression correlates with higher pathological grades and poorer patient survival (Pan2018Transforming). TGFBI's role in cancer is complex, as it can promote tumor progression through interactions with integrins and involvement in signaling pathways that influence cell adhesion and migration (Corona2021The).

## Interactions
TGFBI (transforming growth factor beta induced) is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, primarily through its integrin binding motifs. It binds to integrins such as αvβ3, αvβ5, α1β1, and α3β1, facilitating cell adhesion and migration (Ma2008Extracellular; Ween2012Transforming). TGFBI acts as a linker protein, connecting extracellular matrix (ECM) components like fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and collagens (Ween2012Transforming; Costanza2019Transforming). 

The interaction between TGFBI and integrin αvβ5 is particularly significant in promoting cell migration and invasion, as it activates the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway, which is crucial for these processes (Costanza2019Transforming). TGFBI also influences the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway through its interaction with integrin αvβ3, affecting cell adhesion and motility (Wang2024Novel). 

In cancer, TGFBI's interactions with integrins and ECM proteins contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. For instance, in colon cancer, TGFBI enhances metastasis by promoting transendothelial migration through the integrin αvβ5-Src signaling pathway (Ma2008Extracellular). These interactions underscore TGFBI's role in modulating cellular behavior and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
