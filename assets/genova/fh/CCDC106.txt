# CCDC106

## Overview
The CCDC106 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 106 protein, which is characterized by its structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular processes by interacting with the tumor suppressor protein p53, particularly influencing the p53-Mdm2/MdmX signaling axis, which is vital for cell proliferation and cancer therapy (Zhou2023Molecular). The CCDC106 protein undergoes phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2, a modification essential for its interaction with p53 and its subcellular localization (Ning2019CK2mediated). The gene has been implicated in cervical cancer, particularly through its integration with Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, which affects local chromosome architecture and gene expression, contributing to cancer progression (Cao2020HPVCCDC106). These attributes underscore the significance of CCDC106 in both normal cellular function and disease states, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Structure
The CCDC106 protein is composed of 280 amino acid residues and features a coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Zhou2023Molecular). Its structure includes a long α-helix flanked by two coils at the N-terminal region, while the C-terminal region forms a compact helix-rich structure. These regions are defined as the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of CCDC106, respectively (Zhou2023Molecular). 

Phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification of CCDC106, with protein kinase CK2 phosphorylating it at serine residues S130 and S147. This modification is crucial for its interaction with the tumor suppressor protein p53 and affects its subcellular localization. Phosphorylation at S130 is necessary for binding to p53, while S147 influences nuclear localization due to its proximity to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) located at residues 151-164 (Ning2019CK2mediated). 

The CCDC106 protein interacts with the p53 protein, particularly through its CTD, which binds to the transactivation domain (TAD) of p53, but not to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) (Zhou2023Molecular). This interaction plays a role in the regulation of the p53-Mdm2/MdmX signaling axis, which is important for cell proliferation and cancer therapy (Zhou2023Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC106 gene has been implicated in cervical cancer due to its integration with Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, particularly HPV16. This integration occurs at the fourth intron of the CCDC106 gene on chromosome 19 and is associated with significant alterations in local chromosome architecture and gene expression (Cao2020HPVCCDC106). The integration site is a hotspot for HPV, leading to changes in the three-dimensional genome structure, which affects enhancer-promoter interactions and results in the up-regulation of CCDC106 and down-regulation of tumor suppressor genes like PEG3 (Cao2020HPVCCDC106). 

The integration of HPV into CCDC106 is linked to genomic instability, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions or deletions (indels), and copy number variations (CNVs), which are associated with cervical cancer (Cao2020HPVCCDC106). High expression of CCDC106 correlates with poor disease-free survival in cervical cancer patients, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Cao2020HPVCCDC106). The integration also affects the degradation of p53, a crucial tumor suppressor protein, further contributing to cancer development (Cao2020HPVCCDC106). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCDC106 in the context of cervical cancer and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CCDC106 is known to interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53, playing a significant role in the p53-Mdm2/MdmX signaling axis. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of CCDC106 specifically binds to the N-terminal domain of p53, particularly the transactivation domain (TAD) and proline-rich domain (PRD), but not the DNA-binding domain (DBD) (Zhou2023Molecular). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of p53 activity, as CCDC106 competes with Mdm2 and MdmX for binding to p53, leading to the degradation of p53 and promoting cell proliferation in cancer cells (Zhou2023Molecular).

CCDC106 is also phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 at serine residues S130 and S147, which is essential for its interaction with p53. Phosphorylation at S130 is necessary for binding to p53, while S147 is important for nuclear localization (Ning2019CK2mediated). The interaction between CCDC106 and CK2β, a subunit of CK2, further supports the role of CK2-mediated phosphorylation in regulating CCDC106's function and its impact on p53 degradation (Ning2019CK2mediated). These interactions highlight CCDC106's involvement in modulating p53 stability and function, contributing to cancer progression.
