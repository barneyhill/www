# P4HTM

## Overview
The P4HTM gene encodes the enzyme prolyl 4-hydroxylase, transmembrane (P4H-TM), which is a member of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase family and functions as a transmembrane protein. This enzyme is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a critical role in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) by hydroxylating proline residues, a modification that targets HIF-α for degradation under normoxic conditions (Leinonen2016Lack; Myllyharju2008Prolyl). P4H-TM is characterized by its transmembrane domain and catalytic domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with calcium ions (Saeed2023Biallelic; Koivunen2007An). The gene is expressed in various tissues, with particularly high levels in the brain, and is involved in critical physiological processes such as oxygen sensing, erythropoiesis, and calcium signaling (Byts2020Transmembrane; Myllyharju2008Prolyl). Mutations in P4HTM are linked to several clinical conditions, including HIDEA syndrome and syndromic obesity, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological function (Saeed2023Biallelic; Rahikkala2019Biallelic).

## Structure
The P4HTM protein, encoded by the P4HTM gene, is a transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase with a complex molecular structure. It is a 563-residue protein, although a noncanonical transcript codes for a 502-residue variant, which is prevalent in normal human fibroblasts and myoblasts (Rahikkala2019Biallelic). The protein contains a transmembrane domain and a catalytic domain located within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (Koivunen2007An). 

P4HTM is characterized by an EF-hand motif involved in calcium binding and a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold, which are crucial for its catalytic function (Saeed2023Biallelic; Rahikkala2019Biallelic). The protein lacks the peptide substrate-binding domain typical of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (C-P4Hs) (Koivunen2007An). 

Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation, which affects its mobility and stability (Koivunen2007An). P4HTM can exist in both full-length and cleaved forms, with truncated versions lacking the transmembrane domain (Koivunen2007An). The protein forms a homodimer and is expressed in various human tissues, with high levels in the brain (Saeed2023Biallelic; Koivunen2007An).

## Function
The P4HTM gene encodes the enzyme prolyl 4-hydroxylase, transmembrane (P4H-TM), which is involved in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) through the hydroxylation of proline residues. This post-translational modification marks HIF-α for proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions, thereby regulating its stability and activity (Leinonen2016Lack; Saeed2023Biallelic). P4H-TM is a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, with its catalytic site inside the lumen (Myllyharju2008Prolyl). It is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and placenta, with particularly high expression in the brain (Myllyharju2008Prolyl).

In healthy cells, P4H-TM plays a crucial role in cellular oxygen sensing and maintaining normal physiological processes. It is involved in the regulation of erythropoietin (EPO) expression in the kidney, promoting erythropoiesis (Leinonen2016Lack). P4H-TM also influences calcium signaling and ATP metabolism in astrocytes, affecting vesicular exocytosis and mitochondrial function (Byts2020Transmembrane). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis under varying oxygen conditions, impacting processes such as angiogenesis and metabolism (Koivunen2007An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the P4HTM gene are associated with HIDEA syndrome, a condition characterized by hypotonia, hypoventilation, intellectual disability, dysautonomia, epilepsy, and eye abnormalities. These mutations lead to a loss of function in the P4HTM gene, resulting in insoluble protein products that disrupt normal cellular processes (Rahikkala2019Biallelic). Patients with HIDEA syndrome often exhibit developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and various visual abnormalities. Muscle biopsies from affected individuals show disrupted mitochondrial function, and autopsies reveal neurodegeneration (Rahikkala2019Biallelic).

In addition to HIDEA syndrome, biallelic mutations in P4HTM have been linked to syndromic obesity. This form of obesity is characterized by severe early-onset obesity, hypotonia, developmental delay, and cognitive impairment. The mutations identified in these cases are typically missense mutations, which differ from the loss-of-function mutations seen in HIDEA syndrome, suggesting allelic heterogeneity (Saeed2023Biallelic).

The P4HTM gene is also implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I deficiency, which is associated with severe neonatal hypotonia, intellectual disability, and recurrent pneumonias (Hay2021Biallelic). These findings highlight the diverse clinical manifestations resulting from P4HTM gene mutations.

## Interactions
P4H-TM, a member of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase family, is involved in various interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is part of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2OGDD) family. The enzyme contains a unique combination of a Ca2+-binding EF-domain and a catalytic domain within the ER lumen, which suggests potential interactions with calcium ions that may regulate its activity (Myllykoski2020Structure).

P4H-TM is implicated in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), contributing to its degradation and the regulation of erythropoietin (EPO) (Myllykoski2020Structure). The enzyme's role in HIF regulation suggests interactions with components of the HIF pathway, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In astrocytes, P4H-TM influences calcium signaling, potentially interacting with calcium transport proteins and pathways, as evidenced by changes in the expression of calcium-sequestering ATPases and calcium entry mechanisms in P4H-TM knockout models (Byts2020Transmembrane).

The enzyme's cytoplasmic N-terminus may also interact with unknown partners, as its role and interactions remain largely unexplored (Myllykoski2020Structure).
