# SLC35C2

## Overview
The SLC35C2 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member C2, which is a transmembrane protein primarily involved in the transport of GDP-fucose, a critical substrate for the fucosylation of proteins. This protein is integral to the fucosylation process of Notch receptors, which is essential for optimal Notch signaling, a pathway that plays a pivotal role in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. SLC35C2 is localized in the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), indicating its involvement in the secretory pathway and glycosylation processes. The protein's function is crucial for the synthesis of O-fucose glycans on Notch, which are necessary for effective signaling. Disruption of SLC35C2 activity can lead to impaired Notch signaling, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and physiological functions (Lu2010Slc35c2).

## Function
The SLC35C2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the fucosylation process of Notch receptors, which is essential for optimal Notch signaling in mammalian cells. Notch signaling is a fundamental pathway influencing cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. SLC35C2 is proposed to function as a GDP-fucose transporter, facilitating the fucosylation of Notch1 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, a modification necessary for effective signaling (Lu2010Slc35c2).

SLC35C2 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), suggesting its involvement in the secretory pathway and glycosylation processes (Lu2010Slc35c2). The protein's activity is crucial for the synthesis of O-fucose glycans on Notch, which are critical for Notch signaling (Lu2010Slc35c2). Knockdown of SLC35C2 results in a significant reduction in Notch1 activation, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper Notch signaling (Lu2010Slc35c2).

SLC35C2's role in fucosylation and Notch signaling underscores its importance in cellular processes that depend on these pathways, affecting various physiological functions in healthy human cells (Lu2010Slc35c2).
