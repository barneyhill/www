# FBXL4

## Overview
FBXL4 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 4, a member of the F-box protein family characterized by the presence of an F-box domain and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial maintenance and energy metabolism. It is involved in mitochondrial quality control, maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, and ensuring the stability of mitochondrial respiratory complexes. FBXL4 localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is part of a larger quaternary complex, contributing to bioenergetic homeostasis and preventing excessive mitochondrial degradation (Emperador2020Molecular; Antoun2015Detailed). Mutations in the FBXL4 gene are linked to mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 13 (MTDPS13), a condition marked by severe mitochondrial dysfunction and a range of clinical symptoms (Emperador2020Molecular; Ballout2019FBXL4Related).

## Structure
The FBXL4 protein is a member of the F-box protein family, characterized by the presence of an F-box domain and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The F-box domain, located between the 277th and 332nd amino acids, is crucial for its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating interactions with SKP1 in the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box) complex (haydu2015roles; Li2009Expression). The LRRs are located in the C-terminus and are involved in substrate recognition, forming a solenoid structure with a superhelical arrangement that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Matsushima2019Leucine; haydu2015roles).

FBXL4 contains a mitochondrial localization sequence, indicating its role in mitochondrial functions (haydu2015roles). The protein is predicted to interact with specific substrates, such as the nuclear histone demethylase KDM4A/JMJD2A, through its LRRs (haydu2015roles). Mutations in FBXL4, particularly those affecting the LRRs, can lead to structural instability and are associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (Matsushima2019Leucine; Emperador2020Molecular). The protein is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation, with a half-life of less than two hours, highlighting its dynamic regulation within the cell (haydu2015roles).

## Function
The FBXL4 gene encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 4, which is involved in mitochondrial maintenance and energy metabolism. In healthy human cells, FBXL4 is hypothesized to play a role in mitochondrial quality control, similar to the PINK1-dependent recruitment of parkin, another E3 ubiquitin ligase (Antoun2015Detailed). It is part of the F-box protein family, which typically serves as substrate adaptors in Skp1-cullin1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase protein complexes, although SCF-independent functions are also possible (Alsina2020FBXL).

FBXL4 localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is part of a 400 kDa quaternary complex (Antoun2015Detailed). It is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and the stability of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, playing a critical role in the maintenance of mtDNA and bioenergetic homeostasis (Emperador2020Molecular). FBXL4 prevents excessive mitochondrial degradation via lysosomes, maintaining mitochondrial content and function (Alsina2020FBXL). Its deficiency leads to increased mitochondrial turnover and decreased mitochondrial content, suggesting its role in mitochondrial quality control (Alsina2020FBXL). The protein is also implicated in regulating mitochondrial morphology and autophagy, maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function in healthy cells (Emperador2020Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FBXL4 gene are associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 13 (MTDPS13), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by a range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delay, generalized hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and severe encephalopathy. Patients often present with symptoms such as failure to thrive, neurodevelopmental delays, and persistent lactic acidosis, with onset typically from birth to two years (Emperador2020Molecular; Ballout2019FBXL4Related). 

FBXL4 mutations lead to mitochondrial dysfunction by causing mtDNA depletion and impairing oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in decreased mitochondrial content and increased mitochondrial removal by autophagy (Alsina2020FBXL; Emperador2020Molecular). The condition often results in severe psychomotor retardation and early childhood mortality (Emperador2020Molecular). 

Studies have identified various mutations in FBXL4, including splice site, missense, and frameshift variants, which have been confirmed to be pathogenic through genetic complementation assays (Emperador2020Molecular). The variability in genotype-to-phenotype correlation among patients suggests a complex relationship between specific mutations and clinical outcomes (Ballout2019FBXL4Related).

## Interactions
FBXL4 is known to participate in physical interactions with other proteins, particularly within the context of its role in prostate cancer and mitochondrial function. In prostate cancer, FBXL4 has been shown to interact with ERLEC1, a luminal resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction was confirmed through immunoprecipitation and western blot techniques. The study suggests that FBXL4 targets ERLEC1 for degradation, as overexpression of FBXL4 leads to the downregulation of ERLEC1 protein levels. This interaction may play a role in preventing cancer metastasis by regulating ERLEC1 levels, which are associated with increased tolerance to hypoxia and stress in cancer cells (Stankiewicz2017Identification).

FBXL4 is also implicated in mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 13 (MTDPS13), where it is involved in mitochondrial dynamics and maintenance. Although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed, FBXL4's role in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial fusion suggests it may interact with proteins involved in these processes (Ballout2019FBXL4Related). The precise mechanisms and interactions remain a subject of ongoing research.
