# CAB39

## Overview
CAB39 is a gene that encodes the protein calcium-binding protein 39, which is integral to various cellular signaling pathways. This protein functions primarily as a regulatory subunit within the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex, playing a pivotal role in the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and related kinases, which are crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and regulating metabolism (Gagnon2012Molecular). As a scaffolding protein, CAB39 stabilizes the STK11 (LKB1) complex, influencing processes such as stress response, cell polarity, and ion transport regulation through its interactions with SPAK/OSR1 kinases (Gagnon2012Molecular). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, including its emerging role in cancer progression (Chao2021CAB39).

## Function
CAB39, also known as calcium binding protein 39, plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. It functions as a regulatory subunit of the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex, which is essential for the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and related kinases. This activation is significant for maintaining energy homeostasis, regulating cell growth, and managing metabolism in healthy human cells (Gagnon2012Molecular).

In mammals, CAB39 was initially cloned from a two-cell cleavage stage mouse embryo and is known to have fundamental roles during development and in various adult cell types. CAB39α, a variant of CAB39, acts as a critical scaffolding subunit stabilizing STK11 (LKB1). The STK11/MO25/STRAD complex, which functions upstream of AMPK protein kinases, may also regulate cation-chloride cotransporter function (Gagnon2012Molecular).

CAB39 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences various cellular processes, including stress response and cell polarity. It is involved in stabilizing mutant kinases in an active conformation, suggesting an alternative activation mechanism that may bypass the need for phosphorylation of certain residues (Gagnon2012Molecular). CAB39's interaction with SPAK/OSR1 kinases further highlights its role in regulating ion transport and cellular signaling pathways (Gagnon2012Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAB39 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In bladder cancer, elevated CAB39 expression is associated with more severe malignancy, including lymph node metastasis and poor survival outcomes. CAB39 facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the NF-kB signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Chao2021CAB39). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, high CAB39 expression correlates with advanced disease stages and promotes cell proliferation through the JNK signaling pathway (p&gt; CAB39; Peng2020&lt).

In gastric cancer, CAB39 is targeted by miR-1265, which regulates cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Higher CAB39 expression is linked to larger tumor size and lower survival rates, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Xu2019MIR1265). In glioma, miR-451 targets CAB39, affecting the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and invasion. This interaction highlights CAB39's involvement in tumor growth and metastasis (Zhong2011MicroRNA).

CAB39 also plays a role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by interacting with miR-451a, which influences tumor progression through immune evasion mechanisms (Wang2024miR451a). These findings suggest that CAB39 is a potential therapeutic target in various cancers due to its involvement in key signaling pathways.

## Interactions
CAB39, also known as calcium-binding protein 39, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. CAB39 interacts with WNK4, a serine/threonine kinase, which is essential for the activation of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter NKCC1. This interaction is not affected by mutations at specific residues in CAB39, indicating a unique binding mode compared to other proteins (PonceCoria2014A). CAB39 also interacts with SPAK, another kinase, but mutations in CAB39 can inhibit this interaction, suggesting different binding mechanisms for WNK4 and SPAK (PonceCoria2014A).

CAB39 acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the activation of SPAK and OSR1 kinases, which are involved in the regulation of NKCC1. It helps these kinases reach an active conformation, although CAB39 alone does not activate NKCC1 (PonceCoria2012Calciumbinding). CAB39 also interacts with STRADα, a pseudo-kinase, in a manner similar to its interaction with SPAK (PonceCoria2014A). Additionally, CAB39's interaction with LKB1/STK11, a kinase involved in energy metabolism, is facilitated by a specific residue, although this does not affect NKCC1 activation by the WNK4-CAB39 complex (PonceCoria2014A).
