# ARHGAP44

## Overview
ARHGAP44 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase-activating protein 44, a member of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of Rho GTPases, including CDC42 and RAC1, which are essential for the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton and various cellular processes such as cell morphology, growth, and migration (Shen2023Pancancer; Shen2024ARHGAP44). ARHGAP44 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the organization of cell projections and neuronal development, particularly in spine formation and synaptic plasticity (Shen2024ARHGAP44; Shen2023Pancancer). The gene's expression and genetic alterations have significant implications in cancer prognosis and progression, with varying expression levels observed across different cancer types (Shen2024ARHGAP44; Shen2023Pancancer).

## Structure


## Function
ARHGAP44, also known as Rho GTPase-activating protein 44, is involved in the regulation of Rho GTPases, specifically CDC42 and RAC1, which are crucial for cytoskeleton dynamics. These GTPases play a significant role in maintaining cell morphology, growth, cycle progression, and migration by modulating the actin cytoskeleton (Shen2023Pancancer; Shen2024ARHGAP44). ARHGAP44 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), promoting the inactivation of Rho GTPases by facilitating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thus cycling them between their active and inactive states (Shen2024ARHGAP44).

In healthy human cells, ARHGAP44 is active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in the organization of plasma membrane-bounded cell projections, which are enriched in polymerized actin and myosin patches (Shen2023Pancancer). This protein is also involved in neuronal development, particularly in spine formation and synaptic plasticity, indicating its role in neural function (Shen2024ARHGAP44). By regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, ARHGAP44 contributes to various cellular processes, including cell shape maintenance and motility, which are essential for normal cellular function and organismal development (Shen2023Pancancer).

## Clinical Significance
The ARHGAP44 gene, also known as Rho GTPase-activating protein 44, is implicated in various human cancers, with its expression levels and genetic alterations playing significant roles in cancer prognosis and progression. Altered expression of ARHGAP44 is observed in multiple cancers, being downregulated in bladder cancer, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, low-grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, skin cutaneous melanoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. Conversely, it is upregulated in cholangiocarcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, kidney chromophobe, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and thymoma (Shen2024ARHGAP44; Shen2023Pancancer).

High ARHGAP44 expression is associated with better survival outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma, rectal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, but correlates with worse outcomes in breast cancer, lung squamous cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal carcinoma (Shen2024ARHGAP44; Shen2023Pancancer). Genetic alterations, including mutations, deletions, and amplifications, are noted in various tumors, with single nucleotide mutations observed in skin cutaneous melanoma, uterine endometrioid carcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Shen2024ARHGAP44; Shen2023Pancancer). These alterations suggest a role for ARHGAP44 in DNA repair mechanisms, particularly through its correlation with homologous recombination repair genes (Shen2024ARHGAP44; Shen2023Pancancer).

## Interactions
ARHGAP44 is known to interact with several proteins within the Rho family of GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics and cell signaling. ARHGAP44 functions by enhancing the intrinsic GTPase activity of these proteins, leading to their inactivation. This inactivation is a key regulatory mechanism that modulates the activity of Rho GTPases, thereby influencing cellular functions controlled by these proteins. The interactions between ARHGAP44 and the Rho GTPases are typically transient, as ARHGAP44 acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) to facilitate the conversion of the active GTP-bound form of the GTPases to their inactive GDP-bound form. This regulatory role of ARHGAP44 is essential for maintaining the balance of active and inactive states of Rho GTPases, which is critical for proper cellular function. The precise mechanisms and additional interacting partners of ARHGAP44 may vary, but its primary role in modulating the activity of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 is well-established.
