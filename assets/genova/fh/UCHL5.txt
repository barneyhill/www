# UCHL5

## Overview
UCHL5, or ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L5, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme belonging to the ubiquitin hydrolase family. The protein product of UCHL5 plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and turnover in human cells. As a deubiquitinating enzyme, UCHL5 is involved in the hydrolysis of ubiquitin from polyubiquitin chains, thereby regulating protein stability and degradation. It is characterized by a conserved papain-like catalytic domain and a ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) that modulates its activity through interactions with other proteins. UCHL5 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and key signaling pathways such as Hedgehog and Wnt/β-catenin. Its dysregulation is associated with several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Han2022UCHL5; Xu2024Potential; Sahtoe2015Mechanism).

## Structure
UCHL5, also known as ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L5, is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by a conserved papain-like catalytic domain. This domain includes a flexible active site cross-over loop (CL) that is crucial for substrate selection based on the size of the leaving group (Sahtoe2015Mechanism). UCHL5 also features a C-terminal helical extension known as the ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), which plays a role in protein-protein interactions and can act as an auto-inhibitory module (Sahtoe2015Mechanism).

The enzyme's activity is modulated by DEUBAD domains from proteins such as RPN13 and INO80G. These domains bind primarily to the C-terminal ULD domain of UCHL5, inducing conformational changes that either activate or inhibit its catalytic function. The RPN13 DEUBAD domain activates UCHL5 by stabilizing the ULD in a substrate-binding-competent conformation, while the INO80G DEUBAD domain inhibits it by blocking ubiquitin binding (Sahtoe2015Mechanism).

Structurally, UCHL5's interaction with ubiquitin involves specific residues and structural rearrangements, such as the repositioning of Trp36 and the partial melting of helix a8, which are conserved across the UCH family (Sahtoe2015Mechanism). The enzyme's oligomeric state may also influence its regulatory mechanisms (Sahtoe2015Mechanism).

## Function
UCHL5, also known as ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L5, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and turnover in human cells. It is involved in the hydrolysis of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, a process essential for protein degradation via the proteasome (Sahtoe2015Mechanism). UCHL5 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences processes such as cell cycle progression and DNA repair, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Yao2008Distinct).

In the proteasome, UCHL5 is activated by the RPN13 subunit, which enhances its deubiquitinating activity, while in the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, its activity is inhibited by the INO80G subunit (Sahtoe2015Mechanism). UCHL5 also plays a role in the regulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway by deubiquitinating the Smoothened (Smo) protein, thereby stabilizing it and promoting pathway activity (Zhou2017The). Additionally, UCHL5 is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it stabilizes Axin1, a key component of the β-catenin destruction complex, by preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Han2022UCHL5). These functions highlight UCHL5's critical role in maintaining protein stability and regulating key signaling pathways in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
UCHL5 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in stabilizing oncogenic proteins and degrading tumor suppressors, which promotes cancer cell survival and proliferation. Overexpression of UCHL5 is associated with poor survival outcomes in multiple myeloma, large cell lung carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma, plasma cell myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, and invasive breast carcinoma (Xu2024Potential). In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), UCHL5 expression is increased, correlating with decreased antigen processing and presentation, suggesting an immunosuppressive role (Zhang2024UCHL5). UCHL5 is also a potential prognostic marker in RCC due to its increased abundance in the blood of patients (Zhang2024UCHL5).

In Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, UCHL5 expression is elevated, and its inhibition, along with USP14, using VLX1570, induces apoptosis in drug-resistant cells (Paulus2016Coinhibition). In multiple myeloma, UCHL5 is highly expressed, and its inhibition by b-AP15 leads to decreased cell viability and overcomes resistance to bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor (Tian2014A). These findings highlight UCHL5 as a significant target for therapeutic interventions in various cancers.

## Interactions
UCHL5, also known as ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L5, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that participates in various protein interactions, influencing multiple cellular pathways. It interacts with the DEUBAD domains of RPN13 and INO80G, which have opposing effects on its activity. The DEUBAD domain of RPN13 activates UCHL5, enhancing its substrate-binding ability, while the DEUBAD domain of INO80G inhibits it by preventing ubiquitin binding (Sahtoe2015Mechanism).

UCHL5 is also involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it interacts with Axin1, a key component of the β-catenin destruction complex. This interaction stabilizes Axin1 and is crucial for maintaining its physiological levels, although UCHL5's deubiquitinating activity is not essential for this stabilization (Han2022UCHL5). UCHL5's role in stabilizing Axin1 involves blocking its ubiquitination, potentially by physically obstructing an unknown E3 ligase (Han2022UCHL5).

In the context of the proteasome, UCHL5 interacts with hRpn13, a component of the 19S regulatory particle, although this interaction is independent of the Pru domain of hRpn13 (OseiAmponsa2020Impact). These interactions highlight UCHL5's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
