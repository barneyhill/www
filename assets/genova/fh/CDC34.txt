# CDC34

## Overview
The CDC34 gene encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, known as cell division cycle 34 (CDC34), which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a critical mechanism for protein degradation and regulation in eukaryotic cells. As an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, CDC34 is integral to cell cycle regulation, particularly in facilitating the transition from the G1 to the S phase by targeting key regulatory proteins for degradation. The protein's structure is characterized by a ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain and a unique C-terminal extension that interacts with the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, essential for its function in polyubiquitination. CDC34's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and it is involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and DNA repair. The gene's evolutionary conservation across species underscores its fundamental role in cellular homeostasis. Alterations in CDC34 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2020Systematic; Gazdoiu2007Human; Plon1993Cloning).

## Structure
The CDC34 protein is a human E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in cell cycle regulation. Its primary structure consists of 298 amino acids, with a high degree of homology to the yeast CDC34, particularly around the active-site cysteine (Plon1993Cloning). The secondary structure of CDC34 includes a four-stranded antiparallel beta sheet flanked by four alpha helices, with the catalytic cysteine residue Cys93 located in the beta4-alpha2 connector (Ceccarelli2011An).

The tertiary structure of CDC34 reveals unique features, such as an acidic loop and a long C-terminal extension. This extension is involved in interactions with ubiquitin and the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the Cdc34~Ub thioester in a closed conformation necessary for ubiquitin discharge (Williams2019Structural). The C-terminal domain (CTD) is essential for polyubiquitination and cell cycle progression, with mutations in this region leading to defects in ubiquitination and cell cycle regulation (Williams2019Structural).

CDC34 also contains specific domains like the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) domain, and its structure is characterized by prominent folds that facilitate its enzymatic activity. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its function (Williams2019Structural). The presence of non-covalent ubiquitin binding motifs, UBS1 and UBS2, further supports its role in ubiquitination (Choi2010The).

## Function
The CDC34 gene encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation of various biological processes in human cells. CDC34 works in conjunction with the Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box protein-ROC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase to catalyze the polyubiquitination of substrates, marking them for degradation by the 26S proteasome (Gazdoiu2007Human). This process is vital for maintaining cellular functions such as cell growth, signal transduction, and genomic integrity. CDC34 is particularly important in cell cycle regulation, facilitating the transition from the G1 to the S phase by targeting regulatory proteins like cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors for degradation (Pati1999Human; Mathias1996Cdc53p).

In addition to its role in cell cycle progression, CDC34 is involved in the regulation of transcription by targeting specific repressor proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This activity influences transcriptional activity in response to signaling pathways like cyclic AMP (cAMP) (Pati1999Human). CDC34 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to processes such as DNA replication and repair (Tanaka2001Enhanced). Its function is conserved across species, as human CDC34 can substitute for its yeast counterpart, underscoring its essential role in cellular regulation (Plon1993Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDC34 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In NSCLC, CDC34 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, particularly in stage 1 patients. Its expression is significantly higher in lung tumors compared to normal tissues, with a pronounced increase in smokers. This overexpression is linked to shorter survival times and is induced by tobacco carcinogens (Zhao2020Systematic). CDC34 promotes NSCLC cell proliferation by stabilizing the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), preventing its degradation, and enhancing its signaling pathways. This stabilization is crucial for lung carcinogenesis, as EGFR is often hyperactivated in NSCLC (Zhao2020Systematic).

In HCC, CDC34 is also overexpressed, with higher levels correlating with more aggressive tumor grades. This overexpression is significant in poorly differentiated HCCs, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Tanaka2001Enhanced). CDC34's interaction with EGFR and its competition with c-Cbl, an E3 ligase, for binding to EGFR, further underscores its role in tumorigenesis by preventing EGFR degradation (Zhao2020Systematic). These findings highlight CDC34 as a potential therapeutic target in cancers where it is overexpressed.

## Interactions
The CDC34 protein, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate its role in ubiquitination and cell cycle regulation. CDC34 interacts with the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, specifically binding to the SCF RING subcomplex through its C-terminal region. This interaction is essential for SCF-dependent ubiquitination, which involves the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins (Choi2010The). The C-terminal region of CDC34 contains two motifs, UBS1 and UBS2, which directly interact with ubiquitin, enhancing the enzyme's binding affinity and facilitating ubiquitin chain assembly (Choi2010The).

CDC34 also forms a multiprotein complex with CDC4 and CDC53, which is crucial for the G1-to-S phase transition in the cell cycle. This complex is involved in the degradation of G1 cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (Mathias1996Cdc53p). CDC34 interacts with CDC53, which acts as a scaffold protein, bridging CDC34 to Skp1 and F-box proteins, thereby facilitating the function of SCF complexes (Patton1998Cdc53). These interactions underscore CDC34's pivotal role in regulating protein degradation and cell cycle progression.
