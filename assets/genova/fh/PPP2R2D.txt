# PPP2R2D

## Overview
The PPP2R2D gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit Bdelta, a critical component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit, influencing the activity of PP2A, a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, division, and signal transduction. The regulatory subunit Bdelta plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, particularly in T cells, by regulating the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a key cytokine for T cell proliferation and function (Pan2020PPP2R2D). Through its interactions with other proteins and its involvement in chromatin accessibility and transcription factor dephosphorylation, PPP2R2D is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune responses (Pan2020PPP2R2D). Additionally, PPP2R2D's participation in the PP2A and PP4 systems highlights its versatile role in cellular regulation and its potential impact on various physiological and pathological processes (Zhang2016Quantitative; Glatter2009An).

## Function
PPP2R2D encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses in T cells. In healthy human cells, PPP2R2D is involved in the regulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, a cytokine essential for T cell proliferation and function. Following T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, PPP2R2D expression increases, leading to the suppression of IL-2 production. This regulation is achieved through the modulation of chromatin accessibility at the IL-2 gene locus and the dephosphorylation of transcription factors such as CREB, which are involved in IL-2 transcription (Pan2020PPP2R2D).

PPP2R2D acts as a negative regulator of IL-2 production by maintaining chromatin structure and transcriptional control, thereby influencing T cell signaling and immune response modulation. Its activity is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune responses, which could lead to autoimmune conditions (Pan2020PPP2R2D). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation and stability (Pan2020PPP2R2D).

## Interactions
PPP2R2D, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is part of the PP2A core module, which includes catalytic and scaffolding subunits, forming a highly connected network of phosphatase complexes (Glatter2009An). PPP2R2D has been identified in complexes with both PP2A and PP4 systems, indicating its role in interchangeable subunit assembly between these phosphatase systems. Specifically, PPP2R2D, along with PPP2R1A and PPP2R5D, was found in complexes with PPP4C, the catalytic subunit of PP4, suggesting a degree of overlap between PP2A and PP4 complexes (Glatter2009An).

In pancreatic β-cells, PPP2R2D interacts with the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), as identified through coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. This interaction is part of a dynamic network that responds to glucose levels, highlighting the regulatory role of PPP2R2D in β-cell function (Zhang2016Quantitative). These interactions underscore the importance of PPP2R2D in modulating phosphatase activity and its potential involvement in diverse cellular processes, including DNA damage control and immune regulation.
