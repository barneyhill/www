# SLC25A14

## Overview
The SLC25A14 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 14, also known as uncoupling protein 5 (UCP5), which is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family. This protein is characterized by its role as a transmembrane transporter, primarily involved in the regulation of mitochondrial proton conductance. UCP5 facilitates the dissipation of the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, thereby modulating mitochondrial membrane potential and contributing to energy metabolism and thermogenesis. Predominantly expressed in the brain, UCP5 plays a crucial role in controlling the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitigating oxidative stress, which is vital for maintaining cellular health (Palmieri2013The; Palmieri2004The). The gene's expression and the protein's function are subject to regulation by factors such as fatty acids and purine nucleotides, which influence its activity as an H+ transporter (Palmieri2004The).

## Structure
The SLC25A14 gene encodes the protein UCP5, a member of the mitochondrial carrier family characterized by a tripartite structure with three tandemly repeated homologous domains, each approximately 100 amino acids long (Palmieri2004The). These domains contain two hydrophobic stretches that span the membrane as alpha-helices, separated by hydrophilic regions (Palmieri2004The). The protein typically consists of six transmembrane alpha-helices, forming a channel-like structure that facilitates the transport of molecules across the mitochondrial membrane (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational).

The SLC25A14 protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and localization. Alternative splicing of the SLC25A14 gene can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting the protein's function and tissue-specific expression. The protein is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in the transport of inorganic anions, such as sulfate and thiosulfate, as well as dicarboxylates and other metabolites (Gorgoglione2019The). The structural features of SLC25A14, including its transmembrane helices and conserved sequence motifs, are crucial for its transport mechanism (Palmieri2013The).

## Function
SLC25A14, also known as UCP5, is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family involved in the regulation of mitochondrial proton conductance. It functions as an uncoupling protein, facilitating the dissipation of the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This process reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is crucial for regulating energy metabolism and thermogenesis in cells (Palmieri2004The). UCP5 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a role in controlling the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. This activity helps to mitigate oxidative stress, which is important for maintaining cellular health and function (Palmieri2004The).

The activity of UCP5 is influenced by factors such as fatty acids and purine nucleotides, which modulate its function as an H+ transporter. By dissipating the proton gradient, UCP5 contributes to the regulation of body temperature and the control of oxygen radical production, which are essential for normal physiological processes (Palmieri2004The). Although the specific molecular mechanisms of SLC25A14 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its role in mitochondrial uncoupling highlights its importance in cellular energy balance and protection against oxidative damage.
