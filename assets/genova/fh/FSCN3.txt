# FSCN3

## Overview
FSCN3, or fascin actin-bundling protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the fascin family of actin-bundling proteins. These proteins are integral to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell structure and facilitating cell movement. The FSCN3 protein is characterized by its monomeric, globular structure and contains multiple actin-binding sites, allowing it to bundle actin filaments in a calcium-independent manner (Rajan2023Actin). FSCN3 is predominantly expressed in mature spermatozoa, where it is believed to play a role in microfilament rearrangements during fertilization (Rajan2023Actin). While its specific functions in other tissues are not well-documented, FSCN3's involvement in actin filament organization suggests its potential importance in various cellular processes that require dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements (Lin2023Comprehensive). Additionally, FSCN3 has been studied in the context of certain cancers, where its expression levels and genetic mutations have been linked to disease progression and prognosis (Liu2023Identification; Lin2023Comprehensive).

## Structure
FSCN3, or fascin actin-bundling protein 3, is a member of the fascin family of proteins, which are known for their role in actin filament bundling. The primary structure of FSCN3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a monomeric, globular protein with an approximate molecular weight of 55 kiloDaltons (Groen2024Novel; Lamb2020Fascin). The secondary structure of fascin proteins includes four β-trefoil domains, each composed of six two-stranded β-hairpins arranged in a trifold symmetry, forming a small barrel shape with a "cap" (Groen2024Novel; Lamb2020Fascin).

The tertiary structure of FSCN3 is characterized by these β-trefoil domains, which are arranged in a pseudo-two-fold symmetry, yielding three putative actin-binding sites (Rajan2023Actin). These sites allow FSCN3 to bind and bundle actin filaments in a calcium-independent manner, leading to the formation of compact and dense actin bundles (Rajan2023Actin). The quaternary structure of FSCN3 is not explicitly detailed, but fascin proteins typically function as monomers, unlike many other actin-bundling proteins that operate as dimers (Lamb2020Fascin).

FSCN3 is subject to regulation through post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions, which influence its actin-bundling activity (Rajan2023Actin). The protein is expressed specifically in mature spermatozoa, where it may contribute to microfilament rearrangements during fertilization (Rajan2023Actin).

## Function
FSCN3, or fascin actin-bundling protein 3, is a protein involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a crucial role in bundling actin filaments. This function is essential for maintaining cell structure and facilitating cell movement. FSCN3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to processes such as cell migration and stability. In healthy human cells, FSCN3 is described as testis-specific and may play a role in the terminal elongation of the spermatid head, which is a critical step in sperm development (Lin2023Comprehensive). The protein's involvement in actin filament organization suggests its importance in cellular processes that require dynamic changes in cell shape and motility. While the specific functions of FSCN3 in other tissues or cell types are not well-documented, its role in actin bundling indicates a potential involvement in various cellular activities that depend on cytoskeletal rearrangements. The study of FSCN3 in the context of cancer, particularly kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, highlights its upregulation in certain pathological conditions, although its precise function in healthy cells remains less explored (Lin2023Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
FSCN3 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly related to male infertility and cancer. In the context of male infertility, FSCN3 is significantly down-regulated in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition characterized by a lack of sperm in the semen due to impaired spermatogenesis. This down-regulation suggests that FSCN3 may serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosing NOA and understanding its underlying molecular mechanisms (Liu2023Identification).

In testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), FSCN3 is also notably down-regulated, and its methylation levels are higher compared to normal samples. This alteration in expression and methylation suggests a role in the occurrence and progression of TGCT, making FSCN3 a potential diagnostic biomarker for this type of cancer (Liu2023Identification).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (KIRC), FSCN3 expression is elevated, and genetic mutations in FSCN3 are associated with poorer prognosis, particularly in terms of progression-free survival. These findings indicate that FSCN3 may play a role in cancer progression and could serve as a prognostic marker in KIRC (Lin2023Comprehensive).
