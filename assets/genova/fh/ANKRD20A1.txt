# ANKRD20A1

## Overview
ANKRD20A1 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 20 family member A1, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction capabilities. While the specific biological functions of ANKRD20A1 remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including type 2 diabetes and cancer. The gene's expression and potential regulatory roles in different tissues highlight its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Li2020Identification; Brewer2023Integrating; Torres2017Integrative).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ANKRD20A1 has been identified as a novel gene associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly showing significant association in breast mammary tissue. This gene is located beyond the intervals of known T2D-associated SNPs, indicating its presence in novel loci that might not be detected in traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Torres2017Integrative).

In the context of breast cancer, ANKRD20A1 is noted for its underexpression in deletion peaks at the 9p21.11 region in breast cancers derived from women with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS). However, its role in breast carcinogenesis in PHTS is not well understood, and the gene is suggested to have little evidence of significance in breast cancer, warranting further investigation (Brewer2023Integrating).

In osteogenic differentiation, the long non-coding RNA linc-ANKRD20A1-4, associated with ANKRD20A1, is upregulated in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells from patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). This suggests a potential regulatory role in osteogenesis, although the specific clinical significance of ANKRD20A1 gene mutations or expression alterations in this context is not directly addressed (Li2020Identification).
