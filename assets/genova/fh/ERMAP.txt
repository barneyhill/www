# ERMAP

## Overview
ERMAP, or erythroblast membrane-associated protein, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein predominantly expressed on erythroid cells. This protein is a key component of the Scianna blood group system and is characterized by an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, which suggests its involvement in cell adhesion and signal transduction processes specific to erythroid cells (DENOMME2004The). The intracellular region of the protein contains a conserved B30.2 domain and several kinase-dependent phosphorylation motifs, indicating its potential role in intracellular signaling pathways (DENOMME2004The). ERMAP is implicated in various biological interactions, including those related to immune response modulation and pathogen interactions, such as with Plasmodium falciparum in malaria (Das2019Computational). Additionally, ERMAP has been studied for its regulatory role in immune responses in Alzheimer's disease and its association with cytokine production in hepatitis E virus research (Corneillie2023Virus–Host; Liu2021Administration).

## Structure
The ERMAP protein, associated with the Scianna blood group system, is a type I transmembrane protein expressed exclusively on erythroid cells. It is predicted to have a single extracellular transmembrane immunoglobulin-like domain, which suggests a role in cell adhesion or signal transduction specific to erythroid cells (DENOMME2004The). The intracellular region of ERMAP contains a conserved B30.2 domain and multiple kinase-dependent phosphorylation consensus motifs, indicating potential involvement in signaling pathways (DENOMME2004The).

ERMAP may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common in membrane proteins and can affect protein folding, stability, and interactions (DENOMME2004The). The protein's structure includes an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic tail, but specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature (Téletchéa2019Repository; DENOMME2004The).

The ERMAP gene may also produce splice variant isoforms, which could result in proteins with different functional properties or cellular localizations, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context provided (DENOMME2004The).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ERMAP, or erythroblast membrane-associated protein, is involved in various interactions that influence immune response and cell adhesion. In the context of malaria infection, ERMAP interacts with Plasmodium falciparum proteins, such as erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). This interaction is significant for cytoadhesion and immune modulation, aiding the parasite in evading the human immune system (Das2019Computational).

In Alzheimer's disease research, ERMAP has been identified as a novel immune regulator. It affects T cell and macrophage functions, inhibiting T cell activity and promoting the generation of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. An anti-ERMAP monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been developed to neutralize its inhibitory activity on T cells, enhancing macrophage phagocytosis of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and improving cognitive performance in AD mouse models (Liu2021Administration).

ERMAP is also mentioned in the context of hepatitis E virus (HEV) research, where it is associated with the regulation of cytokine production. However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Corneillie2023Virus–Host).
