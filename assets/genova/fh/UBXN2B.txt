# UBXN2B

## Overview
UBXN2B is a gene that encodes the UBX domain protein 2B, also known as p37, which is a crucial regulatory protein involved in cellular processes such as spindle orientation and mitosis. As a cofactor of the p97 AAA ATPase, UBXN2B plays a significant role in modulating the levels of NuMA at the cell cortex, thereby influencing the axis of cell division and impacting cell fate and tissue development (Lee2017p37UBXN2B). The protein is part of the VCP-UBXD adaptor network, interacting with various proteins involved in ubiquitin signaling, protein trafficking, and metabolism (Raman2015Systematic). Additionally, UBXN2B is implicated in the regulation of mitosis by controlling the recruitment of Aurora A to centrosomes, which is essential for proper mitotic progression and preventing chromosome segregation errors (Kress2013The).

## Function
UBXN2B, also known as p37, plays a critical role in regulating spindle orientation in mammalian cells by modulating the levels of NuMA at the cell cortex. This regulation is crucial for determining the axis of cell division, which affects cell fate and tissue development. UBXN2B acts as a cofactor of the p97 AAA ATPase and regulates spindle orientation by controlling the levels of cortical NuMA through the phosphatase PP1 and its regulatory subunit Repo-Man. This process is independent of other pathways involving Gαi, Aurora A kinase, and PP2A phosphatase (Lee2017p37UBXN2B).

During metaphase, UBXN2B limits the recruitment of NuMA to the cortex, ensuring proper spindle orientation. Depletion of UBXN2B in HeLa cells leads to increased cortical NuMA levels and spindle orientation defects, which can be rescued by exogenous p37 expression. This indicates that UBXN2B specifically regulates NuMA localization rather than its total cellular levels (Lee2017p37UBXN2B).

UBXN2B also interacts with the PP1/Repo-Man complex, mobilizing it from cytoplasmic complexes to kinetochores and chromatin, thereby preventing spindle orientation defects caused by excessive cortical recruitment of NuMA (Lee2017p37UBXN2B). This regulation is essential for maintaining proper spindle orientation and preventing defects during cell division.

## Interactions
UBXN2B, also known as p37, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It acts as a cofactor for the p97 AAA ATPase, regulating spindle orientation by limiting the recruitment of NuMA to the cell cortex through the PP1/Repo-Man pathway. This interaction is essential for maintaining proper spindle orientation and preventing excessive spindle rotations (Lee2017p37UBXN2B).

UBXN2B is also part of the VCP-UBXD adaptor network, where it interacts with various proteins involved in ubiquitin signaling, protein trafficking, and metabolism. This network is linked to numerous biological pathways, suggesting that UBXN2B may function within the same VCP hexamer as other UBXD proteins (Raman2015Systematic).

In addition, UBXN2B is implicated in the regulation of mitosis by controlling the recruitment of Aurora A to centrosomes. It interacts with CDC-48/p97 and AIR-1 (Aurora A), influencing centrosome maturation and spindle orientation. This interaction is crucial for proper mitotic progression and preventing chromosome segregation errors (Kress2013The).
