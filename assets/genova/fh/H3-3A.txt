# H3-3A

## Overview
The H3-3A gene encodes the histone variant H3.3, a crucial component of chromatin that plays a significant role in gene regulation and chromatin dynamics. Unlike canonical histone H3, which is incorporated into chromatin during DNA replication, H3.3 is deposited independently of replication, allowing it to be present in transcriptionally active regions throughout the cell cycle (Elsaesser2010New). The protein H3.3 histone A, encoded by H3-3A, is characterized by specific amino acid differences that influence its interaction with DNA and other histones, contributing to its unique role in maintaining an open chromatin structure conducive to transcriptional activity (Alvarez2017Histone; Ederveen2011The). H3.3 is involved in various protein interactions, including with the DAXX-ATRX complex, which facilitates its deposition at specific genomic regions such as telomeres (Liu2012Structure; Goldberg2010Distinct). Mutations in H3-3A have been implicated in several diseases, including pediatric high-grade gliomas and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its critical role in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Lowe2019Histone; Okur2021De).

## Structure
The H3-3A gene encodes the H3.3 histone variant, which plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and function. The primary structure of H3.3 is similar to canonical histone H3, with five amino acid differences that influence its function and interaction with DNA (Alvarez2017Histone; Ederveen2011The). These differences are located at the N-terminus and within the histone fold domain, which is essential for nucleosome assembly and stability (Alvarez2017Histone).

The secondary structure of H3.3 includes alpha helices and beta sheets typical of histone proteins, contributing to its ability to form the histone fold domain. This domain facilitates the interaction with DNA and other histones, forming the nucleosome core particle (Alvarez2017Histone).

In terms of quaternary structure, H3.3 pairs with other histones, such as H2A, H2B, and H4, to form nucleosomes, which are the fundamental units of chromatin (Alvarez2017Histone). H3.3 is known for its role in transcriptionally active regions and is associated with specific post-translational modifications, such as hyperacetylation, which are crucial for regulating gene expression (Alvarez2017Histone). These modifications are part of the histone code that influences chromatin dynamics and gene activity.

## Function
The H3-3A gene encodes the histone variant H3.3, which plays a crucial role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. Unlike the canonical histone H3, which is replication-dependent, H3.3 is incorporated into chromatin independently of DNA replication and is expressed throughout the cell cycle, including in quiescent, G1, and G2 cells (Elsaesser2010New). This allows H3.3 to be deposited at active genes, promoters, and regulatory elements, facilitating transcriptional activation (Chen2013H3.3).

H3.3 is involved in maintaining an open chromatin structure, which is essential for transcriptional activity. It counteracts the compacting effects of other histone variants, such as H2A.Z, thereby promoting a more accessible chromatin state that facilitates the binding of transcription factors (Chen2013H3.3). The presence of H3.3 at promoter regions of inactive genes suggests it may contribute to a 'poised' state, readying these genes for activation (Elsaesser2010New).

In non-dividing cells, H3.3 is associated with transcriptionally active genes and is thought to play a role in activating genes silenced by H3 methylation, as eukaryotic cells lack demethylating activities (Frank2003Differential). The gene's expression is linked to neuro-muscular deficits and reduced growth rates in mutant mice, indicating a potential involvement in muscle differentiation (Frank2003Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the H3-3A gene, which encodes the histone variant H3.3, are associated with several diseases and conditions. In pediatric high-grade gliomas, particularly those affecting the cerebral cortex, mutations at the G34 position, such as G34R and G34V, are prevalent. These mutations often occur alongside alterations in ATRX/DAXX and TP53 genes (Lowe2019Histone). The H3.3 G34V mutation has been shown to cause differential binding of H3K36me3, leading to increased expression of oncogenes like MYCN, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (Lowe2019Histone).

Germline mutations in H3-3A are linked to a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive neurological dysfunction and congenital anomalies. These mutations disrupt interactions with DNA and other histone proteins, leading to aberrant post-translational modification patterns and altered gene expression (Bryant2020Histone). De novo variants in H3-3A are also associated with neurodevelopmental delays, dysmorphic features, and structural brain abnormalities, affecting normal chromatin regulation and histone remodeling (Okur2021De).

In addition to neurological disorders, H3-3A mutations have been identified in various tumors, including pilocytic astrocytomas, gangliogliomas, and certain endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors (Leske2021A). These mutations highlight the gene's significant role in both oncogenesis and neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
The H3-3A gene encodes the histone variant H3.3, which is involved in various protein interactions critical for chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. H3.3 interacts with the chaperone DAXX, which specifically recognizes H3.3 over the canonical histone H3.1 due to the presence of Ala87 and Gly90 in H3.3. These residues fit into specific pockets in DAXX, facilitating the deposition of H3.3 onto pericentric and telomeric heterochromatin (Liu2012Structure).

H3.3 also forms complexes with ATRX, a chromatin remodeling factor, and DAXX, which are involved in the HIRA-independent localization of H3.3 at telomeres and in the repression of telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) (Goldberg2010Distinct). The DAXX-ATRX complex is responsible for H3.3 enrichment in heterochromatin and may also deposit H3.3 at G-quadruplexes and endogenous retroviruses (RayGallet2020The).

Additionally, H3.3 interacts with other proteins such as DNMT3A, ZMYND11, and SETD2, with different residues mediating these interactions. Variants in H3.3 can disrupt these interactions, potentially leading to neurodevelopmental disorders (Okur2021De). These interactions highlight the role of H3.3 in chromatin structure and regulation.
