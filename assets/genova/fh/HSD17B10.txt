# HSD17B10

## Overview
The HSD17B10 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 10 (HSD10), a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial function and various metabolic pathways, including the metabolism of isoleucine and neuroactive steroids. HSD10 is integral to the mitochondrial RNase P complex, which is essential for processing mitochondrial tRNAs, thereby influencing mitochondrial protein synthesis and function (Liu2020Deacetylation; Oerum2017Novel). The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which affect its stability and function (Liu2020Deacetylation). Mutations in the HSD17B10 gene are linked to HSD10 disease, a rare X-linked mitochondrial disorder characterized by neurological and cardiac symptoms (Upadia2021HSD10). Additionally, altered expression of HSD17B10 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Zschocke2011HSD10).

## Structure
The HSD17B10 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 10, which is involved in various metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functions. The protein is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily and features a Rossmann-fold, a structural motif crucial for binding NAD(P) dinucleotides (Kavanagh2008Medium). The primary structure of HSD17B10 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a tetramer, specifically a dimer of dimers, contributing to its quaternary structure (Oerum2017Novel). 

The secondary structure includes a central β-sheet and several α-helices, such as helix-αF, which contains catalytic residues involved in the proton-relay system and substrate binding (Oerum2017Novel). The tertiary structure forms a stable three-dimensional shape that is essential for its enzymatic activity. The protein also contains an NAD-binding domain, which is integral to its function in oxidoreduction reactions (Kavanagh2008Medium).

HSD17B10 is a component of the mitochondrial RNase P complex, which is crucial for processing mitochondrial precursor tRNAs, highlighting its role in mitochondrial RNA maturation (Oerum2017Novel). The enzyme may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and stability.

## Function
The HSD17B10 gene encodes the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (HSD10), which is crucial for several cellular processes, particularly within the mitochondria. HSD10 is involved in the metabolism of isoleucine, catalyzing the dehydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, a key step in the breakdown of this amino acid (Zschocke2011HSD10; Bertolin2015Parkin). The enzyme also plays a significant role in the metabolism of neuroactive steroids, such as allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, which modulate GABA A receptors and are important for cognitive function (Yang2007HSD17B10:).

HSD10 is a component of the mitochondrial RNase P complex, essential for processing mitochondrial tRNA, which is critical for mitochondrial protein synthesis and function (Liu2020Deacetylation). The enzyme's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, which influence its role in mitochondrial tRNA maturation and cellular stress responses (Liu2020Deacetylation). HSD10 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, with higher concentrations in the liver, heart, and brain, particularly in neural cells, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Zschocke2011HSD10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSD17B10 gene, which encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 10 (HSD10), are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting the central nervous system. HSD10 disease, a rare X-linked mitochondrial disorder, results from pathogenic variants in this gene and is characterized by progressive neurological impairment, seizures, cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, ataxia, microcephaly, and visual impairment. The disease is most commonly observed in males, but females can also be affected due to non-random X-chromosome inactivation (Zschocke2011HSD10; Upadia2021HSD10).

The infantile form of HSD10 disease is the most common, with normal development in the first 6-18 months followed by neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy, often leading to death by age 2-4 years (Zschocke2011HSD10). Mutations such as p.R130C and p.E249Q are linked to severe symptoms, including visual loss and seizures (Yang2009Mental). The p.K212E mutation impairs mitochondrial tRNA processing, contributing to neurodevelopmental regression and epilepsy (Falk2016A).

Altered expression of HSD17B10 is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where it affects cognitive function through interactions with amyloid β, mediating mitochondrial toxicity (Zschocke2011HSD10).

## Interactions
The HSD17B10 gene encodes the HSD10 protein, which is involved in several interactions with other proteins and is a component of the mitochondrial RNase P complex. This complex is essential for processing mitochondrial tRNAs and consists of three subunits: MRPP1 (TRMT10C), MRPP2 (HSD10), and MRPP3 (PRORP) (Falk2016A; Deutschmann2014Mutation). HSD10 forms a subcomplex with MRPP1, which is responsible for recognizing mitochondrial tRNA sequences and catalyzing the methylation of specific tRNA bases (Deutschmann2014Mutation). This subcomplex also recruits MRPP3 to form the functional RNase P complex, which is involved in 5'-tRNA cleavage (Deutschmann2014Mutation).

HSD10 interacts with SIRT3, a mitochondrial deacetylase, which regulates the acetylation status of HSD10. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, indicating a direct interaction both in vivo and in vitro (Liu2020Deacetylation). HSD10 also interacts with Parkin and PINK1 at the outer mitochondrial membrane, potentially facilitating protein import into mitochondria (Bertolin2015Parkin). These interactions highlight the multifunctional role of HSD10 in mitochondrial processes and its involvement in various protein complexes.
