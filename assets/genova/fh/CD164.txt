# CD164

## Overview
CD164 is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane sialomucin protein, also known as endolyn, which plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including hematopoiesis and cell adhesion. The CD164 protein is characterized by its complex structure, featuring two mucin-like domains and a cysteine-rich region, which are essential for its function in mediating cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways (Chan2001Relationship; Doyonnas2000CD164). It is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells and epithelial cell lines, where it localizes to endosomes and lysosomes, with some presence at the plasma membrane (Chan2001Relationship). CD164 is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic progenitor cell adhesion to the bone marrow stroma and acts as a negative regulator of their proliferation and differentiation (Zannettino1998The; Watt2000CD164A). Additionally, CD164 interacts with various proteins, such as CXCR4, influencing cell migration and signaling pathways, which are significant in cancer progression and other pathological conditions (Watt2021The; Tang2012Inhibiting).

## Structure
The CD164 protein, also known as endolyn, is a sialomucin with a complex molecular structure. It is encoded by a gene comprising six exons, which undergo alternative splicing to produce at least three isoforms: the full-length CD164(E1-6), CD164(EΔ5) lacking exon 5, and CD164(EΔ4) missing exon 4 (Chan2001Relationship; Doyonnas2000CD164). The full-length isoform includes two mucin-like domains, with the first domain encoded by exon 1 and predicted to be heavily glycosylated, containing three potential N-linked and nine potential O-linked glycosylation sites (Doyonnas2000CD164). The second mucin domain is encoded by exons 4, 5, and 6, with multiple glycosylation sites contributing to its structure (Doyonnas2000CD164).

The protein features a cysteine-rich region encoded by exons 2 and 3, which contains eight cysteine residues forming disulfide bridges that link the two mucin domains (Chan2001Relationship). CD164 is a type I transmembrane protein with a single-pass transmembrane domain and a 13-amino-acid intracellular region (Lee2001Identification). The protein is known to form dimers and potentially higher-order structures, as indicated by the presence of a tetrameric form in some studies (Doyonnas2000CD164). Glycosylation is a significant post-translational modification, affecting the protein's function and interaction with monoclonal antibodies (Doyonnas2000CD164).

## Function
CD164, also known as endolyn, is a sialomucin protein that plays a significant role in hematopoiesis, particularly in the adhesion of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells to the bone marrow stroma and in the negative regulation of their proliferation. It acts as a potent negative regulator by preventing the proliferation and differentiation of these cells into erythroid and myeloid lineages (Zannettino1998The; Watt2000CD164A). CD164 is involved in cell adhesion processes, facilitating the attachment of hematopoietic progenitor cells to the bone marrow microenvironment, which is crucial for maintaining hematopoietic progenitor cells within the bone marrow (Chan2001Relationship; Zannettino1998The).

The protein is primarily localized in endosomes and lysosomes in hematopoietic progenitor and epithelial cell lines, with some expression at the plasma membrane (Chan2001Relationship). CD164's structure includes two highly O-glycosylated mucin domains and a cysteine-rich non-mucin domain, which are important for its function in cell adhesion and signaling (Watt2021The). The protein's glycosylation patterns are essential for its function, influencing interactions with other molecules and affecting cell adhesion and proliferation (jorgensen2005epitope).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CD164 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In ovarian cancer, overexpression of CD164 is associated with malignant transformation of ovarian surface epithelial cells. This overexpression leads to increased cell proliferation, reduced adhesion, and enhanced anchorage-independent growth, which are indicative of tumorigenic potential. CD164 overexpression also upregulates the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis, activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression (Huang2013CD164).

In colon cancer, CD164 is overexpressed in tumor tissues, and its knockdown in colon cancer cell lines results in reduced proliferation, mobility, and metastasis. This suggests that CD164 promotes cancer progression through the CXCR4 signaling pathway (Tang2012Inhibiting).

A nonsense mutation in CD164, specifically c.574C>T, has been identified in a large Danish family with nonsyndromic hearing impairment. This mutation affects the internalization and trafficking of the CD164 protein, potentially leading to hearing loss through abnormal protein accumulation on the cell surface (Nyegaard2015A).

CD164 is also implicated in Sézary syndrome, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, where it serves as a marker for malignant CD4+ T cells (Benoit2016CD164).

## Interactions
CD164, also known as endolyn, participates in several interactions with other proteins that influence its role in cellular processes. It forms complexes with the CXCR4 protein, which is significant in regulating cell migration through the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, particularly in colon cancer cells. This interaction affects the directional migration of cancer cells, as demonstrated by the altered migration patterns observed when CD164 is knocked down (Tang2012Inhibiting).

CD164 is also part of the CXCR4-VLA-4-VLA-5 complex, which plays a role in the migration or retention of CD133+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in the stem cell niche. This complex is involved in promoting CXCR4-mediated signaling, which can be inhibited by specific monoclonal antibodies (Watt2021The).

In addition, CD164 interacts with P- and E-selectin, although it lacks sLeX moieties required for binding to these selectins. Its sialylation suggests it may act as a ligand for Siglec molecules, with preliminary studies indicating potential binding to hSiglec-5 (Watt2021The; jorgensen2005epitope).

CD164's interactions are often glycosylation-dependent, with its glycosylated epitopes playing a crucial role in these interactions (jorgensen2005epitope).
