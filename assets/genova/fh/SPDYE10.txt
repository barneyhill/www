# SPDYE10

## Overview
SPDYE10 is a gene that encodes the protein known as speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E10. This protein is part of the speedy/RINGO family, which is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Proteins in this family are known for their role in modulating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are crucial for cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. The SPDYE10 gene, through its encoded protein, may play a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell division and growth. Understanding the function and regulation of SPDYE10 is important for elucidating its potential implications in cell cycle-related disorders and diseases. Further research is needed to fully characterize the interactions and pathways involving SPDYE10 and its protein product.
