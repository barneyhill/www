# ARMCX3

## Overview
ARMCX3 is a gene that encodes the protein armadillo repeat containing X-linked 3, also known as Alex3. This protein is a member of the armadillo repeat family, characterized by its role in mediating protein-protein interactions. Alex3 is primarily involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and trafficking within neurons, where it interacts with the Kinesin/Miro/Trak2 complex in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for mitochondrial transport along axons, impacting neuronal viability and neurotransmission (LópezDoménech2012The). The protein is also implicated in various cellular processes beyond the nervous system, including cell proliferation and intracellular signaling pathways in hepatic cells (Mirra2021ARMCX3). ARMCX3's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in maintaining cellular function and its potential impact on diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders (Huang2021ARMC).

## Structure
ARMCX3 is a protein that contains armadillo repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. These repeats are part of the DUF634 domain and consist of three α-helices rich in hydrophobic amino acids, located in the carboxy-terminal region (LópezDoménech2012The). The protein also contains a nuclear localization signal, facilitating its movement between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and two mitochondrial outer membrane-targeting sequences at the N-terminus, which aid in its localization to the mitochondrial outer membrane (Huang2021ARMC).

ARMCX3 interacts with the Kinesin/Miro/Trak2 complex in a calcium-dependent manner to regulate mitochondrial dynamics and transport in neurons (Huang2021ARMC). The interaction is mediated by the armadillo repeat domains, which are crucial for the protein's function (LópezDoménech2012The). The Wnt/PKC pathway indirectly regulates mitochondrial distribution and dynamics by degrading ARMCX3 (Huang2021ARMC).

The protein is highly conserved in mammals, with a 99% identity between Pongo abelii and Homo sapiens, indicating its evolutionary significance (Huang2021ARMC). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ARMCX3 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
The ARMCX3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics and trafficking within neurons. It is part of the armadillo repeat family, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions. ARMCX3 is highly expressed in the nervous system and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial transport and localization at active synaptic sites, which is essential for neuronal viability and neurotransmission (LópezDoménech2012The).

The protein encoded by ARMCX3, known as Alex3, interacts with the Kinesin/Miro/Trak2 complex in a calcium-dependent manner, influencing mitochondrial motility and aggregation. This interaction is crucial for the transport of mitochondria along axons, affecting their motility, velocity, and distance covered (LópezDoménech2012The). Alex3 is localized in mitochondria, the nucleus, and the cytosol of neurons, and its mitochondrial localization is essential for its function in regulating progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation (Mirra2016Function).

In addition to its role in neurons, ARMCX3 is implicated in cell proliferation and clonality in hepatic cells, where its overexpression leads to increased cell proliferation and affects intracellular signaling pathways (Mirra2021ARMCX3). These functions highlight the importance of ARMCX3 in maintaining proper mitochondrial function and cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARMCX3 gene have been implicated in several neurological and metabolic conditions. ARMCX3 enhances the transactivation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) gene promoter via Sox10 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is associated with nicotine addiction, cognition, depression, hyperactivity disorder, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This suggests that ARMCX3 may promote AD progression (Huang2021ARMC). However, ARMCX3 also interacts with the Kinesin/Miro/Trak2 complex to regulate neuronal mitochondrial dynamics, and its degradation via the Wnt/PKC pathway may inhibit AD progression (Huang2021ARMC).

Alterations in ARMCX3 expression are linked to Waardenburg syndrome type II, as it may alleviate the progression of this condition by activating Sox10, a transcription factor crucial for neural crest development (Huang2021ARMC). In the context of metabolic disorders, methylation of ARMCX3 leads to the downregulation of HDAC7 and FYN, which are associated with low birth weight, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (Huang2021ARMC).

In addition, a homozygous variant in the ARMC3 gene, a related gene, has been identified as a genetic cause of stuttering, expanding the spectrum of genetic factors associated with this condition (Rehman2022The).

## Interactions
ARMCX3 interacts with several proteins and complexes, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the Kinesin/Miro/Trak2 complex in a calcium-dependent manner, which is crucial for regulating mitochondrial dynamics and transport in neurons (Huang2021ARMC). This interaction is important for mitochondrial function and is conserved across mammals (Huang2021ARMC).

ARMCX3 also interacts with the Wnt/PKC pathway, which indirectly affects mitochondrial distribution and dynamics by degrading ARMCX3. This interaction suggests a role in inhibiting cancer progression (Huang2021ARMC). In hepatic cells, ARMCX3 interacts with SOX9, a transcription factor involved in tumorigenesis. This interaction is significant in promoting hepatic cell proliferation and is linked to liver cancer susceptibility, particularly under conditions of high-fat diet-induced lipotoxicity (Mirra2021ARMCX3).

ARMCX3 enhances the transactivation of the nAChR gene promoter via Sox10 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in neuron-like cell lines, contributing to neural crest development and cell differentiation (Huang2021ARMC). These interactions highlight ARMCX3's involvement in various cellular pathways and its potential impact on diseases such as cancer and diabetes.
