# NUBP1

## Overview
NUBP1 is a gene that encodes the NUBP iron-sulfur cluster assembly factor 1, a cytosolic protein involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are critical cofactors for numerous cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a nucleotide-binding protein and plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial iron homeostasis and energy metabolism. NUBP1 is part of a heteromeric scaffold complex with NUBP2, essential for the proper assembly and function of Fe-S clusters. It also interacts with other proteins, such as GLRX3 and KATNAL2, indicating its involvement in microtubule dynamics and cell cycle progression. The protein's ability to bind [4Fe-4S] clusters and its interactions with other proteins underscore its multifaceted role in cellular function and regulation (DiStasio2020Nubp2; Camponeschi2020GLRX3; Ververis2015A).

## Structure
NUBP1 is a cytosolic protein involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly, characterized by its ability to bind [4Fe-4S] clusters. The protein contains an N-terminal CX13CX2CX5C motif, which tightly binds [4Fe-4S] clusters, and a C-terminal CPXC motif, which binds a more labile [4Fe-4S] cluster (Camponeschi2020GLRX3). The N-terminal motif is crucial for the protein's dimerization and stability, as it is the primary site for cluster binding (Camponeschi2020GLRX3). 

NUBP1 forms a dimeric structure, with the dimeric form capable of binding approximately 2.2 [4Fe-4S] clusters, where the N-terminal sites are almost fully occupied, while the C-terminal site is only about 20% occupied (Camponeschi2020GLRX3). The protein's quaternary structure is influenced by the presence of adventitious metal ions, which can promote dimerization (Camponeschi2020GLRX3). 

The protein is also involved in the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly machinery, interacting with GLRX3, which transfers [2Fe-2S] clusters to NUBP1. These clusters are then converted into [4Fe-4S] clusters in the presence of glutathione (Camponeschi2020GLRX3). The molecular structure of NUBP1 is not fully characterized, but its ability to bind [4Fe-4S] clusters and form complexes is well-documented (Camponeschi2020GLRX3).

## Function
NUBP1, also known as NUBP iron-sulfur cluster assembly factor 1, is a nucleotide-binding protein involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are essential cofactors for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, NUBP1 functions primarily in the cytosol and plays a critical role in mitochondrial iron homeostasis and energy metabolism. It is part of a heteromeric scaffold complex with NUBP2, necessary for the proper assembly and function of Fe-S clusters (DiStasio2020Nubp2).

NUBP1 is also involved in the regulation of cell division and chromosome partitioning, as it shares structural homology with the Mrp/NBP35 family of NTPases (Ioannou2013Xenopus). This protein is crucial for maintaining cellular iron balance and supporting enzymatic activities that rely on Fe-S clusters. In addition to its role in Fe-S cluster assembly, NUBP1 interacts with katanin-like 2 (KATNAL2) protein isoforms, which are key regulators of microtubule-based processes, including ciliogenesis and centriole duplication (Ververis2015A). These interactions suggest that NUBP1 is integral to various microtubule dynamics and cell cycle progression, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular function.

## Interactions
NUBP1, a nucleotide-binding protein, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. It interacts with KATNAL2, a katanin-like 2 protein, through direct physical interactions. These interactions have been demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid screens, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analyses, indicating that NUBP1 co-immunoprecipitates with KATNAL2 isoforms, suggesting a role in microtubule-based processes (Ververis2015A).

NUBP1 also interacts with GLRX3, a glutaredoxin that acts as a chaperone for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster transfer. GLRX3 transfers [2Fe-2S] clusters to NUBP1, which are then assembled into [4Fe-4S] clusters. This interaction is essential for the maturation of cytosolic Fe-S proteins, with the cluster binding promoting NUBP1 dimerization (Camponeschi2020GLRX3).

In the context of iron-sulfur cluster assembly, NUBP1 forms a hetero-complex with NUBP2. This complex is involved in the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly machinery, although NUBP1 and NUBP2 do not directly mediate Fe-S cluster transfer to cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (Camponeschi2020GLRX3; Kim2018Cytosolic).
