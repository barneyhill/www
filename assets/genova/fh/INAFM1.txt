# INAFM1

## Overview
INAFM1 is a gene that encodes the protein InaF motif containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of an InaF motif, which suggests a role in intracellular signaling pathways, although its precise biological functions are still under investigation. Research has indicated that the expression of INAFM1 is altered in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and therapeutic targeting. The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms are subjects of ongoing study, with implications for understanding its role in cellular homeostasis and disease (Gupta2024Exploiting; Fiock2023Determinants; Zhu2022Glia).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
INAFM1 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, INAFM1 is one of the genes identified with a high area under the curve (AUC > 0.9) in ROC analysis, suggesting its potential role in distinguishing metastatic from non-metastatic breast cancer samples. It was found to be higher in node-negative samples compared to metastatic samples, indicating its relevance in non-metastatic conditions (Gupta2024Exploiting).

In the context of tauopathies, INAFM1 was significantly downregulated in astrocytes treated with tau isoforms, suggesting that tau uptake impairs astrocyte differentiation. This downregulation is associated with conditions like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), where increased astrocytic tau is observed (Fiock2023Determinants).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), INAFM1 is downregulated in GMFB overexpressing cells, indicating a negative correlation with GMFB. This suggests that INAFM1 may participate in pathways relevant to KIRC biology, although its specific clinical significance in this context remains to be fully elucidated (Zhu2022Glia).
