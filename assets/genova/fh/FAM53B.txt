# FAM53B

## Overview
FAM53B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 53, member B. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. FAM53B has been implicated in the progression of several diseases, notably cancer, where it plays a role in pathways such as the Src/FAK/p-Akt/IL-1β signaling pathway, influencing macrophage polarization and cancer cell behavior (Pei2024FAM53B). The protein interacts with 14-3-3 chaperones and SKIIP proteins, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Xu2021Clinical). Clinically, FAM53B is significant in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and other cancers, where its expression levels correlate with disease prognosis and treatment responses (Agnelli2011The; Xu2021Clinical). Additionally, FAM53B has been associated with psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder, through differential methylation (Alam2022Bioinformatic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FAM53B gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), FAM53B is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to immune infiltration and immunotherapy responses. Lower expression levels of FAM53B correlate with improved overall survival rates in PDAC patients (Xu2021Clinical). FAM53B also plays a role in PDAC metastasis by regulating macrophage M2 polarization, which contributes to cancer progression and treatment resistance (Pei2024FAM53B).

In multiple myeloma, FAM53B is part of a critical-gene model that predicts overall survival. Higher expression levels of FAM53B are associated with better prognosis, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker in this disease (Agnelli2011The).

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a chromosomal translocation involving FAM53B was identified, suggesting that alterations in this gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of ALL (Panagopoulos2017FAM53B). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FAM53B in various cancers, where its expression and interactions can influence disease progression and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
FAM53B is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes, particularly in the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It is associated with the Src/FAK/p-Akt/IL-1β signaling pathway, which plays a role in macrophage M2 polarization. Knockdown of FAM53B results in reduced expression of Src, FAK, p-Akt, and IL-1β, indicating that these proteins are part of the pathway through which FAM53B influences macrophage polarization and cancer cell behavior (Pei2024FAM53B).

In addition to its role in PDAC, FAM53B interacts with 14-3-3 chaperones and SKIIP proteins, which are adaptor proteins that connect DNA-binding proteins to transcription modulators. This suggests that FAM53B may be involved in transcriptional regulation through these interactions (Xu2021Clinical).

FAM53B is also identified as a significant gene in the context of major depressive disorder (MDD), where it is differentially methylated. However, specific protein interactions involving FAM53B in this context are not detailed (Alam2022Bioinformatic). Overall, FAM53B's interactions highlight its role in both cancer progression and potential involvement in psychiatric disorders.
