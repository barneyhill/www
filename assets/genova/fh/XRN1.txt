# XRN1

## Overview
XRN1 is a gene that encodes the protein 5'-3' exoribonuclease 1, a crucial enzyme in RNA metabolism. This protein is categorized as an exoribonuclease and plays a significant role in the degradation of mRNA, particularly following the removal of the 5' cap structure, a process essential for maintaining proper mRNA turnover and gene expression regulation (Pashler2016The; Jones2012The). The XRN1 protein is characterized by a conserved catalytic domain that facilitates its exonuclease activity, enabling it to degrade RNA molecules from the 5' end (Langeberg2020Biochemical; Jones2012The). It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it localizes to processing bodies (P-bodies), which are involved in mRNA storage and degradation (Jones2012The). Beyond its role in mRNA decay, XRN1 is also implicated in the degradation of other RNA substrates and participates in pathways such as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), underscoring its importance in cellular function and stability (Jones2012The; Nagarajan2013XRN).

## Structure
The XRN1 protein is a 5' to 3' exoribonuclease involved in mRNA decay, featuring a conserved catalytic domain essential for its exonuclease activity. The catalytic domain is located in the N-terminal region and is responsible for the degradation of decapped RNA by recognizing the 5' phosphate through a basic pocket formed by conserved residues (Langeberg2020Biochemical; Jones2012The). This domain includes key residues such as His41 and Trp540, which organize the RNA for cleavage, and a basic pocket that interacts with the 5' phosphate (Nagarajan2013XRN).

The structure of XRN1 also includes a tower domain that facilitates directional processivity and a β-barrel domain, contributing to the enzyme's function (Nagarajan2013XRN). The C-terminal region, although less conserved, is crucial for XRN1's activity, potentially serving as a scaffold for other proteins involved in RNA degradation (Jones2012The; Nagarajan2013XRN). In Drosophila melanogaster, the C-terminal domain includes a polyglutamine repeat, which may act as a scaffold (Jones2012The).

XRN1 interacts with various proteins involved in mRNA decay, such as the CCR4-NOT complex, through a low-complexity region known as the C-terminal interacting region (CIR) (Chang2019A). This region is involved in recruiting deadenylation and decapping factors, playing a significant role in the 5'–3' mRNA decay pathway (Chang2019A).

## Function
XRN1 is a 5' to 3' exoribonuclease that plays a critical role in RNA metabolism in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the degradation of mRNA following decapping, a process essential for normal mRNA turnover and the regulation of gene expression. XRN1 degrades RNA molecules from the 5' end, ensuring the removal of decapped or cleaved mRNA, which is crucial for maintaining cellular RNA homeostasis (Pashler2016The; Jones2012The).

XRN1 is active in the cytoplasm and is found in processing bodies (P-bodies), which are cytoplasmic structures involved in mRNA storage and degradation. These bodies contain mRNA decapping machinery and ribonucleases, where XRN1 degrades mRNAs that have been translationally repressed (Pashler2016The; Jones2012The). XRN1 also interacts with several cofactors and complexes, such as DCP1/DCP2 and LSM1-7, which are involved in mRNA decapping and decay (Nagarajan2013XRN).

In addition to mRNA decay, XRN1 is involved in the degradation of other RNA substrates, including small RNAs and AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNAs. It plays a role in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a pathway crucial for degrading mRNAs with premature termination codons (Jones2012The; Nagarajan2013XRN). XRN1's activity is vital for regulating processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular function and stability (Pashler2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the XRN1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly osteosarcoma and preeclampsia. In osteosarcoma, a type of cancer affecting adolescents, reduced XRN1 mRNA expression is observed in many cell lines and patient samples. This down-regulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and potentially blocks apoptosis, giving tumor cells a growth advantage. The reduction of XRN1 may lead to increased expression of specific miRNAs or protein-coding RNAs that promote cancerous phenotypes, such as IGF-1, FOS, and MYC, which are involved in cancer progression (Pashler2021Genomewide; Pashler2016The).

In preeclampsia, a condition affecting pregnant women, XRN1 expression is markedly decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during pregnancy and at a 5-year follow-up. This reduction is linked to enhanced cellular senescence and inflammation, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. The study indicates that XRN1 may contribute to disrupted cell-to-cell communication in preeclampsia, although no direct correlation with telomere length was observed (Lekva2021Dysregulated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of XRN1 in both cancer and pregnancy-related conditions.

## Interactions
XRN1, a 5'-3' exoribonuclease, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in mRNA decay. In human cells, XRN1 interacts with the CCR4-NOT complex, a key player in deadenylation, through its C-terminal low-complexity region (CIR). This interaction is not RNA-mediated, as it persists even in the presence of RNase A (Chang2019A). The CIR of XRN1 can inhibit the deadenylase activity of the CCR4-NOT complex, particularly affecting the CAF1 component (Chang2019A). XRN1 also interacts with the decapping activator PatL1, which competes with the CCR4-NOT complex for binding to the CIR, suggesting a regulatory role in mRNA decay (Chang2019A).

In yeast, XRN1 is part of a complex network involving the decapping enzyme DCP1-DCP2 and other decay factors like Lsm1-7 and Dhh1/DDX6, which are involved in mRNA processing and decay (BlascoMoreno2019The). XRN1 also interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and associated factors, influencing transcription elongation and processivity, particularly in the 5' and 3' regions of genes (Fischer2020The). These interactions highlight XRN1's multifaceted role in RNA metabolism and gene expression regulation.
