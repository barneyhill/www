# EDEM2

## Overview
EDEM2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as endoplasmic reticulum degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein 2, which is a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This protein is categorized as an alpha-mannosidase and is involved in the initial mannose trimming of misfolded glycoproteins, a key step in the ERAD process that facilitates the recognition and degradation of these proteins. EDEM2's enzymatic activity is dependent on its interaction with the thioredoxin domain-containing protein TXNDC11, which aids in the formation of essential disulfide bonds within EDEM2 (George2021Purified). The protein's function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, thus playing a significant role in cellular stress response mechanisms (Wu2023EDEM2).

## Structure
EDEM2 is a protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, characterized by its role in mannose trimming. The primary structure of EDEM2 includes specific cysteine residues, such as Cys65 and Cys408, which are crucial for forming disulfide bonds necessary for its enzymatic activity (i&gt; glycan; George2021Purified; N&lt; Ninagawa2021&lt). These disulfide bonds are facilitated by the thioredoxin domain-containing protein TXNDC11, which is essential for EDEM2's α1,2-mannosidase activity (George2021Purified).

EDEM2 contains a mannosidase homology domain (MHD), which is critical for its function in the ERAD pathway (George2021Purified). The formation of disulfide bonds within this domain is vital for its activity, as mutations in these cysteine residues can inactivate the protein (George2021Purified). The quaternary structure of EDEM2 involves its interaction with TXNDC11, forming a complex that is necessary for its enzymatic function (George2021Purified).

While the context does not provide detailed information on the secondary or tertiary structures, it highlights the importance of disulfide bonds and the interaction with TXNDC11 in maintaining the functional conformation of EDEM2. The presence of these structural features underscores the protein's role in glycoprotein processing within the ERAD pathway.

## Function
EDEM2, or endoplasmic reticulum degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein 2, plays a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis in human cells. EDEM2 is involved in the initial mannose trimming step of misfolded glycoproteins, converting M9 to M8B, a crucial step for the degradation signal in glycoprotein ERAD (George2021Purified). This mannose trimming is necessary for the recognition and sorting of substrates to the ERAD pathway, leading to the generation of Man7-5 GlcNAc2 glycan forms required for the disposal of misfolded glycoproteins (Sokołowska2015Hydrophobicity).

EDEM2 functions in association with the thioredoxin domain-containing protein TXNDC11, which is necessary for its mannosidase activity. This interaction facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds in EDEM2, which are essential for its function (George2021Purified). EDEM2 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it helps prevent the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded polypeptides, thus maintaining ER proteostasis (Wu2023EDEM2). By ensuring proper protein folding and degradation, EDEM2 plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis and stress response mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
EDEM2 is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Alterations in EDEM2 expression have been linked to glioma, a type of brain tumor. In glioma, EDEM2 is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and unfavorable clinical characteristics such as high WHO grade and IDH mutation status. Its expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages, and can predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (Wu2023EDEM2).

EDEM2 is also involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins, such as the alpha-1-antitrypsin Z variant, which is associated with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. This condition results from mutations that lead to improper protein folding and accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum. EDEM2, along with EDEM1, facilitates the degradation of these misfolded proteins, preventing cellular dysfunction (JANG2015Role).

In C. elegans, EDEM2 plays a crucial role in managing ER stress and maintaining proteostasis. Loss of EDEM2 function leads to pleiotropic defects and increased sensitivity to ER stress, which can be relevant to understanding the pathogenesis of various human diseases related to protein misfolding and ER stress (Ghenea2022Targeting).

## Interactions
EDEM2 interacts with several proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It forms a high molecular weight complex with TXNDC11 through disulfide bonds between cysteine residues C65 and C408, which is crucial for its α1,2-mannosidase activity (George2021Purified). This interaction enhances EDEM2's function in glycoprotein processing by stabilizing its structure (George2021Purified).

EDEM2 also interacts with the lectin calnexin, showing stronger binding than EDEM1, which suggests a role in glycan-dependent interactions within the ERAD pathway (SłomińskaWojewódzka2015The). Additionally, EDEM2 associates with SEL1L, a component of the ER dislocation machinery, through glycan-mediated interactions (SłomińskaWojewódzka2015The).

The protein's interaction with oxidoreductases like TXNDC11 and PDI enhances its mannosidase activity, particularly on denatured glycoprotein substrates (Shenkman2018Mannosidase). EDEM2's role in substrate recognition is influenced by hydrophobic interactions, allowing it to bind to hydrophobic regions of misfolded proteins, which is essential for its function in ERAD (Sokołowska2015Hydrophobicity). There is no evidence of EDEM2 interacting with nucleic acids.
