# CACNG7

## Overview
CACNG7 is a gene that encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma 7, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of calcium ion transport across cell membranes. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, influencing the trafficking and gating of AMPA receptors, which are critical for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Torán2019Definition; Boggess2024A). The expression of CACNG7 is notably significant in cardiac progenitor cells and the nervous system, where it modulates cellular processes such as synaptic excitability and cardiac function. Alterations in the expression or mutation of CACNG7 have been associated with various disorders, including autosomal recessive intellectual disability and ischemic cardiomyopathy, highlighting its importance in both neurological and cardiac health (SantosCortez2018Novel; Gronich2010Molecular).

## Function
CACNG7 encodes the gamma-7 subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, which plays a crucial role in modulating calcium ion transport across cell membranes. This protein acts as a regulatory subunit for transmembrane AMPA receptors, influencing their trafficking and gating, which is essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Torán2019Definition; Boggess2024A). In cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), CACNG7 is significantly expressed and may help maintain the immature state of these cells by controlling Ca2+ signaling, which is associated with cellular quiescence (Torán2019Definition).

In the nervous system, CACNG7 is involved in modulating neuronal excitability. Knockdown of CACNG7 has been shown to increase synaptic activation, indicating its role in regulating synaptic excitability and potentially linking it to neurological conditions (Boggess2024A). The protein is also expressed in atrial and ventricular myocytes, where it is downregulated in response to cardiac ischemia, suggesting a role in cardiac function and response to stress (Torán2019Definition). Overall, CACNG7 is integral to calcium channel function, affecting both cardiac and neuronal cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CACNG7 gene have been implicated in several disorders. In the context of autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID), CACNG7 has been identified as a novel candidate gene. It is suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of these disorders due to its high expression in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, and its involvement in stabilizing calcium channel expression (SantosCortez2018Novel). Although the exact clinical significance of CACNG7 mutations in specific diseases is not fully detailed, its variants co-segregate with ARID in studied families, indicating a potential link to neurodevelopmental disorders (SantosCortez2018Novel).

In ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), the expression of CACNG7 is reduced in both atrial and ventricular myocytes. This downregulation is part of the molecular remodeling of ion channels, exchangers, and pumps, which may contribute to decreased cardiac contractile functions in ICM (Gronich2010Molecular). The study highlights the importance of understanding these molecular changes to develop targeted therapies for ICM, although it does not provide specific information on the clinical significance of CACNG7 gene mutations beyond its reduced expression in this condition (Gronich2010Molecular).
