# HRURF

## Overview
The HRURF gene encodes the HR upstream open reading frame, a regulatory element involved in the modulation of gene expression. This gene is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription and translation. The HR upstream open reading frame is not a protein in the traditional sense, as it does not encode a functional protein product but rather plays a crucial role in controlling the translation of downstream genes. Its regulatory function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli. The HRURF gene's activity has been linked to several signaling pathways, highlighting its importance in cellular communication and adaptation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
