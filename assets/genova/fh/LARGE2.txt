# LARGE2

## Overview
LARGE2, also known as LARGE xylosyl- and glucuronyltransferase 2, is a gene that encodes a bifunctional glycosyltransferase enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, particularly α-dystroglycan (α-DG). This enzyme plays a critical role in the glycosylation process, which is essential for the proper functioning of α-DG as a receptor for extracellular matrix proteins, thereby maintaining muscle integrity and neural function (Ashikov2012LARGE2; Inamori2014Endogenous). The LARGE2 protein is characterized by its type II membrane protein structure and contains two catalytic domains from the glycosyltransferase-8 (GT8) and GT49 families, which facilitate its enzymatic activity (Ashikov2012LARGE2; Fujimura2005LARGE2). Notably, LARGE2 is more efficient than its homolog LARGE in glycosylating α-DG, indicating its significant role in various tissues, particularly the kidney and placenta (Fujimura2005LARGE2; Inamori2014Endogenous). The gene's expression and function have implications in several clinical contexts, including cancer and muscular dystrophies, where alterations in its activity can affect disease progression and tissue integrity (Huang2014The; Miller2015Downregulation).

## Structure
The LARGE2 protein is a type II membrane protein with a predicted length of 721 amino acids, characterized by a DXD motif common in glycosyltransferases (Fujimura2005LARGE2). It functions as a bifunctional glycosyltransferase, utilizing UDP-xylose (Xyl) and UDP-glucuronic acid (GlcA) as donor sugars to generate polymers with alternating Xyl and GlcA units (Ashikov2012LARGE2). LARGE2 contains two catalytic domains, one belonging to the glycosyltransferase-8 (GT8) family and the other to the GT49 family, which are responsible for its enzymatic activity (Ashikov2012LARGE2).

The protein's structure is inferred from its amino acid sequence and its classification as a type II membrane protein, suggesting a topology typical of glycosyltransferases (Fujimura2005LARGE2). LARGE2 is more efficient than its homolog LARGE in glycosylating α-dystroglycan, a process crucial for the maturation of this protein (Fujimura2005LARGE2). The protein's activity is dependent on the presence of manganese and is inhibited by EDTA and UDP, indicating specific requirements for its enzymatic function (Ashikov2012LARGE2). The molecular structure of LARGE2, including its specific domains and motifs, supports its role in glycosylation processes.

## Function
LARGE2 (LARGE xylosyl- and glucuronyltransferase 2) is a bifunctional glycosyltransferase involved in the post-translational modification of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a protein essential for cell-matrix interactions. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of sugar chains, specifically xylose and glucuronic acid, to α-DG, enhancing its ability to bind extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin. This glycosylation process is crucial for maintaining muscle integrity and proper neural function (Ashikov2012LARGE2; Inamori2014Endogenous).

LARGE2 possesses xylosyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase activities, which are necessary for the functional modification of α-DG. This modification is essential for α-DG to act as a receptor for extracellular matrix ligands, contributing to the structural stability of tissues (Inamori2016LARGE2dependent). LARGE2 is more efficient than its homolog LARGE in glycosylating α-DG, suggesting a differential importance in various tissues (Fujimura2005LARGE2).

LARGE2 is expressed in several tissues, with the highest levels found in the kidney and placenta, but it is not expressed in the brain. This expression pattern indicates that LARGE2 may have tissue-specific roles, particularly in the kidney, where it contributes significantly to α-DG modification (Inamori2014Endogenous).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LARGE2 gene, encoded by GYLTL1B, have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, the downregulation of LARGE2 is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is regulated by transcription factors such as Snail and ZEB1. This downregulation leads to hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (aDG), contributing to disease progression and an invasive cancer phenotype (Huang2014The). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the downregulation of LARGE2, along with ISPD, is linked to increased mortality. This is due to the loss of aDG glycosylation, which is crucial for its function as an extracellular matrix receptor (Miller2015Downregulation).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), LARGE2 expression is influenced by Wnt signaling pathways. The gene is upregulated in CRC cells with active Wnt signaling, particularly in subtypes with high Wnt activity and stem cell-like characteristics. This upregulation affects the O-glycosylation of aDG, which is essential for laminin binding, potentially impacting disease progression (Dietinger2020Wnt-driven).

In muscular dystrophies, mutations in LARGE2 can lead to impaired glycosylation of aDG, contributing to conditions such as congenital muscular dystrophy (Fujimura2005LARGE2).

## Interactions
LARGE2, a bifunctional glycosyltransferase, interacts with α-dystroglycan (α-DG) to facilitate its maturation and functional glycosylation. This interaction is crucial for the formation of laminin-binding glycans on α-DG, which are essential for its role as a receptor for extracellular matrix proteins. LARGE2 has been shown to modify α-DG more effectively than its paralog LARGE, resulting in a larger molecular size and more intense signal of mature α-DG (Fujimura2005LARGE2). 

LARGE2 also interacts with glypican-4 (GPC4), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, modifying it to enhance its laminin-binding ability. This interaction is evidenced by increased IIH6 immunoreactivity in cells expressing LARGE2 and GPC4, indicating the presence of a functional glycan epitope (Inamori2016LARGE2dependent). 

In the context of colorectal cancer, LARGE2 is involved in a Wnt signaling pathway that regulates the O-glycosylation of α-DG. This pathway is crucial for cell-to-matrix interactions, and LARGE2 expression is modulated by Wnt signaling, affecting the glycosylation and laminin-binding capacity of α-DG (Dietinger2020Wnt-driven). These interactions highlight the role of LARGE2 in modifying proteoglycans and influencing cell adhesion and signaling.
