# THY1

## Overview
The THY1 gene encodes the Thy-1 cell surface antigen, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and is expressed in several cell types such as neurons, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Thy-1 plays a crucial role in modulating neurite outgrowth, synapse stabilization, and cellular adhesion and migration, often through interactions with integrins and other signaling molecules (Leyton2019Thy1CD90; Hagood2019Thy1). The gene's expression and function are significant in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including fibrosis, cancer, and metabolic disorders (Picke2018Thy-1; Rege2006Thy‐1).

## Structure
The THY1 protein, also known as Thy-1 cell surface antigen, is a glycoprotein encoded by the THY1 gene. It is initially translated as a pro-form consisting of 161 amino acids in humans. The first 19 amino acids serve as a localization signal targeting the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the C-terminal residues (131-161) function as a transmembrane domain. The mature form of THY1 is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which replaces the terminal 31 amino acids (Bradley2011THY1).

THY1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and possesses a single V-like immunoglobulin domain, contributing to its tertiary structure. The protein is anchored to the cell membrane by the diacyl group of the GPI anchor, which embeds into the membrane (Bradley2011THY1). Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation, with sites at asparagine residues 42, 94, and 118 in murine Thy1, and at positions 42 and 119 in humans. These modifications are crucial for the protein's function and stability (Bradley2011THY1). THY1 typically exists as a monomer on the cell surface and does not form quaternary structures (Morris2018Thy1).

## Function
Thy-1 (CD90) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, influencing cellular adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Thy-1 is expressed on neurons, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, where it modulates neurite outgrowth, particularly in astrocyte-rich regions of the brain, and stabilizes neuronal synapses (Leyton2019Thy1CD90; Rege2006Thy‐1).

Thy-1 interacts with integrins, such as β3 integrin, to regulate focal adhesion and stress fiber formation, which are crucial for cell migration and adhesion (Leyton2019Thy1CD90; Rege2006Thy‐1). It also forms complexes with intracellular signaling proteins and the cytoskeleton, allowing it to sense changes inside and outside cells, thereby influencing cellular processes and behavior (Leyton2019Thy1CD90).

In fibroblasts, Thy-1 affects the production of extracellular matrix components, such as fibronectin and collagen, and modulates fibroblast phenotypes relevant to wound healing and fibrosis (Rege2006Thy‐1). Thy-1 also plays a role in mechanotransduction, interacting with integrins to modulate signaling pathways like Src family kinases and Rho kinases, allowing cells to respond to mechanical stimuli (Hagood2019Thy1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the THY1 gene are linked to several diseases and conditions. In fibrosis, the absence of THY1 expression exacerbates the condition across multiple organs, including the heart, liver, and kidneys. This absence is often due to epigenetic silencing mechanisms such as DNA methylation, which are influenced by aging and inflammation (Hu2022Thy1Integrin; Rege2006Thy‐1). In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, THY1 is absent in fibroblastic foci, contributing to disease progression (Hu2022Thy1Integrin).

In cancer, THY1 plays a dual role. It acts as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where its expression is often reduced due to promoter hypermethylation. Restoration of THY1 expression in these cancers can suppress tumor growth (Rege2006Thy‐1). Conversely, THY1 promotes melanoma migration and metastasis by interacting with integrins, facilitating cell adhesion and migration (Rege2006Thy‐1).

THY1 also influences bone and fat metabolism. Reduced THY1 expression is associated with increased adipose tissue accumulation and decreased bone mass, contributing to conditions like obesity and osteoporosis (Picke2018Thy-1; Yang2020The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of THY1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
THY1, also known as Thy-1, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and signaling. THY1 interacts with integrins, particularly β3 integrin, in breast cancer and melanoma cells, initiating a signaling cascade that includes increased intracellular calcium concentration and activation of the P2X7 receptor, which is crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion (Hu2022Thy1Integrin). In neurons, THY1 interacts with αvβ3 integrin from astrocytes, leading to neurite retraction through the RhoA/ROCK pathway (Maldonado2017Astrocytetoneuron).

THY1 also forms complexes with proteins such as CBP, Csk, and Src in neurons, which are involved in signal transduction and cytoskeletal dynamics (Maldonado2017Astrocytetoneuron). In T cells, THY1 interacts specifically with the p60fyn protein tyrosine kinase, a member of the Src family, suggesting a role in T cell activation (Thomas1992The). The interaction between THY1 and p60fyn is dependent on the GPI-linkage, as disruption of this linkage decreases kinase activity associated with THY1 (Thomas1992The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of THY1 in cellular communication and signaling.
