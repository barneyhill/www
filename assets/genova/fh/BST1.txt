# BST1

## Overview
BST1, or bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family, which is involved in NAD+ metabolism. The protein encoded by BST1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ectoenzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as calcium signaling, cell proliferation, and differentiation. It exhibits enzymatic activities, including ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase, which are essential for intracellular calcium mobilization (Hirata1994ADP). BST1 is expressed on various immune cells, including monocytes, granulocytes, and macrophages, and is involved in immune response and hematopoiesis (Okuyama1996Human). The protein's interactions and enzymatic functions contribute to its role in maintaining protein quality control and cellular structure, particularly in the context of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (Fujita2006Inositol). Additionally, genetic variations in BST1 have been linked to several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Yokoyama2015Association; Wang2015Association).

## Structure
The BST1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family, involved in NAD+ metabolism. The primary structure of the BST1 protein consists of a polypeptide chain with 290 amino acids after the signal peptide is cleaved (Kaisho1994BST1). The protein is glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored, as indicated by a short C-terminal hydrophobic region, and it undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, with four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Kaisho1994BST1).

BST1 has two isoforms due to alternative splicing: CD157-001, the canonical form with 318 amino acids, and CD157-002, which includes an additional exon 1b, resulting in a 333 amino acid sequence. This exon introduces a 15 amino acid insert that forms a structurally disordered, hydrophilic loop (Ferrero2017Human). The secondary structure of CD157 includes alpha helices, beta sheets, and turns, with cysteine residues forming disulfide bridges (Ferrero2017Human). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, as shown in the crystal structure PDB 1ISI (Ferrero2017Human). The CD157-002 isoform maintains the overall structure of the ribosyl-hydrolase domain, with the 15 amino acid insert not significantly altering the structured regions (Ferrero2017Human).

## Function
BST1, or bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ectoenzyme that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It exhibits ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase activities, converting NAD+ to cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a crucial molecule in calcium signaling (Hirata1994ADP). This enzymatic activity is important for intracellular calcium mobilization, which influences numerous cellular functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation (Podestà2005Concentrative).

BST1 is expressed on monocytes, granulocytes, and macrophages, indicating its involvement in the immune response and hematopoiesis (Okuyama1996Human). It functions as a receptor molecule, capable of delivering signals into cells, as demonstrated by its role in inducing tyrosine phosphorylation in myeloid cell lines (Okuyama1996Human). In the bone marrow microenvironment, BST1 supports the growth of pre-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors, highlighting its role in early B and T cell development (Kaisho1994BST1; Podestà2005Concentrative).

The protein is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it influences cell adhesion and proliferation, contributing to the regulation of immune cell function and hematopoiesis (Podestà2005Concentrative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BST1 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Genetic polymorphisms in BST1 are associated with an increased susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in Asian populations. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs4698412 and rs11931532 have shown significant associations with PD risk, although these associations are not consistent across all ethnic groups (Li2019&lt; p&gt; Yokoyama2023Genetic; The; Wang2015Association).

BST1 is also linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In a Japanese population, certain SNPs in the BST1 gene, including rs4301112 and rs28532698, were found to have higher allele frequencies in individuals with ASD, suggesting a potential genetic association (Yokoyama2015Association). Additionally, a fusion transcript involving BST1 and CD38 has been identified in a patient with autism and asthma, indicating a possible role in these conditions (Ceroni2014A).

Alterations in BST1 expression have been associated with idiopathic restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED) in a Chinese population, with the rs4273468 polymorphism significantly increasing the risk of this condition (Huang2021Association). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in various disorders, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
BST1, also known as bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. In yeast, BST1 is known to interact with misfolded glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, such as Gas1*p, through its GPI moiety. This interaction is essential for the degradation of these misfolded proteins, as BST1's GPI inositol deacylase activity facilitates their breakdown (Fujita2006Inositol). The interaction between BST1 and Gas1*p is particularly strong when the latter is misfolded, indicating a role in quality control and degradation processes (Fujita2006Inositol).

BST1 also associates with the chaperone BiP/Kar2p, which is involved in the folding of GPI-anchored proteins. This suggests a collaborative role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (Fujita2006Inositol). In Candida albicans, BST1 is crucial for the anchorage of GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall, affecting the organism's virulence and cell wall integrity (Liu2016Bst1). These interactions highlight BST1's role in maintaining protein quality control and cellular structure through its enzymatic activities and protein associations.
