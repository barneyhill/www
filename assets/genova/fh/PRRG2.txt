# PRRG2

## Overview
PRRG2 is a gene that encodes the protein proline-rich and Gla domain 2, which is characterized by the presence of a proline-rich region and a γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain. This protein is categorized as a cytosolic protein involved in protein-protein interactions, primarily through its WW binding motifs. These motifs enable PRRG2 to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. The protein's interactions with YAP1, a component of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, and NEDD4, a ubiquitin ligase, suggest its involvement in pathways related to cell growth and protein degradation. Understanding the function and interactions of PRRG2 is essential for elucidating its role in disease pathology, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders (Yazicioglu2013Cellular).

## Interactions
PRRG2, a proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain-containing protein, is known to participate in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its cytosolic WW binding motifs. These motifs are small protein-protein interaction domains that facilitate binding with other proteins, which is significant in the context of diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders (Yazicioglu2013Cellular). 

PRRG2 shares interaction partners with PRRG4, another member of the PRRG protein family. Notably, PRRG2 has been shown to interact with YAP1 and NEDD4. YAP1 is a target of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, while NEDD4 is a ubiquitin ligase, indicating that PRRG2 may play a role in pathways related to cell growth and protein degradation (Yazicioglu2013Cellular). These interactions suggest that PRRG2 could be involved in regulatory networks that influence cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis.

The study of PRRG2's interactions is crucial for understanding its physiological roles and potential implications in disease pathology. The interactions with proteins like YAP1 and NEDD4 highlight the importance of PRRG2 in cellular signaling pathways, which may be relevant for therapeutic targeting in related diseases (Yazicioglu2013Cellular).
