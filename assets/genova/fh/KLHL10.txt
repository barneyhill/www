# KLHL10

## Overview
KLHL10 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch like family member 10, which is a member of the kelch repeat-containing protein superfamily. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and six C-terminal kelch motifs, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and its function as a substrate-specific adaptor in the BCR (BTB-Cul3-Roc1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Wang2006Cullin3; Yan2004Haploinsufficiency). KLHL10 is predominantly expressed in the testis and plays a critical role in spermatogenesis, particularly during the late stages of spermiogenesis, by participating in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to regulate protein degradation and turnover (Wang2006Cullin3; Yan2004Haploinsufficiency). Mutations in KLHL10 have been linked to male infertility, highlighting its essential function in sperm development and maturation (Yatsenko2006Noninvasive; Yan2004Haploinsufficiency).

## Structure
The KLHL10 protein is a member of the kelch repeat-containing protein superfamily, characterized by its distinct structural domains. It consists of an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and six C-terminal kelch motifs. The BTB domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, specifically interacting with Cullin 3 ubiquitin ligases, and acts as a substrate-specific adaptor in the BCR (BTB-Cul3-Roc1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Wang2006Cullin3; Yan2004Haploinsufficiency). The kelch motifs are predicted to form a blade-like conformation, assembling into a β-propeller structure, which is similar to that of galactose oxidase (Yan2004Haploinsufficiency).

The protein's tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs into a stable, functional conformation, which is essential for its role in spermatogenesis. KLHL10's quaternary structure likely involves interactions with other proteins, forming complexes such as the CUL3-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, which is crucial for protein degradation pathways during late spermiogenesis (Wang2006Cullin3). The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its significant role in spermatid development (Yan2004Haploinsufficiency). The expression of KLHL10 is specific to the testis, particularly in the cytoplasm of elongating and elongated spermatids (Yan2004Haploinsufficiency).

## Function
KLHL10 (kelch like family member 10) is a testis-specific protein that plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, particularly during the late stages of spermiogenesis. It is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is essential for protein degradation and turnover in cells. KLHL10 functions as part of a CUL3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it acts as a substrate adaptor, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This process is vital for regulating protein stability and turnover during sperm development (Wang2006Cullin3; Yan2004Haploinsufficiency).

The protein contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and six C-terminal kelch repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. These domains enable KLHL10 to interact with CUL3, forming a complex that is active in the cytoplasm of elongating and elongated spermatids (Yatsenko2006Noninvasive; Yan2004Haploinsufficiency). KLHL10's role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is crucial for the elimination of unnecessary proteins, chromatin remodeling, and the removal of defective spermatozoa, ensuring proper sperm maturation and male fertility (Wang2006Cullin3; HUANG2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KLHL10 gene are associated with male infertility, particularly in conditions such as oligozoospermia, characterized by low sperm count. Specific missense mutations, including Q216P and A313T, have been identified in oligozoospermic patients and are linked to impaired homodimerization of the KLHL10 protein, which is crucial for its function in spermatogenesis (Yatsenko2006Noninvasive). These mutations disrupt the formation of a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, essential for spermiogenesis, thereby contributing to infertility (Yatsenko2006Noninvasive).

In mice, haploinsufficiency of KLHL10 leads to infertility due to disrupted spermiogenesis, characterized by asynchronous spermatid maturation and increased apoptosis of germ cells (Yan2004Haploinsufficiency). This suggests that both alleles of KLHL10 are necessary for normal spermatogenesis, and mutations can result in a global failure of this process (Yan2004Haploinsufficiency).

KLHL10 mutations have also been associated with other semen quality issues, such as teratozoospermia and moderate asthenozoospermia, indicating that these genetic alterations may affect more than just sperm count (Yatsenko2006Noninvasive). The presence of these mutations in different ethnic groups suggests they are not due to a founder effect (Yatsenko2006Noninvasive).

## Interactions
KLHL10 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in spermatogenesis. One of its primary interactions is with Cullin 3 (CUL3), forming a CUL3-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. This interaction is facilitated through the BTB/POZ domain of KLHL10, which binds to the amino terminus of CUL3. This complex is involved in protein ubiquitination, a critical process during spermiogenesis, and is essential for regulating protein turnover in testicular development (Wang2006Cullin3).

Mutations in KLHL10, such as Q216P and A313T, have been shown to impair its ability to form homodimers, which is crucial for its function. These mutations weaken the interaction with the wild-type protein, potentially leading to a deficiency in protein function due to impaired homodimerization (Yatsenko2006Noninvasive).

KLHL10 also participates in interactions with other POZ-domain proteins, forming both homodimers and heterodimers. These interactions are crucial for its regulatory functions and are visualized using advanced techniques like bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) (Kim2007New).
