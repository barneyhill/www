# VPS41

## Overview
VPS41 is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of the HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting) complex, which is integral to the endo-lysosomal pathway in eukaryotic cells. The VPS41 protein is categorized as a component of the vesicle trafficking machinery, playing a pivotal role in the fusion of endosomes and lysosomes, thereby facilitating the degradation of endocytosed materials and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Structurally, VPS41 contains several domains, including an N-terminal domain, a clathrin heavy-chain repeat (CHCR) domain, and a RING finger domain, which are essential for its interactions with other proteins and its function within the HOPS complex (Darsow2001Vps41p; Hunter2017VPS18). The protein's interactions with Rab GTPases and SNARE complexes underscore its importance in membrane fusion events and endocytic trafficking (Pols2012The; Lin2014RILP). Mutations in the VPS41 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining lysosomal function and neuronal health (van2019VPS41recessive; Sanderson2021Biallelic).

## Structure
The VPS41 protein is a component of the HOPS complex, which is involved in lysosomal membrane fusion. It contains several important domains, including an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal clathrin heavy-chain repeat (CHCR) domain. The N-terminal domain is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as Apl5p, and is located between amino acids 99 and 232 (Darsow2001Vps41p). The CHCR domain, located between amino acids 753 and 901, is essential for the homo-oligomerization of VPS41, forming a complex of about six molecules (Darsow2001Vps41p).

VPS41 also features a RING finger domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions within the HOPS complex. This domain is crucial for the recruitment of VPS41 to the complex, interacting with other subunits like VPS18 (Hunter2017VPS18). The protein's structure is flexible, with peripheral portions allowing for angular re-orientations relative to the core of the HOPS complex (Moeller2023Structure).

The protein is approximately 100 Å in length, with its Ypt7-interacting unit positioned at the farthest end of the complex, highlighting its role in membrane tethering and fusion (Moeller2023Structure).

## Function
The VPS41 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the HOPS complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosomes and lysosomes in human cells. VPS41 plays a significant role in the endo-lysosomal pathway, facilitating the fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes, which is essential for the degradation of endocytosed cargo. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring efficient degradation processes in healthy human cells (Pols2012The).

VPS41 is also involved in the transport of lysosomal membrane proteins from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to late endosomes via a clathrin-independent pathway. This pathway involves the formation of LAMP carriers, which transport LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 proteins, and VPS41 is crucial for the fusion of these carriers with late endosomes (Pols2013hVps41). The protein is localized on the limiting membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes, as well as on LAMP carriers, indicating its essential role in these fusion processes (Pols2013hVps41).

VPS41 also interacts with other proteins, such as Rab GTPases and SNARE complexes, to facilitate membrane fusion events. It is particularly important for the recruitment of the HOPS complex to endosomal membranes, which is vital for endocytic trafficking and receptor degradation (Pols2012The; Lin2014RILP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS41 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Biallelic variants in VPS41 have been linked to a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cognitive impairment, cerebellar atrophy or hypoplasia, motor dysfunction with ataxia and dystonia, and nystagmus. These mutations disrupt the normal function of the HOPS complex, leading to lysosomal dysregulation and abnormal membrane trafficking (van2019VPS41recessive; Sanderson2021Biallelic).

Specific mutations, such as S285P and R662*, impair the HOPS complex's ability to mediate lysosomal fusion, resulting in defects in endocytic and autophagic cargo delivery to lysosomes. This dysfunction is linked to conditions like ataxia, dystonia, retinal dystrophy, and mental retardation (van2019VPS41recessive). The VPS41 gene also plays a role in neuroprotection, particularly in Parkinson's disease models, where it helps reduce α-synuclein accumulation. Mutations in VPS41 can compromise this protective function, potentially contributing to Parkinson's disease pathology (Harrington2012Functional; Ruan2010VPS41).

Loss-of-function mutations in VPS41 are associated with early-onset dystonia and severe neurodevelopmental impairment, highlighting its role in lysosomal function and neurodegenerative processes (Steel2020Loss‐of‐Function).

## Interactions
VPS41, a subunit of the HOPS complex, participates in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in vesicle trafficking and fusion. VPS41 interacts with the RING domains of VPS18, forming a stable heterodimer that is essential for the recruitment of VPS41 to the HOPS complex in mammalian cells (Hunter2017VPS18). This interaction is crucial for the assembly of the HOPS complex, with VPS18 acting as a central hub (Hunter2017VPS18).

In addition to its role in the HOPS complex, VPS41 interacts with caspase-8, a key player in apoptosis. This interaction occurs via the WD40 region and RING-finger motif of VPS41, and it has been shown to enhance Fas-induced apoptosis in certain cell types (Wang2012Vps41). VPS41 also interacts with RILP, which is important for the endocytic trafficking of endocytosed EGF to the lysosome. This interaction is independent of Rab7, indicating a unique pathway for VPS41 in endocytic trafficking (Lin2014RILP).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of VPS41 in cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, apoptosis, and endocytic trafficking, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
