# KYAT1

## Overview
KYAT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme kynurenine aminotransferase 1, which is a key player in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a transferase, specifically involved in the transamination process that converts L-kynurenine into kynurenic acid, a metabolite with neuroprotective properties. Kynurenine aminotransferase 1 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, brain, and muscle, with particularly high levels in the liver and kidneys, underscoring its significance in peripheral metabolism (Zhen2022Kynurenic). In the central nervous system, the enzyme contributes to neurotransmitter regulation by interacting with receptors such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and the 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which are implicated in neurological conditions like schizophrenia and Huntington's disease (Zhen2022Kynurenic; Han2004pH). The gene's variations have been linked to clinical conditions, including ischemic stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its potential role in disease modulation and recovery (Boros2021Relationships; Fifita2021Genetic).

## Function
KYAT1, or kynurenine aminotransferase 1, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the kynurenine pathway, which is the primary route for the catabolism of tryptophan. This enzyme catalyzes the transamination of L-kynurenine to form kynurenic acid (KYNA), a neuroactive metabolite with neuroprotective effects (CastroPortuguez2020Kynurenine; Zhen2022Kynurenic). KYAT1 is involved in maintaining neurotransmitter balance by acting as an antagonist at the glutamate-binding site and the allosteric glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, and it may also block the 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Han2004pH).

KYAT1 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, brain, and muscle, with higher expression levels in the liver and kidneys, indicating its importance in peripheral tissues (Zhen2022Kynurenic). In the brain, KYAT1 activity is crucial for KYNA formation, which is associated with conditions like schizophrenia and Huntington's disease (Zhen2022Kynurenic; Han2004pH). The enzyme is both cytosolic and mitochondrial, with two mRNA variants coding for proteins with and without mitochondrial targeting sequences, highlighting its role in cellular energy metabolism and neuroprotection (Zhen2022Kynurenic).

## Clinical Significance
The KYAT1 gene, encoding the enzyme kynurenine aminotransferase 1, plays a significant role in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Variations in this gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of ischemic stroke, the rs10988134 SNP in the 3' UTR of KYAT1 has been linked to depression in the Polish population, although it does not directly correlate with stroke occurrence. However, this variant appears more frequently in stroke patients who exhibit early improvement, suggesting a potential influence on short-term recovery outcomes (Boros2021Relationships).

In the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, the KYAT1 gene has been studied for its potential involvement in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A burden of rare protein-altering variants in KYAT1 was identified in ALS cases, indicating a possible contribution to disease risk, although this finding was not replicated in all control comparisons (Fifita2021Genetic). These associations underscore the importance of KYAT1 in modulating neuroactive compounds and inflammation, which are critical factors in both stroke recovery and neurodegenerative disease progression. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and broader implications of KYAT1 gene variations.
