# C18orf54

## Overview
C18orf54 is a gene located on human chromosome 18 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 18 open reading frame 54. This protein is implicated in the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle, particularly during the S/G2-M phases, and is associated with centrosomal functions critical for cell division. The protein's co-localization with ɣ-tubulin, a centrosomal marker, suggests its involvement in ensuring proper kinetochore attachment to spindle microtubules during mitosis (Giotti2018Assembly). Although RNA interference studies indicate that C18orf54 plays a non-redundant role in cell proliferation, the precise molecular mechanisms and interactions of this protein remain largely undefined, classifying it as a functional orphan within cellular processes (Giotti2018Assembly).

## Structure


## Function
C18orf54 is a gene located on chromosome 18 that encodes a protein potentially involved in the human mitotic cell cycle, particularly during the S/G2-M phases. The protein encoded by C18orf54 has been observed to co-localize with ɣ-tubulin, a centrosomal marker, suggesting its involvement in centrosomal functions, which are crucial for cell cycle progression and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Giotti2018Assembly). This co-localization occurs during various mitotic stages, such as prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase, indicating a role in ensuring proper kinetochore attachment to spindle microtubules (Giotti2018Assembly).

RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown assays have shown that reducing the expression of C18orf54 affects cell proliferation rates, implying that the protein has non-redundant functions in cell cycle regulation (Giotti2018Assembly). Despite these findings, the exact molecular mechanisms and functions of C18orf54 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated. The gene is considered a functional orphan, as its specific roles and interactions within cellular processes are not yet well understood (Giotti2018Assembly).
