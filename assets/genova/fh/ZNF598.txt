# ZNF598

## Overview
ZNF598 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 598, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) and posttranscriptional regulation of inflammatory signaling. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a N-terminal RING domain and multiple C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its function in ubiquitinating ribosomal proteins to manage ribosome stalling and maintain translation fidelity (Garzia2017The; Sundaramoorthy2017ZNF598). ZNF598 plays a crucial role in recognizing collided ribosomes and initiating quality control pathways, which are essential for cellular homeostasis (Juszkiewicz2018ZNF598). Additionally, it interacts with proteins such as GIGYF1/2 to repress the translation of inflammation-associated mRNAs, highlighting its dual role in both RQC and inflammatory regulation (Tollenaere2019GIGYF12Driven). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes underscores its significance in health and disease, including neurodegenerative disorders, viral infections, and cancer (DiGiuseppe2018ZNF598; Lu2022Translational).

## Structure
ZNF598 is a human protein consisting of 904 amino acids, characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The protein contains a N-terminal RING domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins involved in ribosome quality control (RQC) (Garzia2017The; Tam2020Arsenite). Additionally, ZNF598 has four N-terminal and one C-terminal C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which are common in nucleic acid-binding proteins and suggest a role in RNA binding (Garzia2017The; Seetharam2013A).

The C-terminal region of ZNF598 is predicted to contain several alpha helices, although this region alone is not sufficient for binding to its translational partners, such as GIGYF2 (Morita2012A). The protein's structure includes a critical N-terminal RING domain, an unstructured central domain, and a C-terminal C2H2 motif (Garzia2017The). ZNF598 is involved in ribosome-associated quality control, where it ubiquitinates specific ribosomal proteins, such as RPS10 and RPS20, to manage ribosome stalling and translation fidelity (Tam2020Arsenite; Sundaramoorthy2017ZNF598).

## Function
ZNF598 is a zinc finger protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a critical role in ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) in human cells. It is involved in the regulatory ubiquitylation of ribosomal proteins, which is essential for resolving stalled ribosomes during translation. This process helps maintain translation fidelity by preventing the accumulation of defective translation products (Sundaramoorthy2017ZNF598; Juszkiewicz2018ZNF598). ZNF598 specifically recognizes collided ribosomes, which occur when a trailing ribosome catches up to a stalled leading ribosome, forming a distinct di-ribosome complex. It targets specific sites on the 40S subunit for ubiquitination, initiating quality control pathways that include ribosome recycling and potentially mRNA decay (Juszkiewicz2018ZNF598).

In addition to its role in RQC, ZNF598 is involved in posttranscriptional regulation of inflammatory signaling. It binds to GIGYF1/2 and represses the translation of inflammation-associated mRNAs, such as interleukin 8 (IL-8) and colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2), thereby suppressing pro-inflammatory signaling in resting cells (Tollenaere2019GIGYF12Driven). This dual role in both RQC and inflammatory regulation highlights ZNF598's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF598 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in ribosome-associated quality control. In neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), alterations in ZNF598 expression are associated with the pathogenesis of the disease. The knockdown of ZNF598 can mitigate some pathological features of AD, suggesting its involvement in the disease's progression through defective ribosome-associated quality control (Lu2022Translational). 

In the context of viral infections, ZNF598 plays a role in the ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins during viral replication. It is involved in the replication of viruses such as the vaccinia virus and SARS-CoV-2. Cells deficient in ZNF598 show impaired viral replication, indicating that viruses may exploit ZNF598 to enhance their replication while suppressing host antiviral responses (DiGiuseppe2018ZNF598; Lu2022Translational).

ZNF598 is also involved in inflammatory signaling. Its deficiency leads to the upregulation of inflammation-associated transcripts, such as IL-8 and CSF2 mRNA, suggesting a role in regulating inflammatory responses. This dysregulation may contribute to chronic inflammation and related conditions (Tollenaere2019GIGYF12Driven). 

In cancer, the expression of ZNF598 is deregulated, and its inhibition may affect cancer cell growth, indicating a potential role as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts (Lu2022Translational).

## Interactions
ZNF598 is a zinc finger protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is involved in ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). It interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis. ZNF598 binds to ribosomal proteins eS10 and uS10 on the 40S subunit, initiating quality control processes through site-specific ubiquitination (Miścicka2024Ribosomal; Juszkiewicz2018ZNF598). This ubiquitination can occur without ribosomal collision, although ribosome collisions enhance its activity (Miścicka2024Ribosomal).

ZNF598 also interacts with the GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 proteins, forming complexes that repress mRNA translation. This interaction is mediated by the GYF domain of GIGYF proteins, which binds to proline stretches in ZNF598 (Tollenaere2019GIGYF12Driven). ZNF598 is suggested to be an RNA-binding protein, as it cross-links to tRNAs, mRNAs, and rRNAs, indicating its role in monitoring mRNA translation and ribosome quality control (Garzia2017The).

In addition, ZNF598 interacts with the cap-binding protein 4EHP and TTP, forming hierarchical complexes that regulate the translation and turnover of specific transcripts (Tollenaere2019GIGYF12Driven). These interactions highlight ZNF598's multifaceted role in translational control and protein quality maintenance.
