# AMY1C

## Overview
The AMY1C gene is one of the several amylase genes responsible for encoding the enzyme salivary alpha-amylase, a hydrolase enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the digestion of dietary starches. This gene is part of a family of amylase genes that exhibit copy number variation, which can influence the concentration and activity of the enzyme in saliva (Barber2020AMY1). The protein product, amylase alpha 1C, is primarily expressed in the salivary glands and initiates the breakdown of starch into simpler sugars during the process of mastication. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the efficient digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, impacting both dietary preferences and nutritional status (Mandel2010Individual). The AMY1C gene, through its influence on salivary amylase levels, may also affect the sensory perception of starchy foods, thereby playing a role in dietary behavior and metabolic health.

## Structure


## Function
The AMY1C gene encodes salivary alpha-amylase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the initial digestion of dietary starches. This enzyme is primarily active in the salivary glands, where it begins the breakdown of starch during mastication. Salivary alpha-amylase hydrolyzes 1,4-glycosidic bonds within starch molecules, resulting in the formation of maltose, isomaltose, oligosaccharides, and glucose (Barber2020AMY1). This process is essential for converting complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars, which are further processed by pancreatic amylase in the small intestine to facilitate glucose absorption (Barber2020AMY1).

The activity of salivary alpha-amylase is influenced by the copy number variation (CNV) of the AMY1 gene, including AMY1C, which correlates with the concentration and enzymatic activity of salivary amylase (Barber2020AMY1). This variation in enzyme levels can affect the perception of starch viscosity in the mouth, influencing dietary preferences and potentially impacting nutritional status (Mandel2010Individual). The presence of salivary amylase may provide nutritional benefits by enhancing the perception of textural attributes of starchy foods and increasing the rate of blood glucose absorption from starch (Mandel2010Individual).
