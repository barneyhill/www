# ZNF865

## Overview
ZNF865 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 865, a member of the Cys2His2 (C2H2) zinc finger protein family, which typically functions as a transcription factor. This protein is involved in regulating essential cellular processes, including the cell cycle, DNA replication, and cellular senescence, by binding to DNA and influencing gene expression (Levis2023ZNF865). Zinc finger protein 865 is broadly expressed across various tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in maintaining normal cellular functions. Its upregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and survival, while downregulation can lead to cellular senescence and cell death (Levis2023ZNF865). The gene has clinical significance, with mutations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and potential therapeutic applications in degenerative diseases and tissue engineering (Levis2023ZNF865; Kobren2024Joint).

## Function
ZNF865 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in regulating key cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, DNA replication, and cellular senescence. ZNF865 is a Cys2His2 (C2H2) zinc finger protein, which typically functions as a transcription factor, influencing gene expression by binding to DNA. This protein is broadly expressed across various cell and tissue types, indicating its fundamental role in maintaining normal cellular functions (Levis2023ZNF865).

In terms of cell biology, ZNF865 upregulation is associated with increased cell cycle entry and proliferation rates, as well as enhanced mRNA and protein processing rates. This suggests that ZNF865 promotes cell proliferation and is essential for cell survival and healthy function. Conversely, its downregulation leads to cellular senescence and cell death, highlighting its protective role in cell health (Levis2023ZNF865).

ZNF865 also plays a role in tissue engineering applications, where its upregulation can enhance cartilage deposition and maintain a chondrogenic phenotype, which is beneficial for treating degenerative conditions such as degenerative disc disease (Levis2023ZNF865). These functions underscore the potential of ZNF865 in therapeutic applications, particularly in cell and gene therapy (Levis2023ZNF865).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF865 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, truncating de novo variants in ZNF865 have been identified in patients with neurodevelopmental delay, suggesting a potential pathogenic role for these mutations (Kobren2024Joint). 

In Parkinson's disease (PD), the interaction between ZNF865 and miR-184 has been studied, revealing that miR-184 levels are elevated in PD patients. This interaction is significant as miR-184 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) treatment has been shown to rescue neuronal apoptosis and improve motor performance in PD models, indicating that ZNF865 may play a role in PD progression and could serve as a therapeutic target (Liu2023MiR184).

Alterations in ZNF865 expression also have implications in cellular senescence and degenerative diseases. Upregulation of ZNF865 can rescue degenerative human neural progenitor cells from senescence, which is associated with age-related diseases. This suggests potential therapeutic applications for conditions like osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease, where ZNF865 upregulation enhances cartilage deposition and cell proliferation (Levis2023ZNF865). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF865 in various disease contexts.
