# KLF9

## Overview
Krüppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the Krüppel-like factor family, characterized by the presence of three C2H2 zinc finger domains. These domains are essential for the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate transcription. KLF9 functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, although it can also act as an activator depending on the cellular context. It plays a critical role in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress responses, and neuronal differentiation. KLF9 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and is expressed in the central nervous system, where it influences neuronal morphology and function. Additionally, KLF9 is implicated in the circadian clock and immune cell development. Clinically, alterations in KLF9 expression have been associated with several cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, influencing tumor growth, metastasis, and patient prognosis (Safi2022Predicting; Simmen2023Krüppellike).

## Structure
KLF9, a member of the Krüppel-like factor family, is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes three conserved C2H2 zinc finger domains located in the C-terminal region. These zinc fingers are crucial for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Safi2022Predicting; Simmen2023Krüppellike). The primary structure of KLF9 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form these zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its function as a transcriptional repressor (Safi2022Predicting).

The secondary structure of KLF9 includes typical elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of KLF9 has been modeled using homology modeling techniques, showing a 62% similarity with the KLF4 template, indicating a well-conserved 3D conformation (Safi2022Predicting).

KLF9 interacts with co-repressors such as Sin3A, facilitating the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2) to alter chromatin structure and repress transcription (Safi2022Predicting). This interaction highlights the quaternary structure's role in forming protein complexes that regulate gene expression. KLF9's post-translational modifications are less reported compared to other KLF family members, but its interactions with other proteins suggest a complex regulatory role in cellular processes (Simmen2023Krüppellike).

## Function
KLF9 (Kruppel-like factor 9) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress responses. It functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, although it can also act as an activator depending on the cellular context (Knoedler2017The; Simmen2023Krüppellike). KLF9 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, where its knockdown or knockout can lead to shortened cell cycles and increased expression of genes involved in cell proliferation (Knoedler2017The).

In the central nervous system, KLF9 is crucial for neuronal differentiation, survival, and function. It is expressed in the hippocampus and cerebellum, where it influences neuronal morphology and function by repressing genes involved in cytoskeletal regulation and Wnt signaling (Knoedler2017The). KLF9 is also linked to the circadian clock, affecting gene expression rhythms in human keratinocytes and breast cancer cells (Simmen2023Krüppellike).

KLF9's expression is induced by oxidative stress, leading to increased reactive oxygen species and apoptosis through the suppression of antioxidant genes (Simmen2023Krüppellike). It is also involved in immune cell development and function, influencing tumor development and the tumor microenvironment (Simmen2023Krüppellike).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KLF9 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, KLF9 knock-down inhibits cell proliferation and growth, while its overexpression reduces 'stemness' and metastatic abilities, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Simmen2023Krüppellike). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, reduced KLF9 expression is associated with poor patient survival, as it inhibits proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and induces apoptosis (Simmen2023Krüppellike). In prostate cancer, KLF9 suppresses growth by repressing AKT and androgen receptor pathways (Simmen2023Krüppellike).

KLF9 expression is also reduced in breast, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinomas, where it inhibits cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Safi2022Predicting; Simmen2023Krüppellike). In multiple myeloma, KLF9 is a transcriptional regulator that induces NOXA-dependent apoptosis, particularly in response to the drug bortezomib, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for treatment efficacy (Mannava2012KLF9).

In cervical cancer, KLF9's reduced expression is linked to poor prognosis and tumor metastasis, and it may serve as a circulating biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Safi2022Predicting). These findings underscore the importance of KLF9 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Krüppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role as a transcription factor. KLF9 interacts with over eighty proteins, many of which are nuclear proteins with activator or repressor functions, such as ARID2, BRD7, CTCF, and YY1. These interactions suggest potential roles in regulating chromatin structure and gene accessibility during oncogenesis (Simmen2023Krüppellike). KLF9 is known to recruit HDAC1 to the MMP9 gene promoter in breast cancer cells, repressing MMP9 synthesis and cell migration/invasion (Simmen2023Krüppellike). It also interacts with Progesterone Receptor B and ZZEF1 (Simmen2023Krüppellike).

KLF9 contains a conserved hydrophobic motif, AAQCL, which serves as a Sin3-interacting domain (SID) and facilitates the recruitment and binding of Sin3A, a co-repressor involved in recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and altering chromatin compaction to repress transcription (Safi2022Predicting). KLF9 also physically interacts with C/EBPα, a transcription factor, to synergistically activate the PPARγ2 promoter during adipogenesis (Pei2010Krüppellike). This interaction is crucial for the transactivation of PPARγ2, a key regulator in adipogenesis (Pei2010Krüppellike). These interactions highlight KLF9's role in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in various cellular processes.
