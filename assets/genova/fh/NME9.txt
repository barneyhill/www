# NME9

## Overview
NME9 is a gene that encodes the protein NME/NM23 family member 9, which is part of the NME/NM23 family of proteins. This family is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. NME9 is categorized within Group II of the NME protein family, which is characterized by proteins that are more divergent and often associated with ciliary and flagellar structures (Herak2018A). The NME9 protein contains a thioredoxin domain (TRX_NDPk) and an NDPk_TX domain, although it does not exhibit the typical thioredoxin activity associated with protein-disulfide reductase functions (Desvignes2009Nme). It is predominantly expressed in tissues with ciliated cells, such as the testis and lung, and is implicated in microtubule association, suggesting a role in ciliary function and axonemal organization (Boissan2009The; Desvignes2009Nme). The gene is thought to have originated from a partial duplication of the NME8 gene, sharing a similar exon-intron structure in its 5'-region (Ćetković2014Nme; Desvignes2009Nme).

## Structure
The NME9 protein, a member of the NME/NM23 family, is characterized by the presence of a thioredoxin domain (TRX_NDPk) and an NDPk_TX domain, which are also found in the N-terminus region of the human NME8 protein (Desvignes2009Nme). Despite the presence of a thioredoxin domain, NME9 does not exhibit thioredoxin activity, which is typically associated with protein-disulfide reductase functions (Desvignes2009Nme). NME9 is part of Group II of the NME protein family, which includes proteins that are more divergent and often located in cilia or flagella (Herak2018A). 

The protein is highly expressed in tissues containing ciliated cells, such as the testis and lung, and has the ability to associate with microtubules, suggesting a role in testicular function and axonemal organization (Desvignes2009Nme). NME9 is hypothesized to have originated from an incompletely translocated duplication of the NME8 gene, with both proteins sharing a similar exon-intron structure in the 5'-region of the gene (Ćetković2014Nme; Desvignes2009Nme). The specific molecular structure of NME9, including its tertiary and quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available sources.

## Function
NME9, a member of the NME/NM23 family, is primarily expressed in tissues containing ciliated cells, such as the testis and lung. It is associated with microtubular structures, including the cilia of lung airway epithelium and the axoneme of spermatids, suggesting a role in ciliary function and axonemal organization (Boissan2009The; Desvignes2009Nme). Despite containing a thioredoxin domain, NME9 does not exhibit thioredoxin activity, which is typically involved in protein-disulfide reduction (Boissan2009The; Desvignes2009Nme).

NME9 is classified within Group II of the NME gene family, which includes proteins with divergent functions and lower sequence identity compared to Group I. These proteins are generally expressed in ciliated structures, such as primary cilia and sperm flagella, indicating a specialized role in these cellular components (Boissan2009The). Although the specific molecular functions of NME9 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its expression pattern and association with ciliary structures imply a significant role in cellular processes related to cilia and possibly in testicular function (Boissan2009The; Desvignes2009Nme).
