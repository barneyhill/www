# PEX5L

## Overview
PEX5L is a gene that encodes the protein peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 like, which plays a pivotal role in the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes. This protein is categorized as a peroxisomal targeting receptor and is integral to the peroxisomal import machinery. It shares structural similarities with PEX5, including tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions necessary for binding peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) proteins. PEX5L exists in multiple isoforms and is involved in the import of PTS2 proteins by interacting with Pex7p. The protein transitions from a soluble cytosolic form to a membrane-bound form, becoming part of the peroxisomal translocon and acting as a pore-forming component. Mutations in the PEX5L gene are linked to rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 5 (RCDP5), a disorder characterized by defects in peroxisomal protein import, underscoring the gene's critical role in cellular function and peroxisomal biogenesis (Barøy2015A; Otera2002Peroxisomal; Blum2022Membrane).

## Structure
PEX5L is a peroxisomal targeting receptor involved in the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes. It shares structural similarities with PEX5, including the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. The TPR domains in PEX5L facilitate the binding of peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) proteins, and the protein's C-terminal domain is essential for cargo binding and pore organization (Otera2002Peroxisomal; Blum2022Membrane).

PEX5L exists in two isoforms, with PEX5L containing a 37-amino acid insertion that is important for PTS2 import by interacting with Pex7p (Otera2002Peroxisomal). The N-terminal domain of PEX5L is largely disordered and contains multiple WXXXF/Y motifs, which are critical for interactions with Pex13p and Pex14p, components of the peroxisomal import machinery (Otera2002Peroxisomal).

PEX5L transitions from a soluble form in the cytosol to a membrane-bound form, where it becomes part of the peroxisomal translocon. This transition involves the formation of larger complexes and ion-conducting channels, suggesting that PEX5L acts as a pore-forming component of the translocon (Blum2022Membrane).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX5L gene are associated with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 5 (RCDP5), a peroxisome biogenesis disorder. This condition is characterized by congenital cataracts, growth delay, microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, and seizures. Radiological findings often include mild shortening of the humeri, narrow ilii, coxa vara, and scoliosis. The clinical phenotype is linked to a specific mutation, c.722dupA, which results in a frameshift affecting only the PEX5L isoform, leading to a selective defect in the import of PTS2-tagged proteins (Barøy2015A).

The loss of PEX5L disrupts the interaction with Pex7p, impairing the import of PTS2 proteins into peroxisomes. This disruption is crucial for peroxisomal function and contributes to the pathogenesis of RCDP5. Patients with this mutation exhibit mildly reduced plasmalogen levels and elevated phytanic acid levels, indicating deficient import of specific PTS2-tagged proteins like AGPS and PHYH (Barøy2015A; Matsumura2000Disruption).

The dysfunction of PEX5L due to mutations can lead to peroxisomal disorders, highlighting its critical role in peroxisomal protein import and normal cellular function (Okumoto2020Peroxisome:; Matsumura2000Disruption).

## Interactions
PEX5L, also known as peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 like, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins that facilitate peroxisomal matrix protein import. PEX5L interacts with Pex14p, which serves as the initial docking site for the Pex5p-cargo complexes on peroxisomal membranes. This interaction is crucial for the translocation of PTS2-Pex7p complexes into peroxisomes (Otera2000The). PEX5L also binds to Pex13p, although this interaction is not necessary for the import of PTS1 and PTS2 proteins but is essential for the import of catalase, a peroxisomal enzyme (Otera2002Peroxisomal).

The protein contains multiple WXXXF/Y motifs, which are critical for its binding to Pex14p, with motifs 1, 3, and 5 being the highest-affinity sites (Otera2002Peroxisomal). PEX5L also interacts with Pex7p, a receptor for PTS2 proteins, facilitating their import into peroxisomes. This interaction is essential for PTS2 transport and is mediated by the N-terminal region of PEX5L, which includes a specific 37-amino-acid insertion (Matsumura2000Disruption; Otera2002Peroxisomal). The interaction between PEX5L and Pex7p is disrupted by certain mutations, such as S214F, which abolish PTS2 protein import (Matsumura2000Disruption).
