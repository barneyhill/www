# SPRR2G

## Overview
SPRR2G is a gene that encodes the small proline-rich protein 2G, which is a crucial component of the cornified cell envelope (CE) in epithelial cells. This protein is categorized as a structural protein involved in keratinization, contributing to the differentiation and function of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis. The SPRR2G protein is initially present in the cytosol and becomes cross-linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase, forming an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and protective function of the skin barrier (Tripathi2020Human; Nemes1999Bricks). Located within the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1q21, SPRR2G is part of a gene cluster that plays a significant role in skin barrier function and response to environmental stress (Martin2004Longrange). The protein's expression is modulated by environmental factors and possesses anti-oxidative properties, contributing to the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (Kypriotou2012The).

## Structure


## Function
SPRR2G (small proline-rich protein 2G) is a protein-coding gene involved in the process of keratinization and plays a significant role in the differentiation and function of keratinocytes. The protein encoded by SPRR2G initially appears in the cell cytosol and is eventually cross-linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase, forming an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane. This process is crucial for the structural integrity and protective function of keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis (Tripathi2020Human).

SPRR2G is part of the small proline-rich protein (SPRR) family, which contributes to the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE) in epithelial cells. These proteins are involved in constructing permeability barriers in various tissues, such as the skin, mouth, and tongue, and are upregulated under stress conditions to rapidly build a temporary barrier (Martin2004Longrange). The SPRR2G gene is located within the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on human chromosome 1q21, a region known for its role in skin barrier function and response to environmental stress (Martin2004Longrange).

## Clinical Significance
SPRR2G has been implicated in various cancers, particularly in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and larynx squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In LSCC, SPRR2G is one of the most highly expressed genes in tumor tissues, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker or therapeutic target (Figueiredo2019Larynx). In HNSCC, SPRR2G expression is downregulated in HPV-positive tumors compared to HPV-negative ones, indicating a possible involvement in the pathogenesis of HPV-associated cancers (L.2017Distinct; Tripathi2020Human). This downregulation is associated with promoter methylation, which may regulate its expression in HPV-positive cases (L.2017Distinct).

In breast cancer, SPRR2G is among the genes upregulated in association with morphological features such as tumor grade, suggesting a link between its expression and tumor behavior (Rakha2020Visual). The gene's expression patterns in these cancers highlight its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a target for therapeutic interventions. However, the specific clinical significance of SPRR2G mutations or alterations in its interactions remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
SPRR2G, a member of the small proline-rich protein (SPRR) family, is involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE) in epithelial cells. These proteins are substrates for transglutaminase (TGase) enzymes, which catalyze cross-linking reactions essential for CE assembly. SPRR2G, like other SPR proteins, participates in cross-linking processes that contribute to the structural integrity and barrier function of the epidermis (Kalinin2002Epithelial; Nemes1999Bricks).

SPRR2G is thought to interact with involucrin, a key protein in the CE, through binding to its groove. This interaction is facilitated by the proline-rich repeats in SPRR2G, which allow it to form extended conformations that can interact with involucrin. These interactions are crucial for the early stages of CE formation, where involucrin serves as a scaffold for other proteins (Kalinin2002Epithelial).

SPRR2G, along with other SPRR proteins, is sensitive to environmental factors such as UV irradiation and retinoic acid, which can influence its expression and interactions. These proteins also possess anti-oxidative properties, contributing to the detoxification of reactive oxygen species in the skin (Kypriotou2012The).
