# EPRS1

## Overview
EPRS1 is a gene that encodes the bifunctional enzyme glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase 1, which plays a critical role in protein synthesis and various cellular processes. This enzyme is categorized as a tRNA synthetase and is a key component of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC), where it contributes to the regulation of immune and metabolic activities. EPRS1 is involved in the translation of proteins by catalyzing the attachment of glutamate and proline to their respective tRNAs. Beyond its canonical role in protein synthesis, EPRS1 participates in noncanonical functions, such as modulating inflammatory responses through the GAIT complex and influencing lipid metabolism and antiviral immune responses. The enzyme's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which affects its interactions and functions within the cell (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent).

## Structure
The EPRS1 protein, also known as glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is a bifunctional enzyme with a complex molecular structure. It is composed of several distinct domains, including a glutathione-S-transferase-like (GST) domain, three WHEP domains, a glutamyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (EARS1) domain, a prolyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (PARS1) domain, and a zinc-binding domain (ZBD) (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent; Vasu2021The). The GST domain is involved in interactions within the multi-synthetase complex (MSC), forming a tetrameric complex with other synthetases (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent). The WHEP domains, located in the linker region, are involved in non-canonical functions such as binding to GAIT RNA elements (Vasu2021The).

The tertiary structure of EPRS1 includes crystal structures of the GST and PARS1 domains, while the W1 domain has been solved using NMR spectroscopy (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent). The quaternary structure involves EPRS1 forming a dimer within the MSC (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation at Ser886, Ser990, and Ser999, are crucial for its function in inflammatory responses and its dissociation from the MSC (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent). The ZBD is essential for catalytic activity and stability, coordinating Zn2+ with conserved cysteine residues (Vasu2021The).

## Function
The EPRS1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase 1, which is a bifunctional tRNA synthetase involved in protein synthesis and various noncanonical cellular functions. In healthy human cells, EPRS1 is a component of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by acting as a molecular switch that regulates immune and metabolic activities in response to specific stimuli (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent).

EPRS1 is involved in the regulation of inflammation through its participation in the GAIT (gamma-interferon-activated inhibitor of translation) complex. Upon phosphorylation, EPRS1 dissociates from the MSC and interacts with other proteins to form the GAIT complex, which silences the translation of inflammatory genes by binding to specific mRNA elements (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent). This function is crucial for resolving inflammation and maintaining inflammatory homeostasis (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent).

In addition to its role in inflammation, EPRS1 is involved in lipid metabolism. It is phosphorylated in response to insulin, which influences adipocyte function and lipid accumulation by interacting with fatty acid transport proteins and regulating triglyceride synthesis (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent). EPRS1 also plays a role in antiviral immune responses by stabilizing MAVS, a key protein in the RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway, thereby enhancing antiviral cytokine production (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EPRS1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Biallelic mutations in EPRS1 have been linked to hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, a condition characterized by deficient myelination, developmental delays, motor and cognitive regression, and sensorineural hearing loss. These mutations affect the proline tRNA synthetase core domain, leading to decreased protein availability and impaired tRNA synthetase function (Mendes2018Biallelic; Khan2024Homozygous).

Heterozygous variants in EPRS1 have been identified in patients with psychomotor retardation, seizures, and deafness, with mutations located in the conserved EARS1 domain (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent). Compound heterozygous mutations in EPRS1 have also been reported in patients with diabetes and bone diseases, affecting tRNA charging kinetics and aminoacylation (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent).

EPRS1 is implicated in fibrosis, as it is overexpressed in failing hearts and contributes to the translation of proline-rich profibrotic proteins. The antifibrotic agent halofuginone inhibits EPRS1 activity, reducing the translation of proline-rich collagens, suggesting EPRS1 as a potential drug target for fibrotic diseases (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent).

In cancer, EPRS1 is overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and breast cancer, correlating with unfavorable clinical outcomes. It regulates cell cycle and estrogen response gene expression, contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer cell proliferation (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent).

## Interactions
EPRS1, or glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is a bifunctional enzyme that participates in various protein interactions within the multi-synthetase complex (MSC). It contains a glutathione-S-transferase-like (GST) domain that interacts with the GST domains of auxiliary proteins AIMP2 and AIMP3, forming a tetrameric GST complex with MARS1, which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the MSC (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent). EPRS1 also interacts with IARS1 through its EARS1 domain, although its PARS1 domain does not contact other MSC components (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent).

In the context of immune response, EPRS1 interacts with the RIG-I/MAVS axis, crucial for antiviral signaling. It competes with MAVS for binding to poly(C)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2), preventing PCBP2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of MAVS, thereby enhancing antiviral immune responses (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent). EPRS1 also plays a role in the GAIT complex, where it binds to GAIT-element-containing mRNAs, inhibiting their translation. This interaction involves EPRS1's W1 and W2 domains and is regulated by phosphorylation events (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent).

EPRS1 is involved in anti-inflammatory signaling by recruiting AKT to early endosomes, where it interacts with Rab5B and Rab5C, and regulates downstream targets like glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent).
