# PRPF3

## Overview
The PRPF3 gene encodes the pre-mRNA processing factor 3 protein, a critical component of the spliceosome complex involved in the splicing of pre-mRNA. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor and is essential for the proper assembly and function of the spliceosome, particularly through its association with the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) (Cao2011Temporal; GonzalezSantos2002Central). The PRPF3 protein is characterized by several domains, including a PWI motif, a PRP3 domain, and a DUF1115 domain, which facilitate its role in RNA splicing (Zhong2016Two). Mutations in the PRPF3 gene have been linked to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Comitato2007Mutations; Cao2011Temporal). The study of PRPF3 and its associated mutations provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal degeneration and the broader implications of splicing factor dysfunction.

## Structure
The PRPF3 protein, encoded by the PRPF3 gene, is a component of the spliceosome complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It is a human homologue of the yeast U4/U6-associated splicing factor Prp3 and consists of 683 amino acids (Zhong2016Two). The protein contains several domains, including a PWI motif, a PRP3 domain, and a DUF1115 domain, which are crucial for its function in RNA splicing (Zhong2016Two).

The secondary structure of PRPF3 includes extended α-helices, particularly in its N-terminal half, which are involved in binding to the U4/U6 snRNA duplex. The first helix (residues 238-262) and the second helix (residues 291-326) play significant roles in recognizing specific nucleotides and forming hydrogen bonds with the RNA duplex (Wan2016The).

Mutations in PRPF3, such as p.R449G and p.H511P, are located in highly conserved regions and are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. These mutations likely disrupt the protein's α-helical structure, impairing its ability to bind RNA (Zhong2016Two). The T494M mutation leads to the formation of aggregates in photoreceptor cells, affecting the distribution of other splicing factors (Comitato2007Mutations).

## Function
The PRPF3 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts, facilitating the maturation of mRNA. PRPF3 is specifically associated with the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), which is essential for spliceosome assembly and function (Cao2011Temporal; GonzalezSantos2002Central). The protein interacts with other splicing factors, such as Hprp4p, and this interaction is vital for maintaining the association with U4/U6 snRNAs, which are necessary for the splicing process (GonzalezSantos2002Central).

In healthy human cells, PRPF3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in stabilizing intermediate complexes necessary for spliceosome assembly (Cao2011Temporal). The central region of the PRPF3 protein is crucial for its interaction with Hprp4p, and this interaction is necessary for the recruitment of other proteins to the U4/U6 snRNP, highlighting its role in the complex protein-protein interactions required for spliceosome assembly (GonzalezSantos2002Central). The proper functioning of PRPF3 is essential for accurate mRNA processing, which is critical for cellular function and gene regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRPF3 gene are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), specifically RP18, a degenerative eye disease characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptor cells, leading to vision impairment (Comitato2007Mutations; Cao2011Temporal). The T494M mutation in PRPF3 is particularly noted for causing protein aggregation in the nucleolus of photoreceptor cells, which disrupts the distribution of other splicing factors and triggers apoptosis, contributing to retinal degeneration (Comitato2007Mutations). These aggregates are not observed with the wild-type protein and suggest a cell-specific dominant effect (Comitato2007Mutations).

The pathogenic mechanism of PRPF3 mutations may involve defects in the recycling of the pre-mRNA splicing factor, leading to aberrant protein aggregation in photoreceptors (Comitato2007Mutations). Despite PRPF3 being ubiquitously expressed, its mutations result in a specific detrimental effect in rod photoreceptors, possibly due to the high demand for splicing components in the retina (Cao2011Temporal). The study of PRPF3 mutations highlights the importance of understanding the biochemical changes leading to nuclear aggregates and their impact on the splicing of rod-specific genes (Comitato2007Mutations).

## Interactions
PRPF3 is a component of the spliceosome, specifically part of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex, and plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate spliceosome assembly and function. PRPF3 binds to PRPF4, a key component of the U4-U6 splicing complex, through its central region, while its C-terminal part binds to small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and PAP-1 (Comitato2007Mutations). The C-terminus of PRPF3 is essential for binding to Hprp4p, U4/U6 snRNA, and other proteins such as the U4/U6 snRNA recycling factor p110, SPF30, and U5 snRNP proteins Hprp6 and Hsnu66 (Cao2011Temporal).

Mutations in PRPF3, such as the T494M variant, can lead to the formation of aggregates in photoreceptor cells, affecting the distribution of other splicing factors like SC35 and disrupting splicing factor recycling (Comitato2007Mutations). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the proper function of the spliceosome and ensuring efficient RNA splicing, particularly in retinal cells where high levels of splicing activity are required (Cao2011Temporal).
