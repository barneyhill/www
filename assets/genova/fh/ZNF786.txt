# ZNF786

## Overview
ZNF786 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 786, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to DNA. Zinc finger proteins are typically involved in transcriptional regulation, and ZNF786 is no exception, playing a role in chromatin structure and function. The protein encoded by ZNF786 is implicated in interactions with histone proteins, suggesting its involvement in chromatin remodeling or gene expression regulation. Additionally, ZNF786 is a potential target of microRNA miR-17-5p, indicating a layer of post-transcriptional regulation that could influence its expression and function (Martin2014Imperfect; Ser2019Optimized).

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF786 is involved in interactions with histone proteins, as identified through optimized cross-linking mass spectrometry studies. The research revealed that ZNF786 is cross-linked to histone proteins, suggesting that it may associate with histones through proximal binding to DNA rather than direct binding to the histones themselves. This indicates a potential role for ZNF786 in chromatin structure or function, possibly through interactions with histones or DNA (Ser2019Optimized).

In addition to its interactions with histones, ZNF786 has been identified as a potential target of miR-17-5p. The gene contains extended 3' UTRs that harbor miR-17-5p seed or centered sites, suggesting that ZNF786 may interact with miR-17-5p through these extended regions. This interaction implies a regulatory mechanism where miR-17-5p could influence the expression of ZNF786 by binding to these sites (Martin2014Imperfect).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of ZNF786 in cellular processes, involving both protein-protein interactions within chromatin and regulatory interactions with miRNAs, which may impact gene expression and chromatin organization.
