# APH1B

## Overview
APH1B is a gene that encodes the protein aph-1 homolog B, a subunit of the γ-secretase complex, which is a multi-pass transmembrane protein complex involved in intramembrane proteolysis. The γ-secretase complex plays a critical role in the cleavage of various type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neuregulin 1 (NRG1), which are important for cellular signaling and brain function (Dehury2020Membrane; Zhang2020Negative). The APH1B protein acts as a scaffold within the complex, influencing its proteolytic activity and stability (Odorcic2023Structure). It is particularly significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, due to its involvement in the production of amyloid-beta peptides (Dehury2020Membrane). Additionally, APH1B has been implicated in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, where its role in NRG1 processing is crucial (Dejaegere2008Deficiency). The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation, and its dysregulation can have significant clinical implications (Park2021Dysregulated).

## Structure
APH1B is a multi-pass transmembrane protein that is part of the γ-secretase complex, which is crucial for intramembrane proteolysis. It has a seven-transmembrane topology, with its N-terminus and even-numbered loops facing the lumen, while the C-terminus faces the cytosol (Li2014Structural). The APH1B subunit shares a 56% sequence identity with its paralog APH1A, with conservative substitutions scattered throughout (Odorčić2024Apo; Odorcic2023Structure).

Structurally, APH1B serves as a scaffold within the γ-secretase complex, modulating its proteolytic activity in an isoform-dependent manner. The structural differences between APH1B and APH1A are primarily located at the PSEN1/APH-1 interface, involving interactions between transmembrane helices and the insertion of the PSEN1 C-terminus into the APH-1 helical bundle (Odorcic2023Structure). These differences are confined to regions with low sequence conservation and are sequence-dependent rather than environment-dependent (Odorcic2023Structure).

The APH1B isoform shows local divergence in three segments on the intracellular and extracellular membrane surfaces, with specific bends in the helical pairs and a partially disordered cytosolic loop (Odorčić2024Apo). These structural features may contribute to isoform-dependent allosteric effects, influencing the dynamics of the γ-secretase complex (Odorcic2023Structure).

## Function
The APH1B gene encodes a subunit of the γ-secretase complex, a crucial protease involved in the intramembrane processing of various type I transmembrane proteins, including neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Dehury2020Membrane; Zhang2020Negative). In healthy human cells, APH1B plays a significant role in the proper cleavage of NRG1, which is essential for intracellular signaling pathways that influence brain development and synaptic activity (Dejaegere2008Deficiency). This processing is vital for maintaining normal synaptic transmission and plasticity, particularly in the hippocampus, where it regulates excitatory synaptic connections and cognitive functions (Fazzari2014Cell).

APH1B is also involved in the assembly and stabilization of the γ-secretase complex, which is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Zhang2020Negative). The complex's activity is crucial for the processing of APP, influencing the production of amyloid-beta peptides, which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Dehury2020Membrane). The APH1B subunit may also form a water channel within the membrane-bound enzyme complex, facilitating water molecule transport across the membrane, which is important for its function (Dehury2020Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
The APH1B gene is implicated in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders due to its role in the γ-secretase complex, which is crucial for the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Dysregulated expression of APH1B has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), where increased expression levels in peripheral blood correlate with brain atrophy and amyloid-β deposition. This dysregulation may lead to a higher Aβ 1-42/1-40 ratio, contributing to AD pathogenesis (Park2021Dysregulated). Genetic studies have identified APH1B as a susceptibility gene for AD, with its inactivation in mouse models reducing disease-relevant phenotypic features (Odorčić2024Apo; Serneels2009γSecretase).

In schizophrenia, mutations or deficiencies in APH1B disrupt the cleavage of neuregulin 1 (NRG1), leading to the accumulation of its transmembrane fragment, which is linked to the disorder. This disruption results in behavioral and physiological changes, such as impaired sensorimotor gating and increased dopamine activity, which are associated with schizophrenia (Dejaegere2008Deficiency).

Despite these associations, some studies have found negative evidence for the role of specific APH1B variants, such as T27I, in AD, suggesting that not all genetic variations in APH1B contribute to disease pathology (Zhang2020Negative).

## Interactions
APH1B is a component of the γ-secretase complex, which is crucial for the proteolytic processing of several type I transmembrane proteins. Within this complex, APH1B interacts with other subunits, including presenilin (PSEN1), nicastrin (NCT), and PEN-2. These interactions are essential for the assembly and function of the γ-secretase complex (Odorcic2023Structure).

The interaction between APH1B and PSEN1 is particularly significant. APH1B interacts with PSEN1 at the transmembrane region, involving adjacent α-helices of APH-1B (TM2-TM4) and PSEN1 (TM1, TM8-TM9). The C-terminus of PSEN1 inserts into the APH-1B helical bundle on the extracellular side, forming a specific interface that spans approximately 2000 Å² (Odorčić2024Apo). These interactions are largely conserved between APH-1 isoforms, although some substitutions in the transmembrane helices may influence the interaction dynamics (Odorcic2023Structure).

APH1B also plays a role in modulating the length of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, which is critical for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. The presence of APH1B in the γ-secretase complex is associated with the production of longer, aggregation-prone Aβ peptides (Odorčić2024Apo). This modulation is thought to occur through allosteric-like effects at the PSEN1/APH-1 interface, which are induced by substrate binding (Odorcic2023Structure).
