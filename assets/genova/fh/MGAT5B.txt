# MGAT5B

## Overview
MGAT5B is a gene that encodes the enzyme alpha-1,6-mannosylglycoprotein 6-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase B, commonly referred to as GnT-IX. This enzyme is a glycosyltransferase, which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of branched O-mannose glycans, predominantly in the brain (Kizuka2019Regulated; Kizuka2017Expression). GnT-IX catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to mannose residues, forming a unique β1,6-linkage, which is essential for the modification of specific glycoproteins, influencing their function and stability (Kizuka2019Regulated). The activity of this enzyme is localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to protein folding, stability, and cell signaling, thereby impacting cellular communication and immune response regulation (Kizuka2019Regulated). The expression of MGAT5B is subject to regulation by transcription factors and epigenetic modifications, underscoring its complex role in cellular processes (Kizuka2019Regulated).

## Function
The MGAT5B gene encodes the enzyme GnT-IX, a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of branched O-mannose glycans, which are primarily expressed in the brain. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to mannose residues, forming a unique β1,6-linkage from the reducing mannose in brain O-mannose glycans (Kizuka2019Regulated; Kizuka2017Expression). These glycans are crucial for modifying specific glycoproteins, such as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type Z (PTPRZ), affecting their retention time at the cell surface and phosphatase activity (Kizuka2019Regulated).

In healthy human cells, MGAT5B's function is linked to the modification of glycoproteins with branched O-mannose glycans, which play a role in cellular communication and potentially in regulating astrocyte activation and demyelination processes (Kizuka2019Regulated; Kizuka2017Expression). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to protein folding, stability, and cell signaling, thereby influencing cellular communication and immune response regulation (Kizuka2019Regulated). The expression of MGAT5B is regulated by transcription factors such as NeuroD1 and CTCF, and is influenced by epigenetic histone modifications (Kizuka2019Regulated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MGAT5B gene have been implicated in several diseases. In schizophrenia, increased expression of MGAT5B and other glycosylation enzymes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex suggests a role in the dysregulation of glycosylation pathways, potentially affecting protein folding and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Mueller2018Glycosylation). In prostate cancer, MGAT5B is overexpressed, particularly in metastatic cell lines, and its products, β(1,6)-branched oligosaccharides, are markers of tumor progression (Lange2012Human). This overexpression is associated with increased metastatic potential and poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients (Lange2012Human).

MGAT5B has also been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where a de novo variant in the gene was identified in an individual with early onset autism, suggesting a potential role in the disorder's pathogenesis (Viggiano2024Genomic). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MGAT5B is among the proteins identified as potential biomarkers, with increased levels observed in patients, indicating its utility in diagnosing the disease (Trevisan2020The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MGAT5B in various conditions, emphasizing its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
