# CYP4F3

## Overview
CYP4F3 is a gene that encodes the cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily F member 3, a protein involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and eicosanoids. This enzyme is categorized as a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which is known for its role in the oxidative metabolism of various substrates. The CYP4F3 gene produces two main isoforms, CYP4F3A and CYP4F3B, through alternative splicing, each with distinct tissue-specific expression and functional roles. CYP4F3A is primarily expressed in leukocytes and plays a critical role in the inactivation of leukotriene B4, a pro-inflammatory molecule, thereby modulating immune responses (Kalsotra2006Cytochrome; Kikuta2007Expression). In contrast, CYP4F3B is predominantly found in the liver and is involved in the ω-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid, contributing to the regulation of vascular tone and other physiological processes (Madec2011CYP4F3B; Corcos2012Human). The gene's activity is essential for maintaining the balance of inflammatory responses and is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions (Jarrar2019Molecular; Tang2024Establishment).

## Function
The human gene CYP4F3 encodes enzymes that are crucial in the metabolism of fatty acids and eicosanoids, primarily functioning in the hydroxylation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent pro-inflammatory molecule. This process is essential for modulating inflammation by converting LTB4 into an inactive form, thus regulating inflammatory responses in the body (Jarrar2019Molecular; Corcos2012Human). CYP4F3 produces two isoforms, CYP4F3A and CYP4F3B, through alternative splicing. CYP4F3A is predominantly expressed in leukocytes, such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes, where it efficiently inactivates LTB4, playing a significant role in the immune response (Kalsotra2006Cytochrome; Kikuta2007Expression). 

CYP4F3B, on the other hand, is primarily found in the liver and is involved in the ω-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid to produce 20-HETE, a molecule involved in regulating vascular tone, cell proliferation, and natriuresis (Madec2011CYP4F3B; Corcos2012Human). The expression of these isoforms is tissue-specific, with CYP4F3A associated with myeloid differentiation and CYP4F3B being predominant in the liver, ileum, and kidney (Kalsotra2006Cytochrome). The activity of CYP4F3 is crucial for maintaining the balance of inflammatory responses and contributes to various physiological processes, including lipid metabolism and detoxification (Corcos2012Human).

## Clinical Significance
The CYP4F3 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) CYP4F3 rs4646904 is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, particularly in smokers. This SNP affects splicing efficiency and is linked to higher gene expression levels, which may contribute to carcinogenesis (Jarrar2019Molecular; Yin2017Pathway‐analysis). 

In colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), CYP4F3 is significantly overexpressed in certain subtypes, correlating with a higher degree of invasiveness. However, patients with overexpression of CYP4F3 have a more favorable prognosis, suggesting a complex role in cancer progression (Tang2024Establishment). 

CYP4F3 is also involved in inflammatory diseases due to its role in the inactivation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent chemoattractant. Alterations in CYP4F3 expression can impact inflammatory responses, potentially influencing conditions like hypereosinophilic syndromes (Christmas2003Myeloid). 

The gene's expression is linked to cardiovascular diseases through the production of 20-HETE, which affects processes like platelet aggregation and hypertension (Jarrar2019Molecular).

## Interactions
CYP4F3 is involved in a complex network of interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It directly interacts with several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2C8, CYP4A11, CYP2E1, and CYP2C9, which suggests its role in forming multiprotein complexes that may influence its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity (Tang2024Establishment). Additionally, CYP4F3 indirectly modulates the expression levels of genes such as CYP3A4, FMO3, and AOX1, indicating its involvement in broader regulatory networks (Tang2024Establishment).

CYP4F3 also participates in miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks. It interacts with microRNAs such as has-miR-875-3p, has-miR-513a-3p, and has-miR-452-3p, which may affect its expression and function in cellular processes (Tang2024Establishment). These interactions highlight the gene's role in the regulation of gene expression and its potential impact on the progression of diseases like colorectal cancer liver metastasis.

While the specific physical interactions of CYP4F3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its involvement in these networks suggests a significant role in modulating inflammatory responses and metabolic pathways (Tang2024Establishment; Jarrar2019Molecular).
