specific ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia.
