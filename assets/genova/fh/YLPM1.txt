# YLPM1

## Overview
YLPM1 is a gene that encodes the YLP motif containing 1 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. The YLP motif containing 1 protein is characterized by its role in RNA processing and transcriptional regulation, functioning as a nuclear protein that interacts with other molecular components to influence gene expression. It is implicated in the regulation of chromatin structure and has been associated with several cellular pathways that are crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions. The protein's interactions and regulatory roles suggest its involvement in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Kahle2010Comparison; Ganguly2018Impact; SierraRamirez2021An).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the YLPM1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), YLPM1 is identified as part of a set of candidate 'driver' mutations associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). These mutations can lead to clonal expansion and potentially evolve into overt malignancies, particularly in aging populations (Ganguly2018Impact).

YLPM1 also interacts with the CACNA1A gene, specifically with its polyglutamine-containing isoform MPI. This interaction is exclusive to the disease-causing MPI isoforms, suggesting that YLPM1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of conditions related to aberrant protein interactions, such as ataxia (Kahle2010Comparison).

In breast cancer, YLPM1 is co-expressed with the PHF20L1 gene. Although its direct role in breast cancer is not fully elucidated, its co-expression with PHF20L1 suggests a potential involvement in cancer biology, particularly in aggressive subtypes (SierraRamirez2021An). These findings highlight the clinical significance of YLPM1 in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a target for further research and therapeutic intervention.
