# BTN2A1

## Overview
BTN2A1 is a gene that encodes the protein butyrophilin subfamily 2 member A1, which is a member of the butyrophilin family of proteins. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein with immunomodulatory functions, primarily involved in the regulation of immune responses. It plays a pivotal role in the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, a subset of γδ T cells, by acting as a ligand for their T cell receptor (TCR) and facilitating the recognition of phosphoantigens, which are compounds associated with microbial infections and cancer cells (Rigau2020Butyrophilin; Karunakaran2020Butyrophilin2A1). BTN2A1 forms complexes with other butyrophilin proteins, such as BTN3A1, to enhance immune cell activation and cytotoxic responses, particularly against tumor cells (Cano2021BTN2A1). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in immune regulation and potential therapeutic applications in cancer and other diseases (Cano2021BTN2A1).

## Structure
BTN2A1 is a member of the butyrophilin family, characterized by its structure, which includes two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (IgV and IgC) and an intracellular B30.2 domain (Cano2021BTN2A1; Rigau2020Butyrophilin). The IgV domain of BTN2A1 directly binds to germline-encoded regions of the Vγ9 TCR, which is crucial for phosphoantigen sensing (Karunakaran2020Butyrophilin2A1). BTN2A1 predominantly forms homodimers on the cell surface, stabilized by an interchain disulfide linkage involving a membrane-proximal cysteine residue (Karunakaran2020Butyrophilin2A1). This dimerization is essential for its function in immune cell activation.

The protein can also form complexes with BTN3A1, enhancing its export to the plasma membrane, which is crucial for Vγ9Vδ2 T cell cytotoxicity (Cano2021BTN2A1). The interaction between BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 involves their ectodomains, and the B30.2 domain of BTN3A1 is crucial for this interaction (Cano2021BTN2A1). BTN2A1's structure and interactions are vital for its role in immune regulation, particularly in the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells against cancer cells (Cano2021BTN2A1). Specific post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may influence BTN2A1's function and stability, although detailed information on these modifications is not provided in the context.

## Function
BTN2A1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune response, particularly in the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, a subset of γδ T cells. These T cells are involved in recognizing and responding to phosphoantigens (P-Ags), which are non-peptidic pyrophosphate compounds produced by pathogens and overexpressed by cancer cells (Rigau2020Butyrophilin; Karunakaran2020Butyrophilin2A1). BTN2A1 acts as a ligand for the Vγ9Vδ2 T cell receptor (TCR), directly binding to germline-encoded regions of the Vγ9 chain, which is essential for P-Ag sensing and T cell activation (Rigau2020Butyrophilin; Karunakaran2020Butyrophilin2A1).

BTN2A1 forms a complex with BTN3A1 at the cell surface, which is critical for the activation of these T cells. This interaction facilitates the clustering of TCRs, enhancing the immune response to microbial infections and potentially tumor cells (Cano2021BTN2A1; Karunakaran2020Butyrophilin2A1). The protein is expressed on various immune cells, including B, T, and NK cells, as well as monocytes, indicating its broad role in immune cell function (Rigau2020Butyrophilin). BTN2A1's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in immune regulation and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and infectious diseases (Cano2021BTN2A1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BTN2A1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In East Asian populations, particularly among Japanese individuals, the rs6929846 SNP in the BTN2A1 gene is significantly associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). This association is particularly pronounced in Japanese men and is linked to increased prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia (Yamada2011Association). The T allele of this SNP is also associated with increased systolic blood pressure and serum creatinine levels, and decreased HDL-cholesterol levels (Yamada2011Association).

BTN2A1 is also involved in immune regulation, particularly in the context of cancer. It plays a crucial role in the cytotoxic response of Vg9Vd2 T cells against malignant cells. Alterations in BTN2A1 expression can impact the effectiveness of these T cells, suggesting its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy (Cano2021BTN2A1). In ovarian cancer, circulating levels of BTN2A1 have been studied as potential prognostic biomarkers, with high plasma concentrations inversely correlated with progression-free survival in patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (Fanale2022Can).

## Interactions
BTN2A1 interacts with several proteins, notably BTN3A1, BTN3A2, and BTN3A3, playing a crucial role in the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, a subset of γδ T cells. BTN2A1 forms complexes with BTN3A1 at the plasma membrane, which is essential for the cytotoxic response of these T cells against cancer cells. This interaction involves the extracellular domains of BTN2A1 and is enhanced by phosphoantigens (pAgs) and treatments like zoledronate (Cano2021BTN2A1). BTN2A1 also enhances the plasma membrane exposure of BTN3A2 and BTN3A3, although to a lesser extent (Cano2021BTN2A1).

BTN2A1 directly binds to the Vγ9 chain of the Vγ9Vδ2 T cell receptor (TCR), facilitating the initial contact between target cells and T cells. This interaction is critical for the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells and involves the germline-encoded region between CDR2 and CDR3 of the Vγ9 chain (Cano2021BTN2A1). The BTN2A1-BTN3A1 complex is recognized by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, and specific mutations in BTN3A1 can affect this interaction, indicating the importance of these interactions for T cell activation (Fulford2023Vγ9Vδ2).
