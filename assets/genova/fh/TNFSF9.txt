# TNFSF9

## Overview
TNFSF9, also known as 4-1BB ligand or CD137L, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. The protein, TNF superfamily member 9, plays a pivotal role in immune regulation by interacting with its receptor, 4-1BB (CD137), on T cells. This interaction is crucial for T-cell activation, survival, and memory formation, as well as for modulating immune responses in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. The TNFSF9 protein is characterized by its ability to form homotrimers, which enhances its binding affinity to receptors and facilitates the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as NF-κB, AKT, and PI3K. These pathways are involved in promoting cell survival and proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis (Dostert2019The; Wiens2011Origin). The gene is located on chromosome 19 in humans and is subject to post-translational modifications that can affect its stability and function (Wiens2011Origin).

## Structure
TNFSF9, also known as 4-1BB ligand or CD137L, is a type II transmembrane protein that is part of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. The protein is characterized by an intracellular N terminus and an extracellular C terminus, which is typical of TNFSF ligands (Wiens2011Origin). The extracellular region contains the TNF homology domain (THD), which is composed of 10 β-strands that fold into a 'jellyroll' topology. This structure is crucial for the protein's ability to form homotrimers, which are essential for its biological activity and for initiating signaling through receptor binding (Wiens2011Origin).

The trimeric structure of TNFSF9 enhances the avidity of ligand-receptor interactions, which is important for its function in cellular signaling pathways, including those involved in inflammation and apoptosis (Wiens2011Origin). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur and can influence the stability and function of the protein, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The gene encoding TNFSF9 is located on chromosome 19 in humans (Wiens2011Origin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TNFSF9 gene, also known as 4-1BB ligand, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. TNFSF9 is involved in immune system regulation, and its dysregulation can impact immune responses. In the context of cancer, TNFSF9 expression is associated with the tumor immune microenvironment. High expression levels of TNFSF9 in tumors have been linked to increased immune cell infiltration, including B cells, CD8+ T cells, and myeloid dendritic cells, which can enhance adaptive immune responses. However, this high expression is also associated with dysfunctional T cells, potentially impairing T cell function and contributing to immune evasion by tumors (Isoda2024TNFSF9).

In inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, TNFSF9 interactions are implicated in the recruitment of monocytes to inflammatory tissues, exacerbating conditions such as vasculitis, Crohn's disease, and Grave's disease. These interactions can also influence the tumor microenvironment by recruiting monocytes that convert to tumor-associated macrophages, potentially worsening prognosis in solid tumors (Shao2010CD137). The complex bidirectional signaling between TNFSF9 and its receptor CD137 can modulate immune responses, suggesting that targeting this pathway could offer therapeutic benefits in treating these conditions (Kwon2009CD137CD137).

## Interactions
TNFSF9, also known as 4-1BB ligand, interacts with the 4-1BB receptor (CD137) on T cells, playing a crucial role in immune response regulation. This interaction is essential for T-cell development, survival, proliferation, effector function, and memory T-cell formation. The 4-1BB/4-1BBL interaction activates several signaling pathways, including NF-κB, AKT, p38, and PI3K, which promote the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and inhibit pro-apoptotic factors like BIM (Dostert2019The).

The cytoplasmic region of 4-1BB contains two TRAF-binding motifs that recruit TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3, which are crucial for the activation of various signaling pathways. Specifically, 4-1BB induces ERK activation through the recruitment of TRAF1 and leukocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1), contributing to the upregulation of Bcl-xL and the downregulation of Bim, promoting CD8+ T-cell survival. The recruitment of TRAF2 is important for the activation of canonical NF-κB and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in CD8+ T cells, leading to the upregulation of Bcl-xL and Bfl-1 and the activation of JNK and p38 (So2019The).

In macrophages, TNFSF9 is involved in the TNFSF9/TRAF1/p-AKT/IL-1β signaling pathway, which is suggested to be involved in macrophage M1 polarization, contributing to anti-tumor immunity (Wu2019Autoinducer2).
