# SLC17A4

## Overview
SLC17A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 17 member 4, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family of transporters. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is specifically expressed in the intestinal brush border membrane. It plays a crucial role in the transport of organic anions, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, urate, and thyroid hormones, across cell membranes in a chloride-dependent manner (Togawa2012A; A2019Genomewide). As a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), SLC17A4 features 12 transmembrane helices that facilitate its function as a polyspecific organic anion exporter (Omote2016Structure). The protein is implicated in various physiological processes, including the metabolic clearance of thyroid hormones and the extrusion of metabolic waste products, contributing to homeostasis in the intestines (Togawa2012A; A2019Genomewide).

## Structure
The SLC17A4 protein is a member of the SLC17 family of transporters, which are characterized by their role in transporting organic anions in a membrane potential and chloride-dependent manner. The protein is specifically expressed in the intestinal brush border membrane and functions as an organic anion exporter (Togawa2012A). Structurally, SLC17A4 is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), which typically features 12 transmembrane helices (Omote2016Structure). These helices are integral to the protein's function, facilitating the transport of substrates across the cell membrane.

The primary structure of SLC17A4 consists of amino acid sequences encoded by the SLC17A4 gene. While specific details on the secondary and tertiary structures are not provided, the protein's classification within the MFS suggests the presence of common structural motifs such as alpha helices. The quaternary structure of SLC17A4 is not detailed in the available context, and there is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms. The protein's function as a polyspecific organic anion exporter is supported by its ability to transport various anionic compounds, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and urate (Togawa2012A).

## Function
The SLC17A4 gene encodes a protein that functions as an intestinal organic anion exporter, primarily involved in the transport of various organic anions across cell membranes. This protein is a member of the solute carrier 17 (SLC17) family and is specifically expressed in the intestinal brush border membrane, where it facilitates the uptake of organic anions such as p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) in a chloride-dependent manner. The transport process is driven by an electrochemical gradient of protons across the membrane (Togawa2012A).

SLC17A4 is also implicated in the transport of thyroid hormones, specifically triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), across cell membranes. It has been identified as a high-affinity transporter for these hormones, playing a crucial role in thyroid hormone signaling and regulation (A2019Genomewide). The protein is predominantly expressed in the small intestine, colon, pancreas, liver, and kidney cortex, suggesting its involvement in the metabolic clearance and entero-hepatic cycle of thyroid hormones (A2019Genomewide).

In addition to its role in thyroid hormone transport, SLC17A4 is involved in the extrusion of metabolic waste products and xenobiotics, contributing to homeostasis in the intestines (Togawa2012A).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC17A4 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in different physiological processes. In prostate cancer (PCa), SLC17A4 is considered to act as an oncogene. High expression levels of SLC17A4 are associated with poor prognosis, promoting cell proliferation and invasion, while low expression levels correlate with better survival outcomes. This suggests that SLC17A4 could serve as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for predicting immunotherapeutic benefits in PCa (Li2022A).

In the context of thyroid hormone regulation, SLC17A4 functions as a transporter of thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Genetic variations in the SLC17A4 locus have been linked to the progression of elevated serum urate levels to gout, indicating its role in metabolic clearance and the entero-hepatic cycle of thyroid hormones. These findings suggest potential clinical implications for thyroid dysfunction treatment, particularly in optimizing levothyroxine therapy for hypothyroidism (A2019Genomewide).

SLC17A4 is also identified as an intestinal organic anion exporter, potentially involved in urate extrusion, which may have implications for conditions related to urate metabolism (Togawa2012A).
