# GDPD5

## Overview
GDPD5 is a gene that encodes the protein glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain containing 5, which is a member of the glycerophosphodiesterase family. This protein is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters, contributing to the production of glycerol-3-phosphate and alcohol, and plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis and neural development (Feng2018GDPD5). GDPD5 is expressed in various tissues, including neurons and vascular endothelium, where it is crucial for neuronal differentiation and survival (Luo2022GDPD5). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway and choline phospholipid metabolism, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (van2018Glycerophosphodiesterase; Cao2016Targeting). Clinically, GDPD5 has been associated with cancer progression and treatment resistance, particularly in colorectal cancer, while also serving as a potential tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma (Xia2021Identification; Feng2018GDPD5).

## Function
GDPD5 is a glycerophosphodiesterase involved in the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters to produce glycerol-3-phosphate and alcohol, playing a crucial role in cellular homeostasis and neural development. It is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining osmotic balance and signal transduction pathways, particularly in neuronal cells (Feng2018GDPD5). GDPD5 is expressed in neurons, terminally differentiated oligodendrocyte subsets, and vascular endothelium, where it is critical for neuronal differentiation, growth, and survival (Luo2022GDPD5).

In the context of cell biology, GDPD5 is involved in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway by cleaving glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins at the plasma membrane. This activity is important for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination in various tissues (van2018Glycerophosphodiesterase). GDPD5's enzymatic function is also linked to the degradation of glycerophosphocholine (GPC) to free choline and glycerol-3-phosphate, which is significant in choline phospholipid metabolism (Cao2016Targeting). This metabolic role is particularly relevant in the context of cancer, where GDPD5 influences cell proliferation and migration (Cao2016Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
GDPD5 has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), GDPD5 is overexpressed, contributing to metastasis and chemoresistance, particularly against the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu). Silencing GDPD5 in CRC cells increases their sensitivity to 5-Fu and reduces their invasive capabilities, suggesting its role in promoting cancer progression and treatment resistance (Feng2018GDPD5). The regulation of GDPD5 by microRNA 195-5p (miR-195-5p) has been identified, where overexpression of miR-195-5p decreases GDPD5 levels, enhancing chemosensitivity and reducing metastasis in CRC cells (Feng2018GDPD5).

In neuroblastoma, GDPD5 expression is associated with better survival outcomes. High GDPD5 expression correlates with favorable prognosis, while low expression is linked to poor outcomes. GDPD5 is suggested to induce differentiation and inhibit motility of neuroblastoma cells, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Xia2021Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GDPD5 in cancer prognosis and treatment strategies, suggesting it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in both colorectal cancer and neuroblastoma.
