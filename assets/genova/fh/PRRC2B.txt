# PRRC2B

## Overview
PRRC2B is a gene that encodes the proline-rich coiled-coil 2B protein, which is an RNA-binding protein involved in translational regulation. This protein is characterized by its ability to interact with eukaryotic initiation factors, such as eIF3 and eIF4, playing a crucial role in transcript-selective translational control (Bohlen2022PRRC2; Das2024Lossoffunction). The PRRC2B protein is particularly significant in cardiovascular development, where it regulates the translation of mRNAs essential for heart and valve development (Das2024Lossoffunction). Additionally, PRRC2B is implicated in various clinical conditions, including congenital heart defects and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Wang2022Durable; Das2024Lossoffunction).

## Structure
The PRRC2B protein is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, primarily facilitated by Arg-Gly (RG) repeat motifs encoded by exon 16, which are crucial for interacting with target mRNAs (Das2024Lossoffunction). The protein structure of the full-length (FL) PRRC2B and its exon 16-excluded (∆E16) isoform has been predicted by AlphaFold, indicating that most regions are intrinsically disordered, including the exon 16-encoded region (Das2024Lossoffunction). These intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) suggest a flexible structure that may facilitate interactions with various molecular partners.

PRRC2B is involved in forming complexes with translation initiation factors such as eIF4G2 and eIF3, indicating its role in transcript-selective translational control (Das2024Lossoffunction). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its function, particularly in neuronal physiological processes (Mei2013Expression).

Alternative splicing of the PRRC2B gene results in at least two isoforms: the full-length (FL) and the ∆E16 isoform, which lacks exon 16. The ∆E16 isoform potentially has reduced RNA-binding and translation activity compared to the full-length protein, but it may compensate for the loss of the full-length protein in certain physiological contexts (Das2024Lossoffunction).

## Function
The PRRC2B gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in translational regulation, particularly in cardiovascular development. In healthy human cells, PRRC2B is involved in the regulation of translation initiation by interacting with eukaryotic initiation factors such as eIF3 and eIF4, forming complexes that are essential for transcript-selective translational control (Bohlen2022PRRC2; Das2024Lossoffunction). This protein is known to promote leaky scanning, a process that allows ribosomes to bypass certain upstream open reading frames (uORFs), thereby enhancing the translation of main open reading frames (ORFs) (Bohlen2022PRRC2).

PRRC2B is highly expressed in the cardiovascular system, including the aorta and coronary artery, and is essential for maintaining normal cardiac development and function (Das2024Lossoffunction). It regulates the translation of mRNAs related to heart and valve development, such as BMP2, NOTCH1, and ROCK1, which are critical for smooth muscle cell function and the closure of the ductus arteriosus (Das2024Lossoffunction). The protein's activity is crucial for proper protein synthesis, which is necessary for cardiovascular health and overall organismal development (Das2024Lossoffunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRRC2B gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions, particularly congenital cardiovascular malformations. PRRC2B is associated with congenital heart defects (CHD), including mitral valve and pulmonary vein defects. Genetic variants, such as de novo mutations, are enriched in CHD phenotypes, with specific mutations like p.R1113X linked to mitral valve abnormalities (Das2024Lossoffunction). Loss-of-function mutations in PRRC2B can lead to translational defects, affecting the expression of genes crucial for cardiovascular development, resulting in conditions like patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and neonatal lethality in mouse models (Das2024Lossoffunction).

In addition to cardiovascular implications, PRRC2B has been implicated in cancer. A PRRC2B-ALK gene fusion has been identified in epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma (EIMS), a variant of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). This fusion is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, and patients with this genetic alteration have shown responses to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Wang2022Durable). Furthermore, PRRC2B has been identified as a key carcinogenic gene in Wilms' tumor, with high expression levels correlating with poor overall survival in patients, suggesting its role as an onco-driver in this childhood cancer (He2021Identification).

## Interactions
PRRC2B is involved in several protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions that are crucial for its role in translational regulation. It interacts with eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), specifically eIF3 and eIF4 complexes, and is associated with ribosomal preinitiation complexes. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments with endogenous eIF3B, eIF4G1, and eIF4E, as well as the ribosomal 40S component RPS15 (Bohlen2022PRRC2). PRRC2B also forms a complex with eIF4G2, which is essential for the translational activation of mRNAs related to cell cycle progression (Das2024Lossoffunction).

PRRC2B's role extends to its interaction with specific mRNAs, influencing their translation. It binds to mRNAs such as PLCG2, PHKB, and WDR26, which are crucial for heart and valve development (Das2024Lossoffunction). The protein is also part of the CCR4-NOT and 43S pre-initiation complexes, indicating its involvement in RNA metabolism-related complexes (Lv2023coRIC).

PRRC2B's interactions are not limited to proteins and mRNAs; it also plays a role in promoting leaky scanning, a process where ribosomes bypass upstream open reading frames (uORFs) to translate the main ORF, facilitating the translation of mRNAs containing uORFs (Bohlen2022PRRC2).
