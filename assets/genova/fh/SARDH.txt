# SARDH

## Overview
The SARDH gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme sarcosine dehydrogenase, which is a key player in the metabolism of sarcosine, an intermediate in the degradation of glycine. As a flavoprotein, sarcosine dehydrogenase is involved in the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine to glycine, a critical step in the mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism pathway. This pathway is essential for cellular energy production and the synthesis of nucleotides and other biomolecules, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic balance (Mazdak2019DNA). The enzyme's activity is particularly significant in the hippocampus, where it contributes to memory-related processes by regulating formaldehyde levels during learning activities (Ai2019Endogenous). Alterations in the SARDH gene have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in cancer-related signaling pathways (He2019Alteration; Xie2024Sarcosine).

## Structure
The SARDH gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme sarcosine dehydrogenase, which plays a role in the metabolism of sarcosine, an intermediate in glycine degradation. The primary structure of SARDH consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that are encoded by the SARDH gene. The secondary structure of the protein includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function.

In terms of tertiary structure, SARDH is characterized by its three-dimensional folding, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The protein may also exhibit quaternary structure if it assembles into a complex with multiple subunits, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context.

SARDH contains specific domains, including FAD-binding sites, which are essential for its catalytic function. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, potentially influencing the enzyme's activity and regulation. The existence of splice variant isoforms of SARDH can lead to structural and functional diversity, allowing the enzyme to adapt to different cellular conditions and requirements. These structural features collectively enable SARDH to perform its role in sarcosine metabolism effectively.

## Function
SARDH (sarcosine dehydrogenase) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolism of sarcosine, a derivative of the amino acid glycine. It catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine to glycine, a process that is essential for the mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism pathway (Mazdak2019DNA). This pathway is crucial for cellular energy production and the synthesis of nucleotides and other biomolecules, contributing to maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic balance (Mazdak2019DNA).

In healthy human cells, SARDH is involved in the generation of formaldehyde, which is necessary for facilitating NMDA receptor currents and enhancing long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation (Ai2019Endogenous). The enzyme's activity is particularly important in the hippocampus, where it contributes to memory-related processes by regulating formaldehyde levels during learning activities (Ai2019Endogenous). SARDH's function in formaldehyde production is linked to its role in one-carbon metabolism and DNA methylation, processes essential for new memory formation (Ai2019Endogenous).

SARDH is also implicated in the regulation of sarcosine levels, which are typically low or undetectable in benign tissues, and alterations in its activity have been associated with various cancers (Mazdak2019DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SARDH gene have significant clinical implications. In sporadic colorectal cancer (sCRC), SARDH is identified as a novel tumor suppressor gene. A specific deleterious mutation, c.551C>T, has been reported in sCRC, and SARDH expression is abnormally decreased at both transcriptional and translational levels. This downregulation is also observed in other cancers such as oesophageal, lung, liver, and pancreatic cancers, suggesting a broader role in tumorigenesis (He2019Alteration).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SARDH expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This reduced expression is linked to advanced pathological stages and worse prognosis, including lower overall survival and progression-free intervals. SARDH's expression is associated with DNA methylation and immune infiltration, which are factors contributing to its prognostic value in HCC (Xie2024Sarcosine).

SARDH also influences cancer-related signaling pathways, particularly affecting chemokine-related genes such as CXCL1 and CCL20, which may be associated with their methylation states. These interactions suggest that SARDH plays a role in the regulation of immune responses and cancer progression (He2019Alteration).
