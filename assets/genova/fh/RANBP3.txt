# RANBP3

## Overview
RANBP3 is a gene that encodes the Ran-binding protein 3, a key regulatory protein involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. This protein functions as a cofactor in the Crm1-mediated nuclear export pathway, enhancing the interaction between Crm1, Ran:GTP, and nuclear export signals (NES) to facilitate the transport of proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Lindsay2001RanBinding). RanBP3 is characterized by its three distinct domains: an NH2-terminal region with a nuclear localization signal, an F domain with nucleoporin-like motifs, and an R domain similar to the Ran-binding domain of RanBP1, which are essential for its binding and export activities (Lindsay2001RanBinding). The protein's ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a Crm1-dependent manner underscores its critical role in maintaining cellular function by regulating protein transport across the nuclear membrane (Lindsay2001RanBinding).

## Structure


## Function
Ran-binding protein 3 (RanBP3) is a crucial cofactor in the Crm1-mediated nuclear protein export process in human cells. It enhances the affinity of Crm1 for Ran:GTP and nuclear export signals (NES), facilitating the export of proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Lindsay2001RanBinding). RanBP3 contains three domains: an NH2-terminal region with a nuclear localization signal (NLS), an F domain with nucleoporin-like motifs, and an R domain similar to the Ran-binding domain (RBD) of RanBP1. The N and F domains are essential for binding Crm1, while the F and R domains are necessary for full export activity (Lindsay2001RanBinding).

RanBP3 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a Crm1-dependent manner, and its export is inhibited by the Crm1-specific inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) (Lindsay2001RanBinding). It forms a complex with Crm1, NES, and Ran:GTP, which interacts with nucleoporins and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in a Ran:GTP-dependent manner (Lindsay2001RanBinding). This complex is disassembled by RanBP1 and RanGAP, facilitating the release of NES cargo (Lindsay2001RanBinding). RanBP3's role in nuclear export is crucial for maintaining cellular function by regulating the transport of proteins across the nuclear membrane (Lindsay2001RanBinding).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RANBP3 gene have been associated with several medical conditions, particularly in the context of male infertility and cancer. In male infertility, reduced expression of RANBP3 has been linked to disorders such as maturation arrest (MA) and Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCO). These conditions are characterized by impaired spermatogenesis, leading to nonobstructive azoospermia, where sperm is absent in the ejaculate (Tang2019Ran‑binding).

In cancer, RANBP3 has been implicated in breast cancer through its methylation patterns. The gene tends to be hypomethylated in breast cancer tissues, which may contribute to unchecked cancer cell proliferation. This hypomethylation is particularly noted in estrogen receptor-expressing breast cancer, suggesting a role in hormone receptor-related cancer progression (Hu2024Value).

The study of RANBP3's methylation patterns in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) has shown potential for non-invasive breast cancer diagnosis and monitoring, highlighting its diagnostic efficiency and correlation with hormone receptor expression (Hu2024Value). These findings suggest that RANBP3 plays a significant role in both reproductive health and cancer biology.

## Interactions
Ran-binding protein 3 (RanBP3) is involved in several key interactions that facilitate its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. RanBP3 directly binds to Crm1, a member of the karyopherin-β family, enhancing the affinity of the Crm1-RanBP3 complex for Ran:GTP and nuclear export signals (NES) (Lindsay2001RanBinding). This interaction is crucial for Crm1-mediated nuclear protein export, as RanBP3 increases the binding of Crm1 to Ran:GTP and export cargo, such as NES peptides (Lindsay2001RanBinding). RanBP3 contains three domains, with the N and F domains binding Crm1, while both the F and R domains are necessary for full export activity (Lindsay2001RanBinding).

RanBP3 also interacts with nucleoporins, components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). It does not compete with nucleoporins Nup214 or p62 for Crm1 binding in the presence of Ran:GTP, suggesting simultaneous binding to Crm1 (Lindsay2001RanBinding). RanBP3 stabilizes the interaction of Crm1 with Ran:GTP, increasing Crm1's affinity for NES-containing cargo and the NPC (Lindsay2001RanBinding). Additionally, RanBP3 can inhibit the association of Crm1 with NPCs, an effect modulated by Ran:GTP (Lindsay2001RanBinding). These interactions highlight RanBP3's role as a crucial cofactor in nuclear export processes.
