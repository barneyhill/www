# EMD

## Overview
The EMD gene encodes emerin, a type II transmembrane protein located at the inner nuclear membrane, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining nuclear architecture and regulating gene expression. Emerin is characterized by its LEM domain, which facilitates interactions with chromatin-associated proteins, and a transmembrane segment that anchors it to the nuclear envelope (Essawy2019An; Pfaff2016Emery–Dreifuss). This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including mechanotransduction, transcriptional regulation, and muscle cell differentiation, through its interactions with nuclear lamins, actin, and other nuclear components (Dharmaraj2019Rare). Mutations in the EMD gene are linked to X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (XL-EDMD), a condition marked by muscle weakness and cardiac defects, underscoring emerin's critical role in cellular integrity and function (Koch2014Emerin; Muntoni2006Disease).

## Structure
Emerin is a nuclear envelope protein encoded by the EMD gene, consisting of 254 amino acids. It is an integral membrane protein primarily located at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) (Essawy2019An; Pfaff2016Emery–Dreifuss). The protein structure includes a notable N-terminal LEM domain, spanning the first 45 amino acids, which is crucial for binding to the chromatin-associated protein barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) (Holaska2006Lmo7; Essawy2019An). This domain is characterized by a helix-loop-helix fold (Pfaff2016Emery–Dreifuss).

Emerin also contains a large intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a short transmembrane segment near its C-terminal end, which facilitates its anchoring to the nuclear membrane (Essawy2019An; Pfaff2016Emery–Dreifuss). The IDR is involved in interactions with lamin A/C, tubulin, and actin, and undergoes phosphorylation during nuclear adaptation to mechanical stress (Essawy2019An).

Mutations in the LEM domain, such as ∆K37, can disrupt the protein's 3D structure and affect its binding affinity for BAF, although the mutant can still transiently form a BAF-binding competent structure (Essawy2019An). The transmembrane domain's hydrophobicity is essential for proper membrane integration, which is mediated by the TRC40/GET pathway (Pfaff2016Emery–Dreifuss).

## Function
Emerin, encoded by the EMD gene, is a crucial component of the nuclear envelope, primarily located at the inner nuclear membrane. It plays a significant role in maintaining nuclear architecture and function by interacting with nuclear lamins, LINC complexes, and BANF1, a chromatin-associated protein (Dharmaraj2019Rare). Emerin is involved in various cellular processes, including signaling, cell proliferation, mechanotransduction, transcriptional regulation, and 3D genome organization. It is particularly important in muscle cells, where it influences the cytoskeletal F-actin networks and regulates the SRF-Mkl1 coactivator complex (Dharmaraj2019Rare).

In healthy cells, emerin inhibits the binding of the transcription factor Lmo7 to the MyoD promoter, which is crucial for muscle differentiation (Meinke2015Abnormal). Emerin's interaction with lamin A and other nuclear components is essential for its function, affecting nuclear lamina functions, cell cycle control, and mechanotransduction (Dharmaraj2019Rare). The protein's ability to form networks or filaments and its interactions with partners like F-actin, myosin 1c, and tubulin are vital for maintaining nuclear structure and function (Dharmaraj2019Rare). Emerin's role in these processes underscores its importance in cellular integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EMD gene, which encodes the inner nuclear membrane protein emerin, are primarily associated with X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (XL-EDMD). This condition is characterized by muscle weakness, joint contractures, and cardiac conduction defects (Koch2014Emerin; Muntoni2006Disease). The majority of mutations in the EMD gene result in the loss of emerin protein, leading to the classic symptoms of XL-EDMD. However, some mutations allow for stable emerin expression but still cause the disease, albeit with less severe phenotypes (Koch2014Emerin).

Emerin mutations can lead to abnormal activation of signaling pathways, such as the MAPK pathway, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of EDMD. In Emd knockout mice, a model for XL-EDMD, there is abnormal activation of the ERK branch of the MAPK pathway, which affects cardiac function (Muchir2007Activation). Additionally, emerin-null cells show increased β-catenin activity, affecting myogenic differentiation and muscle regeneration, contributing to the EDMD phenotype (Koch2014Emerin).

Mutations in the EMD gene can also result in cardiac abnormalities, including conduction disorders and arrhythmias, which may precede muscle symptoms in some cases (Kovalchuk2021Case). These cardiac issues can be severe, requiring interventions such as pacemaker insertion (Muntoni2006Disease).

## Interactions
Emerin, encoded by the EMD gene, is a nuclear membrane protein that participates in various interactions crucial for maintaining nuclear architecture and regulating gene expression. It binds directly to specific isoforms of nesprin-1 and nesprin-2, which are nuclear membrane proteins. The binding regions of nesprin-1α (residues 368-627) and nesprin-2β (residues 126-219) interact with emerin residues 140-176. These interactions are essential for emerin's retention at the nuclear membrane and are disrupted in X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (X-EDMD) (Wheeler2007Distinct).

Emerin also interacts with several other proteins, including lamin A/C, β-catenin, and F-actin, which are involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope and chromatin. It binds to transcription regulators such as Lmo7, inhibiting its binding to the MyoD and Pax3 promoters, thereby regulating myogenic differentiation and proliferation (Dedeic2011Emerin).

Emerin's interactions extend to the chromatin protein Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF) and other nuclear proteins like GCL, Btf, and YT521-B, which are involved in gene regulation and nuclear assembly (Holaska2006Lmo7). These interactions highlight emerin's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its involvement in disease pathology when disrupted.
