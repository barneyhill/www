# TRAPPC13

## Overview
TRAPPC13 is a gene that encodes the protein trafficking protein particle complex subunit 13, which is a component of the TRAPP (transport protein particle) complex. This complex is involved in the regulation of vesicular transport processes within the cell, playing a crucial role in the trafficking of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The TRAPPC13 protein is categorized as a part of the multi-subunit tethering complexes, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organelle function. Mutations or dysregulation of TRAPPC13 have been implicated in various cellular dysfunctions and may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain diseases, although specific clinical correlations are still under investigation.
