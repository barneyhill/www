# SCAMP4

## Overview
SCAMP4, or secretory carrier membrane protein 4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in membrane trafficking and cellular communication processes. The SCAMP4 protein is part of the SCAMP family, which plays a crucial role in vesicle fusion, cargo sorting, and the secretion of cytokines, particularly in the context of cellular senescence (Kim2018SCAMP4). In proliferating cells, SCAMP4 is rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, indicating its tightly regulated function in cellular processes (Kim2018SCAMP4). The protein is localized on the plasma membrane and is implicated in the secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, suggesting its involvement in modulating cellular environments and signaling pathways related to aging (Kim2018SCAMP4).

## Function
SCAMP4 (secretory carrier membrane protein 4) is a member of the SCAMP family involved in membrane trafficking processes, particularly in the context of cellular senescence. In healthy human cells, SCAMP4 is rapidly degraded in proliferating cells through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suggesting a tightly regulated role in cellular processes (Kim2018SCAMP4). SCAMP4 is localized on the plasma membrane and is implicated in the secretion of cytokines, potentially through the SNARE machinery or by facilitating exosome release (Kim2018SCAMP4). 

SCAMP4's involvement in cellular communication and material exchange is highlighted by its role in vesicle fusion and cargo sorting, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Kim2018SCAMP4). Although specific functions in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, SCAMP4's activity in senescent cells, where it enhances the secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, suggests it may play a role in modulating cellular environments and responses (Kim2018SCAMP4). The protein's presence on the cell surface in senescent cells indicates its potential involvement in signaling pathways that influence cellular aging and related physiological processes (Kim2018SCAMP4).

## Clinical Significance
SCAMP4 has been identified as a novel prognostic marker in glioma, a type of brain tumor, where its expression is associated with tumor progression and immune infiltration. Higher SCAMP4 expression correlates with poorer overall survival in glioma patients, particularly in low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It is also linked to higher malignancy and is considered an independent prognostic factor, with its expression negatively correlated with CD8+ T cell infiltration and positively correlated with tumor purity (Ge2021SCAMP4).

In anal cancer, SCAMP4 is one of the hypermethylated genes identified in high-risk cases of anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC). This hypermethylation could serve as a potential biomarker for assessing the risk of progression from high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions to ASCC (Iseas2024Unraveling).

In the context of Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS), SCAMP4 shows increased expression in fibroblasts with short telomeres, although the clinical significance of this finding is not detailed (Habib2019Nijmegen). These studies suggest that alterations in SCAMP4 expression or methylation may play a role in the progression of certain cancers and other conditions.
