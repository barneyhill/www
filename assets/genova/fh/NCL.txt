# NCL

## Overview
The NCL gene encodes nucleolin, a multifunctional phosphoprotein predominantly located in the nucleolus. Nucleolin is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an N-terminal domain, a central RNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal glycine-arginine-rich region. As a key player in ribosome biogenesis, nucleolin is involved in various cellular processes such as rRNA synthesis, pre-rRNA processing, and ribosomal assembly. Beyond its nucleolar functions, nucleolin shuttles between different cellular compartments, participating in RNA metabolism, mRNA stability, and signal transduction. It also acts as a histone chaperone, facilitating chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. Nucleolin's interactions with proteins and nucleic acids underscore its role in cellular homeostasis and stress responses. Alterations in nucleolin expression and localization are linked to several diseases, including various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Scott2016Nucleolin; Jia2017New; Berger2015The).

## Structure
Nucleolin (NCL) is a multifunctional phosphoprotein with a complex molecular structure, consisting of three main domains: an N-terminal domain, a central RNA-binding domain (RBD), and a C-terminal glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) region. The N-terminal domain contains multiple phosphorylation sites and a nuclear localization signal, although it is not sufficient for nucleolus localization (Yanagida2001Isolation). The central domain includes four RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for binding to ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and G-rich oligonucleotides (Okuwaki2020RNArecognition). The GAR region is involved in RNA interaction and is essential for binding to G-quadruplex structures, which regulate gene expression (Okuwaki2020RNArecognition; Saha2020Nucleolin).

NCL's interaction with RNA is primarily mediated through its RBD, which binds to specific RNA sequences, such as the nucleolin recognition element (NRE) in rRNA (Yanagida2001Isolation). The GAR region also plays a significant role in nucleolar localization and RNA-binding activity, particularly in association with G-quadruplex structures (Okuwaki2020RNArecognition; Saha2020Nucleolin). NCL undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influence its function and interactions (Yanagida2001Isolation).

## Function
Nucleolin (NCL) is a multifunctional protein primarily located in the nucleolus, where it plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis, including rRNA synthesis, pre-rRNA processing, and ribosomal assembly and maturation (Jia2017New). NCL is involved in chromatin remodeling by acting as a histone chaperone, facilitating the eviction of H2A-H2B dimers, which is crucial for DNA transcription, replication, and repair (Scott2016Nucleolin). It also participates in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA through both homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways (Scott2016Nucleolin).

In addition to its nucleolar functions, NCL shuttles between various cellular compartments, including the nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and cell membrane, where it is involved in processes such as RNA metabolism, mRNA stability, and signal transduction (Salvetti2016Nuclear). NCL interacts with a variety of proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, and mRNA splicing, stability, and transport, highlighting its role in nuclear pre-mRNA metabolism (Salvetti2016Nuclear). NCL's interactions with transcription factors and its ability to modulate mRNA expression further underscore its importance in cellular stress responses and homeostasis (Scott2016Nucleolin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and localization of nucleolin (NCL) are associated with various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders. In cancer, NCL is overexpressed in several types, including colorectal, gastric, breast, lung, glioblastoma, melanoma, and cervical cancers. This overexpression is linked to increased cell survival, proliferation, and invasion, contributing to cancer progression and poor prognosis (Berger2015The). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high NCL mRNA levels are associated with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival, especially in elderly patients (Marcel2017Expression).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, a heterozygous de novo truncating mutation in the NCL gene has been identified in an individual with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This mutation disrupts the nucleolar localization of the NCL protein, potentially leading to a loss of function and contributing to the disorder's pathology (Sheikh2021Heterozygous).

NCL is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, where its mislocalization is linked to conditions such as ALS, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington's disease. These alterations can lead to nucleolar stress and contribute to neuronal dysfunction (Baltanás2019Nucleolin).

## Interactions
Nucleolin (NCL) is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a critical role in various cellular processes. NCL interacts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and pre-rRNA, facilitating ribosome biogenesis and assembly by binding to ribosomal proteins and pre-rRNA sequences (Okuwaki2020RNArecognition; Jia2017New). It also acts as a histone chaperone, binding with H2A-H2B dimers to assist in nucleosome assembly (Jia2017New).

NCL's RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) and glycine and arginine-rich (GAR) region are crucial for its interactions with rRNAs and nucleolar proteins, which are essential for its nucleolar localization (Okuwaki2020RNArecognition). NCL binds to G-quadruplex structures, such as those in the c-myc gene promoter, and interacts with guanine-rich oligonucleotides like AS1411, which has potential as an anti-cancer agent (Okuwaki2020RNArecognition; González2009Identification).

NCL also interacts with Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), facilitating EBNA1-mediated episome binding, maintenance, and transcription, which is crucial for the persistence of the Epstein-Barr virus genome (Chen2013Nucleolin). These interactions highlight NCL's multifaceted role in cellular and viral processes.
