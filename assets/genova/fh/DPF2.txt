# DPF2

## Overview
DPF2, or double PHD fingers 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The protein, also known as BAF45d, is a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex and is characterized by its double plant homeodomain (PHD) finger domains, which facilitate interactions with histone tails. These interactions are crucial for the protein's role in modulating chromatin accessibility and influencing gene expression, particularly in hematopoietic stem cells. DPF2 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of inflammation and oxidative stress responses, through its interaction with transcription factors such as NRF2. The protein's ability to bind acetylated and crotonylated histone residues underscores its significance in transcriptional regulation. Mutations or dysregulation of DPF2 have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical importance (Mas2023The; Xiong2016Selective; Chugunov2021Conserved).

## Structure
The DPF2 protein, also known as BAF45d, is characterized by its double PHD (plant homeodomain) finger domains, which are zinc-finger motifs crucial for its interaction with histone tails. Each PHD finger contains two zinc ions, with the first coordinated by three cysteines and one histidine, and the second by four cysteines, a conserved feature across DPF-domain-containing proteins (Chugunov2021Conserved). The DPF domains form a single structure that interacts with histone N-tails, with specific pockets for binding histone peptides. These include an acidic pocket for arginine side chains, a hydrophobic pocket for lysine side chains, and another acidic pocket for unmethylated residues (Chugunov2021Conserved).

The tertiary structure of DPF2 has been elucidated through crystallization and X-ray diffraction, revealing a well-refined structure with 95.7% of the backbone dihedral angles in favored regions (Xiong2016Selective). DPF2 is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, particularly in hematopoietic stem cells, and shows a higher binding affinity for crotonylated histone H3K14 compared to acetylated forms, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Xiong2016Selective). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its structure and function.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DPF2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. DPF2 is a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex and plays a crucial role in regulating NRF2-dependent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant gene expression. Loss-of-function mutations in DPF2 are associated with cancer and Coffin-Siris syndrome, a condition characterized by developmental delays and physical abnormalities (Mas2023The). In hematopoietic cells, DPF2 deficiency leads to systemic inflammation, hyperproliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, and myeloid skewing, contributing to conditions such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, and a predisposition to autoimmune diseases (Mas2023The).

DPF2 also interacts with NF-κB to control immune response genes in cancer cell lines, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Mas2023The). The gene's role in modulating inflammation and immune responses is further highlighted by its involvement in the immune escape of the influenza virus, where it suppresses beta interferon production, facilitating viral replication (Shin2017Double). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DPF2 in various inflammatory and immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
DPF2, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, is involved in several interactions that influence gene expression. It is a component of the canonical BAF (cBAF) complex, which includes other subunits such as ARID1A/BAF250A/B and BRG1. DPF2 plays a crucial role in modulating inflammation through its interaction with the nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NRF2), a transcription factor that regulates anti-inflammatory and antioxidant gene expression. The loss of DPF2 impairs the recruitment of the BAF catalytic subunit BRG1 to NRF2-controlled enhancers, which is necessary for the transcriptional response to oxidative stress and inflammation (Mas2023The).

DPF2 also interacts with histone modifications, specifically binding to acetylated and crotonylated histone residues via its tandem PHD finger domains. This interaction is crucial for the localization of the BAF complex to specific gene regulatory regions marked with H3K27ac, affecting chromatin accessibility and gene expression (Mas2023The; Xiong2016Selective). Additionally, DPF2 acts as an adaptor protein linking RelB/p52 with the SWI/SNF complex, activating the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, which negatively regulates type I interferon induction (Shin2017Double).
