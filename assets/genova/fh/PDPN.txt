# PDPN

## Overview
Podoplanin (PDPN) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein known as podoplanin. This protein is characterized by its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including lymph node architecture maintenance, cell motility, and tumor progression. Podoplanin is heavily glycosylated, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as the C-type lectin-like receptor-2 (CLEC-2), influencing platelet aggregation and immune responses (Kaneko2015Monoclonal; Ogasawara2020Crystal). The protein's interaction with the cytoskeleton through ERM family proteins underscores its role in cell adhesion and motility (MartínVillar2004Characterization). PDPN is also implicated in cancer, where its expression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis, making it a significant focus of clinical research (Lee2020Podoplanin; Quintanilla2019Podoplanin).

## Structure
Podoplanin (PDPN) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein characterized by a signal peptide, an extracellular domain rich in O-glycosylation sites, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain is heavily O-glycosylated, which is crucial for its function, particularly in interactions with the C-type lectin-like receptor-2 (CLEC-2) involved in platelet aggregation (Kaneko2015Monoclonal; Ogasawara2020Crystal). The cytoplasmic tail contains a cluster of basic amino acids that bind to ERM family proteins, linking the protein to the cytoskeleton (MartínVillar2004Characterization).

PDPN lacks a defined quaternary structure but may form homodimers. Its glycosylation includes sialylated O-glycans, which are essential for its recognition by specific monoclonal antibodies, such as LpMab-9 and LpMab-19, which target different glycosylated regions of the protein (Kaneko2015Monoclonal; Ogasawara2016LpMab19). The protein's structure includes several platelet aggregation-stimulating (PLAG) domains, with specific amino acids like Glu47 and Asp48 playing a role in its function (Ogasawara2020Crystal). The gene encoding PDPN is located on chromosome 1 at 1p36.13 and consists of six exons and five introns (MartínVillar2004Characterization).

## Function
Podoplanin (PDPN) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of lymph nodes (LNs) by regulating the contractility of fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). In healthy human cells, PDPN is highly expressed in FRCs and is crucial for regulating actomyosin contractility, which is essential for maintaining the LN microarchitecture and facilitating immune cell interactions (Astarita2014The). PDPN interacts with the C-type lectin receptor CLEC-2, which is expressed by dendritic cells and platelets. This interaction modulates FRC contractility, allowing LNs to expand during immune responses to accommodate increased lymphocyte numbers (Astarita2014The).

PDPN also influences cell motility by interacting with proteins such as ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM), which are involved in cytoskeletal dynamics. This interaction is crucial for cell adhesion, elongation, and contraction (Astarita2014The). Additionally, PDPN is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival, with its deficiency leading to increased FRC proliferation and altered LN structure (Astarita2014The). PDPN's role extends to the development of the lung and lymphatic systems during embryogenesis, highlighting its importance in both structural and functional aspects of cell biology (Krishnan2013Serines).

## Clinical Significance
Podoplanin (PDPN) is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), PDPN is linked to poor prognosis, promoting cancer cell growth, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Lee2020Podoplanin). PDPN expression in OSCC is also associated with increased intravascular platelet aggregation, contributing to cancer-associated thrombosis and higher mortality rates (Lee2020Podoplanin).

In glioblastomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the skin, esophagus, and head and neck, PDPN expression correlates with poor prognosis, while in uterine cervical and lung SCCs, it is considered a favorable prognostic factor (Quintanilla2019Podoplanin). PDPN is often found at the invasive front of tumors, suggesting its expression may be induced by cytokines or growth factors from stromal cells (Quintanilla2019Podoplanin).

PDPN also plays a role in the tumor microenvironment by contributing to an immunosuppressive environment through its expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and its function as a co-inhibitory receptor on T cells (Suzuki2022Roles). This immunosuppressive role is significant in promoting tumor growth and immune evasion (Suzuki2022Roles).

## Interactions
Podoplanin (PDPN) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that participates in several protein interactions, influencing cell migration and tumor progression. One of its primary interactions is with CD44, a type I membrane glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and motility. This interaction is crucial for promoting directional cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes important in cancer metastasis. The interaction between PDPN and CD44 is direct and not mediated by ERM proteins, with glycosylation playing a significant role in their association (MartínVillar2010Podoplanin).

PDPN also interacts with heat shock protein A9 (HSPA9) in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. This interaction occurs on the cell surface and is involved in cell growth and invasiveness, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Tsuneki2013Extracellular).

Additionally, PDPN's intracellular serine residues can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which inhibits cell motility. This phosphorylation affects PDPN's interaction with proteins linked to the actin cytoskeleton, such as Rho and ezrin, which are involved in cell motility and invasion (Krishnan2015PKA; Krishnan2013Serines).
