# ZNF71

## Overview
ZNF71, or zinc finger protein 71, is a gene that encodes a member of the zinc finger protein family, specifically categorized as a transcription factor. The protein product, zinc finger protein 71, is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, and other proteins. ZNF71 is part of the KRAB-ZFP family, known for its role in transcriptional repression through the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain. This domain recruits KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1), forming a repressor complex that contributes to heterochromatin formation and gene silencing (Ye2021Molecular). The gene's structure includes multiple exons, with alternative splicing leading to different isoforms, including a KRAB-less variant (Ye2021Molecular). ZNF71 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance in tumor progression and chemoresistance (Ye2021Molecular).

## Structure
ZNF71, or zinc finger protein 71, is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains. These domains are small protein motifs stabilized by zinc ions, which facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. The ZNF71 gene is composed of four exons. Exons 1 and 2 code for a 180 nucleotide 5' untranslated region (UTR) and the first 11 amino acids of the protein. Exon 3 codes for the next 43 amino acids, which include most of the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repression domain. Exon 4, the longest exon, codes for the remainder of the protein, including a 13-zinc-finger putative DNA binding domain and a predicted ~4 kb 3' UTR (Ye2021Molecular).

ZNF71 is part of the KRAB-ZFP family, which are transcriptional repressors known for silencing transposable elements. They contain an N-terminal KRAB domain and a C-terminal C2H2-type zinc finger array. The KRAB domain recruits KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1), forming a repressor complex that leads to heterochromatin formation (Ye2021Molecular). The third exon, which contains the KRAB domain, can be alternatively spliced out to produce a KRAB-less isoform, resulting in a shorter in-frame protein encoded by exon 4 (Ye2021Molecular).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF71, particularly its KRAB isoform, plays a significant role in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alterations in the expression of ZNF71 KRAB are associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in NSCLC. Higher expression levels of the ZNF71 KRAB isoform correlate with shorter patient survival and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as docetaxel and paclitaxel (Ye2021Molecular). This isoform is linked to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process involved in tumor progression and metastasis, and is overexpressed in mesenchymal cell lines compared to epithelial ones (Ye2021Molecular).

The study suggests that ZNF71 KRAB could serve as a more effective prognostic factor than overall ZNF71 expression, providing additional prognostic and predictive value in NSCLC (Ye2021Molecular). Despite its association with EMT and chemoresistance, functional analyses using CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi indicate that ZNF71 knockdown does not significantly affect NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting its role may be more related to drug resistance and EMT rather than direct tumor growth (Ye2021Molecular).

## Interactions
ZNF71, a zinc finger protein, is known for its role as a transcription factor, capable of binding to DNA, RNA, and other proteins. The KRAB domain of ZNF71 is particularly noted for its transcriptional repression activity, often through recruiting KAP1, which forms a repressor complex leading to heterochromatin formation (Ye2021Molecular). This interaction suggests that ZNF71 can influence gene expression and cellular behavior by forming complexes with other proteins.

In the context of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ZNF71 has been associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process involved in tumor progression and metastasis. The KRAB isoform of ZNF71 is linked to EMT, potentially through interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids that influence gene expression (Ye2021Molecular). The study also highlights the involvement of TRIM28, a co-factor for KRAB-ZFP transcription factors, in EMT and cancer progression, suggesting a potential interaction with ZNF71 (Ye2021Molecular).

While specific protein interactions of ZNF71 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) are not detailed, the protein is implicated in influencing transcription processes and immune infiltration, which may involve interactions with other transcription factors or regulatory elements (Jiang2022Downregulation).
