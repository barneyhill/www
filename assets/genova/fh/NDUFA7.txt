# NDUFA7

## Overview
NDUFA7 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A7, a component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, playing a pivotal role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, thereby contributing to the establishment of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane essential for ATP synthesis (Triepels2000Characterization; Shi2020ndufa7). NDUFA7 is characterized by its extended coil structure with minimal secondary structure, except for an N-terminal amphipathic helix, which is crucial for its interaction with other subunits within the complex (Padavannil2022The). The protein's function is regulated through phosphorylation, which influences complex I assembly and activity, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular energy metabolism (Gowthami2019Mapping). The gene is highly conserved across species, highlighting its essential role in cellular processes (Shi2020ndufa7).

## Structure
The NDUFA7 protein is a component of the Q-module in mitochondrial complex I, primarily consisting of an extended coil with minimal secondary structure, except for an N-terminal amphipathic helix. This helix is crucial for binding at the interface of the matrix and inner mitochondrial membrane, interacting with subunits such as NDUFS8, NDUFA1, and NDUFA12 (Padavannil2022The). The protein's coil structure ascends from the membrane to the N-module, moves laterally along the N/Q-module interface, and descends back towards the membrane. The ascending coil interacts with NDUFS8, NDUFA12, and NDUFS2, while the lateral coil engages with NDUFV1, NDUFS1, and NDUFS2. A variable region, disordered in mammals, interacts with NDUFS3 and NDUFA5. The descending coil extends towards the N-terminus of NDUFS8, interacting with NDUFS2, NDUFS3, and NDUFA5 (Padavannil2022The).

In mammals, NDUFA7 is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (mtPKA) at Ser95, which may influence binding and regulate complex I assembly (Padavannil2022The). This phosphorylation suggests a role in stabilizing the attachment of the N-module and facilitating the replacement of assembly factors during complex I assembly (Padavannil2022The).

## Function
NDUFA7 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in cellular respiration. This complex is responsible for transferring electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the formation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is essential for ATP production (Triepels2000Characterization; Shi2020ndufa7). NDUFA7 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a significant role in maintaining efficient energy production in cells (Shi2020ndufa7).

In healthy human cells, NDUFA7 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial complex I activity through phosphorylation. Although the phosphorylation level of NDUFA7 at serine 96 is low, it is part of the regulatory mechanism that can impact complex I function, which is crucial for mitochondrial bioenergetics and reactive oxygen species production (Gowthami2019Mapping). The gene is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in cellular processes (Shi2020ndufa7). While specific functions in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, NDUFA7's involvement in complex I suggests its importance in maintaining normal mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the NDUFA7 gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In cardiac hypertrophy, a condition characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, NDUFA7 expression is significantly decreased under conditions of pressure overload in the heart, such as those induced by transverse aortic constriction in mice. This suggests that NDUFA7 may play a role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and related myocardial dysfunction (Shi2020ndufa7).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly severe erosive RA, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in NDUFA7 have been associated with the disease. These variants are thought to contribute to oxidative stress, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. The gene-burden tests in RA patients have shown a nominally significant association between NDUFA7 SNVs and severe erosive RA, suggesting a potential genetic basis for the disease (Mitsunaga2015Aggregation).

While NDUFA7 is part of the mitochondrial complex I, which is crucial for ATP production, specific diseases directly caused by mutations in NDUFA7 have not been extensively documented. However, its involvement in mitochondrial dysfunction suggests a potential link to broader mitochondrial disorders (Shi2020ndufa7).

## Interactions
NDUFA7 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is involved in the electron transport chain. It plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. NDUFA7 is part of the N-module of complex I, which is essential for the initial stages of electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone (D’Angelo2020Biogenesis; Arroum2023Loss).

NDUFA7 interacts with other subunits within complex I to facilitate its assembly and stability. The depletion of NDUFS3, another subunit of complex I, affects the stability of NDUFA7, indicating its dependence on the proper assembly of the complex (D’Angelo2020Biogenesis). Additionally, NDUFA7 is downregulated in cells lacking NDUFB10, another complex I subunit, which suggests that NDUFA7's expression and stability are linked to the overall integrity of complex I (Arroum2023Loss).

A recent study found that a mitochondrial micro peptide can bind to NDUFA7 and inhibit complex I activity, indicating a direct interaction with another protein or peptide. This suggests that NDUFA7 may interact with other proteins or peptides to modulate its function (McGovern2022Respirasome).
