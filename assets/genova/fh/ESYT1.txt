# ESYT1

## Overview
The ESYT1 gene encodes the protein extended synaptotagmin 1 (E-Syt1), which is a member of the extended synaptotagmin family of proteins. E-Syt1 is characterized as a lipid transfer protein with a transmembrane domain, a synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain, and multiple C2 domains that facilitate its function in cellular lipid and calcium homeostasis (FernándezBusnadiego2015Threedimensional; Min2007ESyts). The protein is primarily involved in tethering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane and mitochondria, playing a crucial role in lipid transfer and calcium signaling at these contact sites (Yu2016Extended; Janer2023ESYT1). E-Syt1's activity is regulated by calcium ions, which bind to its C2 domains, enabling the protein to mediate lipid transfer and maintain cellular homeostasis (Yu2016Extended). The gene and its encoded protein are implicated in various physiological processes and have been associated with several neurological and metabolic disorders, as well as cancer (Pan2023The; Janer2023ESYT1).

## Structure
Extended synaptotagmin 1 (E-Syt1) is a protein characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes several distinct domains. E-Syt1 contains an N-terminal transmembrane region, a synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain, and five C2 domains: C2A, C2B, C2C, C2D, and C2E (Min2007ESyts). The SMP domain forms a dimer that creates a channel for lipid transfer, playing a crucial role in the protein's function as a lipid transfer protein (FernándezBusnadiego2015Threedimensional). The C2 domains are autonomously folded structures that bind to lipids and calcium ions, with the C2A domain containing canonical Ca2+-binding residues (Yu2016Extended; Min2007ESyts).

The C2 domains are involved in membrane binding and are essential for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of E-Syt1's lipid transfer activity. The C2A and C2C domains, in particular, are crucial for Ca2+ binding, which is necessary for the protein's function at membrane contact sites (Yu2016Extended). The C2C domain mediates ER-PM tethering, while the C2E domain binds the plasma membrane in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner (Bian2017Ca). The structural arrangement of these domains allows E-Syt1 to facilitate the tethering of the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane and to mediate lipid transfer between these membranes (FernándezBusnadiego2015Threedimensional).

## Function
The ESYT1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in tethering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria, facilitating essential cellular processes such as lipid and calcium homeostasis. ESYT1 is localized at mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCs), where it forms a complex with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein SYNJ2BP. This complex is vital for maintaining the structure and function of MERCs, which are involved in lipid synthesis and transport, calcium signaling, and other cellular processes (Janer2023ESYT1).

ESYT1 functions as a Ca2+-dependent lipid transfer protein (LTP), facilitating the non-vesicular transport of lipids between the ER and mitochondria. This process is crucial for the synthesis of key mitochondrial phospholipids, such as cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine, which are necessary for mitochondrial function (Yu2016Extended; Janer2023ESYT1). The protein's activity is regulated by cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, with its C2 domains mediating membrane tethering and lipid transfer (Yu2016Extended).

In addition to lipid transfer, ESYT1 is essential for the transfer of calcium ions from the ER to mitochondria, a process critical for maintaining mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and overall cellular health (Janer2023ESYT1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the ESYT1 gene have been implicated in several neurological and metabolic disorders. Disruptions in ESYT1 function can lead to impaired mitochondrial lipid and calcium homeostasis, which are critical for cellular health. These disruptions are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as aging-related conditions (Janer2023ESYT1). The ESYT1-SYNJ2BP complex is essential for maintaining mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCs), and its loss can impair calcium flux and alter the mitochondrial lipidome, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Janer2022ESYT1).

In cancer research, ESYT1 is involved in calcium signaling and metabolism, processes that are crucial for tumor progression. Dysregulated calcium signaling influenced by ESYT1 is linked to uncontrolled tumor growth and development. Knockdown of ESYT1 affects the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) pathway, impacting tumor cell proliferation and resistance to cell death (Pan2023The). The role of ESYT1 in lipid transport and membrane stability may also indirectly affect cancer cell proliferation, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic marker for cancer (Pan2023The).

## Interactions
ESYT1, or extended synaptotagmin 1, is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly at mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCs). It forms a complex with SYNJ2BP, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of MERCs. This interaction facilitates the transfer of lipids and calcium between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, crucial for cellular homeostasis (Janer2022ESYT1; Janer2023ESYT1). The ESYT1-SYNJ2BP complex is a high-molecular-weight assembly that promotes the formation of MERCs, and its disruption leads to impaired calcium flux and altered mitochondrial lipid composition (Janer2022ESYT1).

ESYT1 also interacts with ESYT2, another SMP domain-containing protein, forming complexes at ER-plasma membrane contact sites. This interaction is regulated by calcium binding and specific phospholipids (Janer2023ESYT1). Additionally, ESYT1 is suggested to interact with lipid transport proteins such as OSBPL8, indicating a role in organizing membrane domains for lipid transfer (Janer2022ESYT1; Janer2023ESYT1). These interactions highlight ESYT1's multifaceted role in cellular lipid and calcium homeostasis.
