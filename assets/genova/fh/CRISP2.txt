# CRISP2

## Overview
CRISP2 is a gene that encodes the cysteine-rich secretory protein 2, a member of the CRISP family, which is characterized by its conserved cysteine residues and distinct functional domains. This protein is primarily expressed in the testes and plays a crucial role in sperm development and function, particularly in processes such as capacitation, hyperactivated motility, and the acrosome reaction. The CRISP2 protein is involved in regulating calcium ion flow through ryanodine receptors, which is essential for sperm physiology and fertility (Jamsai2008Characterization; Jamsai2010A). It interacts with other proteins, such as gametogenetin 1 (GGN1) and the prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94), to facilitate sperm motility and capacitation (Anklesaria2016Identification; Jamsai2008Characterization). Alterations in CRISP2 expression have been linked to male infertility, highlighting its significance in reproductive health (Gholami2020The).

## Structure
CRISP2 is a member of the cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) family, characterized by 16 conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability (Jamsai2008Polymorphisms). The protein is composed of two main domains: the N-terminal CAP (cysteine-rich secretory protein/antigen 5/pathogenesis-related-1) domain and the C-terminal CRISP domain, connected by a hinge region (Jamsai2010A). The CAP domain is involved in cell adhesion, while the CRISP domain regulates ion channels, particularly Ca2+ flow through ryanodine receptors, which is crucial for sperm function (Gonzalez2021CysteineRich; Jamsai2010A).

The CRISP domain has a structure similar to K+ channel inhibitors, with a fold that includes a hydrophobic core and disulfide bridges (Guo2005Crystal). The hinge region contains disulfide bonds that are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the protein (Guo2005Crystal). CRISP2 forms oligomers with different molecular weights and biochemical properties in the sperm tail and head, indicating a potential quaternary structure (Gonzalez2021CysteineRich). The protein is not glycosylated, and its expression is primarily in the testis, specifically in germ cells (Gonzalez2021CysteineRich).

## Function
CRISP2 (cysteine-rich secretory protein 2) is primarily expressed in the testes and plays a significant role in sperm development and function. It is a component of mature sperm, localized in the acrosome, the connecting piece of the neck, and the outer dense fibers of the sperm tail (Brukman2016Fertilization). CRISP2 is involved in sperm physiology, particularly in gamete fusion during fertilization, and is crucial for proper sperm function and fertility (Brukman2016Fertilization; Busso2007Evidence).

The protein is part of the CRISP family, characterized by conserved cysteines and distinct functional domains. The CRISP domain of CRISP2 regulates calcium ion flow through ryanodine receptors, which is essential for sperm functions such as capacitation, hyperactivated motility, and the acrosome reaction (Jamsai2008Characterization; Jamsai2010A). CRISP2 also interacts with gametogenetin 1 (GGN1) in the sperm tail, suggesting a role in sperm tail development and motility (Jamsai2008Characterization).

CRISP2's involvement in sperm-oocyte binding and its potential role in cell-cell adhesion are also noted, although the mechanisms remain unclear (Jamsai2008Characterization). Aberrant expression of CRISP2 is linked to male infertility, with reduced levels observed in infertile patients with various sperm-related syndromes (Brukman2016Fertilization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CRISP2 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly affecting sperm motility and morphology. Reduced expression of CRISP2 is observed in infertile men with conditions such as azoospermia, asthenozoospermia, teratoasthenozoospermia, and oligoasthenoteratospermia, which are characterized by impaired sperm motility and abnormal morphology (Gholami2020The; Gonzalez2021CysteineRich). These conditions are associated with decreased sperm maturation and motility, as CRISP2 is crucial for the acrosome reaction and gamete fusion, processes essential for fertilization (Gholami2020The).

CRISP2 expression is also linked to calcium signaling regulation, which is vital for sperm hyperactivation, a process necessary for successful fertilization (Gonzalez2021CysteineRich). Alterations in CRISP2 expression can lead to structural changes in sperm flagella and dysregulation of intracellular calcium, further affecting sperm function (Gholami2020The).

While specific mutations in CRISP2, such as the C196R polymorphism, have been identified, they do not show a significant association with male infertility, suggesting that expression alterations rather than mutations are more commonly linked to fertility issues (Jamsai2008Polymorphisms).

## Interactions
CRISP2, a cysteine-rich secretory protein, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in reproductive processes. It interacts with gametogenetin 1 (GGN1), a novel binding partner identified through a yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction occurs between the ion channel regulatory region within the CRISP domain of CRISP2 and the carboxyl-most 158 amino acids of GGN1. The GGN1-CRISP2 complex is suggested to play a role in sperm motility and/or capacitation by regulating Ca2+ flux, essential for sperm function (Jamsai2008Characterization).

CRISP2 also binds to the prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94) in human sperm. This interaction was confirmed using an affinity pull-down method, marking the first time CRISP2 from human sperm has been shown to bind to PSP94. The interaction involves the CAP domain and hinge region of the CRISP domain, potentially inhibiting the activity of the ion channel regulatory region (Anklesaria2016Identification).

Additionally, CRISP2 participates in gamete fusion, as evidenced by its binding to specific sites on the egg surface. This interaction is crucial for sperm-egg fusion, with studies showing that anti-CRISP2 antibodies significantly decrease the percentage of fertilized eggs (Cohen2008Participation).
