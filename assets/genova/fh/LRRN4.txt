# LRRN4

## Overview
LRRN4 (leucine rich repeat neuronal 4) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein characterized by leucine-rich repeat domains, which are essential for mediating protein-protein interactions. This protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a critical role in neuronal development and synaptic connectivity, particularly influencing long-term memory formation in regions such as the hippocampus (Xu2022Prognostic; Chen2006AMIGO). Beyond the nervous system, LRRN4 is also expressed in various non-neuronal tissues, including the lung, ovary, and heart, indicating its involvement in broader cellular functions (Xu2022Prognostic). The protein's expression is notably high in mesothelial cells, suggesting a role in maintaining mesothelial cell identity (KanamoriKatayama2011LRRN4). Additionally, LRRN4 has been implicated in pathological conditions, such as colorectal cancer and colon adenocarcinoma, where its altered expression is associated with disease progression and prognosis (Zhang2022The; Xu2022Prognostic).

## Function
LRRN4 (leucine rich repeat neuronal 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular and molecular processes, primarily within the nervous system. The protein is characterized by leucine-rich repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for cell signaling and synaptic connectivity. In healthy human cells, LRRN4 is notably active in the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus, where it plays a significant role in long-term memory formation and neuronal development (Xu2022Prognostic; Chen2006AMIGO).

LRRN4 is also expressed in non-neuronal tissues, including the lung, ovary, and heart, suggesting a broader role in cellular functions beyond the nervous system (Xu2022Prognostic). In mesothelial cells, which line the body's serous cavities and internal organs, LRRN4 is highly expressed and serves as a marker for the mesothelial lineage, indicating its involvement in maintaining mesothelial cell identity or function (KanamoriKatayama2011LRRN4).

The protein's involvement in cellular processes is further highlighted by its regulation in response to lung injury and its potential role in inflammatory responses, as evidenced by its upregulation in certain conditions (KanamoriKatayama2011LRRN4).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LRRN4 gene have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). In CRC, LRRN4 is highly expressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its elevated expression is associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (Xu2022Prognostic). High LRRN4 expression correlates with advanced pathological stages, lymphatic invasion, and lymph node metastasis, suggesting its role as an independent prognostic factor for CRC (Xu2022Prognostic). Functional studies indicate that LRRN4 promotes cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and migration while inhibiting apoptosis, contributing to tumor growth and progression (Xu2022Prognostic).

In COAD, LRRN4 expression is significantly higher in tumor samples compared to adjacent normal tissues. This increased expression is linked to advanced TNM stages and poorer prognoses, making LRRN4 a potential biomarker for COAD diagnosis and prognosis (Zhang2022The). The gene's expression is associated with the activation of several cancer-related signaling pathways, including the Ras/MAPK pathway in CRC and the TGF-β and WNT pathways in COAD, which are crucial for cancer progression (Zhang2022The; Xu2022Prognostic).
