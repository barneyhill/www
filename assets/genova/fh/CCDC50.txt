# CCDC50

## Overview
The CCDC50 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 50 protein, also known as Ymer, which is a crucial component in cellular processes related to autophagy and immune regulation. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain and motifs interacting with ubiquitin (MIUs), which facilitate its role as a selective autophagy receptor (ModamioHøybjør2007A). CCDC50 is involved in the degradation of K63-polyubiquitinated proteins, playing a significant role in modulating immune responses by regulating pathways such as the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) and STING-mediated interferon responses (Hou2020A; Hou2021Autophagy). The protein's interactions with LC3B and other autophagic components underscore its function in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Hou2020A). Additionally, mutations in CCDC50 have been linked to progressive hearing loss and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders (ModamioHøybjør2007A; Farfsing2009Gene).

## Structure
The CCDC50 protein, also known as Ymer, is characterized by several structural features, including a coiled-coil domain and motifs interacting with ubiquitin (MIUs) (ModamioHøybjør2007A). The coiled-coil domain is encoded by exons 3 and 4, while the MIU1 and MIU2 motifs are encoded by exons 7 and 8, and exons 8 and 9, respectively (ModamioHøybjør2007A). These motifs are crucial for the protein's interaction with LC3B, a protein involved in autophagy, and polyubiquitin chains (Hou2020A).

CCDC50 contains a non-canonical LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, DQEWYDAE, which interacts with LC3B, facilitating its role as an autophagic cargo receptor (Hou2020A). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination at lysine 129 and phosphorylation of tyrosines 145 and 146 in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation (ModamioHøybjør2007A).

CCDC50 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, with the longer transcript encoding a protein of 482 amino acids and a shorter variant encoding a protein of 305 amino acids (ModamioHøybjør2007A). These isoforms may influence the protein's function and localization within the cell. The protein is soluble and cytoplasmic, with a molecular mass of approximately 38 kDa (ModamioHøybjør2007A).

## Function
The CCDC50 gene encodes a protein that functions as a selective autophagy receptor, playing a critical role in regulating immune responses in healthy human cells. It is involved in the degradation of K63-polyubiquitinated proteins, such as RIG-I and MDA5, which are key components of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway. This pathway is responsible for triggering type I interferon (IFN) production in response to viral infections. By facilitating the autophagic degradation of these proteins, CCDC50 helps maintain immune homeostasis and prevents excessive inflammation (Hou2020A).

CCDC50 also regulates the STING-mediated interferon response, crucial for defending against DNA virus infections. It achieves this by delivering K63-polyubiquitinated STING to autolysosomes for degradation, thereby modulating type I IFN signaling activity. This regulation is essential to prevent overactivation of immune responses, which can lead to tissue damage and autoimmune diseases (Hou2021Autophagy).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, CCDC50 is expressed in immune tissues and cells, particularly in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which produce the majority of type I IFN. This expression pattern suggests its predominant role in regulating autophagy within the immune system (Hou2021Autophagy).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC50 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. A mutation in CCDC50 is linked to progressive hearing loss, specifically DFNA44, an autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing impairment. This mutation, identified as a tandem duplication in exon 11, leads to a frameshift and a novel protein sequence, causing postlingual, progressive sensorineural hearing loss. The hearing loss initially affects low to mid frequencies and progresses to profound loss by the sixth decade of life (ModamioHøybjør2007A).

In the context of cancer, CCDC50 is overexpressed in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Its overexpression is associated with enhanced cell survival and proliferation, potentially through the modulation of NFkB and p53 signaling pathways. Silencing CCDC50 in these cancer cells reduces cell viability, indicating its role in promoting cell survival (Farfsing2009Gene).

CCDC50 also plays a role in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It acts as a negative regulator of type I interferon pathways, and its downregulation is linked to increased disease activity in SLE. This suggests that CCDC50 dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune conditions (Hou2021Autophagy).

## Interactions
CCDC50 interacts with several proteins involved in the immune response, particularly during viral infections. It acts as a selective autophagy receptor, mediating the degradation of K63-polyubiquitinated RIG-I and MDA5 by interacting with LC3B, a protein associated with autophagosomes. This interaction is facilitated through CCDC50's LIR (LC3-interacting region) and MIU (motif interacting with ubiquitin) motifs, which allow it to bind to both the LIR-docking site (LDS) and the UIM-docking site (UDS) on LC3B (Hou2020A).

CCDC50 also interacts with the STING protein, targeting it for autophagic degradation. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal transmembrane domain of STING and the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of CCDC50. CCDC50 recognizes K63-polyubiquitinated STING and delivers it to LC3-positive autophagosomes, indicating its role in regulating the cGAS-STING pathway (Hou2021Autophagy).

In addition, CCDC50 interacts with the autophagic cargo receptor p62, although it can function independently of p62 in promoting the degradation of polyubiquitinated RIG-I. It also interacts with MAVS, TBK1, and IKKε, suggesting a role in regulating the stability and activity of RIG-I/MDA5 through autophagic degradation (Hou2020A).
