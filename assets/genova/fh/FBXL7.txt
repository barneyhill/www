# FBXL7

## Overview
FBXL7 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 7, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by an F-box motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein is a crucial component of the SCF (SKP1-Cullin-1-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by targeting specific proteins for degradation, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation (Liu2015Fbox; Wang2022Functional). FBXL7 is highly conserved across species, underscoring its biological importance (Liu2015Fbox). The protein's function is modulated through post-translational modifications, including ubiquitylation and N-myristoylation, which influence its stability and localization (Wang2022Functional). FBXL7's interactions with proteins such as Aurora A and Survivin highlight its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer biology (Wang2022Functional).

## Structure
The FBXL7 protein, encoded by the human FBXL7 gene, is composed of 491 amino acids and features several key structural elements. It includes an F-box motif, which is essential for binding to the SKP1 protein, a component of the SCF (SKP1-Cullin-1-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex plays a critical role in targeting proteins for polyubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome, maintaining protein homeostasis in eukaryotic cells (Wang2022Functional). The protein also contains 11 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) at the C-terminus, which are involved in substrate recognition (Wang2022Functional).

FBXL7 is highly conserved across species, sharing 98% sequence identity between humans and mice, indicating its biological importance (Liu2015Fbox). The protein's structure includes a ubiquitination modification site on lysine 109 (K109), which is crucial for its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (Liu2015Fbox). Post-translational modifications of FBXL7 include ubiquitylation and N-myristoylation, which affect its stability and subcellular localization (Wang2022Functional). The interaction with FBXL18, mediated by an FQ motif, regulates FBXL7's degradation (Liu2015Fbox).

## Function
FBXL7 is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, targeting proteins for degradation to maintain cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, FBXL7 is involved in regulating several biological processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression (Liu2015Fbox; Wang2022Functional). It specifically targets proteins such as Aurora A and Survivin for degradation. Aurora A is essential for mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation, and its degradation by FBXL7 leads to mitotic arrest and apoptosis (Wang2022Functional). FBXL7 also targets Survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis, promoting mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis (Wang2022Functional).

FBXL7 is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes like cell proliferation and differentiation (Wang2022Functional). The protein's activity is regulated through polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, mediated by another F-box protein, FBXL18, which ensures the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis (Liu2015Fbox). This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive tissue injury (Liu2015Fbox).

## Clinical Significance
The FBXL7 gene is implicated in various human cancers, with its expression levels and mutations having significant clinical implications. In many cancers, such as bladder, cervical, colon, kidney, lung, ovarian, prostate, rectum, thyroid, and uterine cancers, FBXL7 is generally downregulated, often due to promoter hypermethylation. This downregulation is associated with poor survival outcomes, particularly in prostate and pancreatic cancers, where it acts as a tumor suppressor by degrading oncogenic substrates like Aurora A and Survivin (Wang2022Functional). In ovarian cancer, however, higher FBXL7 levels correlate with worse survival and chemotherapy resistance, suggesting a complex role that may vary by cancer type (Chiu2018FBXL7).

Mutations in FBXL7, such as P65S, P93L, and R310H, impair its ability to bind substrates, while others like Q271H and R353Q affect its interaction with CUL1 and SKP1, disrupting its function in the SCF ligase complex. These mutations can lead to the accumulation of oncogenic substrates, promoting tumorigenesis (Wang2022Functional). FBXL7's expression and mutation status could serve as biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targets, particularly in glioma and ovarian cancer, where it is linked to chemotherapy resistance (Chiu2018FBXL7; Wang2022Functional).

## Interactions
FBXL7 is involved in several physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is a subunit of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for ubiquitination and degradation. FBXL7 interacts with Aurora A, a substrate that it targets for polyubiquitylation and degradation, affecting mitotic spindle formation and cell cycle progression (Wang2022Functional). Aurora A also interacts with FBXL7 by binding to the transcription factor FOXP1 at the FBXL7 promoter, phosphorylating FOXP1, and repressing FBXL7 transcription, establishing a feed-forward loop (Wang2022Functional).

FBXL7 targets Survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis, for degradation, which is crucial for apoptosis and mitochondrial function (Kamran2017Aurora). It also interacts with Snail1, a transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby inhibiting cancer metastasis (Tang2021Downregulated). In non-small cell lung cancer, FBXL7 interacts with PFKFB4, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which affects glucose metabolism and the malignant phenotype of cancer cells (Zhou2023Hypoxiamediated). These interactions highlight FBXL7's role in regulating protein stability and cellular processes through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
