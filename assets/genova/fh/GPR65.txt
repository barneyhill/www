# GPR65

## Overview
GPR65 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 65, a proton-sensing receptor involved in various physiological processes, particularly in immune regulation and cellular metabolism. As a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, GPR65 plays a critical role in sensing extracellular pH changes and modulating inflammatory responses. The receptor is primarily expressed in immune cells, where it influences the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulates immune cell differentiation. Through its interactions with G proteins, GPR65 activates signaling pathways that are essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and tissue integrity. The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as in cancer, highlighting its significance in health and disease (Zhang2023Targeting; Chen2022pH; Justus2024The).

## Function
GPR65, also known as TDAG8, is a proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis by sensing extracellular pH changes. In healthy human cells, GPR65 is involved in modulating inflammatory responses by inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6, and IFNγ from immune cells like macrophages and CD8+ T cells (Chen2022pH). This receptor operates through the Gαs protein, leading to the production of cAMP, which phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB. This phosphorylation event blocks CREB's binding to the NF-κB complex, thereby limiting pro-inflammatory responses (Xie2021pH).

GPR65 is also involved in regulating lipid metabolism and immune cell differentiation, particularly affecting Th17 and Th22 cells. It influences the cAMP-CREB-DGAT1 axis, which is crucial for fatty acid metabolism and cytokine production (Chen2022pH). In dendritic cells, GPR65 activation reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhances antigen presentation by modulating endo-lysosomal function (Chen2022pH). The receptor's activity is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation, highlighting its role in immune regulation and cellular metabolism (Chen2022pH).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPR65 gene have been linked to several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Genome-wide association studies have associated GPR65 with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Wirasinha2017GPR65; Zhao2021The; Justus2024The). In IBD, polymorphisms such as rs8005161 can increase disease severity, and reduced GPR65 expression is linked to impaired bacterial phagocytosis and increased pro-inflammatory signaling, exacerbating intestinal inflammation and promoting colitis-associated cancer (Justus2024The).

In the context of autoimmune diseases, GPR65 plays a role in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. GPR65 deficiency in mice leads to worsened disease progression, highlighting its protective role (Wirasinha2017GPR65; Zhao2021The). GPR65 is also implicated in asthma, where it can increase eosinophil viability, contributing to inflammation (Justus2024The).

In cancer, GPR65 expression influences tumor growth and resistance to acidosis-mediated cell death. It has a complex role in blood cancers, where it can both promote and inhibit cancer progression depending on the context (Justus2024The). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, GPR65 expression correlates with anti-apoptotic proteins, aiding leukemia cell survival in acidic environments (Insel2020ProtonSensing).

## Interactions
GPR65, also known as TDAG8, is a G protein-coupled receptor that participates in various signaling pathways through its interactions with other proteins. It is known to interact with G proteins, specifically coupling with Gs and G12/13 proteins, which mediate the activation of second messengers such as cAMP and RhoA, respectively (Tcymbarevich2019The). These interactions are crucial for its role in proton sensing and the regulation of cellular responses to acidic environments.

In the context of human trophoblast cells, GPR65 influences cytoskeletal dynamics by interacting with the cAMP-ERK signaling pathway. This interaction leads to the upregulation of myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) and MYLK3, and the downregulation of fibronectin, affecting cell adhesion and motility (Mao2023GPR65). GPR65's role in these processes suggests potential interactions with components of the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix.

In hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, GPR65 is involved in the JNK and NF-κB signaling pathways, promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. These interactions are mediated through the Gαq-Ca2+-JNK/NF-κB and Gαq-Ca2+-MLK3-MKK7-JNK pathways, highlighting its role in modulating inflammatory responses (Zhang2023Targeting).
