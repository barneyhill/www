# ADGRL2

## Overview
ADGRL2, or adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L2, is a gene that encodes a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically known as latrophilin-2. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a long extracellular N-terminal domain, a seven-transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail, typical of GPCRs (Anderson2017Postsynaptic; Vezain2018A). ADGRL2 plays a crucial role in synaptic recognition and assembly, particularly in the hippocampus, where it functions as a synaptic target-recognition molecule (Anderson2017Postsynaptic). The protein is involved in intracellular calcium signaling pathways and interacts with various ligands, influencing cellular processes such as adhesion and signaling (Vezain2018A; Krishnan2016Classification). Mutations in the ADGRL2 gene have been linked to neurological conditions, highlighting its importance in brain development and function (Vezain2018A).

## Structure
The ADGRL2 protein, also known as latrophilin-2, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. It features a long extracellular N-terminal domain, a seven-transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail, which is typical of GPCR architecture (Anderson2017Postsynaptic; Vezain2018A). The extracellular domain includes a cysteine-rich region homologous to a galactose-binding lectin domain, an olfactomedin domain, and a hormone-binding domain (Krishnan2016Classification). The lectin domain is characterized by a beta-sandwich structure with two antiparallel sheets, surrounded by a 10-residue alpha-helix and two extended loops, while the olfactomedin domain has a propeller fold and a conserved calcium-binding site (Krishnan2016Classification).

ADGRL2 also contains a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which mediates autoproteolysis, resulting in cleavage into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (Anderson2017Postsynaptic; Krishnan2016Classification). Post-translational modifications of ADGRL2 include glycosylation, which is common in its extracellular domain (Vezain2018A). The protein interacts with various binding partners, such as teneurins, fibronectin leucine-rich transmembranes (FLRTs), and neurexins, contributing to its role in cell adhesion and synapse assembly (Anderson2017Postsynaptic; Krishnan2016Classification).

## Function
ADGRL2, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L2, is a member of the adhesion-GPCR family involved in various molecular and cellular functions. In healthy human cells, ADGRL2 plays a critical role in synapse recognition and assembly, contributing to synapse maintenance. It interacts with endogenous ligands such as FLRT3 and binds weakly to teneurin-2, but not with neurexins or FLRT1 (Vezain2018A). This receptor is crucial for the assembly and maintenance of specific synapses, particularly in the hippocampus, where it acts as a synaptic target-recognition molecule (Anderson2017Postsynaptic).

ADGRL2 is involved in intracellular calcium signaling pathways, specifically through its interaction with the ligand α-latrotoxin, which leads to calcium release via a G protein-coupled pathway. This signaling is essential for regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and neuronal migration (Vezain2018A). The gene is expressed early in human development, with strong expression in the neural tube and various brain regions, including the cerebellum, where it is crucial for normal development and function (Vezain2018A).

In the hippocampus, ADGRL2 maintains synapse numbers through a postsynaptic mechanism, influencing synaptic organization and neural circuit development (Anderson2017Postsynaptic). Its proper function is vital for healthy brain development and synaptic connectivity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADGRL2 gene have been associated with significant neurological conditions. A de novo variant, specifically c.3785T>A, has been linked to extreme microcephaly, severely reduced sulcation, and rhombencephalosynapsis (RES), a condition characterized by abnormal cerebellar development. This variant impairs calcium signaling, which is crucial for neuronal migration, and affects intracellular calcium release in response to ligand activation, altering signal transduction pathways involving G-protein coupled receptor activation (Vezain2018A). 

Research involving MRI studies in Adgrl2 +/- mice has shown microcephaly and defects in cerebellar growth, supporting the role of ADGRL2 in cerebellar development (Vezain2018A). The variant also increases cell adhesion properties and reduces cell motility, potentially due to altered signal transduction, which affects cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular signaling (Vezain2018A). 

Despite these findings, resequencing of ADGRL2 in individuals with RES and other brain malformations did not reveal additional pathogenic variants, suggesting that ADGRL2 mutations may not be a common cause of these conditions (Vezain2018A). Nonetheless, the expression patterns of ADGRL2 during early development indicate its significant role in brain development (Vezain2018A).

## Interactions
ADGRL2, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as adhesion and signaling. It is part of the Adhesion-GPCR family and interacts with several ligands, including fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 3 (FLRT3), but not with neurexins or FLRT1, and binds weakly to teneurin-2 (Vezain2018A; Krishnan2016Classification). The N-terminal fragment of ADGRL2 contains a cysteine-rich region homologous to a galactose-binding lectin domain, which is involved in binding interactions, although it binds weakly to teneurin-2 compared to other family members (Krishnan2016Classification).

ADGRL2 is also known to interact with intracellular signaling pathways. The c.3785T>A variant in ADGRL2 affects intracellular calcium signaling, which is crucial for synaptic function and neuronal migration (Vezain2018A). This variant impairs calcium release in response to α-latrotoxin, a known agonist for ADGRLs, indicating a role in G protein-mediated signaling (Vezain2018A). These interactions suggest that ADGRL2 plays a significant role in cellular adhesion and signaling, impacting processes such as neuronal migration and cerebellar development (Vezain2018A).
