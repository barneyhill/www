# EDDM3B

## Overview
EDDM3B is a gene that encodes the epididymal protein 3B, which is primarily expressed in the human epididymis. This protein is involved in the maturation and function of sperm, contributing to the creation of an optimal environment for sperm development within the epididymal lumen (Leir2020An). Although EDDM3B is secreted by the epididymal epithelium and plays a role in reproductive processes, studies have shown that it is not essential for male fertility, as evidenced by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments in mice (Sun2020CRISPRCas9based). Beyond its reproductive functions, EDDM3B has been implicated in various diseases, including breast cancer and asthma, and is being investigated as a potential biomarker for gliomas (Obaidat2023Noncoding; Ghorbani2023Discovery; Zhang2019How). Despite these associations, the precise molecular mechanisms and broader biological significance of EDDM3B remain areas of active research.

## Function
EDDM3B, also known as epididymal protein 3B, is primarily expressed in the human epididymis, where it plays a significant role in sperm maturation and function. The protein is secreted by the epididymal epithelium into the lumen, contributing to the environment necessary for sperm maturation (Leir2020An). EDDM3B is part of a group of proteins encoded by cluster 1 cells in the epididymis, which are thought to be crucial for sperm maturation, although these cells are not well-characterized (Leir2020An). 

Despite its expression in the epididymis, studies using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in mice have shown that EDDM3B is individually dispensable for male fertility, as knockout mice did not exhibit any significant differences in fertility compared to wild-type controls (Sun2020CRISPRCas9based). This suggests that while EDDM3B may contribute to the reproductive process, it is not essential for fertility, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms or functional redundancy with other proteins. The specific molecular activities of EDDM3B in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in the epididymal environment indicates a role in supporting sperm function and maturation.

## Clinical Significance
The EDDM3B gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In breast cancer, EDDM3B is located near intergenic sequences targeted by autoantibodies, suggesting a role in breast carcinogenesis. The gene's involvement in the synthesis and secretion of epididymal epithelial cell proteins may be linked to its predictive value for late metastasis in node-negative breast cancer, although comprehensive data are still lacking (Obaidat2023Noncoding).

In the context of asthma, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3ʹ untranslated region of the EDDM3B gene, rs3827907, has been associated with the response to inhaled corticosteroids. This SNP interacts with treatment efficacy, particularly in African American populations, and is linked to the expression of the RNASE2 gene, which encodes a proinflammatory protein (Zhang2019How).

In gliomas, EDDM3B has been identified as a potential serum biomarker, with increased levels observed in glioma patients compared to those with meningiomas. However, its clinical utility requires further validation (Ghorbani2023Discovery). These findings suggest that EDDM3B may play a role in various pathological processes, although its precise mechanisms and significance remain to be fully elucidated.
