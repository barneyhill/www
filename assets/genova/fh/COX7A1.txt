# COX7A1

## Overview
The COX7A1 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7A1, a protein that is an integral component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, specifically within Complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase (COX). This protein is categorized as a structural subunit, contributing to the assembly and stability of the COX complex, which is essential for the process of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in cells. COX7A1 is predominantly expressed in skeletal and heart muscle tissues, where it plays a critical role in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. The protein's involvement in the formation of COX dimers underscores its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and functional efficiency of the COX complex (Rönn2008Age; Čunátová2020Role).

## Function
The COX7A1 gene encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as Complex IV, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This complex is responsible for the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, a process that is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in cells (Rönn2008Age; Čunátová2020Role). COX7A1 is specifically expressed in skeletal and heart muscle tissues, where it plays a significant role in regulating energy production and maintaining efficient mitochondrial function (Rönn2008Age).

In healthy human cells, COX7A1 contributes to the structural and regulatory subunits of the COX complex, while the catalytic core is composed of mitochondrial-encoded proteins (Rönn2008Age). The gene is involved in the formation of COX dimers and is detected only in these dimers, indicating its role in the structural integrity and functional efficiency of the COX complex (Čunátová2020Role). The absence of COX7A1 leads to decreased COX activity, highlighting its importance in maintaining COX function, although it can be partially replaced by other isoforms in certain tissues (Čunátová2020Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the COX7A1 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In mice, deletion of the heart-type cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7a1, encoded by COX7A1, leads to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. This condition is characterized by an increase in heart weight, enlargement of the left ventricular cavity, and impaired cardiac function, suggesting that similar mutations in humans could potentially lead to a dominantly inherited form of cardiomyopathy (Hüttemann2012Mice).

In humans, COX7A1 expression is downregulated in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes. This downregulation is associated with increased DNA methylation of the COX7A1 promoter with age, which may contribute to defects in the skeletal muscle respiratory chain and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (Rönn2008Age).

In the context of cancer, COX7A1 has been studied in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, where its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and increases apoptosis. This suggests a potential tumor suppressor role for COX7A1, possibly through the regulation of autophagic flux and interaction with NOX2, a superoxide-generating enzyme (Zhao2019COX7A1).

## Interactions
COX7A1, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), is involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It interacts with other subunits within Complex IV, such as MT-CO1, to facilitate electron transfer. A mutation in MT-CO1, specifically M117T, can disrupt its interaction with COX7A1, potentially leading to a loss of stability and function of the complex (Lloyd2013Structural).

COX7A1 is part of the late-stage assembly of COX holoenzymes, where it is incorporated into existing complexes. This process involves a conserved late state intermediate (LSI) complex that includes COX6A and COX7A subunits, along with ancillary factors that aid in their incorporation (Čunátová2020Role). COX7A1 is detected only in COX dimers, indicating its specific role in the structural organization of the enzyme (Čunátová2020Role).

In the context of supercomplex formation, COX7A1 is expressed in heart and muscle tissues, where it plays a role in the binding of Complex IV to other complexes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This interaction is crucial for the formation of supercomplexes, although COX7A2 is the predominant isoform in human cells (FernándezVizarra2021SILACbased).
