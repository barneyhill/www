# VWA2

## Overview
The VWA2 gene encodes the protein von Willebrand factor A domain containing 2, commonly referred to as AMACO, which is a member of the von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain-containing protein superfamily. AMACO is an extracellular matrix protein that plays a critical role in the structural integrity of the basement membrane, a key component of the extracellular matrix that supports tissue architecture and cell adhesion. The protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes multiple VWA domains, cysteine-rich domains, and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and is subject to rare post-translational modifications such as O-glucosylation and O-fucosylation (Richardson2014AMACO; Gebauer2008OGlucosylation). AMACO is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with Fras1, a component of the Fraser complex, which is essential for its deposition in the basement membrane (Richardson2014AMACO). The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including colorectal cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (González2018Epigenetic; Hoogmartens2021Contribution; van2018A).

## Structure
The VWA2 gene encodes the AMACO protein, which is part of the von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain-containing protein superfamily. The molecular structure of AMACO includes an N-terminal VWA domain, followed by a cysteine-rich domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and two additional VWA domains. At the C-terminus, there is another EGF-like domain and a unique domain (Richardson2014AMACO; Gebauer2008OGlucosylation). 

AMACO is characterized by rare post-translational modifications, specifically O-glucosylation and O-fucosylation, on its first EGF-like domain. These modifications occur at overlapping consensus sequences and are conserved across species, suggesting a functional role (Gebauer2008OGlucosylation). The glycosylation patterns have been studied using mass spectrometry, revealing complex glycan structures (Gebauer2008OGlucosylation).

AMACO is an extracellular matrix protein localized at the basement membrane of multiple tissues during development. It interacts with Fras1, a component of the Fraser complex, through its chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) and P2 domains (Richardson2014AMACO). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in the basement membrane-associated Fraser complex (Richardson2014AMACO).

## Function
The VWA2 gene encodes the AMACO protein, which is a component of the basement membrane-associated Fraser complex. This protein is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the basement membrane, a crucial part of the extracellular matrix that supports tissue architecture and cell adhesion (Richardson2014AMACO). AMACO contains von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, particularly with Fras1, another component of the Fraser complex. This interaction is essential for the stabilization and deposition of AMACO in the basement membrane (Richardson2014AMACO).

In healthy human cells, AMACO is localized at the basement membrane of multiple tissues during development, indicating its role in tissue maintenance and development (Richardson2014AMACO). Although the specific functions of AMACO in humans are not fully understood, it is known to support integrin-mediated cell attachment in mice, suggesting a similar role in humans (Gebauer2010Expression). The protein's involvement in the Fraser complex implies that it plays a role in maintaining the integrity of tissues, particularly when the complex is compromised, as seen in conditions like Fraser syndrome (Richardson2014AMACO).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the VWA2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In colorectal cancer, VWA2 is over-expressed, particularly in primary tumors, and is associated with a Myc-driven oncogenic program. This over-expression is linked to hypomethylation of regions near the gene, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early detection of colorectal cancer (González2018Epigenetic). 

In Alzheimer's disease, homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in VWA2 have been identified in both early-onset and late-onset cases. These mutations are rare and may contribute to the disease's genetic etiology, particularly in sporadic cases without a family history of autosomal dominant inheritance (Hoogmartens2021Contribution).

VWA2 mutations have also been associated with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). A specific homozygous missense mutation, Arg446Cys, has been linked to vesicoureteral reflux and end-stage renal disease. This mutation affects the protein's secretion and aggregation, potentially impacting kidney development and function (van2018A). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of VWA2 in various diseases.

## Interactions
The VWA2 gene encodes a protein that interacts with the Fraser complex, which is involved in kidney development. VWA2 specifically interacts with the CSPG domains of Fras1, a component of the Fraser complex, and co-localizes with Fras1 in the nephrogenic zone of the renal cortex in newborn mice. This interaction suggests a role for VWA2 in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) (van2018A).

In Dictyostelium, Vwa2 interacts with the FbxwD protein, a WD40 repeat F-box protein. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and is suggested to occur primarily in prestalk cells during development. The interaction is robust enough to be detected in co-immunoprecipitations of FbxwD-FLAG 3 expressed at native levels (Boland2023Synergy).

The VWA2 protein contains a von Willebrand factor A domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. This domain is structurally similar to the VWA domain of PTMP1, a collagen-binding matrix protein, indicating potential interactions with other extracellular matrix components (van2018A).
