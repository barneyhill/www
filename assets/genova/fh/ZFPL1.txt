# ZFPL1

## Overview
ZFPL1 (zinc finger protein like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the cis-Golgi apparatus. The ZFPL1 protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs and a RING domain, which suggest its role as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, contributing to protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways. Notably, ZFPL1 is a single transmembrane protein localized to the Golgi complex, where it interacts with the cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130, playing a crucial role in membrane tethering and fusion. The protein is implicated in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, influencing cell growth and proliferation, and is considered to act as an oncogene in endometrial cancer. Its overexpression in cancerous tissues and cell lines highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment (Cai2018RING; Nakamura2011The).

## Structure
The ZFPL1 protein is composed of 310 amino acids and features several distinct structural domains. It includes two zinc finger motifs, specifically C3H and C2HC types, located at amino acids 4-35, which are involved in protein interactions (Cai2018RING). The protein also contains a RING domain spanning amino acids 53-100, which is crucial for its role in promoting cell proliferation, particularly in the endometrial cancer cell line RL95-2. Notably, within the RING domain, the fourth conserved histidine residue is replaced by aspartic acid at the N-terminal, which may influence its function (Cai2018RING).

ZFPL1 has a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) from amino acids 265-287, essential for its localization in the Golgi complex (Cai2018RING). This localization is critical for maintaining the integrity of the cis-Golgi, as ZFPL1 interacts with the C-terminal coiled-coil segment of GM130 via the zinc finger motif (Cai2018RING). The protein's involvement in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is significant, as it upregulates p-Akt308 and p-Akt473 expression while inhibiting PTEN expression, with the RING domain being essential for these functions (Cai2018RING). The study suggests that ZFPL1 may act as an oncogene in endometrial cancer development (Cai2018RING).

## Function
ZFPL1 (zinc finger protein like 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structure and function of the cis-Golgi apparatus in healthy human cells. It is a single transmembrane protein anchored to the cis-Golgi membrane, where it interacts with the cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130 through its zinc finger motif. This interaction is crucial for the integrity of the cis-Golgi and intermediate compartment (IC) membranes, facilitating membrane tethering and fusion (Cai2018RING; Nakamura2011The).

The protein's RING domain is essential for its function, suggesting a potential role as an E3 enzyme in cis-Golgi organization and trafficking (Nakamura2011The). ZFPL1 is involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is critical for cell growth and proliferation. It modulates this pathway by upregulating phosphorylated Akt levels and downregulating PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, thereby promoting cell proliferation (Cai2018RING).

In summary, ZFPL1 is integral to maintaining Golgi structure and function, influencing key cellular processes such as protein trafficking and cell proliferation through its interactions and signaling pathway modulation.

## Clinical Significance
ZFPL1 has been implicated in the progression of endometrial cancer (EC). The gene is overexpressed in EC tissues and the RL95-2 cell line, suggesting its role in cancer development. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, a key pathway in EC pathogenesis. Conversely, knockdown of ZFPL1 suppresses cell proliferation and affects the PI3K/Akt pathway, indicating that ZFPL1 acts as an oncogene in EC (Cai2018RING). The RING domain of ZFPL1 is crucial for its role in promoting cell proliferation and influencing the PI3K/Akt pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cai2018RING). 

Mutations in ZFPL1 have also been observed in uterine corpus endometrial cancer, with 21 mutations identified, suggesting a potential link between these mutations and cancer progression (Cai2018RING). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZFPL1 in endometrial cancer and its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and therapy. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of ZFPL1's involvement in the PI3K/Akt pathway and its function as an E3 enzyme remain unclear, warranting further investigation (Cai2018RING).

## Interactions
ZFPL1 (zinc finger protein like 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to endometrial cancer. One of the key interactions of ZFPL1 is with the cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130. This interaction is facilitated by the zinc finger motif of ZFPL1 and is stabilized by its RING domain. The interaction with GM130 is crucial for maintaining the structure and functional integrity of the cis-Golgi, which is important for the protein's role in cell proliferation and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Cai2018RING).

ZFPL1's involvement in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is further highlighted by its effect on the phosphorylation of Akt. Overexpression of ZFPL1 increases the levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt308 and p-Akt473), while its knockdown results in decreased phosphorylation of these sites. This suggests that ZFPL1 may interact with other proteins within the PI3K/Akt pathway, although the specific molecular mechanisms and interacting partners remain to be fully elucidated (Cai2018RING). The study indicates that ZFPL1 could potentially interact with Golgi scaffold proteins to mediate its effects on this signaling pathway (Cai2018RING).
