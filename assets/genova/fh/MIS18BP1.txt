# MIS18BP1

## Overview
MIS18BP1 is a gene that encodes the protein MIS18 binding protein 1, which is integral to centromere function and chromosome segregation in human cells. The protein is a key component of the Mis18 complex, which also includes Mis18α and Mis18β, and is involved in the recruitment of the CENP-A-specific chaperone HJURP to centromeres. This recruitment is essential for the proper loading of CENP-A nucleosomes, thereby maintaining centromere identity and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Parashara2024PLK1mediated). MIS18 binding protein 1 is phosphorylated by the protein kinase PLK1, which enhances its interaction with PLK1 and is necessary for its recruitment to centromeres (Parashara2024PLK1mediated). This phosphorylation-dependent interaction is crucial for the activation of the Mis18 complex, promoting CENP-A loading and centromere stability (Parashara2024PLK1mediated). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, particularly at centromeric regions, where it plays a pivotal role in ensuring genomic stability by regulating centromere assembly and function (Parashara2024PLK1mediated).

## Function
MIS18BP1 (MIS18 binding protein 1) plays a critical role in centromere function and inheritance in human cells. It is a component of the Mis18 complex, which includes Mis18α and Mis18β, and is essential for the recruitment of the CENP-A-specific chaperone HJURP to centromeres. This recruitment is crucial for the proper loading of CENP-A nucleosomes, which are vital for maintaining centromere identity and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Parashara2024PLK1mediated).

MIS18BP1 is phosphorylated by PLK1 at specific sites, such as T78 and S93, which enhances its interaction with PLK1 and is necessary for its recruitment to centromeres. This phosphorylation is essential for the deposition of CENP-A and the recruitment of HJURP, highlighting the importance of PLK1-mediated phosphorylation in centromere function (Parashara2024PLK1mediated). The interaction between phosphorylated MIS18BP1 and PLK1 facilitates the activation of the Mis18 complex, promoting CENP-A loading and centromere stability (Parashara2024PLK1mediated).

MIS18BP1 is active in the nucleus, particularly at centromeric regions, where it plays a pivotal role in ensuring genomic stability by regulating centromere assembly and function (Parashara2024PLK1mediated).

## Interactions
MIS18BP1, also known as M18BP1 or hKNL2, is a crucial component of the Mis18 complex, which plays a significant role in centromere function and CENP-A deposition. MIS18BP1 interacts with PLK1, a protein kinase, through phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. PLK1 phosphorylates MIS18BP1 at specific residues, including T78 and S93, which are essential for the recruitment of the Mis18 complex to centromeres and the subsequent loading of CENP-A (Parashara2024PLK1mediated). These phosphorylations facilitate the interaction between MIS18BP1 and the Polo-Box Domain (PBD) of PLK1, enhancing the binding affinity and promoting centromere function (Parashara2024PLK1mediated).

MIS18BP1 also interacts with other components of the Mis18 complex, including Mis18α and Mis18β, to recruit the CENP-A specific chaperone HJURP to the centromere. This interaction is crucial for the proper deposition of CENP-A during the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Parashara2024PLK1mediated). The phosphorylation of Mis18α by PLK1 is necessary for activating the Mis18α/β complex, which enhances its interaction with HJURP, further supporting centromere inheritance (Parashara2024PLK1mediated). These interactions underscore the importance of MIS18BP1 in the regulation of centromere assembly and function.
