# IST1

## Overview
IST1 is a gene that encodes the IST1 factor associated with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-III), a crucial component in cellular membrane remodeling processes. The IST1 protein is categorized as a structural protein within the ESCRT-III complex, playing a pivotal role in cytokinesis, endosomal recycling, and autophagy. It interacts with proteins containing microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains, such as VPS4, LIP5, and Spartin, through its C-terminal MIT-interacting motif (MIM), facilitating essential cellular processes like membrane scission and recycling (Agromayor2009Essential; Guo2015Distinct). IST1's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including hearing loss and Alzheimer's disease (Feng2019MAPTTau; SantosCortez2021Identification).

## Structure
The IST1 protein is a component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is involved in membrane remodeling processes. Structurally, IST1 contains a C-terminal MIT-interacting motif (MIM) that is crucial for its function, particularly in binding with MIT domains of proteins such as VPS4, LIP5, and Spartin (Guo2015Distinct). The IST1 protein can form a three-turn α-helix when interacting with these MIT domains, although it is capable of forming a six-turn α-helix in other contexts (Guo2015Distinct). The binding interactions involve specific hydrophobic and polar residues, with key residues like Leu-324, Phe-328, Leu-331, and Arg-327 playing significant roles in these interactions (Guo2015Distinct).

IST1 is known to form oligomers, indicating a quaternary structure, and it may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which contribute to its functional diversity. The IST1 protein's interaction with MIT domains is characterized by distinct binding modes, MIM1 and MIM3, which are determined by specific structural features in both the MIT and MIM sequences (Guo2015Distinct). These interactions are essential for the protein's role in processes like cytokinesis and endosomal sorting.

## Function
The IST1 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including membrane remodeling and trafficking. In healthy human cells, IST1 plays a significant role in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, by localizing to the midbody and facilitating abscission, the separation of daughter cells. This function is mediated through its interactions with proteins containing microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains, such as VPS4, LIP5, and Spartin, via its C-terminal MIT-interacting motif (MIM) (Agromayor2009Essential; Guo2015Distinct).

IST1 is also involved in endosomal recycling, where it forms a co-polymer with CHMP1B, essential for normal-topology membrane remodeling. This interaction is crucial for processes like transferrin receptor recycling, although it is not necessary for cytokinesis or multivesicular body (MVB) sorting (Knyazeva2023Chemogenetic). Additionally, IST1 is implicated in the autophagy-lysosomal system, where it aids in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a process vital for cellular waste degradation (Feng2019MAPTTau). These roles highlight IST1's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell division.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IST1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of hearing loss, a rare deleterious variant in IST1, c.737C>G (p.(Pro246Arg)), has been identified in a patient with profound hearing loss and an enlarged vestibular aqueduct. This variant is associated with poor cochlear implant outcomes, suggesting that IST1 may be a candidate gene for nonsyndromic hearing loss (SantosCortez2021Identification).

In Alzheimer's disease, IST1 plays a crucial role in autophagy, a cellular degradation process. MAPT/tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease leads to a decrease in IST1 expression, disrupting the ESCRT-III complex formation necessary for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This disruption contributes to autophagy deficits and exacerbates neurodegeneration. Overexpression of IST1 has been shown to improve cognitive function and reduce autophagosome accumulation in Alzheimer's models, indicating its potential therapeutic role (Feng2019MAPTTau).

IST1 is also essential for cytokinesis, and its depletion results in multinucleated cells due to failed cell division. This defect highlights IST1's critical role in cell division processes (Agromayor2009Essential). These findings underscore the clinical significance of IST1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
IST1 is a protein that plays a significant role in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, particularly within the ESCRT-III complex. It interacts with several proteins through its C-terminal MIT-interacting motifs (MIMs). IST1 binds to the microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains of proteins such as VPS4, LIP5, and Spartin. These interactions are crucial for processes like cytokinesis and membrane remodeling (Guo2015Distinct).

IST1 also interacts with CHMP1B, forming a complex essential for endosomal recycling and membrane scission. The chemogenetic tool Tantalosin can specifically disrupt the IST1-CHMP1B interaction, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Knyazeva2023Chemogenetic). Additionally, IST1 interacts with CHMP2B and CHMP4B, which are key components of the ESCRT-III complex involved in autophagy and lysosomal degradation (Feng2019MAPTTau).

IST1's interaction with VPS4 is mediated by its MIM motif, which is essential for the disassembly and recycling of ESCRT complexes. This interaction is critical for the final steps of cytokinesis (Agromayor2009Essential). IST1 also recruits the Calpain-7 protease to the midbody during cell division, a process dependent on the binding of IST1's MIM elements to the MIT domains of CAPN7 (Paine2022The).
