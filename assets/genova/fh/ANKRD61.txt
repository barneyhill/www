# ANKRD61

## Overview
ANKRD61 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 61, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. The protein is involved in supporting ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) in regulating ubiquitylation, a key process in cell signaling and protein degradation pathways (Shira2023Advanced). ANKRD61 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, including cancer and neurological disorders, due to its altered expression and genetic variations. Its presence in extracellular vesicles of colon cancer cell lines suggests its potential as a biomarker for cancer detection (Matthiesen2020Extracellular). Additionally, genetic studies have linked ANKRD61 to the modulation of disease onset in X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (Laabs2021Identifying). The gene's expression patterns also vary in conditions such as uterine fibroids, indicating its broader significance in human health (Chuang2023The).

## Structure
ANKRD61, or ankyrin repeat domain 61, is a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs, which are common domains involved in protein-protein interactions. These motifs typically consist of 33-residue sequences that form helix-loop-helix structures, contributing to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures. The ankyrin repeats facilitate the protein's ability to interact with other proteins, which is crucial for its function in various cellular processes (Shira2023Advanced).

The protein's structure may include multiple ankyrin repeats, which are integral to its stability and function. While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of ANKRD61 are not provided in the available literature, the presence of ankyrin repeats suggests a modular architecture that supports diverse protein interactions. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, which can influence its activity and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the current context (Shira2023Advanced).

ANKRD61 is also involved in supporting USP proteins in regulating ubiquitylation, a process critical for cell signaling and protein degradation pathways (Shira2023Advanced). The gene's expression and potential splice variant isoforms could further modulate its functional roles in different tissues or conditions.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ANKRD61 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and genetic variations. In cancer research, ANKRD61 has been identified as a unique protein in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) of colon cancer cell lines, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for tissue-specific cancer detection (Matthiesen2020Extracellular). This highlights its role in the selective protein secretion process associated with cancer progression.

In the context of X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP), a genome-wide association study identified ANKRD61 as one of the genes with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may influence the age at onset of the disease. Specifically, 22 SNPs were situated in the EIF2AK1 and ANKRD61 genes, indicating its potential involvement in modifying the disease's clinical presentation (Laabs2021Identifying).

Additionally, ANKRD61 has been noted for its altered expression in the transcriptomic landscape of uterine fibroids, with significant expression differences observed between racial groups. However, the specific clinical significance of these alterations in relation to uterine fibroids or other diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Chuang2023The).
