# FGFR1

## Overview
The FGFR1 gene encodes the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This receptor is characterized by its complex structure, comprising an extracellular domain with three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. FGFR1 is activated through ligand-induced dimerization, which triggers downstream signaling pathways such as the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, influencing cellular functions and development (Mohammadi2005Structural; Johnson1991The). The receptor is involved in critical physiological processes, including angiogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal differentiation, and its dysregulation is implicated in various pathological conditions, including craniosynostosis, Kallmann syndrome, and several cancers (Xie2020FGF/FGFR; Katoh2016Therapeutics).

## Structure
FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of FGFR1 includes an extracellular domain with three immunoglobulin-like domains (D1, D2, and D3), a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (Belov2013Molecular; Johnson1991The). The secondary structure features beta sheets and alpha helices, particularly in the immunoglobulin-like domains, which belong to the I-set subgroup of the Ig superfamily (Mohammadi2005Structural).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the D2 and D3 domains forming a beta sandwich structure stabilized by a disulfide bridge (Mohammadi2005Structural). The quaternary structure of FGFR1 involves dimerization upon ligand binding, which is crucial for its activation (Goetz2013Exploring).

FGFR1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, which is essential for receptor activation and signal transduction (Mohammadi1996Identification). The receptor exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, particularly in the third immunoglobulin-like domain, resulting in different ligand-binding properties (ClaessonWelsh1999Signal; Johnson1991The). These splice variants include both membrane-anchored and soluble forms, contributing to the receptor's functional diversity (Johnson1991The).

## Function
FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by modulating cell cycle progression. FGFR1 signaling inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 and p27, promoting cell cycle progression and proliferation (Dombrowski2013FGFR1). This signaling pathway involves the activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, which facilitate the degradation of these inhibitors and influence the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a key event in cell cycle progression (Dombrowski2013FGFR1).

FGFR1 is also involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and neuronal differentiation through interactions with G protein-coupled receptors and other receptor tyrosine kinases, influencing cell fate, proliferation, migration, survival, and differentiation of neurons (Xie2020FGF/FGFR). In the context of angiogenesis, FGFR1 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells and plays a significant role in endothelial proliferation and migration, essential for angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (Xie2020FGF/FGFR). FGFR1's interactions with integrins and neural cell adhesion molecules further highlight its importance in maintaining cellular functions and signaling (Xie2020FGF/FGFR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FGFR1 gene are implicated in a variety of diseases and conditions. Germline gain-of-function mutations in FGFR1 are associated with craniosynostosis, a condition characterized by the premature fusion of skull bones (Katoh2016Therapeutics). Postzygotic mosaic gain-of-function mutations in FGFR1 are linked to encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis, which involves brain lipomas, ocular tumors, and cutaneous nevus (Katoh2016Therapeutics). FGFR1 mutations are also associated with Kallmann syndrome (KS) and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH), with heterozygous mutations found in 10% of KS cases and 6% of all CHH individuals (Gach2020Expanding).

In cancer, FGFR1 gene amplifications are prevalent in several types, including breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell lung cancers (Katoh2016Therapeutics; Helsten2015Fibroblast). FGFR1 fusions are found in glioblastoma and myeloproliferative neoplasia (Katoh2016Therapeutics). FGFR1 mutations are significantly associated with midline gliomas, serving as an independent prognostic marker (Picca2018FGFR1). These genetic alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of both cancerous and noncancerous diseases by affecting signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Katoh2016Therapeutics).

## Interactions
FGFR1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling. It forms complexes with fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and heparan sulfate (HS), which are essential for receptor dimerization and activation. The interaction with HS is particularly important, as it facilitates the formation of a ternary complex with FGF1 and FGFR1, supporting a 2:2:2 model of FGF1:HS:FGFR1 (Ibrahimi2004Kinetic; Wu2003The). Heparin, a form of HS, enhances the binding affinity between FGFR1 and FGF2, promoting the formation of a stable ternary complex (Ibrahimi2004Kinetic).

FGFR1 also interacts with signaling proteins such as Frs2, Crk, CrkL, Plcγ, and Grb14. Frs2 binds to the juxtamembrane region of FGFR1 and is phosphorylated, activating the Ras-Erk1/2 signaling cascade and associating with Gab1 to activate PI3K/Akt. Crk and CrkL interact with FGFR1 through phosphorylated Tyr463, mediating cell proliferation via Erk1/2 and Jnk pathways. Plcγ interacts through phosphorylated Tyr766, regulating Ca2+ levels and Pkcδ activity, while Grb14 binds to Tyr766 and Tyr776, inhibiting FGFR1-mediated activation of Plcγ (Brewer2015Fgfr1).

Additionally, FGFR1 interacts with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), where NCAM's F3 modules bind to FGFR1's Ig modules, promoting axonal outgrowth. ATP can inhibit this interaction, suggesting a regulatory mechanism (Kiselyov2003Structural).
