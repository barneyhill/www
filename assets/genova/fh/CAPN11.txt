# CAPN11

## Overview
CAPN11 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 11, a member of the calpain family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. Calpain 11 is characterized by its proteolytic activity, which is regulated by calcium binding, facilitated by EF-hand motifs within its structure. The gene is highly conserved across species, suggesting its evolutionary importance and functional significance. Calpain 11 shares significant sequence homology with other calpains, such as CAPN1 and CAPN2, and is considered the human orthologue of chicken /m calpain (Dear1999CAPN11:). The protein's interactions with calpastatin and CAPNS1 are crucial for its regulation, with evolutionary adaptations observed in eutherian mammals (Macqueen2010A). These interactions underscore the protein's role in cellular processes, potentially implicating it in various physiological and pathological contexts.

## Structure
The CAPN11 protein is a member of the calpain family, characterized by its calcium-dependent cysteine protease activity. It has a predicted molecular weight of approximately 80 kDa and consists of 702 amino acids. The protein is organized into four domains, with Domain II exhibiting features typical of a protease domain. The active site of CAPN11 includes the conserved residues Cys102, His259, and Asn283, which are characteristic of cysteine proteases (Dear1999CAPN11:).

CAPN11 also contains conserved sequences for calcium-binding, similar to those found in CAPN2, indicating the presence of EF-hand motifs that facilitate calcium interaction. The gene structure of CAPN11 is highly conserved, with 21 translated exons that maintain identical splicing phases, predominantly phase III. This conservation extends to the exons encoding the five EF-hand motifs, which are crucial for the protein's calcium-binding capability (Hata2001Both).

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that CAPN11 is closely related to CAPN1 and CAPN2 among mammalian calpains, and it shows significant sequence homology to chicken /m calpain, suggesting it may be the human orthologue of this protein (Dear1999CAPN11:). The protein's structure and function are influenced by its conserved domains and active site residues, which are essential for its proteolytic activity.

## Interactions
CAPN11, a member of the calpain family, exhibits specific interactions with other proteins, particularly calpastatin (CAST) and CAPNS1. These interactions are crucial for its function and regulation. The study of CAPN11 through protein homology modeling, based on the crystal structure of the rat CAPN2-CAPNS1 complex bound to an inhibitory domain of CAST, has revealed significant insights into these interactions. In eutherian CAPN11, type II residue replacements have led to radical changes in its interaction with CAST4, a variant of calpastatin, and to a lesser extent, with CAPNS1. These alterations are conserved in both rat and ancestral eutherian CAPN11, indicating that the original type II fixations in the eutherian stem have remained largely unchanged through evolution (Macqueen2010A).

The interactions between CAPN11 and CAST4 involve residue-residue interactions at the interface, which have been conserved between pretherian orthologues and CAPN2. Despite modifications in eutherian CAPN11, critical interactions with the protease core and active-site cleft remain unaffected, suggesting that while the overall stability of the interaction may be altered, essential functional aspects are preserved (Macqueen2010A). These findings highlight the evolutionary divergence and functional constraints of CAPN11 in different vertebrate lineages.
