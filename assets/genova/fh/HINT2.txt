# HINT2

## Overview
HINT2, or histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 2, is a gene located on chromosome 9p13.2 that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme belonging to the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily. The protein encoded by HINT2 is characterized by a conserved His-X-His-X-His-XX motif and functions primarily within the mitochondria, where it plays a pivotal role in regulating energy metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics. As a mitochondrial enzyme, HINT2 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of supercomplexes within the electron transport chain, thereby facilitating efficient ATP production. The protein's structure includes a nucleotide-binding fold, and it forms a homodimer that is essential for its enzymatic activity. HINT2's interactions with cardiolipin and the mitochondrial stress-70 protein, GRP75, underscore its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy balance. Its downregulation has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Dolot2013Expression; Li2017HINT2; Rajasekaran2018The).

## Structure
The human HINT2 protein is a member of the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily, characterized by a conserved His-X-His-X-His-XX motif. It is a mitochondrial enzyme with a molecular weight of 16.9 kDa, encoded by the HINT2 gene located on chromosome 9p13.2, and consists of 163 amino acids (Dolot2013Expression; Dolot2021Biochemical). The protein's structure includes a nucleotide-binding fold, classified as an alpha-beta meander, which is conserved across HIT proteins. This fold comprises a helix (a1) and three anti-parallel beta-strands (b1-b3) forming part of a curved beta-sheet, followed by a long alpha-helix (a2) and additional beta-strands and helices (b4, a3, b5) completing the monomer fold (Maize2013Structural).

HINT2 forms a homodimer with extensive contacts between a2 helices and b4 sheets, creating a crescent-shaped ten-stranded beta-sheet. The nucleotide-binding site is located on the outer face of this molecular crescent (Maize2013Structural). The protein exhibits higher adenosine phosphoramidase activity compared to its homolog HINT1, and its mutation results in a loss of this activity (Dolot2013Expression). The catalytic histidine, His149, adopts different conformations in the two monomers, which may be relevant to its function in catalysis (Maize2013Structural).

## Function
HINT2, or histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 2, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the mitochondria of hepatocytes, where it influences mitochondrial bioenergetics and oxidative phosphorylation. HINT2 enhances the assembly and stabilization of supercomplexes within the electron transport chain, which are essential for efficient ATP production (Rajasekaran2018The). The protein interacts with cardiolipin and the mitochondrial stress-70 protein, GRP75, facilitating the assembly of respiratory chain supercomplexes and maintaining mitochondrial function (Rajasekaran2018The).

HINT2 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption rates, which are critical for energy production and cellular respiration (Rajasekaran2018The). Its absence leads to impaired fatty acid β-oxidation and reduced ATP production, highlighting its role in energy balance and mitochondrial adaptability (Rajasekaran2018The). HINT2 also influences NAD homeostasis, which is vital for various metabolic pathways, including those involved in β-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Fan2020Overexpression). Overall, HINT2 is essential for maintaining normal mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, preventing metabolic disorders in healthy cells.

## Clinical Significance
HINT2 downregulation is significantly associated with the progression and metastasis of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Studies have shown that HINT2 expression is lower in primary and metastatic CRC tissues compared to normal colorectal tissues. This downregulation is linked to advanced tumor stages and is believed to be caused by methylation of the HINT2 gene promoter. The reduced expression of HINT2 enhances tumor migration and invasion, promoting metastasis through mechanisms involving the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mediated by hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-2α and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) (Li2017HINT2).

HINT2 downregulation also correlates with increased expression of ZEB1, which suppresses CDH1 transcription, a key epithelial marker in EMT. This suggests that HINT2 may regulate EMT by downregulating ZEB1, thereby impacting CRC metastasis. Experiments have demonstrated that HINT2 knockdown increases cell migration and invasion, while its overexpression has the opposite effect, indicating its potential as a clinical biomarker for CRC progression and metastasis risk (Li2017HINT2).

In addition to its role in CRC, HINT2 is downregulated in hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinomas, where its absence can lead to bioenergetic deficits and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes (Dolot2021Biochemical).

## Interactions
HINT2 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. It directly interacts with glucose-regulated protein 75 kDa (GRP75), a mitochondrial stress-70 protein, in a nucleotide-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of respiratory chain supercomplexes, particularly involving cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4, suggesting a regulatory role in mitochondrial respiration (Rajasekaran2018The). HINT2 also binds to cardiolipin, a phospholipid associated with mitochondrial membranes, which positions it near complex IV and cytochrome c, further implicating it in mitochondrial bioenergetics (Rajasekaran2018The).

In terms of nucleotide interactions, HINT2 has been shown to bind with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), influencing NAD levels in mitochondria. This interaction is characterized by specific binding kinetics, suggesting a role in NAD synthesis pathways (Fan2020Overexpression). Additionally, HINT2 forms a homodimer in solution and interacts with nucleotides like AMP and GMP, with a preference for GMP, indicating its involvement in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (Maize2013Structural; Dolot2021Biochemical). These interactions highlight HINT2's potential as a sensor of energy demand and its influence on mitochondrial adaptability.
