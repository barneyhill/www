# S1PR4

## Overview
S1PR4, or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various cellular signaling pathways. This receptor is part of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor family, which plays a crucial role in immune system regulation and cell motility. S1PR4 is predominantly expressed in lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues, where it influences immune cell trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics by interacting with specific G-protein subunits, such as Ga i and Ga 12/13 (Gräler2003The). The receptor's ability to mediate immune cell migration and its involvement in inflammatory responses underscore its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cancer (Suh2018Sphingosine1Phosphate; Xiong2019CD4).

## Function
S1PR4 (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in cell signaling and motility, particularly within the immune system. It specifically binds sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and is predominantly expressed in lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues. S1PR4 is involved in the regulation of cell shape and motility by coupling with G-protein subunits Ga i and Ga 12/13, leading to the activation of the small GTPase Rho. This activation results in cytoskeletal rearrangements, such as stress fiber formation and cell rounding, which are crucial for cell movement and shape changes (Gräler2003The).

In the context of immune cell trafficking, S1PR4 is essential for the migration of CD4 T cells into lymphatic vessels and draining lymph nodes. It regulates transendothelial migration (TEM) and interacts with vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), influencing the distance and velocity of T cell migration. This receptor is crucial for T cell movement in response to S1P gradients, which is vital for immune surveillance and response (Xiong2019CD4). S1PR4's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining immune system function and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
S1PR4 (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), S1PR4 expression is significantly upregulated in patients with moderate to severe disease, particularly in those with ulcerative colitis. This upregulation is associated with the severity of the disease, suggesting that S1PR4 may serve as a biomarker for severe IBD (Suh2018Sphingosine1Phosphate). The receptor is predominantly expressed in immune cells, such as T cells and dendritic cells, where it modulates cytokine production, including IL-17 and IL-27, which are involved in inflammatory responses (Suh2018Sphingosine1Phosphate).

In the context of cancer, S1PR4 has been mentioned in relation to breast cancer prognosis, indicating its potential role in disease progression (Meacci2019S1P/S1P). Although the specific mechanisms are not fully understood, the expression of S1PR4 in immune cells and its involvement in cytokine regulation suggest that it may influence tumor microenvironments and immune responses in cancer.

While S1PR4's role in multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases is acknowledged, specific mutations or expression alterations in S1PR4 related to these conditions are not detailed in the provided context (McGinley2021Sphingosine).

## Interactions
S1PR4, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor, is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with specific G-protein subunits to mediate various cellular responses. It selectively couples with the G-protein subunits Ga i and Ga 12/13, but not with Ga q or Ga s, indicating a specific interaction profile that influences downstream signaling pathways (Gräler2003The). This coupling leads to the activation of the small GTPase Rho, which is associated with cytoskeletal rearrangements and changes in cell shape and motility (Gräler2003The).

S1PR4 also plays a role in immune cell trafficking, particularly in the migration of CD4 T cells and peritoneal B1 B cells. It regulates T cell migration through interactions with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), affecting migration distances and velocities (Xiong2019CD4). In inflammatory conditions, S1PR4 is involved in the chemotactic response of peritoneal B cells, influencing their migration and localization within secondary lymphoid organs (Riese2021Sphingosine1Phosphate). These interactions highlight S1PR4's role in modulating immune responses and cell motility through specific protein interactions.
