# GSTA2

## Overview
GSTA2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase alpha 2, a member of the alpha class of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). These enzymes are pivotal in the detoxification processes within the body, particularly in the liver, where they catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of electrophilic compounds, aiding in their solubilization and excretion. The protein encoded by GSTA2 functions as a dimer and is characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain with a thioredoxin-like fold and a C-terminal domain composed of alpha-helices, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Frova2006Glutathione; Oakley2011Glutathione). GSTA2 plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by reducing organic hydroperoxides to alcohols, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis and mitigating oxidative damage (Tetlow2004Functional). The enzyme's activity is significant in the metabolism of various compounds, including bilirubin and steroid hormones, and its expression levels have been linked to cancer susceptibility and progression (Coles2005Human; Gaspar2009The).

## Structure
GSTA2, a member of the Alpha class glutathione S-transferases, is characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain with a thioredoxin-like fold and a C-terminal domain composed of alpha-helices. These domains are crucial for its function, with the N-terminal domain involved in glutathione binding and the C-terminal domain forming the hydrophobic substrate binding site (Frova2006Glutathione; Oakley2011Glutathione). The protein functions as a dimer, which is essential for its catalytic activity, as each subunit contains independent catalytic sites (Frova2006Glutathione).

The primary structure of GSTA2 includes specific amino acid residues that influence its substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency. For instance, differences in the H-site contribute to its ability to reduce cumene hydroperoxide (Frova2006Glutathione). The protein's structure has been studied using crystallography, with a PDB ID of 2VCT and a resolution of 2.1 Å, indicating high similarity to predicted structures (Oakley2023Hidden).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation may affect GSTA2's activity and stability, although specific modifications for GSTA2 are not detailed in the provided context. Splice variants can lead to different isoforms, potentially altering the enzyme's function (Oakley2023Hidden).

## Function
The GSTA2 gene encodes for an enzyme that is part of the alpha class of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which are crucial for detoxifying a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds. This enzyme catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to electrophilic substances, facilitating their solubilization and excretion, primarily in the liver (Board2013Glutathione; Gaspar2009The). GSTA2 plays a significant role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by reducing organic hydroperoxides to alcohols, a process that is particularly important in the liver, the main site for drug and xenobiotic detoxification (Tetlow2004Functional).

GSTA2 is involved in the metabolism of various compounds, including bilirubin, bile acids, and steroid hormones, and is a major line of defense against oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (Gaspar2009The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for mitigating oxidative damage and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It also contributes to the detoxification of alkylating agents and other harmful compounds, thereby protecting cells from genotoxic effects (Board2013Glutathione; Xie2005Overexpression). GSTA2's expression is notably high in the liver, where it supports the detoxification processes essential for organismal health (Ng2021Glutathione).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GSTA2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. The P110S polymorphism in GSTA2, which results in a serine substitution, significantly affects the enzyme's activity with substrates like cumene hydroperoxide. This diminished activity may impact physiological functions such as prostaglandin synthesis, potentially influencing drug metabolism and disease etiology, particularly in the liver (Tetlow2004Functional).

Increased expression of GSTA2 has been observed in colorectal and lung cancer, suggesting a role in tumor biology (Coles2005Human). Conversely, decreased expression is noted in stomach and liver tumors, indicating that GSTA2 expression levels may influence cancer susceptibility and progression (Coles2005Human).

The loss of the Nrf2 transcription factor, which regulates GSTA2 expression, leads to reduced detoxification capacity and increased sensitivity to carcinogens in mice. This suggests that alterations in GSTA2 expression due to Nrf2 loss could contribute to increased vulnerability to chemical and oxidative stress-related conditions (CHANAS2002Loss).

Despite these associations, studies have found no significant link between GSTA2 polymorphisms and breast cancer susceptibility in certain populations, indicating that the role of GSTA2 in cancer may be complex and context-dependent (Gaspar2009The).
