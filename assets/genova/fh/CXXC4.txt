# CXXC4

## Overview
CXXC4 is a gene that encodes the CXXC finger protein 4, also known as Idax, which is characterized by a CXXC-type zinc finger domain. This domain is essential for the protein's ability to bind DNA, particularly at unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, implicating it in processes related to DNA methylation and demethylation (Han2017CXXC4). Functionally, CXXC4 is involved in the negative regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, acting as a tumor suppressor by interacting with Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins to stabilize the β-catenin destruction complex (Lu2013Enhancer). The protein's interactions extend to TET2, a key player in DNA demethylation, where it modulates TET2 levels through a proteasome-dependent mechanism (Ko2013Modulation). CXXC4's role in various cancers, including breast, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinoma, underscores its clinical significance, particularly in the context of tumor suppression and potential therapeutic targeting (Fu2020Downregulation; Liu2020Dermatopontin; Lu2013Enhancer).

## Structure
CXXC4, also known as CXXC finger protein 4 or Idax, contains a CXXC-type zinc finger domain, which is crucial for its DNA-binding capability. This domain allows CXXC4 to bind DNA sequences with unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, suggesting a role in DNA methylation and demethylation processes (Han2017CXXC4). The protein is involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway by interacting with Dishevelled (Dvl), a key component of the pathway. This interaction is essential for its function as a tumor suppressor, as it disrupts the association of Dvl with Axin-GSK-3β, leading to the degradation of β-catenin (Lu2013Enhancer).

CXXC4 is also known to stabilize the destruction complex of β-catenin by binding to Dvl, with specific amino acid residues, K161 and T162, being critical for this interaction and its growth inhibitory effects (Lu2013Enhancer). The protein's structure and function may be influenced by post-translational modifications and splice variants, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the available context. The gene is located on chromosome 4q24, and its deletion has been observed in various cancers, indicating its potential role in cancer development (Lu2013Enhancer).

## Function
CXXC4, also known as CXXC finger protein 4 or Idax, plays a significant role in regulating gene expression and cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it binds to non-modified CpG islands (CGIs) and promoters via its CXXC domain. This domain is crucial for its DNA binding ability, allowing CXXC4 to recruit other proteins, such as TET2, to specific DNA regions, potentially influencing gene expression (Liu2020Structural).

In the nucleus, CXXC4 enhances the interaction of the transcription factor Sp1 with the promoter of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), stimulating its transcription. This activity is associated with the induction of apoptosis, particularly in the context of cancer, but it also suggests a role in regulating cell growth and death in normal cells (Han2017CXXC4).

CXXC4 is also involved in the negative regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It interacts with Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins, stabilizing the destruction complex of β-catenin, which prevents its accumulation in the cytoplasm and subsequent translocation into the nucleus. This action inhibits the transcription of Wnt target genes, which are involved in cell proliferation (Lu2013Enhancer).

## Clinical Significance
CXXC4, also known as CXXC finger protein 4, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In breast cancer, downregulation of CXXC4 is linked to increased tumorigenicity and resistance to tamoxifen, a common endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. This resistance is associated with the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, leading to increased expression of proteins like β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-myc, which promote cell proliferation and survival (Fu2020Downregulation).

In gastric cancer, CXXC4 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting Wnt signaling. Its downregulation, often mediated by EZH2, results in the activation of Wnt signaling, contributing to cancer progression. This downregulation is associated with poor outcomes in gastric cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Lu2013Enhancer).

CXXC4 mutations have also been implicated in the progression of severe congenital neutropenia to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations lead to increased CXXC4 protein levels and reduced TET2 protein levels, fostering an inflammatory state that drives leukemic progression (Olofsen2020Malignant).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, CXXC4 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its overexpression inhibiting cell growth and Wnt signaling, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2020Dermatopontin).

## Interactions
CXXC4, also known as Idax, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the TET2 protein, a key player in DNA demethylation, by binding to its catalytic domain. This interaction leads to the downregulation of TET2 protein levels through a proteasome-dependent mechanism involving caspase activation (Ko2013Modulation). The CXXC domain of CXXC4 is crucial for its DNA-binding activity, which is necessary for the degradation of TET2 protein (Ko2013Modulation).

CXXC4 also interacts with Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins, inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction occurs through the PDZ domain of Dvl, affecting processes such as osteoblast differentiation and embryonic kidney development (Xiong2018CXXC5:). In gastric cancer, CXXC4 disrupts the association of Dvl with the Axin-GSK-3β complex, leading to the activation of GSK-3β and promoting the degradation of β-catenin (Lu2013Enhancer).

CXXC4's DNA-binding ability is also involved in enhancing the interaction of the transcription factor Sp1 with the promoter of GDF15, stimulating its transcription and inducing apoptosis in gastric cancer cells (Liu2020Structural; Han2017CXXC4).
