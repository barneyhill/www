# TMEM67

## Overview
TMEM67 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 67, also known as meckelin, which is integral to ciliary function and signaling pathways in human cells. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in ciliogenesis and the regulation of Wnt signaling. Structurally, TMEM67 comprises several domains, including a cysteine-rich repeat region and multiple transmembrane domains, which facilitate its function in the ciliary transition zone. The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage, resulting in distinct functional isoforms that contribute to ciliary structure and signaling. Mutations in the TMEM67 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, such as Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Joubert syndrome, underscoring its critical role in human development and health (Abdelhamed2013Variable; Ahmed2024Two).

## Structure
TMEM67, also known as meckelin, is a transmembrane protein involved in ciliary function and signaling pathways. The human TMEM67 protein consists of 995 amino acids and includes several distinct domains: a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich repeat region, three transmembrane domains, and a coiled-coil domain (Lee2017Functional). The cysteine-rich domain (CRD) at the N-terminus is homologous to those found in Frizzled family receptors and ROR family receptor tyrosine kinases, which are involved in Wnt signaling pathways (Ahmed2024Two; Dawe2006The).

The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage by the metalloproteinase ADAMTS9, resulting in two functional isoforms: a C-terminal portion that localizes to the ciliary transition zone and a non-cleaved form that regulates Wnt signaling (Ahmed2024Two). The cleavage occurs at two highly conserved sites in the extracellular domain, located at K331-F332 and N342-F343, which are essential for ciliary structure and function (Ahmed2024Two).

The tertiary structure of TMEM67 includes a cytoplasmic coiled-coil domain in the C-terminus, which is important for protein interactions and dimerization (Ahmed2024Two). The quaternary structure is characterized by a homodimeric formation with four dimerization interfaces, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (Ahmed2024Two).

## Function
TMEM67, also known as meckelin, is a protein that plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis and Wnt signaling in healthy human cells. It is a component of the Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) module at the ciliary transition zone (TZ), which acts as a diffusion barrier essential for ciliogenesis. TMEM67 undergoes proteolytic cleavage by the metalloproteinase ADAMTS9, resulting in two functional forms: a C-terminal fragment and a full-length non-cleaved form. The C-terminal fragment localizes to the ciliary TZ and is vital for the assembly of the TZ necklace and the MKS/B9 module, which are critical for proper ciliary targeting and function (Ahmed2024Two).

The full-length form of TMEM67 is involved in regulating Wnt signaling pathways. It binds to Wnt5a and forms a complex with ROR2, a co-receptor for non-canonical Wnt signaling, which is crucial for balanced signaling during development (Ahmed2024Two). TMEM67's cysteine-rich domain at its N-terminus is homologous to domains in Frizzled family receptors, which are involved in Wnt ligand binding and signaling modulation (Ahmed2024Two). Mutations in TMEM67 can lead to ciliopathies, highlighting its essential role in human development and health (Ahmed2024Two).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM67 gene, also known as meckelin, are implicated in several ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome (JS), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), COACH syndrome, and nephronophthisis (NPH). These conditions often involve multiorgan dysfunction due to defects in primary cilia, which are crucial for cellular signaling pathways (Otto2009Hypomorphic; Bui2020Novel).

In Joubert syndrome, TMEM67 mutations are associated with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, developmental delays, and the characteristic "molar tooth sign" on MRI. These mutations are a common genetic cause of JS, particularly in patients with liver disease and coloboma, accounting for a significant proportion of cases with kidney disease but not retinal degeneration (Vilboux2017Molecular).

COACH syndrome, a subtype of JS, is characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, coloboma, and congenital hepatic fibrosis. TMEM67 mutations are a major cause of this syndrome, found in a significant percentage of affected families (Brancati2009MKS3TMEM67mutations; Doherty2009Mutations).

In Meckel-Gruber syndrome, TMEM67 mutations lead to severe developmental abnormalities, including central nervous system malformations and multicystic kidneys. These mutations are responsible for a subset of MKS cases (Baala2007The; Iannicelli2010NovelTMEM67mutations).

## Interactions
TMEM67, also known as meckelin, is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its role in ciliogenesis and signaling pathways. TMEM67 interacts with Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1), a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of Dvl-1 at the basal body, which is necessary for normal Wnt/β-catenin signaling. A pathogenic in-frame deletion mutation (p.919delF) in TMEM67 disrupts this interaction, leading to deregulated signaling and contributing to ciliopathy phenotypes such as Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) and Joubert syndrome (JBTS) (Abdelhamed2013Variable).

TMEM67 also forms part of the Meckel-Gruber syndrome protein complex, interacting with MKS1 and CC2D2A. These interactions are vital for the formation and function of the primary cilium, as they are involved in the assembly of the ciliary transition zone (TZ) and the MKS/B9 module, which are essential for ciliary trafficking and signaling (Ahmed2024Two; Dawe2006The).

Additionally, TMEM67 undergoes proteolytic cleavage by the metalloproteinase ADAMTS9, resulting in two functional forms that localize differently and have distinct roles in ciliogenesis and Wnt signaling (Ahmed2024Two). These interactions and modifications highlight TMEM67's central role in maintaining ciliary structure and function.
