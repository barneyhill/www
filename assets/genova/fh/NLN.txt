# NLN

## Overview
The NLN gene encodes the protein neurolysin, a zinc metallopeptidase involved in the degradation of neuropeptides and mitochondrial peptides. Neurolysin is primarily localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it plays a crucial role in processing mitochondrial targeting peptides, thereby maintaining mitochondrial function and protein homeostasis. Structurally, neurolysin is characterized by a complex molecular architecture, including a conserved HExxH zinc-binding motif essential for its catalytic activity, and a prolate ellipsoid shape that facilitates substrate specificity. Functionally, neurolysin is implicated in the degradation of amyloid-beta peptides, potentially influencing Alzheimer's disease pathology, and inactivating neuropeptides such as neurotensin, bradykinin, and substance P, which are vital for neurotransmission and gastrointestinal functions. The protein's interactions with mitochondrial proteins and its involvement in the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes underscore its importance in cellular metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases like acute myeloid leukemia (Mirali2020Thea; Teixeira2018Mechanism; Checler2018Neurolysin:).

## Structure
Neurolysin (NLN) is a zinc metallopeptidase with a complex molecular structure that facilitates its role in neuropeptide metabolism. The primary structure of NLN consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which includes a conserved HExxH zinc-binding motif crucial for its catalytic activity (Shi2024Structural; Teixeira2018Mechanism). 

The secondary structure of NLN is predominantly α-helical, with a small percentage of β secondary structure elements. It features a three-helix bundle and a series of long helices that form the walls of a deep channel, which is a defining characteristic of its tertiary structure (Brown2001Structure). This channel restricts substrate access, allowing only small, unstructured peptides to reach the active site (Brown2001Structure).

NLN's tertiary structure is described as a prolate ellipsoid shape, with two major domains enclosing a narrow catalytic channel. This structure is crucial for its function, as it allows the enzyme to accommodate diverse peptide substrates without significant conformational changes (Shi2024Structural; Teixeira2018Mechanism). The protein may also form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, although specific details on this aspect are limited in the provided context.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are common in NLN, although specific sites and effects are not detailed in the context provided.

## Function
Neurolysin (NLN) is a zinc metallopeptidase that plays a significant role in the degradation of neuropeptides and mitochondrial peptides, contributing to various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it is involved in the processing and maturation of mitochondrial proteins by cleaving mitochondrial targeting peptides (mTPs). This activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and protein homeostasis, as the accumulation of mTPs can lead to detrimental effects such as dissipation of membrane potential and aberrant protein processing (Teixeira2018Mechanism).

NLN also participates in the degradation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. It works in conjunction with other peptidases to degrade Aβ fragments, potentially reducing aggregation and maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Teixeira2018Mechanism). In addition to its mitochondrial functions, NLN is involved in the inactivation of neuropeptides like neurotensin, bradykinin, and substance P, which are important for neurotransmission and gastrointestinal functions (Al‐Ahmad2021Neurolysin; Checler2018Neurolysin:). Through these activities, NLN plays a protective role in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the neurolysin (NLN) gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), NLN is overexpressed in approximately 41% of cases. This overexpression is associated with increased formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes (RCS), which are crucial for oxidative metabolism in leukemic cells. Inhibition of NLN has been shown to selectively impair the growth and viability of AML cells and stem cells, while sparing normal hematopoietic cells, suggesting that NLN could be a potential therapeutic target in AML (Mirali2020The).

In the context of entropion in domestic sheep, a genome-wide association study identified a significant SNP near the NLN gene, suggesting a genetic basis for this condition. The study indicates that NLN may be involved in conditions related to energy metabolism and inflammatory responses, potentially through its role in the angiotensin-(1-7), MAS1 pathway and its impact on neurotensin activity (Mousel2015GenomeWide).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of NLN in both hematological malignancies and genetic conditions affecting physical development, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Neurolysin (NLN) is a mitochondrial peptidase that interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes (RCS) essential for oxidative metabolism. NLN interacts with mitochondrial proteins such as LETM1 and BCS1L, which are involved in RCS assembly and mitochondrial cristae formation. These interactions are vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, where NLN is necessary for cell viability (Mirali2020Thea).

NLN's interaction with LETM1 is significant for the assembly of LETM1 complexes, which are crucial for RCS formation. Inhibition of NLN disrupts these complexes, impairing oxidative phosphorylation and selectively affecting AML cells (Mirali2020Thea). Additionally, NLN has been shown to interact with a network of proteases, including presequence protease (PreP or PITRM1), to degrade mitochondrial presequence peptides and other fragments, highlighting its role in mitochondrial peptide degradation (Teixeira2018Mechanism).

These interactions underscore NLN's importance in mitochondrial function and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases like AML, where its inhibition can reduce leukemic cell growth and viability (Mirali2020Thea).
