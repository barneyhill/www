# GNG14

## Overview
GNG14 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit gamma 14, a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction. These proteins are critical for transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors, thereby influencing various cellular responses. The G protein subunit gamma 14 is categorized as a signaling protein, and its function is integral to the formation of a functional heterotrimeric complex with other G protein subunits. This complex is essential for the proper relay of signals within cells. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, which are crucial for its membrane localization and activity. Mutations and alterations in the expression of GNG14 have been implicated in several diseases, including melanoma, highlighting its potential significance in clinical research and therapeutic development (Ferreira2022Characterization; Riaz2011New).

## Structure
GNG14 encodes the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which play a crucial role in signal transduction. The primary structure of GNG14 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its function and interactions. The secondary structure of this protein may include elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules and its role in cellular signaling pathways. In terms of quaternary structure, GNG14 interacts with other G protein subunits to form a functional heterotrimeric complex, which is vital for its role in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors.

Post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, are significant for GNG14 as they influence its membrane localization and functional activity. Prenylation involves the addition of lipid groups to the protein, which facilitates its attachment to cell membranes, thereby affecting its interaction with other proteins and its overall function in signal transduction pathways. These structural and functional characteristics underscore the importance of GNG14 in cellular communication and response mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
The GNG14 gene, which encodes a subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In a study characterizing whole exomes from the Arabian Peninsula, GNG14 was identified as having potentially pathogenic non-synonymous variants. These variants are predicted to be involved in signaling pathways, although the specific clinical significance of these mutations remains unclear (Ferreira2022Characterization).

In the context of melanoma, GNG14 was among the G protein subunits found to have nonsynonymous somatic mutations in a high-throughput sequencing study. This study identified mutations across several genes, including GNG14, in cutaneous melanomas, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis. However, the specific impact of GNG14 mutations on melanoma progression or treatment response has not been detailed (Riaz2011New).

Overall, while GNG14 is associated with signaling pathways and has been identified in studies of genetic variants and melanoma, the precise clinical implications of its mutations and expression changes require further investigation to establish their role in disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targeting.
