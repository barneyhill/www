# FCRL6

## Overview
FCRL6, or Fc receptor-like 6, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein known as Fc receptor-like 6. This protein is primarily expressed on mature cytotoxic lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and certain T-cell subsets, and is characterized by three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a cytoplasmic tail with signaling motifs. Unlike classical Fc receptors, FCRL6 does not bind immunoglobulins but interacts with MHC class II molecules, specifically HLA-DR, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses. The protein's cytoplasmic tail contains both immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and noncanonical activation motifs, which are involved in recruiting phosphatases and other signaling molecules, indicating its potential function as an immune checkpoint regulator. FCRL6 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including chronic immune disorders and cancer, where its expression is associated with immune evasion and resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapies (Davis2020Roles; Johnson2018Tumorspecific; Schreeder2010Cutting).

## Structure
The FCRL6 protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein characterized by three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, an uncharged transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domains are of the immunoglobulin C-type, with the first and second domains showing homology to the second and third domains of FcγRI, sharing 42% sequence identity (Davis2007Fc; Wilson2007FcRL6). The cytoplasmic tail contains several signaling motifs, including a consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and a noncanonical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), with tyrosine residues Y371 and Y356 playing crucial roles in signaling (Davis2020Roles; Kulemzin2011FCRL6). 

FCRL6 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct extracellular and intracellular domains. The v1 isoform is the longest, while others like FCRL6v2 and FCRL6v3 have variations in domain composition and cytoplasmic tail structure (Kulemzin2011FCRL6). The protein's cytoplasmic tail also features a proline-rich segment and a C-terminus with CxxxxC motifs, suggesting potential metal-ion-binding capabilities (Wilson2007FcRL6). Despite its structural features, FCRL6 does not function as an Ig-binding protein (Davis2007Fc).

## Function
FCRL6 is a receptor primarily expressed on mature cytotoxic lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and certain T-cell subsets, such as CD8+ T cells and γδ T cells. It is associated with the expression of perforin, a protein involved in the cytotoxic activity of these cells, indicating its role in immune responses (Davis2020Roles; Schreeder2008FCRL6). FCRL6 is characterized by three extracellular Ig-like domains and a cytoplasmic tail containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which recruits SHP-2 phosphatase, suggesting an inhibitory role in cytotoxic lymphocytes (Davis2020Roles; Kulemzin2011FCRL6).

FCRL6 does not bind immunoglobulins, unlike classical Fc receptors, but it interacts with MHC class II molecules, specifically HLA-DR, on antigen-presenting cells. This interaction implies a role in modulating the relationship between cytotoxic lymphocytes and MHCII-expressing cells, potentially influencing immune response regulation (Schreeder2010Cutting). Despite its structural features suggesting a regulatory function, FCRL6's precise biological role in healthy human cells remains unclear, as its engagement does not significantly affect cytokine production or cytotoxic activity in vitro (Wilson2007FcRL6).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FCRL6 gene have been associated with several diseases, particularly those involving chronic immune stimulation and cancer. In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), FCRL6 is notably upregulated, marking an expansion of cytotoxic lymphocyte subsets, including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells. This upregulation may reflect chronic immune activation and contribute to effector cell dysfunction, potentially indicating a blunted capacity for disease clearance (Davis2020Roles; Schreeder2008FCRL6).

In the context of cancer, FCRL6 expression is elevated in certain tumor microenvironments, such as melanoma, breast, and lung cancers, particularly in patients who have relapsed after PD-1 blockade therapy. This suggests a role for FCRL6 in adaptive resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Davis2020Roles; Johnson2018Tumorspecific). FCRL6's interaction with MHCII molecules can inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity, indicating its function as an immune checkpoint that tumors may exploit to evade immune responses (Davis2020Roles; Johnson2018Tumorspecific).

Additionally, FCRL6 gene variants have been studied in the context of rheumatoid arthritis, with certain polymorphisms potentially influencing disease risk based on age and gender (Yang2021Fc).

## Interactions
FCRL6 interacts with several proteins through its cytoplasmic tail, which contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). These motifs are crucial for recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1, SHP-2, SHIP-1, and SHIP-2. The interaction with SHP-1 and SHP-2 is dependent on the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue Y371, while SHIP-1 requires Y356, and SHIP-2 requires both Y356 and Y371 (Kulemzin2011FCRL6; Wilson2007FcRL6). The adaptor protein Grb2 also associates with FCRL6, relying on the Y356 residue (Kulemzin2011FCRL6).

FCRL6 is known to bind to MHC class II molecules, specifically HLA-DR, on antigen-presenting cells. This interaction is significant in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of tumor immunology and chronic immune disorders (Davis2020Roles; Schreeder2010Cutting). The binding of FCRL6 to HLA-DR can inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity, suggesting a role as an immune checkpoint inhibitor (Davis2020Roles). These interactions highlight FCRL6's potential as a regulatory molecule in immune signaling pathways, influencing both inhibitory and modulatory functions in immune cells.
