# EIF6

## Overview
EIF6, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6, is a gene that encodes a pivotal protein involved in the regulation of ribosome assembly and translation initiation. The EIF6 protein functions as a ribosomal anti-association factor, binding to the 60S ribosomal subunit to prevent its premature association with the 40S subunit, thereby regulating the formation of active 80S ribosomes essential for protein synthesis (Benelli2008Function; Ali2017Eukaryotic). This protein is a member of the pentein protein family, characterized by its unique structural features that facilitate its binding interactions (Klinge2011Crystal). EIF6 is crucial for both cytoplasmic translation initiation and nuclear ribosome biogenesis, playing a significant role in the maturation of preribosomal particles (Zhu2017The). Dysregulation of EIF6 expression or function is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and ribosomopathies, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhu2017The; Taha2022Case).

## Structure
EIF6, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6, is a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation regulation. It consists of 245 amino acid residues (Ali2017Eukaryotic). EIF6 is a member of the pentein protein family, characterized by a five-fold pseudosymmetry and two large flat surfaces, with the larger surface commonly serving as a binding interface (Klinge2011Crystal). The protein binds specifically to the 60S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting its association with the 40S subunit, thus acting as a ribosomal anti-association factor (Benelli2008Function).

The structure of EIF6 has been observed in complex with the 60S ribosomal subunit, where it binds to ribosomal protein L23 and is positioned near the sarcin-ricin loop, preventing the binding of the 40S subunit (Klinge2011Crystal). EIF6 does not typically form quaternary structures as it functions as a monomer. Its activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which is necessary for its release from the 60S subunit (Benelli2008Function). While the context does not provide specific details on the primary, secondary, or tertiary structures, EIF6's role and interactions suggest a complex and regulated structure essential for its function in translation initiation.

## Function
EIF6, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6, is a critical protein involved in the regulation of ribosome assembly and translation initiation in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a ribosomal anti-association factor by binding to the 60S ribosomal subunit, thereby preventing its premature association with the 40S subunit. This regulation is essential for controlling the formation of active 80S ribosomes, which are necessary for protein synthesis (Zhu2017The; Ali2017Eukaryotic).

EIF6 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in translation initiation, but it is also present in the nucleus, contributing to the biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Zhu2017The; Ali2017Eukaryotic). In the nucleus, EIF6 is involved in the maturation of preribosomal particles, which is crucial for proper ribosomal assembly and function (Zhu2017The).

The activity of EIF6 is regulated by phosphorylation, which facilitates its release from the 60S subunit, allowing the formation of active ribosomes (Manfrini2017High). This regulation is vital for maintaining normal cellular processes, including protein synthesis and cell growth, and is tightly controlled to prevent dysregulation that could lead to pathological conditions (GolobSchwarzl2019Eukaryotic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EIF6 gene have significant clinical implications. Overexpression of EIF6 is linked to various cancers, including colorectal cancer, head and neck carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. In these cancers, EIF6 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (Zhu2017The). In colorectal cancer, EIF6 levels increase progressively from normal tissue to carcinoma, suggesting its potential as a cancer biomarker (Zhu2017The). 

In the context of liver diseases, EIF6 plays a role in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Higher levels of EIF6 are associated with this progression, and its depletion has been shown to reduce lipid accumulation and tumor growth, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Scagliola2021Targeting).

EIF6 variants also have implications in Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS), a ribosomopathy. Certain EIF6 variants can compensate for hematological complications associated with SDS, potentially reducing the risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (Taha2022Case). These findings highlight the gene's role in both oncogenesis and ribosomal disorders.

## Interactions
EIF6 interacts with the 60S ribosomal subunit, specifically binding to the uL14 (RPL23) interface. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the 60S subunit in a translationally inactive state by preventing its premature association with the 40S subunit, thereby inhibiting the formation of the 80S ribosome (Elliff2022Dynamic; Jaako2021eIF6). EIF6 binds to specific regions of the 60S subunit, including the C terminus of uL14, the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL), uL3, and the N terminus of eL24 (Jaako2021eIF6).

The release of EIF6 from the 60S subunit is facilitated by the proteins SBDS and EFL1 in the presence of GTP, which are essential for ribosomal subunit joining and active translation (Jaako2021eIF6). EIF6 also interacts with the β4 integrin subunit, specifically binding to its cytodomain, although this interaction suggests a function independent of β4 in organisms lacking this integrin (Sanvito1999The).

Mutations in EIF6, such as those associated with Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS), can disrupt its interaction with the 60S subunit, affecting ribosome assembly and function (Elliff2022Dynamic). These interactions highlight EIF6's role in ribosome biogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target in certain diseases (Elliff2022Dynamic).
