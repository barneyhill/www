# ST8SIA6

## Overview
ST8SIA6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 6, a member of the sialyltransferase family involved in the biosynthesis of polysialic acid. This enzyme is categorized as a mono-sialyltransferase and is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of sialic acid residues to glycoproteins and glycolipids, forming α2,8-linkages. These linkages are essential for various cellular processes, including cell-cell interactions, neural development, and immune responses (Huang2017The; Anne2010Comprehensive). Structurally, ST8SIA6 is a type II transmembrane protein, characterized by a unique configuration that includes a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a catalytic domain within the Golgi lumen (HarduinLepers2023The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the post-translational modification of proteins, influencing cellular recognition and signaling pathways (Huang2017The).

## Structure
The ST8SIA6 gene encodes the enzyme ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 6, which is part of the ST8Sia family of sialyltransferases. This enzyme is involved in the transfer of sialic acid residues to glycoproteins and glycolipids, specifically forming α2,8-linkages (Huang2017The; HarduinLepers2023The). ST8SIA6 is classified as a mono-sialyltransferase, characterized by a less compact structure compared to other family members, which is linked to its catalytic specificity (Huang2017The).

Structurally, ST8SIA6 is a type II transmembrane protein, featuring a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, an intermediate stem region, and a large catalytic domain oriented within the Golgi lumen (HarduinLepers2023The). It contains a single pair of disulfide bonds at C186:C335, contributing to its less compact structure, with a notable distance of 48 Å between the N-terminal region and the core region (Huang2017The). Unlike other family members, ST8SIA6 lacks anti-parallel β-sheets (Huang2017The).

The enzyme also features conserved sialylmotifs, which are crucial for donor and acceptor binding, although specific details about the molecular structure of ST8SIA6 remain limited (HarduinLepers2023The).

## Function
The ST8SIA6 gene encodes a sialyltransferase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of polysialic acid, a carbohydrate polymer that modifies glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid residues to form α-2,8 linkages, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell-cell interactions, neural development, and immune responses (Anne2010Comprehensive). 

In healthy human cells, ST8SIA6 is expressed at basal levels across almost all tissues, with higher expression noted in the kidney, heart, and spleen (Anne2010Comprehensive). The enzyme is typically active in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the post-translational modification of proteins, contributing to the formation of sialylated molecules that play significant roles in cellular recognition and signaling (Huang2017The). 

The structural features of ST8SIA6, such as its type II transmembrane topology and conserved sialyl motifs, are essential for its catalytic activity and substrate specificity (Huang2017The). These structural characteristics enable the enzyme to perform its function effectively, influencing processes like cell migration and neural development (Anne2010Comprehensive).
