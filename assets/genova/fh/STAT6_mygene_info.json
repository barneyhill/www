this gene is a member of the STAT family of transcription factors. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein plays a central role in exerting IL4 mediated biological responses. It is found to induce the expression of BCL2L1/BCL-X(L), which is responsible for the anti-apoptotic activity of IL4. Knockout studies in mice suggested the roles of this gene in differentiation of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, expression of cell surface markers, and class switch of immunoglobulins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, May 2010].", "symbol": "STAT6", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1335877"}, "unigene": "Hs.524518", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P42226", "TrEMBL": ["A8K4S9", "B4DQB3", "Q5FBW6", "G3V5K5", "A0A1W2PNW1", "G3V2L2", "G3V5I8", "H0YIY2", "G3V568", "G3V370", "G3V2M3", "G3V2H4", "H0YJH6", "A0A494C0T4"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "STAT6"}}
