# CCNL1

## Overview
Cyclin L1, encoded by the CCNL1 gene, is a nuclear protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of transcription and pre-mRNA splicing. As a member of the cyclin family, Cyclin L1 is characterized by its cyclin box domain and an arginine-serine-rich (RS) domain, which are essential for its function in splicing and transcriptional regulation (Herrmann2007Characterization; Loyer2020Roles). The protein interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11) and other splicing factors, forming complexes that are crucial for efficient pre-mRNA processing (LOYER2005Role; Loyer2008Characterization). Cyclin L1 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and cellular differentiation, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, such as cervical cancer and polycystic ovary syndrome (Narayan2007Gene; Huang2021Long). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions highlight its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology.

## Structure
Cyclin L1, encoded by the CCNL1 gene, is a protein characterized by a cyclin box domain at its N-terminus and an arginine-serine-rich (RS) domain at its C-terminus. The cyclin box domain is crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation and is structurally defined by closely packed helical modules (Loyer2020Roles). The RS domain, which is similar to those found in SR proteins, is involved in RNA splicing and localization to nuclear speckles (Herrmann2007Characterization; Dickinson2002Cyclin).

Cyclin L1 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including L1α, L1β, and L1γ. The L1α isoform is the longest, containing both the cyclin box and RS domain, while L1β and L1γ are shorter, with L1β containing only the cyclin box and L1γ being a truncated version of L1β (Dickinson2002Cyclin; Loyer2008Characterization). Cyclin L1 is known to interact with CDK11, specifically its p110 isoform, and is involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing (Żuryń2021The).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are suggested, particularly in the context of its interactions with kinases and its role in splicing regulation (Dickinson2002Cyclin). Cyclin L1's RS domain also functions as a nuclear localization signal, contributing to its immobility within nuclear speckles (Herrmann2007Characterization).

## Function
Cyclin L1, encoded by the CCNL1 gene, is a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of transcription and pre-mRNA splicing in healthy human cells. It interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11) to form complexes that play a crucial role in these processes. Cyclin L1 is associated with hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II and splicing factors, indicating its involvement in transcription and RNA splicing (LOYER2005Role; Loyer2008Characterization).

Cyclin L1 exists in multiple isoforms, with Cyclin L1α being the most prominent. This isoform contains an N-terminal cyclin box and a C-terminal RS domain, which are essential for its function in splicing. Cyclin L1α is an immobile component of the splicing factor compartment, specifically localized in nuclear speckles, where it is involved in the assembly and storage of splicing factors (Herrmann2007Characterization).

The interaction of Cyclin L1 with CDK11 p110 enhances splicing activity, and its depletion leads to a decrease in splicing efficiency. This suggests that Cyclin L1 is integral to the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, impacting gene expression and cellular differentiation (Loyer2020Roles; Loyer2008Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCNL1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In cervical cancer, CCNL1 is identified as a potential target oncogene within the frequently amplified chromosomal region 3q26-29. This region is associated with invasive cervical cancer, suggesting that overexpression of CCNL1 may contribute to tumorigenesis (Narayan2007Gene).

In the context of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the long non-coding RNA lnc-CCNL1-3:1, which is related to CCNL1, is overexpressed in granulosa cells. This overexpression leads to increased apoptosis and reduced glucose uptake, contributing to insulin resistance and follicular atresia in PCOS. The interaction between lnc-CCNL1-3:1 and the transcription factor FOXO1 is crucial, as it prevents FOXO1 degradation, thereby promoting these pathological processes (Huang2021Long).

In pituitary adenomas, particularly ACTH-secreting tumors, CCNL1 expression is upregulated, although its expression levels are similar in both tumor and non-tumoral tissues. This suggests a potential role in tumor biology, although the specific implications remain unclear (TaniguchiPonciano2022The).

## Interactions
Cyclin L1 (CCNL1) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in transcription and pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with CDK11 p110, a protein kinase, and the splicing factor SFRS2 (SC35), as well as the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), suggesting its involvement in a nuclear complex that regulates transcription and pre-mRNA processing (Loyer2020Roles). CCNL1, particularly its isoforms Cyclin L1α and L2α, co-localizes with CDK11 p110 in nuclear speckles and interacts with mitosis-specific CDK11 p58 and apoptosis-specific CDK11 p46 (Loyer2020Roles). Cyclin L1α and L2α also interact with splicing factors like RNPS1 and 9G8, promoting pre-mRNA splicing (Loyer2020Roles).

In cardiomyocytes, CCNL1 interacts with PPP1CA, a protein phosphatase involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, affecting the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Yap, a key factor in cardiomyocyte proliferation (Gong2023Cyclin). Additionally, in the context of polycystic ovary syndrome, the long non-coding RNA lnc-CCNL1-3:1 interacts with the transcription factor FOXO1, enhancing its nuclear localization and expression, which is implicated in promoting apoptosis and reducing glucose uptake in granulosa cells (Huang2021Long).
