# NT5C1B

## Overview
NT5C1B is a gene that encodes the enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IB, a crucial component of nucleotide metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a hydrolase and is primarily involved in the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates to nucleosides, a key step in the purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways. These pathways are essential for maintaining nucleotide balance within cells, thereby influencing DNA and RNA synthesis (Borowiec2006Adenosine). The enzyme is predominantly active in the cytosol and plays a significant role in regulating intracellular purine nucleotide concentrations, which is vital for cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Camici2018Interplay). NT5C1B is notably expressed in the testes and has been linked to male fertility, with its activity being modulated by factors such as pH and divalent cations (Borowiec2006Adenosine). Additionally, the enzyme's function in spermatozoa suggests a role in cryoprotectant tolerance, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular functions under stress conditions (Song2019NT5C1B).

## Function
NT5C1B encodes the enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IB, which plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates to nucleosides. This activity is essential for maintaining nucleotide balance within the cell and contributes to the purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways, impacting DNA and RNA synthesis (Borowiec2006Adenosine). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytosol and is involved in the regulation of intracellular purine nucleotide concentrations, which is important for cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Camici2018Interplay).

NT5C1B is highly expressed in the testes, where it shares substrate specificity with its isoform cN-IA, primarily hydrolyzing AMP and being allosterically activated by ADP (Borowiec2006Adenosine). The enzyme's activity is influenced by factors such as pH and the presence of divalent cations like Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ (Borowiec2006Adenosine). In spermatozoa, NT5C1B has been associated with cryoprotectant tolerance, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular functions under stress conditions, which could be extrapolated to its function in healthy human cells (Song2019NT5C1B).

## Clinical Significance
The NT5C1B gene is associated with male fertility and autoimmune diseases. Alterations in its expression have been linked to cryoprotectant tolerance in spermatozoa, which is crucial for maintaining sperm quality under stress conditions induced by cryoprotectants like glycerol. These conditions can affect sperm motility and mitochondrial function, impacting fertility outcomes (Song2019NT5C1B).

While specific diseases directly resulting from NT5C1B mutations or expression changes are not detailed, the gene's role in nucleotide metabolism suggests potential implications in disorders where nucleotide balance is disrupted, such as cancer. The enzyme encoded by NT5C1B, cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase-I, is involved in hydrolyzing nucleoside monophosphates and is activated by ADP, playing a role in adenosine delivery during ischemic or hypoxic conditions (Borowiec2006Adenosine).

The gene is also noted for its potential involvement in autoimmune infertility, although the exact relationship requires further investigation (Borowiec2006Adenosine). Understanding the clinical significance of NT5C1B could aid in developing targeted therapies for conditions related to its altered expression or function.
