# CNKSR1

## Overview
CNKSR1, or Connector Enhancer of Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein known as CNK1. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular signal transduction, particularly within the Ras/MAPK and Rho signaling pathways. As a scaffold protein, CNK1 facilitates the assembly of signaling complexes, thereby enhancing the efficiency and specificity of signal transduction processes. It contains several domains, including a sterile alpha motif (SAM), a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are essential for its interactions with other proteins and phosphoinositides (Singh2020Redefining; Feil2023DNA). CNK1 is involved in various cellular functions, such as cell growth, proliferation, and migration, and is active in both the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane (Kazeminasab2018CNKSR1; Clapéron2007KSR). Alterations in CNKSR1 have been linked to several diseases, including intellectual disabilities and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Kazeminasab2018CNKSR1; Quadri2017Expression).

## Structure
CNKSR1 is a scaffold protein involved in signal transduction pathways, characterized by several distinct domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions. It contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM), a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are crucial for its role in mediating communication between signaling pathways such as Ras and Rho GTPase (Singh2020Redefining; Feil2023DNA). The PH domain of CNKSR1 is specifically noted for its ability to bind phosphoinositides, particularly PI(4)P, which may relate to its role in promoting PI(4,5)P2 production (Singh2020Redefining).

CNKSR1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions with other proteins (Veinstein2024The). The protein may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Feil2023DNA). The 3D structure of CNKSR1 has been predicted using Genome3D, with annotations based on SCOP and CATH domains, indicating a consensus on its domain structure (Lewis2012Genome3D:). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not available in the provided context.

## Function
The CNKSR1 gene encodes the CNK1 protein, a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in signal transduction pathways, particularly the Ras/MAPK pathway. CNK1 facilitates the assembly of signaling complexes, enhancing the efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of Ras signaling by bringing together various components of these pathways. This assembly increases the interaction between signaling molecules and prevents their inactivation, thereby supporting normal cell signaling processes that regulate cell growth, proliferation, survival, and migration (Indarte2019An).

CNK1 is involved in linking Rho and Ras signal transduction pathways. It acts as an effector for Rho, interacting specifically with the GTP-bound form of Rho through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This interaction is essential for Rho-induced gene expression via the serum response factor (SRF), although it does not affect Rho-induced stress fiber formation, indicating a specific role in transcriptional activation pathways (Jaffe2004Human).

The CNK1 protein is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it interacts with various kinases and adaptor proteins. It is involved in multiple signaling pathways, including the Ras/ERK and Rho/JNK pathways, and plays a role in neuronal development and cell migration (Kazeminasab2018CNKSR1; Clapéron2007KSR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CNKSR1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A novel frameshift mutation in CNKSR1 has been associated with syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID) in an Iranian family. This mutation results in a frameshift and premature termination codons, potentially leading to protein truncation or nonsense-mediated decay. Affected individuals exhibit symptoms such as microcephaly, short stature, profound intellectual disability, ataxia, aggression, and quadrupedal gait, with MRI scans showing cerebellar hypoplasia (Kazeminasab2018CNKSR1).

In cancer, CNKSR1 expression has been studied in pancreatic cancer, where it is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High CNKSR1 expression is associated with improved survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. The cellular distribution of CNKSR1, particularly its nuclear presence, correlates with increased nuclear phospho-ERK expression, indicating its involvement in the MAPK/ERK pathway (Quadri2017Expression). Additionally, CNKSR1 has been implicated in rectal cancer, where it is more commonly mutated in patients who do not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Bagaria2022Discriminating).

## Interactions
CNKSR1, also known as human CNK1, acts as a scaffold protein that facilitates interactions between various signaling molecules in the Rho and Ras signal transduction pathways. It contains several protein-protein interaction domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which specifically interacts with the GTP-bound form of Rho, playing a crucial role in Rho-dependent transcriptional activation (Jaffe2004Human). CNKSR1 also associates with Rhophilin, a known Rho effector, through its CRIC domain, and this interaction is essential for Rho-mediated serum response factor (SRF) activation (Jaffe2004Human).

CNKSR1 interacts with RalGDS, a Ras effector, suggesting its role in mediating cross-talk between Rho and Ras pathways. However, the interactions between CNKSR1 and Rhophilin or RalGDS are mutually exclusive, indicating competitive binding (Jaffe2004Human). The PH domain of CNKSR1 also binds to phosphatidylinositides at the plasma membrane, which is crucial for its interaction with mutant KRas proteins. This interaction is disrupted by small molecules like PHT-7.3, which inhibit the proliferation of mutant KRas cells (Indarte2019An). These interactions highlight CNKSR1's role in assembling multiprotein complexes that regulate cellular responses.
