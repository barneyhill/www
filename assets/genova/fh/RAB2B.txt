# RAB2B

## Overview
RAB2B is a gene that encodes a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, specifically the RAB2B protein, which plays a critical role in intracellular vesicular transport. The RAB2B protein is involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting. As a small GTPase, RAB2B functions as a molecular switch, cycling between active and inactive states to facilitate its role in vesicle budding, transport, and fusion. The protein is characterized by a Rab domain and a double cysteine prenylation motif, which are crucial for its membrane association and function. RAB2B is expressed in various tissues and has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in tumor tissues such as colon adenocarcinoma, as well as in neurological disorders like autism spectrum disorder (Homma2019Comprehensive; Kato2023Hesperetin; Ni2002Molecular).

## Structure
The RAB2B gene encodes a protein that is part of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, involved in vesicular transport, specifically from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex (Ni2002Molecular). The primary structure of the RAB2B protein consists of 216 amino acids, with a Rab domain located at residues 7-167 (Ni2002Molecular). This domain is crucial for its function in intracellular trafficking.

The protein's secondary structure includes regions that form the Rab domain, which is typical of small GTPases, although specific details on alpha helices and beta sheets are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure of RAB2B, like other Rab proteins, likely involves a compact folding that facilitates its role as a molecular switch, cycling between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active states (Kumar2020Structural).

RAB2B contains a double cysteine prenylation motif at the C terminus, a post-translational modification that aids in membrane attachment, which is essential for its function in vesicle trafficking (Ni2002Molecular). The protein shares high homology with mouse Rab2 and human Rab2A, indicating conserved structural features across species (Ni2002Molecular). The quaternary structure, involving interactions with other proteins, is not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The RAB2B gene encodes a protein that is part of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are crucial for regulating vesicular traffic in eukaryotic cells. RAB2B functions as a membrane-associated molecular switch, playing a significant role in the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. This process is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and ensuring proper protein sorting and secretion (Homma2019Comprehensive; Ni2002Molecular).

In healthy human cells, RAB2B is involved in the regulation of vesicular transport between specific compartments of the endocytic and exocytic pathways. It is active in the cytoplasm and associated with membrane-bound organelles, facilitating the budding, transport, and fusion reactions necessary for vesicular transport (Ni2002Molecular). The protein contains a Rab domain and a double cysteine prenylation motif, which are important for its function and localization within the cell (Ni2002Molecular).

RAB2B is expressed in various human tissues and is overexpressed in certain tumor tissues, such as colon adenocarcinoma, suggesting a potential role in cancer biology (Ni2002Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB2B gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurological disorders. In pancreatic cancer, RAB2B is a direct target of microRNA-448 (miR-448), which is significantly downregulated in cancerous tissues. Overexpression of miR-448 leads to the downregulation of RAB2B, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting that RAB2B plays a role in promoting pancreatic cancer cell growth (Jin2018miR‑448). In cervical cancer, RAB2B expression is positively regulated by METTL3, a gene associated with poor prognosis. METTL3 enhances the mRNA stability of RAB2B, promoting cancer cell proliferation. Knockdown of METTL3 reduces RAB2B expression, highlighting its potential oncogenic role in cervical cancer (Hu2020METTL3).

In the context of neurological disorders, RAB2B is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Knockdown of RAB2B inhibits neuronal and oligodendroglial cell differentiation, processes crucial for normal brain development. This inhibition is linked to decreased expression of differentiation markers, which may contribute to the cellular disorganization observed in ASD (Kato2023Hesperetin).

## Interactions
RAB2B, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular vesicle trafficking. One significant interaction is with the bacterial protein SidM, which AMPylates RAB2B, indicating its involvement in host-pathogen interactions. This AMPylation is a post-translational modification that enhances rhodamine fluorescence, suggesting a regulatory role in cellular processes (Yu2015Host–Pathogen).

RAB2B also interacts with members of the GARIN protein family, particularly GARIN3, which binds to both the constitutively active and inactive forms of RAB2B. This interaction is important for the recruitment of GARIN3 to the Golgi apparatus, highlighting RAB2B's role in membrane trafficking and vesicle fusion/fission (Wang2024Golgi). GARIN5B, another member of the GARIN family, similarly binds to both forms of RAB2B, indicating a shared functional pathway in cellular processes (Wang2024Golgi).

Additionally, RAB2B is implicated in exosome secretion, where its inhibition leads to decreased exosome production. This suggests a role in the early secretory pathway and its association with endocytic Rabs, such as Rab4, Rab14, and Rab11, further supporting its involvement in vesicular transport (Ostrowski2009Rab27a).
