# GPR19

## Overview
GPR19 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 19, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a significant role in various physiological processes. This receptor is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in regions associated with circadian rhythm regulation, such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and is also found in peripheral tissues like the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract (Gerlach2023Expression; Yamaguchi2021Gpr19). GPR19 is involved in critical cellular functions, including energy metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and cellular stress responses, through its interaction with signaling pathways such as MAPK and ERK (Maudsley2022Intersection; Hossain2016Neuronal). The receptor's activity is modulated by its interaction with endogenous ligands like adropin, influencing processes such as glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Maudsley2022Intersection). GPR19's expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rao2017G; Mushala2023Gprotein).

## Function
GPR19 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of circadian rhythms, energy metabolism, and cellular stress responses. It is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is the master circadian clock, suggesting a role in modulating circadian rhythms (Yamaguchi2021Gpr19). GPR19 is also expressed in several peripheral tissues, including the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and prostate, where it may influence processes such as pepsinogen synthesis and gut motility (Gerlach2023Expression).

At the molecular level, GPR19 is linked to the regulation of mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism. It interacts with the peptide adropin, which influences glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. This interaction affects mitochondrial fuel substrate utilization, promoting glucose usage through the GPR19-MAPK-PDK4 signaling pathway (Maudsley2022Intersection). GPR19 also plays a role in cellular stress responses, potentially regulating cellular status in response to stress, which is crucial in the aging process (Maudsley2022Intersection).

In terms of cellular localization, GPR19 is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of cells, indicating an internalized state (Gerlach2023Expression). This receptor's activity is associated with various signaling pathways, including ERK and Akt, which are involved in cell growth and survival (Hossain2016Neuronal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GPR19 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and metabolic disorders. In cancer, GPR19 is overexpressed in several types, including breast cancer, metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma, and small cell lung cancer. In breast cancer, GPR19 overexpression is associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), processes crucial for cancer metastasis. The receptor's activation by the peptide hormone adropin, which engages the ERK/MAPK pathway, promotes an epithelial phenotype, reducing cell motility and invasiveness (Rao2017G). 

In lung cancer, GPR19 expression correlates negatively with the proliferation marker Ki-67 and positively with patient survival, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic or therapeutic target (Gerlach2023Expression). 

GPR19 also plays a role in metabolic regulation. In GPR19 knockout mice, sex-dependent metabolic dysfunctions were observed, with males showing glucose intolerance and altered hepatic glucose production under high-fat diet conditions. This suggests GPR19's involvement in nutrient signaling and substrate oxidation, particularly in the liver (Mushala2023Gprotein). 

The receptor is also linked to cardiovascular diseases, where its upregulation after myocardial infarction increases ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress (Maudsley2022Intersection).

## Interactions
GPR19, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It has been shown to participate in plasmalogens (Pls)-induced signaling, where its overexpression enhances the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt pathways in neuronal cells. This suggests that GPR19 may form homomers or heteromers with other GPCRs or tyrosine kinase receptors, facilitating kinase activity and phosphorylation of signaling proteins (Hossain2016Neuronal).

In the context of breast cancer, GPR19 interacts with the peptide hormone adropin, which acts as an endogenous ligand. This interaction activates the ERK/MAPK pathway, leading to increased E-cadherin expression and reduced invasive properties of breast cancer cells, indicating a shift towards an epithelial phenotype (Rao2017G).

GPR19 also interacts with melanocortin receptors, such as MC3R, where it slightly enhances cAMP accumulation, suggesting a modulatory role in the signaling pathway of MC3R (Li2021Identification). These interactions highlight GPR19's involvement in diverse signaling pathways, impacting both neuronal and cancer cell functions.
