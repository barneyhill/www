# OR2G6

## Overview
The OR2G6 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily G member 6, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules and is a subset of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure. Olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR2G6, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of odors. The OR2G6 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity and specificity of olfactory signaling (Qiu2020aarFDC).
