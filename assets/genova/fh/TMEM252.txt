# TMEM252

## Overview
TMEM252 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 252, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and cell-cell communication. The specific functions and interactions of transmembrane protein 252 remain under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in pathways that are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. Understanding the role of TMEM252 and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease.
