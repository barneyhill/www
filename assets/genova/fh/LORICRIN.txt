# LORICRIN

## Overview
LORICRIN is a gene that encodes the loricrin cornified envelope precursor protein, a crucial structural component of the epidermis. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in forming the cornified cell envelope (CE), which is essential for the skin's barrier function. Loricrin is highly abundant in the stratum granulosum of the epidermis, where it undergoes extensive cross-linking to provide mechanical resilience and insolubility to the CE. The protein is characterized by a high content of glycine, serine, and cysteine, which facilitates the formation of flexible glycine loops and disulfide bridges, contributing to the structural integrity and flexibility of the epidermis (Ishitsuka2020Loricrin:; Hohl1991Characterization). Mutations in the LORICRIN gene are linked to various skin disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining epidermal health and function (Suzuki2019Somatic).

## Structure
Loricrin is a protein characterized by its high glycine content, comprising approximately 47% of its amino acid composition, along with significant amounts of serine and cysteine (Hohl1991Characterization). The primary structure of loricrin includes tandem quasi-repeating peptides enriched in glycines and serines, forming a glycine-loop configuration (Yoneda1992The). These glycine-rich sequences are interspersed with lysine and glutamine-rich domains, which are involved in isodipeptide cross-links catalyzed by transglutaminases (Steinert1991Glycine; Hohl1991Characterization).

The secondary structure of loricrin is suggested to include flexible glycine-rich loops, which contribute to the protein's flexibility and the overall flexibility of the epidermis (Hohl1991Characterization). These loops are hypothesized to form higher-order structures, potentially facilitating interactions within the cytoskeletal and envelope-cytoskeletal frameworks (Steinert1991Glycine).

Loricrin undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including the formation of disulfide bonds and N(γ-Glu-tarnyl)lysine isodipeptide bonds, which contribute to its insolubility and structural stability (Hohl1991Characterization). These cross-links are crucial for the protein's function in forming the cornified cell envelope, providing a highly resistant barrier in the epidermis (Hohl1991Characterization). The protein's structure is thought to form a compact rosette-like configuration stabilized by these cross-links (Hohl1991Characterization).

## Function
Loricrin is a critical protein component of the cornified envelope (CE) in the epidermis, playing a significant role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. It is primarily expressed in the stratum granulosum of the epidermis, where it contributes to the formation of a highly resistant and insoluble barrier that protects against environmental stressors and prevents water loss (Ishitsuka2020Loricrin:; Kypriotou2012The). Loricrin is characterized by its high glycine, serine, and cysteine content, which allows it to form flexible glycine loops and disulfide bridges, providing structural integrity and flexibility to the CE (Koch2000Lessons; Hohl1991Characterization).

The protein is cross-linked by transglutaminases, forming isopeptide bonds between lysine and glutamine residues, which are essential for the CE's mechanical resilience and insolubility (Hohl1991Characterization; Nemes1999Bricks). Loricrin's ability to form strong isopeptide cross-linkages ensures the durability of the epidermal barrier, making it resistant to hydrolysis and mechanical stress (Ishitsuka2022Loricrin). In healthy human cells, loricrin's interactions with other proteins, such as filaggrin, are crucial for maintaining the skin's barrier function and preventing dehydration (Ishitsuka2022Loricrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LORICRIN gene are associated with several skin disorders, primarily characterized by defects in the epidermal barrier. Vohwinkel syndrome (VS) with ichthyosis is caused by dominant-negative mutations in the LOR gene, leading to palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and the formation of pseudoainhum or erythrokeratoderma. These mutations result in delayed translation termination, causing mutant loricrin to accumulate in the nucleus, which disrupts the permeability barrier (Ishitsuka2020Loricrin:). Loricrin keratoderma (LK) is another condition linked to LORICRIN mutations, characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma, ichthyosis, and constricted digits. The mutations lead to frameshifts that replace the glycine-rich C-terminus with an arginine-rich sequence, causing nuclear accumulation of loricrin (Suzuki2019Somatic).

Revertant mosaicism, where pathogenic mutations revert to wild-type, has been observed in LK, providing a potential therapeutic avenue (Suzuki2019Somatic). The presence of revertant spots in affected individuals suggests a natural correction mechanism through somatic recombination (Suzuki2019Somatic). These findings highlight the complex role of LORICRIN mutations in skin pathology and suggest potential strategies for intervention.

## Interactions
Loricrin is a major component of the cornified envelope in the epidermis and participates in several critical protein interactions. It forms cross-linkages with keratin intermediate filaments, filaggrin, and small proline-rich proteins, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of the epidermal barrier. These interactions are facilitated by transglutaminase enzymes, which catalyze the formation of isodipeptide bonds, primarily involving lysine and glutamine residues, contributing to the insolubility and robustness of the cornified envelope (Ishitsuka2020Loricrin:; Hohl1991Characterization).

Loricrin also interacts with bacterial proteins, playing a role in the colonization of human tissues by Staphylococcus aureus. It serves as a ligand for the fibronectin binding protein B (FnBPB) and clumping factor B (ClfB) of S. aureus, facilitating bacterial adhesion to human skin and nasal epithelial cells. The interaction with ClfB is crucial for nasal colonization, as demonstrated by reduced bacterial retention in loricrin-deficient mice (Mulcahy2012Nasal; da2022Fibronectin). These interactions highlight loricrin's role not only in maintaining the epidermal barrier but also in mediating host-pathogen interactions.
