# HS2ST1

## Overview
HS2ST1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase 1, which is a critical component in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a complex polysaccharide involved in various biological processes. This enzyme is categorized as a sulfotransferase and is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the 2-O position of iduronic acid residues in HS chains. The sulfation of heparan sulfate is essential for its biological activity, influencing cell signaling, growth factor binding, and cell-cell interactions. HS2ST1 plays a significant role in development, angiogenesis, and wound healing by contributing to the structural diversity and function of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Byrne2018New; Ouidja2022Variability). Disruptions in the function of HS2ST1 can lead to developmental abnormalities and have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (Chung2024Prognostic; Ouidja2022Variability).

## Function
Heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS2ST1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS) by catalyzing the transfer of sulfate groups to the 2-O position of iduronic acid residues in HS chains. This sulfation process is essential for the biological activity of HS, influencing cell signaling, growth factor binding, and cell-cell interactions (Byrne2018New; Ouidja2022Variability). HS2ST1 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the structural diversity and function of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), impacting processes such as development, angiogenesis, and wound healing (Ouidja2022Variability).

In healthy human cells, HS2ST1 is involved in the formation of sequences that interact with heparin-binding proteins, which are crucial for normal development and homeostasis (Ouidja2022Variability). The enzyme's activity is necessary for optimal signaling of growth factors like FGF, TGFβ, and SHH, which are important for various cellular functions and developmental processes (Zhao2019Changes). Disruption of HS2ST1 can lead to severe developmental abnormalities, highlighting its essential role in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (Ouidja2022Variability).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HS2ST1 gene are associated with a neurofacioskeletal syndrome that may include renal agenesis. This condition is characterized by brachydactyly of the hands and feet, flexion contractures, agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphism, such as a coarse face, upslanted palpebral fissures, a broad nasal tip, and a wide mouth. In affected individuals, heparan sulfate (HS) chains in skin fibroblasts lack 2-O-sulfation of GlcA/IdoA residues, leading to increased N- and 6-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues. This alteration results in decreased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK1/2, by FGF2, suggesting that HS2ST1 and 2-O-sulfated HS are crucial for proper skeletal and renal development (Mizumoto2021Congenital).

Altered expression of HS2ST1 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In breast cancer, overexpression of HS2ST1 affects cancer stem cell properties, influencing signaling pathways such as MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin, which are crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Vijaya2020HS2ST1‐dependent; Teixeira2020The). In HCC, high HS2ST1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to pathways involved in cell cycle progression and mTORC1 signaling (Chung2024Prognostic).

## Interactions
HS2ST1, or heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase 1, is involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate by catalyzing the 2-O-sulfation of iduronic acid residues. While specific physical interactions of HS2ST1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, it is known to interact with various enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and modification of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). These include exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 (EX1), glucuronic acid epimerase (GLCE), N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST), heparan sulfate glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase (HS3ST), and heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (HS6ST) (Chung2024Prognostic).

In addition to these interactions, HS2ST1 has been studied for its binding with various ligands, including 3'-phosphoadenosine-containing nucleotides such as Coenzyme A (CoA), which suggests a competitive binding mechanism similar to that of protein kinases with ADP (Byrne2018New). The enzyme's activity can be inhibited by small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, which bind to its active site and compete with its natural substrates (Byrne2018New). These interactions highlight the enzyme's role in heparan sulfate modification and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
