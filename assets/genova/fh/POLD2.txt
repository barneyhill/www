# POLD2

## Overview
POLD2 is a gene that encodes the DNA polymerase delta 2, accessory subunit, a crucial component of the DNA polymerase delta complex involved in DNA replication and repair. The protein encoded by POLD2, often referred to as the p50 subunit, functions as a scaffold within the polymerase delta complex, facilitating the assembly and interaction of other subunits such as POLD1, POLD3, and POLD4. This protein is characterized by its oligonucleotide binding (OB) and phosphodiesterase-like (PDE) domains, which are essential for protein-protein interactions and the stability of the polymerase complex (Baranovskiy2008Xray; Baldeck2015FF483–484). POLD2 is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotic species, underscoring its functional importance in maintaining genomic stability (Reynolds1999Characterisation). The protein plays a significant role in DNA damage tolerance, particularly through its interaction with DNA polymerase eta (Polη), which is crucial for translesion synthesis, a mechanism that allows replication to proceed past DNA lesions (Baldeck2015FF483–484).

## Structure
The POLD2 gene encodes the 50 kDa accessory subunit of DNA polymerase delta, which plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair. The protein structure of POLD2 includes several distinct domains. The p50 subunit, homologous to yeast Pol31, contains oligonucleotide binding (OB) and phosphodiesterase-like (PDE) domains. The PDE domain is central and inactive in eukaryotic polymerases but is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the OB domain is connected to the PDE domain via linkers, contributing to stable protein-protein interactions (Baranovskiy2008Xray).

The POLD2 protein also interacts with other subunits of the DNA polymerase delta complex, forming a quaternary structure. It acts as a scaffold for the assembly of the complex by interacting with POLD1, POLD3, and POLD4 subunits (Baldeck2015FF483–484). The interaction between POLD2 and DNA polymerase eta (Polη) is mediated by the FF 483-484 motif in Polη, which is crucial for translesion synthesis, a DNA damage tolerance mechanism (Baldeck2015FF483–484).

The POLD2 protein is evolutionarily conserved, with ten conserved regions identified across various eukaryotic species, indicating its functional significance (Reynolds1999Characterisation). These conserved regions include invariant amino acid positions that are essential for its activity (Reynolds1999Characterisation).

## Function
The POLD2 gene encodes a subunit of the DNA polymerase delta complex, which is essential for DNA replication and repair. This complex is composed of four subunits: POLD1, POLD2, POLD3, and POLD4, with POLD2 serving as a scaffold for the assembly of the complex by interacting with the other subunits (Baldeck2015FF483–484). POLD2 is involved in the synthesis of the lagging strand during DNA replication, ensuring high-fidelity DNA synthesis and maintaining genomic stability (Yamaguchi2023Association).

POLD2 also plays a role in DNA damage tolerance, particularly through its interaction with DNA polymerase eta (Polη). This interaction is crucial for translesion synthesis (TLS), a process that allows DNA replication to continue past lesions, such as those induced by ultraviolet irradiation. The interaction between Polη and POLD2 is mediated by a specific region of Polη, highlighting the importance of POLD2 in facilitating DNA damage tolerance (Baldeck2015FF483–484).

In healthy human cells, POLD2 is active in the nucleus, where it stabilizes the polymerase complex, contributing to the maintenance of genome integrity and proper cell cycle progression (Yamaguchi2023Association).

## Clinical Significance
The POLD2 gene, encoding a subunit of the DNA polymerase delta complex, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in DNA replication and repair. In bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), high expression of POLD2 is associated with poor overall survival and resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This resistance may be due to POLD2's ability to bypass cisplatin-induced DNA adducts, contributing to chemoresistance (Givechian2018CADPOLD2). 

In ovarian carcinomas, particularly poorly differentiated serous carcinomas, POLD2 is significantly upregulated, correlating with a poorer prognosis. This suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker for ovarian cancer (Elgaaen2010POLD2). 

In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), while POLD2 expression did not significantly differ between patients and healthy controls, lower expression levels were associated with reduced 5-year survival rates, indicating a potential impact on prognosis (YÖNTEM2023DNA). 

Mutations in POLD2, such as the D293N variant, are linked to an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by replicative stress and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, highlighting its critical role in maintaining genome integrity (Yamaguchi2023Association).

## Interactions
POLD2, a subunit of DNA polymerase delta, plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair by interacting with various proteins. It serves as a scaffold within the polymerase delta complex, interacting with other subunits such as POLD1, POLD3, and POLD4 to form a functional holoenzyme (Nicolas2016POLD1:). POLD2 specifically interacts with the human DNA polymerase eta (Polη) through the FF 483-484 motif, which is essential for translesion synthesis, a process that allows DNA replication to bypass lesions (Baldeck2015FF483–484). This interaction is crucial for maintaining Polη within the replication complex, especially following UV-induced DNA damage (Baldeck2015FF483–484).

POLD2 also interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which enhances the processivity of the polymerase complex, although POLD2 does not bind PCNA directly. Instead, it may alter the conformation of POLD1 to facilitate PCNA interaction (Reynolds1999Characterisation). Additionally, POLD2 is involved in interactions with several proteins that regulate DNA metabolism, including PIAS2, P21, PDIP1, PDIP38, PDIP46, and WRN, which are essential for maintaining genomic integrity (Cong2022An). These interactions highlight POLD2's role in both the structural assembly of the polymerase complex and its functional regulation during DNA replication and repair.
