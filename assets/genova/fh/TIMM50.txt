# TIMM50

## Overview
TIMM50 is a gene that encodes the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 50 (TIMM50), a crucial component of the TIM23 complex located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a significant role in the import and translocation of mitochondrial proteins, acting as a receptor for precursor proteins and facilitating their movement across the inner membrane (Shahrour2016Mitochondrial; Farouk2021Outer). TIMM50 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, contributing to the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation supercomplexes and supporting steroid hormone synthesis by interacting with key steroidogenic enzymes (Chaudhuri2021Diverse). Mutations in the TIMM50 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial dysfunctions, impacting mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing reactive oxygen species levels, which can disrupt mitochondrial respiration and enhance autophagic responses (Chaudhuri2021Diverse). Additionally, TIMM50 expression is implicated in various clinical conditions, including mitochondrial epileptic encephalopathy and certain cancers, where its dysregulation affects mitochondrial activity and cellular growth (Zhang2019TIMM50; Shahrour2016Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The TIMM50 protein is a component of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein translocase, specifically the TIM23 complex. It features a single transmembrane domain (TMD) located between amino acids 66-88, with the N-terminal domain exposed to the mitochondrial matrix and the C-terminal domain exposed to the intermembrane space (IMS) (Chaudhuri2021Diverse). The protein has a characteristic N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS), which is cleaved in the mature form, resulting in a protein size of 40 kDa (Chaudhuri2021Diverse).

Structurally, TIMM50 includes a phosphatase-like motif similar to those in the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, characterized by the sequence DXDX(T/V), which is crucial for its dual-specific phosphatase activity (Chaudhuri2021Diverse). The protein's structure is compact at alkaline pH but becomes disordered at acidic pH, indicating flexibility necessary for preprotein transfer (Chaudhuri2021Diverse).

A longer isoform, TIMM50a, exists in humans, featuring an additional 103 amino acids at the N-terminus, which includes a nuclear localization signal, allowing it to localize to the nucleus, particularly in Cajal bodies (Chaudhuri2021Diverse). This isoform is involved in the processing and release of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) from Cajal bodies.

## Function
The TIMM50 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the TIM23 complex, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a vital role in the import and translocation of mitochondrial proteins, acting as a receptor for precursor proteins and facilitating their movement across the inner membrane (Shahrour2016Mitochondrial; Farouk2021Outer). TIMM50 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, as it is involved in the precursor handover process necessary for protein import into the mitochondria (Callegari2020From).

In healthy human cells, TIMM50 is crucial for the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation supercomplexes, which are necessary for efficient energy production. It also helps maintain mitochondrial morphology and network architecture (Chaudhuri2021Diverse). TIMM50 interacts with key steroidogenic enzymes, playing a significant role in steroid hormone synthesis by stabilizing enzyme conformations and facilitating cholesterol binding and release (Chaudhuri2021Diverse).

Mutations in TIMM50 can lead to severe mitochondrial dysfunctions, affecting mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing reactive oxygen species levels, which can disrupt mitochondrial respiration and enhance autophagic responses (Chaudhuri2021Diverse). Overall, TIMM50 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TIMM50 gene are associated with several severe clinical conditions, primarily due to mitochondrial dysfunction. These mutations can lead to mitochondrial epileptic encephalopathy, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, and variable complex V deficiency. Patients with these conditions often present with severe intellectual disability, seizure disorders, and elevated lactate levels. The mutations affect the TIM23 complex, crucial for protein import into mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial membrane defects (Shahrour2016Mitochondrial).

In cancer, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer, TIMM50 expression is often upregulated. This upregulation is linked to increased mitochondrial activity, cell growth, and chemoresistance. TIMM50 overexpression correlates with larger tumor size, advanced stage, and poor survival outcomes. It promotes tumor progression through the ERK signaling pathway, enhancing proliferation and invasion capabilities of cancer cells (Chaudhuri2021Diverse; Zhang2019TIMM50).

Alterations in TIMM50 expression also have implications in cardiac health. Downregulation of TIMM50 is observed in models of cardiac hypertrophy, where it acts as a repressor of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. TIMM50 deficiency leads to increased reactive oxygen species levels and reduced mitochondrial respiratory complex activity, contributing to cardiac dysfunction (Chaudhuri2021Diverse).

## Interactions
TIMM50, a component of the TIM23 complex, is involved in the translocation of proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It interacts with several proteins within this complex, including TIM23 and TIM17, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that demonstrate its specific association with these proteins (Mokranjac2003Tim50). TIMM50 also interacts with precursor proteins in the intermembrane space during their import into mitochondria. Cross-linking experiments have shown that TIMM50 is in contact with incoming precursor proteins, particularly when these proteins are arrested at the outer membrane or span both the outer and inner membranes (Mokranjac2003Tim50).

In addition to its role in protein translocation, TIMM50 interacts with steroidogenic enzymes such as CyP450scc and 3 β-HSD2. It facilitates cholesterol binding and release by interacting with the flexible domain of CyP450scc and stabilizes 3 β-HSD2 in its unfolded form, preventing its degradation (Chaudhuri2021Diverse). These interactions are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and steroidogenesis. Mutations in TIMM50 that disrupt these interactions can lead to impaired steroidogenesis and are associated with various mitochondrial dysfunctions (Chaudhuri2021Diverse).
