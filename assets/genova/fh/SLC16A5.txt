# SLC16A5

## Overview
SLC16A5 is a gene that encodes the protein monocarboxylate transporter 6 (MCT6), a member of the solute carrier family 16. MCT6 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is part of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family, which is involved in the transport of various organic anions across cell membranes. Unlike other MCT family members, MCT6 does not transport typical substrates such as L-lactate or pyruvate, indicating a unique substrate specificity (Halestrap2013The). The protein is primarily expressed in the kidney and placenta, suggesting a role in drug transport and metabolism, particularly in renal secretion or reabsorption processes (Murakami2005Functional). Despite its established role in drug transport, the natural substrate of MCT6 remains unidentified, and its physiological functions are not fully understood (Meredith2008The). The gene has clinical significance due to its involvement in drug metabolism and potential implications in metabolic diseases and cancer treatment (Jones2019Characterization; Swart2019Analytical).

## Structure
The SLC16A5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family, characterized by a structure with 12 transmembrane (TM) α-helical domains, with both the N- and C-termini located intracellularly (Halestrap2013The; HALESTRAP1999The). This topology is typical of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), to which the MCT family belongs (Halestrap2013The). The protein's structure includes a large cytosolic loop between TMs 6 and 7, which is a common feature among MCTs (Halestrap2013The).

The SLC16A5 protein, also known as MCT6, has been studied for its role in transporting the loop diuretic bumetanide, although its natural substrate remains unknown (Halestrap2013The; Meredith2008The). Unlike other MCTs, SLC16A5 does not demonstrate proton-linked transport of L-lactate or pyruvate, suggesting differences in substrate specificity and transport mechanism (Halestrap2013The). The protein is not glycosylated, consistent with predictions for other members of the MCT family (Halestrap2013The). The evolutionary divergence of MCT6 suggests it may have distinct substrate specificities or co-transport mechanisms compared to other MCTs (HALESTRAP1999The).

## Function
The SLC16A5 gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 6 (MCT6), which is part of the monocarboxylate transporter family. MCT6 is distinct from other transporters in this family due to its unique substrate specificity. It is involved in the transport of various drugs, including bumetanide, probenecid, and nateglinide, but does not transport typical substrates of other MCT isoforms like L-lactic acid or L-tryptophan (Murakami2005Functional). The transport activity of MCT6 is sensitive to pH and membrane potential, although it is not dependent on a proton gradient, suggesting it may facilitate the diffusion of organic anions along the electrochemical potential gradient (Murakami2005Functional).

MCT6 is predominantly expressed in the kidney and placenta, indicating a potential role in the renal secretion or reabsorption of drugs (Murakami2005Functional). The transporter has been shown to be involved in the disposition of various drugs, potentially influencing drug metabolism and disposition (Murakami2005Functional). While its exact physiological role in humans remains to be fully elucidated, MCT6's involvement in drug transport suggests it may play a significant role in pharmacokinetics (Meredith2008The).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC16A5 gene, encoding the monocarboxylate transporter 6 (MCT6), has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in drug transport and metabolism. A notable genetic variant, rs4788863, in SLC16A5 is associated with a decreased risk of cisplatin-induced hearing impairment in Caucasian/European testicular cancer patients, suggesting a protective effect against ototoxicity (Swart2019Analytical; Zazuli2020The).

Alterations in SLC16A5 expression have been linked to metabolic processes. Studies using knockout mouse models have shown that the absence of MCT6 leads to significant changes in glucose and lipid metabolism, indicating a potential role in metabolic diseases (Jones2019Characterization). The gene's expression is upregulated in response to fasting and certain diets, further supporting its involvement in lipid metabolism (Jones2019Characterization).

In the context of cancer, SLC16A5 has been associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects in testicular cancer, although its primary focus in cancer research has been on other family members like SLC16A1 and SLC16A3 (Yu2020Comprehensive). Despite these associations, specific diseases directly resulting from SLC16A5 mutations or expression changes are not extensively documented.

## Interactions
SLC16A5, also known as monocarboxylate transporter 6 (MCT6), is part of the solute carrier family 16. It has been shown to form a complex with the chaperone protein Basigin (BSG), a glycoprotein with a single transmembrane domain and extracellular immunoglobulin domains. This interaction is crucial for the correct plasma membrane expression and activity of certain monocarboxylate transporters, although the specific role of this interaction in SLC16A5's function is not fully detailed (Halestrap2013The; Frommelt2024The).

The study of the SLC-interactome has provided high-confidence structural models for the interaction between SLC16A5 and Basigin, marking a significant advancement in understanding the protein-protein interactions involving SLC16A5 (Frommelt2024The). However, the natural substrate of SLC16A5 remains unidentified, and its interactions with nucleic acids have not been reported in the available literature (Halestrap2013The; Meredith2008The).

Overall, while SLC16A5's interaction with Basigin is established, further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of its protein interactions and their implications for its transport functions.
