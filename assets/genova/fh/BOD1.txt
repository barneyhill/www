# BOD1

## Overview
BOD1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as biorientation of chromosomes in cell division 1, which plays a pivotal role in the process of mitosis. This protein is categorized as a kinetochore protein, essential for the accurate alignment and segregation of chromosomes during cell division. BOD1 ensures proper chromosome biorientation by regulating the attachment of chromosomes to the spindle apparatus, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Schleicher2017The; Porter2007Bod1). The protein functions by inhibiting the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, specifically the B56 regulatory subunit, at mitotic kinetochores, which is crucial for the phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins necessary for stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments (Schleicher2017The; Porter2013Bod1). BOD1's interactions with the Ndc80 complex are vital for its recruitment to kinetochores and its role in regulating PP2A activity (Schleicher2017The). The gene's significance extends beyond cell division, as mutations in BOD1 have been linked to various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its broader biological importance (Jacobs2020The; EsmaeeliNieh2016BOD1).

## Function
The BOD1 gene encodes a protein that is essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis in human cells. BOD1 is a kinetochore protein that plays a critical role in chromosome biorientation, ensuring accurate attachment of chromosomes to the spindle apparatus, which is vital for maintaining genomic stability (Schleicher2017The; Porter2007Bod1). 

BOD1 functions by inhibiting the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex containing the B56 regulatory subunit (PP2A-B56) at mitotic kinetochores. This inhibition is crucial for maintaining the phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins, such as Ndc80 and Knl1, which are necessary for proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments (Schleicher2017The; Porter2013Bod1). BOD1's interaction with the Ndc80 complex is particularly important for its recruitment to kinetochores and its function in regulating PP2A activity (Schleicher2017The).

The protein is active at kinetochores from prometaphase until anaphase, and its presence is necessary for the correction of attachment errors and stabilization of correct attachments, preventing chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy (Schleicher2017The; Porter2007Bod1). BOD1's role in these processes underscores its importance in ensuring proper mitotic progression and chromosome stability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BOD1 gene have been linked to intellectual disability (ID) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. A homozygous nonsense mutation in BOD1 was identified in a consanguineous Iranian family, where affected individuals exhibited moderate to mild ID with IQs ranging from 50-75. This mutation led to the absence of BOD1 mRNA and protein, suggesting its crucial role in cognitive function (EsmaeeliNieh2016BOD1). Another study reported a homozygous nonsense mutation in a Lebanese family, associated with syndromic ID, neurodevelopmental delay, hearing impairment, and endocrine dysfunction, expanding the clinical spectrum of BOD1 deficiency (Hamdan2020A).

BOD1 is also implicated in motor coordination disorders. In mice, BOD1 deficiency in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum leads to ataxia-like behaviors, highlighting its role in maintaining motor coordination through cerebellar circuits (Liu2022BOD1). Additionally, BOD1 mutations have been associated with psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. In bipolar disorder, BOD1 mutations may influence the glutamatergic pathway, contributing to the disease's progression (Jacobs2020The). These findings underscore the importance of BOD1 in various neurological and psychiatric conditions, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for these disorders.

## Interactions
BOD1 interacts specifically with the PP2A-B56 regulatory subunit, but not with the B55 subunit. This interaction was demonstrated through immunoprecipitation experiments using HeLa cells expressing Bod1-GFP, where Bod1 was shown to bind specifically to the B56 regulatory subunit of PP2A. The phosphorylation of Bod1 at T95 is crucial for its interaction with PP2A-B56, as mutations at this site affected Bod1's ability to rescue biorientation defects in cells. Recombinant Bod1 was shown to interact with the PP2A-B56 holocomplex in vitro, particularly when the T95E phosphomimetic mutant was used, which also resulted in reduced phosphatase activity of the holoenzyme (Porter2013Bod1).

BOD1 also interacts with the Ndc80 complex, a key component of the kinetochore. Pull-down assays demonstrated that BOD1 interacts with Ndc80, Nuf2, and Spc24. Further experiments using a recombinant form of the Ndc80 complex, known as Ndc80 Bonsai, showed that BOD1-MBP binds strongly to this complex, particularly to the Ndc80/Nuf2-GST dimer. This interaction is essential for BOD1's recruitment to kinetochores, as depletion of Ndc80 in HeLa cells resulted in a significant loss of BOD1 from kinetochores (Schleicher2017The).
