# RNF2

## Overview
RNF2, or Ring Finger Protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a crucial component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). The RNF2 protein is characterized by a RING finger motif, classifying it as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing by catalyzing the monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119, a modification essential for transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction (Rao2009RNF2; Bajusz2018From). RNF2 is integral to maintaining stem cell pluripotency and regulating developmental processes, with its activity being crucial for proper embryonic development and cellular differentiation (Voncken2003Rnf2; Bajusz2018From). The protein's interactions with various components of the PRC1 complex, including CBX family proteins, underscore its role in forming multiprotein complexes necessary for its function in transcriptional regulation (Vandamme2011Interaction).

## Structure
RNF2, also known as Ring Finger Protein 2, is a 336-amino acid protein characterized by a unique C3HC4 RING finger motif spanning amino acids 40-90. This motif is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the monoubiquitination of lysine 119 on histone H2A, a key process in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing (Rao2009RNF2). The RING finger domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with Bmi-1, which enhances RNF2's ubiquitin ligase activity (Rao2009RNF2).

The RING domain of RNF2 features a conserved cross-brace fold, including a zinc-coordinating motif, two N-terminal β-strands, a central α-helix, and two bipartite zinc-coordination sites. These structural elements form a shallow cleft that serves as the E2 interaction site, essential for its ubiquitin ligase function (Gundogdu2019Structural). RNF2 can form specific interactions with E2 enzymes, such as a salt bridge with E2 α1, due to a carboxylate-containing residue on its ZI A, which may influence its ability to interact with a spectrum of E2s (Gundogdu2019Structural).

RNF2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine residues, particularly at Serine 41, mediated by the p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. These modifications suggest a regulatory role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling (Rao2009RNF2).

## Function
RNF2, also known as Ring Finger Protein 2, is a critical component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) in mammalian cells. It functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, catalyzing the monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 (K119), a modification that is essential for chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression (Bajusz2018From). This activity is crucial for maintaining repressed chromatin states and regulating gene expression, particularly in the context of developmental genes (Bajusz2018From).

RNF2 is involved in the formation and stability of PRC1 complexes, interacting with various CBX family proteins, which are part of these complexes. This interaction is vital for the integrity and function of PRC1 in chromatin-associated gene repression (Vandamme2011Interaction). RNF2 is active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency and regulating developmental processes (Bajusz2018From).

In embryonic development, RNF2 is essential for proper gastrulation and mesoderm formation, as its deficiency leads to developmental arrest and embryonic lethality (Voncken2003Rnf2). It also plays a role in repressing developmental control genes and maintaining embryonic stem cell identity (Bajusz2018From).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RNF2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In cancer, RNF2 overexpression is linked to the progression of various types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, and bladder urothelial carcinoma. Its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 is crucial for chromatin remodeling and gene silencing, processes that are often dysregulated in cancer. RNF2's involvement in pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and TGFβ signaling contributes to cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis (Yan2021Emerging).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, rare deleterious de novo missense variants in RNF2, such as p.R70H and p.S82R, have been identified. These variants are associated with severe intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, and other neurological symptoms. Functional studies in Drosophila suggest these mutations act as loss-of-function alleles, disrupting RNF2's interaction with BMI1 and its ability to ubiquitinate histone H2A, leading to a specific neurodevelopmental disorder (Luo2021Rare).

In zebrafish, loss of RNF2 results in cardiac defects due to the derepression of tbx-transcription factors, highlighting its role in maintaining proper gene expression during development (Chrispijn2019Loss).

## Interactions
RNF2, also known as Ring1B, is a key component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. RNF2 interacts with PHB2 (prohibitin2) and CP2c, forming a complex where PHB2 binds to the N-terminal and CP2c to the C-terminal of RNF2. This interaction is essential for repressing CP2c-stimulated transcriptional activity, particularly affecting the expression of the a-globin gene (Lee2008PHB2). 

RNF2 is also involved in interactions with CBX family proteins within the PRC1 complex. It consistently interacts with all CBX family members, although the specific interactions and affinities can vary among different CBX proteins, indicating distinct PRC1 complexes (Vandamme2011Interaction). 

In addition, RNF2 interacts with the linker region of human p-glycoprotein (Pgp), as identified through yeast two-hybrid analysis. This interaction involves the C-half of RNF2 and suggests a specific role in the function of Pgp related to drug resistance (Rao2006RNF2). 

These interactions highlight RNF2's role in forming multiprotein complexes and its involvement in transcriptional repression and chromatin modification.
