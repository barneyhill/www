# P2RX2

## Overview
The P2RX2 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2X2, a member of the P2X receptor family, which functions as a ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor is activated by extracellular ATP and is primarily involved in synaptic transmission and neuromodulation. The P2X2 receptor is characterized by its structure, which includes two transmembrane domains, an extracellular loop, and intracellular termini, forming a trimeric assembly that can be either homomeric or heteromeric. It plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, particularly in the auditory and vestibular systems, where it contributes to sound transduction and balance. Mutations in the P2RX2 gene have been linked to hearing impairments, including autosomal dominant deafness and noise-induced hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance (Mittal2015Molecular; Mittal2016Characterization; George2019Hearing).

## Structure
The P2RX2 gene encodes the P2X2 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel activated by ATP. The primary structure of the P2X2 receptor consists of a sequence of amino acids forming two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2), an extracellular loop, and intracellular N- and C-termini (North2016P2X; Mittal2015Molecular). The secondary structure includes alpha helices that form the transmembrane domains, with TM2 lining the pore of the channel (Mittal2015Molecular).

The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the receptor, with the extracellular loop containing 10 cysteine residues forming five disulfide bridges, a conserved structural motif (Mittal2015Molecular). The quaternary structure of the P2X2 receptor is a trimer, composed of either homotrimeric or heterotrimeric assemblies (North2016P2X; Illes2020Update).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which influences receptor desensitization, particularly at a protein kinase C site at Thr18 in the amino-tail (Mittal2015Molecular). The P2X2 receptor exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, such as the P2X2a and P2X2b variants, which affect desensitization rates (MortonJones2015Properties). These structural features are crucial for the receptor's function in various physiological processes, including auditory function and taste perception (Mittal2015Molecular; Illes2020Update).

## Function
The P2RX2 gene encodes the P2X2 receptor, a purinergic receptor that functions as an ATP-gated ion channel. This receptor is primarily involved in synaptic transmission and neuromodulation, facilitating the influx of cations such as calcium and sodium, which influences neuronal excitability and communication (Illes2020Update; Mittal2016Characterization). P2X2 receptors are expressed abundantly in the nervous system, including the cochlea and other parts of the ear, where they play a critical role in auditory neurotransmission and sound transduction (Illes2020Update; Mittal2016Characterization).

In the auditory system, P2RX2 is essential for hair cell mechanotransduction and tolerance to noise, with ATP binding causing conformational changes that open the channel pore, allowing cation internalization (Mittal2016Characterization). The receptor's ATPase activity is crucial for its function, as ATP hydrolysis is required for channel opening and gating (Mittal2016Characterization). P2X2 receptors also contribute to taste perception by mediating epithelial-to-neuronal signaling in taste buds (Illes2020Update).

In the vestibular system, P2RX2, along with P2RX4, mediates cation absorption in transitional and supporting cells of the utricular macula, playing a protective role during high-intensity stimuli (Jeong2020P2RX2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the P2RX2 gene are associated with several forms of hearing loss, including autosomal dominant deafness-41 (DFNA41) and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The P2RX2 p.V60L mutation is linked to progressive sensorineural hearing loss, characterized by early onset and progression to deafness, often exacerbated by noise exposure (Yan2013Mutation; Liu2019Progressive). This mutation results in a constitutively open channel that is insensitive to ATP, disrupting normal cochlear function and leading to hearing impairment (George2019Hearing).

Other mutations, such as p.Gly353Arg and p.Asp273Tyr, have been identified in different populations and are associated with similar hearing loss phenotypes. The p.Gly353Arg mutation affects ion channel gating and stability, contributing to the pathogenesis of hearing loss (Faletra2014A). The p.Asp273Tyr mutation results in nonfunctional channels, further implicating P2RX2 in hearing loss (George2019Hearing).

Alterations in P2RX2 expression levels, such as down-expression due to DNA hypermethylation, are linked to age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) in elderly individuals, suggesting that epigenetic changes may also play a role in hearing loss (Bouzid2018Downexpression).

## Interactions
The P2RX2 receptor, a member of the P2X receptor family, participates in various interactions with other proteins, forming both homomeric and heteromeric complexes. It can heteromerize with P2X1 subunits, resulting in the formation of P2X1/2 heteromers. These heteromers exhibit distinct functional properties compared to homomeric P2X1 receptors, such as altered responses to extracellular pH. However, the heteromerization process is inefficient and not consistently observed, complicating further characterization (MarquezKlaka2008Intersubunit).

P2RX2 also interacts with phosphoinositides (PIPns), which are crucial for channel gating and stabilization. Specific lysine residues, such as K365 and K369, are involved in this interaction, enhancing the receptor's open conformation (Habermacher2016Molecular; Mittal2016Characterization).

Zinc ions modulate P2RX2 activity through a biphasic allosteric mechanism. In the rat P2X2 receptor, residues like H120 and H213 are involved in zinc potentiation. In humans, the presence of R225 instead of H213 results in zinc inhibition, but mutating R225 to cysteine can restore zinc potentiation, indicating a similar mechanism to the rat receptor (Habermacher2016Molecular).
