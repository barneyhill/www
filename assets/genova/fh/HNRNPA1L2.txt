# HNRNPA1L2

## Overview
The HNRNPA1L2 gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 like 2, a member of the hnRNP-A/B family, which is involved in RNA binding and processing. This protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and glycine-arginine-rich (RGG) motifs, which facilitate its role in the packaging of pre-mRNA into hnRNP particles and the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of poly(A) mRNA (Shishkin2019Heterogeneous; Piazzi2023Alternative). HNRNPA1L2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including RNA splicing and transcription regulation, and interacts with the histone variant H3.3-G34W, particularly in the context of giant cell tumor of bone (Lee2024H3.3G34W). The gene's involvement in RNA processing and its interactions with other proteins underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer and spinal muscular atrophy (Wu2019Functional; Garofalo2023Preliminary).

## Structure
The HNRNPA1L2 protein is a member of the hnRNP-A/B family, characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities. It contains two RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains located near the N-terminus, which are crucial for RNA binding. These domains are almost equal in size, with the first RRM domain being slightly longer than the second by 2-5 amino acids (Shishkin2019Heterogeneous). The RRM domains typically consist of 70-85 amino acid residues forming a conserved structure with two consensus sequences, RNP-1 and RNP-2, that facilitate RNA binding (Shishkin2019Heterogeneous).

In addition to the RRM domains, HNRNPA1L2 has glycine-arginine-rich (RGG) motifs in its C-terminal region, which are involved in binding to RNA and DNA. These motifs are characterized by the presence of glycine residues preceding arginine residues, forming a positively charged arginine radical that interacts with negatively charged phosphate groups (Shishkin2019Heterogeneous). The protein is involved in the packaging of pre-mRNA into hnRNP particles and the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of poly(A) mRNA (Piazzi2023Alternative). HNRNPA1L2 expresses one transcript and one isoform, and is located on chromosome 13q14.3 (Piazzi2023Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
The HNRNPA1L2 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in RNA processing and splicing. In the context of giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB), the H3.3-G34W mutation, which is prevalent in over 90% of GCTB cases, interacts with hnRNPA1L2, leading to significant splicing aberrations. This interaction results in altered exon skipping and inclusion patterns, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis (Lee2024H3.3G34W). The mutation's presence causes a redistribution of hnRNPA1L2, affecting gene expression and splicing events, which may have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying GCTB (Lee2024H3.3G34W).

In spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the expression of HNRNPA1L2 is upregulated following treatment with nusinersen, suggesting its involvement in the recovery of splicing machinery affected by the disease. This upregulation may serve as a marker of treatment response, reflecting changes in splicing accuracy and mRNA processing (Garofalo2023Preliminary).

Additionally, the HNRNPA1L2 gene is involved in the formation of chimeric RNAs, such as the HNRNPA1L2-SUGT1 chimera, which has been studied in the context of bladder cancer. This chimeric RNA may play a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, highlighting its potential significance in cancer biology (Wu2019Functional).

## Interactions
The HNRNPA1L2 protein interacts with the histone variant H3.3-G34W, particularly in the context of giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB). This interaction is significant in transcription and RNA processing, as HNRNPA1L2 shows a four-fold increase in peak numbers in the presence of H3.3-G34W compared to control cells, indicating novel RNA targets associated with the G34W mutation (Lee2024H3.3G34W). HNRNPA1L2 and H3.3-G34W co-localize on many exons, including those in genes with dense exon clusters, contributing to splicing aberrations enriched for HNRNPA1L2 binding motifs (Lee2024H3.3G34W).

HNRNPA1L2 is also involved in significant splicing events, particularly exon skipping and inclusion, influenced by its motifs at upregulated splicing events. This suggests a role in RNA splicing and a functional interaction with H3.3-G34W, affecting E2F target genes and cell cycle regulation, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (Lee2024H3.3G34W). The interaction with H3.3-G34W leads to a redistribution of HNRNPA1L2's binding sites, shifting from the 3'UTR in parental cells to include the 5'UTR in the H3.3-G34W background (Lee2024H3.3G34W).
