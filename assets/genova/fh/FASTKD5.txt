# FASTKD5

## Overview
FASTKD5 is a gene that encodes the FAST kinase domains 5 protein, which is primarily involved in mitochondrial RNA processing. The protein plays a crucial role in the maturation of precursor mitochondrial RNAs, particularly those not flanked by tRNAs, thereby ensuring proper mitochondrial function and efficient oxidative phosphorylation (Carbajosa2022Identification; Ohkubo2021The). FAST kinase domains 5 is categorized as a mitochondrial RNA-binding protein and is enriched in mitochondrial RNA granules, where it is essential for the assembly of mitochondrial ribosomal subunits and the regulation of mitochondrial translation (Antonicka2015Mitochondrial). The protein's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids underscore its multifaceted role in cellular energy production, metabolism, and disease processes, including cancer and mitochondrial dysfunction (MagranerPardo2021Systematic; Ohkubo2021The).

## Function
FASTKD5 is a protein that plays a critical role in mitochondrial RNA processing, particularly at non-canonical junctions. It is essential for the maturation of precursor mitochondrial RNAs that are not flanked by tRNAs, which is crucial for proper mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation (Carbajosa2022Identification; Ohkubo2021The). FASTKD5 is involved in the processing of non-canonical mitochondrial transcripts encoded on the heavy strand, and its depletion leads to the accumulation of unprocessed precursor RNAs, affecting the levels of mature transcripts such as COX I mRNA (Antonicka2015Mitochondrial).

The protein is enriched in mitochondrial RNA granules and is crucial for the assembly of mitochondrial ribosomal subunits, impacting both the small and large subunits (Antonicka2015Mitochondrial). FASTKD5 is also involved in the regulation of mitochondrial translation and the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, particularly affecting the synthesis of COX I protein and the assembly of Complex IV (Antonicka2015Mitochondrial; Ohkubo2021The). Its role in RNA processing and stability is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function, influencing cellular energy production and metabolism (Ohkubo2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FASTKD5 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and mitochondrial dysfunction. In cancer, FASTKD5 is frequently mutated in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and skin cutaneous melanoma, with mutation rates of 5-7% and 4%, respectively (MagranerPardo2021Systematic). These mutations often co-occur with other cancer-related genes, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (MagranerPardo2021Systematic).

FASTKD5 is also involved in mitochondrial RNA processing, and its loss can lead to defects in mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation, which are critical for cellular energy production (Ohkubo2021The). This dysfunction can contribute to severe mitochondrial pathologies, although specific diseases directly linked to FASTKD5 mutations are not detailed (Ohkubo2021The).

In the context of sarcoidosis, FASTKD5 interacts with NLRX1, a gene associated with familial sarcoidosis, suggesting a potential role in mitochondrial dysfunction during the disease (Pacheco2021Autophagy). The gene's involvement in mitochondrial RNA processing and its interactions with other proteins highlight its significance in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and its potential impact on disease when altered (Ohkubo2021The).

## Interactions
FASTKD5 is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, primarily within the context of mitochondrial RNA processing and cancer signaling pathways. It interacts with proteins such as NTRK1 and FBXO6, which are part of cancer signaling pathways, suggesting a role in cancer progression (MagranerPardo2021Systematic). FASTKD5 also interacts with HERC2 and UBC, indicating its involvement in broader cellular processes (MagranerPardo2021Systematic).

In mitochondrial RNA processing, FASTKD5 is essential for the synthesis of COX1 protein and the assembly of Complex IV. It interacts with FASTKD4, as shown by BioID analysis, but does not interact with FASTKD3, suggesting cell-type specific effects (Ohkubo2021The). FASTKD5 is also involved in the cleavage of non-canonical RNA junctions, potentially through intrinsic nuclease activity or by recruiting an unidentified nuclease (Ohkubo2021The).

FASTKD5's interaction with NLRX1 is crucial for regulating oxidative phosphorylation and enhancing HIV-1 replication in CD4 T cells. This interaction is strengthened during HIV-1 infection, although it does not alter FASTKD5 expression levels (Guo2021Multiomics). These interactions highlight FASTKD5's multifaceted role in mitochondrial function and disease processes.
