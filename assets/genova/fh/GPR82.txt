# GPR82

## Overview
GPR82 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 82, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is part of the P2Y12-like family and is known for its selective interaction with G protein subunits, particularly the Gαi protein, which is indicative of its specific coupling profile (Lu2024Constitutive; Riddy2017G). Although the physiological role of GPR82 is not fully elucidated, it has been implicated in metabolic regulation and inflammatory processes, with its expression being modulated by factors such as glycine (GutiérrezRojas2022Glycine). The gene's expression is notably high in the hypothalamus, suggesting a potential involvement in appetite regulation and energy balance (Engel2011Reduced). Despite its potential significance, the endogenous ligand and detailed signaling pathways of GPR82 remain unidentified, leaving its precise biological and clinical roles an area of ongoing research (Riddy2017G).

## Clinical Significance
The GPR82 gene, encoding a G protein-coupled receptor, has been implicated in metabolic regulation, particularly in relation to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Studies involving GPR82-deficient mice have shown that these mice exhibit reduced body weight, lower body fat content, and improved glucose tolerance, suggesting a role in energy balance and metabolic processes (Engel2011Reduced). In human studies, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the GPR82 gene, such as rs6609159 and rs4827286, have been associated with lower body mass index (BMI) and body fat content, particularly in males, indicating potential genetic links to obesity-related traits (Engel2011Reduced).

The gene's expression is highest in the hypothalamus, suggesting a possible role in appetite regulation, although the exact mechanisms remain speculative (Engel2011Reduced). Despite these findings, the precise clinical implications of GPR82 mutations or alterations in expression are not fully understood, as the gene's endogenous ligand and detailed signaling pathways have yet to be identified (Riddy2017G). The high mutability of GPR82, due to its proximity to telomeres and high A+T content, suggests a potential for genetic variations that could impact its clinical significance (Raines2022DrugTargeted).

## Interactions
GPR82, a G protein-coupled receptor, has been shown to interact specifically with G protein subunits. Studies using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays have demonstrated that GPR82 forms GDP-sensitive complexes with G i1 heterotrimers, indicating a specific interaction with G i1 proteins. This interaction is not observed with other G protein subtypes such as G s, G q, or G 13 heterotrimers, suggesting a selective coupling profile for GPR82 (Lu2024Constitutive).

GPR82 is part of the P2Y12-like family of receptors, which are known to couple with the Ga i protein. Despite the limited information on the specific physiological role of GPR82, its interaction with Ga i proteins aligns with the coupling characteristics of its receptor family (Riddy2017G).

The receptor's expression and potential interactions are modulated by factors such as glycine, which can increase GPR82 transcription levels in inflammatory environments. This modulation suggests that GPR82 may play a role in inflammatory processes, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context have not been detailed (GutiérrezRojas2022Glycine).
