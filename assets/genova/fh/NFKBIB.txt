# NFKBIB

## Overview
NFKBIB is a gene that encodes the protein NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta (IκBβ), which is a critical component of the NF-κB signaling pathway. As a member of the IκB family, IκBβ functions primarily as an inhibitor of NF-κB transcription factors, which are pivotal in regulating immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. The protein achieves this by binding to NF-κB dimers in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing their translocation to the nucleus and subsequent activation of target genes (Othumpangat2017Upregulation). IκBβ is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate its interaction with NF-κB and contribute to its regulatory role (Othumpangat2017Upregulation). The degradation of IκBβ, triggered by phosphorylation, allows NF-κB to enter the nucleus and initiate transcriptional programs essential for immune and inflammatory responses (McKenna2015Inhibiting). The gene's expression and function are implicated in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Lerebours2008NFkappa).

## Structure
The NFKBIB gene encodes the IκBβ protein, which is part of the IκB family that regulates NF-κB transcription factors. The primary structure of IκBβ consists of a sequence of amino acids forming ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with NF-κB dimers (Othumpangat2017Upregulation). The secondary structure of IκBβ includes alpha helices within these ankyrin repeats, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of ankyrin repeats into a solenoid shape, which is typical for proteins in this family. This solenoid shape facilitates the binding and inhibition of NF-κB by sequestering it in the cytoplasm, preventing its translocation to the nucleus (Othumpangat2017Upregulation).

In terms of quaternary structure, IκBβ interacts with NF-κB dimers, forming a complex that regulates the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating the degradation and function of IκBβ. Phosphorylation marks IκBβ for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and activate gene transcription (Othumpangat2017Upregulation).

## Function
NFKBIB, also known as IκBβ, is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway in human cells. In healthy cells, NFKBIB forms complexes with NF-κB dimers, sequestering them in the cytoplasm and preventing their translocation to the nucleus. This sequestration inhibits the transcription of NF-κB target genes, which are involved in processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses (Othumpangat2017Upregulation; McKenna2015Inhibiting).

Upon exposure to specific stimuli, such as infections or inflammatory signals, NFKBIB undergoes phosphorylation, leading to its degradation. This degradation releases NF-κB, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of genes necessary for the immune response and inflammation (Othumpangat2017Upregulation; McKenna2015Inhibiting). NFKBIB is particularly involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory genes, as it preferentially binds to cRel-containing NF-κB dimers, which target unique DNA sequences (McKenna2015Inhibiting).

The regulation of NF-κB by NFKBIB is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and controlling inflammatory responses, highlighting its importance in cell biology and organismal health (Othumpangat2017Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NFKBIB gene, which encodes the NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving inflammatory and immune responses. In the context of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), NFKBIB is significantly upregulated, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of this aggressive cancer type. This upregulation occurs independently of proliferation and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) status, indicating a distinct mechanism of action in IBC (Lerebours2008NFkappa).

The NF-kappa-B signaling pathway, regulated by NFKBIB, is crucial in controlling inflammation and immune responses. Dysregulation of this pathway can lead to abnormal immune responses, contributing to the development of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Alterations in NFKBIB expression may result in enhanced NF-kappa-B activity, promoting inflammatory processes and potentially leading to disease progression (Lerebours2008NFkappa).

While specific mutations in NFKBIB have not been extensively detailed in the provided context, the gene's role in regulating NF-kappa-B suggests that any significant alterations could have broad implications for immune system function and inflammatory disease pathogenesis. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance of NFKBIB mutations and expression changes.

## Interactions
NFKBIB, also known as NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta, is involved in several key interactions within the NF-κB signaling pathway. It interacts with NF-κB dimers, particularly the RelA:RelA homodimer, stabilizing these low-affinity dimers and enhancing their formation. This stabilization is crucial for the expression of specific NF-κB target genes such as MIP-2 and TNFα (Tsui2015IκBβ). NFKBIB also interacts with the NF-κB p65 subunit, similar to IκBα, but exhibits distinct molecular interactivity and phosphorylation status in reactions catalyzed by IKK2 (Shoji2020The).

In the context of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), NFKBIB is part of an autoregulatory loop involving KIT and RELA. Nuclear KIT binds to the promoter of NFKBIB, enhancing its expression, which in turn regulates RELA activity and KIT expression (Hsueh2019Nuclear). This loop is significant in the context of imatinib-resistant GISTs, where NFKBIB downregulation leads to increased RELA nuclear translocation and reduced KIT transcription (Hsueh2019Nuclear).

NFKBIB is also regulated by miR-4776, which downregulates its expression, leading to increased NF-κB activity. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of influenza virus infection, where NFKBIB downregulation is associated with enhanced viral replication (Othumpangat2017Upregulation).
