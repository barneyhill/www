# CST3

## Overview
The CST3 gene encodes cystatin C, a small, non-glycosylated protein that functions as a potent inhibitor of cysteine proteases, particularly cathepsins. Cystatin C is categorized as a protease inhibitor and plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including protein turnover, immune regulation, and apoptosis. The protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi stacks, where it is secreted in its active monomeric form. Structurally, cystatin C is characterized by a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a long α-helix, stabilized by disulfide bridges. It can form dimers through 3D domain swapping, which is relevant in certain pathological conditions such as hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy. The CST3 gene and its encoded protein are implicated in several clinical conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Mussap2004Biochemistry; Li2018Cystatin; Xu2015Cystatin).

## Structure
Cystatin C (CST3) is a small, non-glycosylated protein consisting of 120 amino acid residues. Its primary structure includes a hydrophobic leader sequence of 26 amino acids, which is cleaved to produce the mature protein (Mussap2004Biochemistry). The secondary structure of cystatin C is characterized by a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet wrapped around a long α-helix. This structure is further stabilized by two β-bulge elements that contribute to the curvature of the β-sheet (Mussap2004Biochemistry). The tertiary structure is maintained by disulfide bridges between Cys73 and Cys83, and Cys97 and Cys117, which are crucial for the protein's stability (Mussap2004Biochemistry).

Cystatin C can form dimers through a process known as 3D domain swapping, which involves the exchange of subdomains between two molecules. This dimerization results in a loss of inhibitory activity against C1-type proteases but retains affinity for mammalian legumain (Mussap2004Biochemistry). The dimerization is particularly relevant in the context of the L68Q variant, which is prone to forming amyloid fibrils and is associated with hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (Abrahamson1994Increased; Ekiel1996Foldingrelated).

## Function
Cystatin C, encoded by the CST3 gene, is a potent inhibitor of cysteine proteases, particularly cathepsins, which are involved in various biological processes such as protein turnover, pro-protein processing, bone remodeling, antigen presentation, and apoptosis (Xu2015Cystatin). In healthy human cells, cystatin C is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi stacks, where it is constitutively secreted. During its maturation, it forms a transient dimer to prevent interference with cysteine proteases in the secretion pathway, dissociating into an active monomer before secretion (Mussap2004Biochemistry).

Cystatin C plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protease activity, ensuring proper cellular function, and preventing pathological processes. It is involved in controlling apoptosis, where it can have both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic effects depending on the context (Xu2015Cystatin). The protein is also implicated in immune regulation, affecting processes such as antigen presentation and cytokine production, which are essential for immune responses (Zi2018Involvement). Cystatin C's regulation of cysteine proteases is vital for maintaining tissue integrity and modulating inflammatory responses (Zi2018Involvement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CST3 gene, which encodes cystatin C, are associated with several diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), a polymorphism in CST3 is identified as a risk factor for late-onset AD, particularly in individuals over 80 years old. The GG genotype of CST3 is linked to a two-fold increased risk of AD, and cystatin C colocalizes with amyloid-beta in cerebral vessels, a common abnormality in AD brains (Crawford2000A). 

In hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a specific mutation in CST3 leads to the deposition of cystatin C in cerebral vessel walls, resulting in microvascular degeneration and cerebral hemorrhage (Crawford2000A). 

CST3 polymorphisms are also associated with cerebral white matter lesions in elderly individuals. The minor allele haplotype -82C/+4C/+148A is linked to decreased plasma CST3 levels and an increased risk of deep and subcortical white matter hyperintensity (DSWMH) and periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) (Maniwa2020Association). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CST3 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to healthy tissues, suggesting its potential role as a serum marker for HCC (Zhou2019Investigation). 

CST3 also plays a role in endothelial cell function and angiogenesis. Its expression is influenced by VEGFA blocking, which inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and migration, indicating CST3's involvement in vascular development and related diseases (Li2018Cystatin).

## Interactions
Cystatin C (CST3) is known to interact with various proteins, influencing its role in physiological and pathological processes. One significant interaction is with heparan sulfate (HS), a major component of the extracellular matrix. CST3 binds to HS in a pH-dependent manner, with stronger binding observed at lower pH levels. This interaction involves two clusters of residues in CST3, one at the N-terminus and another around the histidine residue H90, which are crucial for forming a complete HS-binding site (Zhang2021pHdependent). The binding of HS to CST3 significantly impairs its inhibitory activity towards cysteine proteases like papain, suggesting a regulatory role in protease inhibition (Zhang2021pHdependent).

CST3 also interacts with cathepsins, inhibiting their proteolytic activity, which is crucial in processes such as bone resorption and inflammation (Jiang2020The). In the context of vascular development, CST3 interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), where blocking VEGFA increases CST3 expression. This interaction affects endothelial cell functions, including proliferation and migration, and is associated with angiogenesis (Li2018Cystatin). These interactions highlight CST3's multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
