# EMC3

## Overview
EMC3 is a gene that encodes the ER membrane protein complex subunit 3, a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC). This protein is part of the Oxa1 superfamily of membrane protein transporters and plays a significant role in the insertion and assembly of transmembrane domains (TMDs) into the lipid bilayer. As a transmembrane protein, EMC3 is involved in the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins, interacting cotranslationally with nascent polypeptides to stabilize them and prevent premature degradation. The protein forms a stable subcomplex with EMC6, characterized by a hydrophobic groove and a nine-transmembrane domain structure, facilitating the insertion of TMDs. EMC3 is also implicated in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and is associated with the unfolded protein response, ensuring the correct folding and surface expression of certain proteins (Hegde2022The; Shurtleff2018The; Wu2023EMC).

## Structure
EMC3 is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC) and is part of the Oxa1 superfamily of membrane protein transporters. It is involved in the insertion and assembly of transmembrane domains (TMDs) into the lipid bilayer. EMC3 forms a stable subcomplex with EMC6, characterized by a hydrophobic groove that spans the membrane and a nine-transmembrane domain (TMD) structure. This subcomplex includes a three-helix bundle similar to the core of bacterial YidC and archaeal YidC-like proteins, forming a hydrophilic vestibule with conserved basic residues crucial for TMD insertion (Hegde2022The).

The structure of EMC3 is conserved across the Oxa1 superfamily, featuring a two-helix hairpin in its first cytosolic loop, which is involved in substrate recruitment. This hairpin interacts with EMC3's C-terminal tail and EMC2, and mutations in this region can affect substrate insertion (Hegde2022The). EMC3's hydrophilic vestibule is implicated in facilitating the translocation of hydrophilic tails of proteins, providing a conducive environment for TMD insertion (Wu2023EMC). EMC3 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing.

## Function
EMC3 is a critical component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a vital role in the insertion and folding of transmembrane domains (TMDs) into the ER membrane. EMC3 is part of a stable subdomain within the EMC that includes a nine-transmembrane domain structure, forming a horseshoe-shaped hydrophobic groove that spans the membrane. This structure facilitates the insertion of TMDs, which are typically hydrophobic and span the membrane as α-helices (Hegde2022The).

EMC3 is involved in the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins, interacting cotranslationally with nascent polypeptides to stabilize them and prevent premature degradation. This function is crucial for the proper folding and function of these proteins, which often contain destabilizing TMDs (Shurtleff2018The). EMC3's role extends to the insertion of tail-anchored proteins and N exo signal anchors into the ER membrane, where it facilitates the translocation of hydrophilic segments across the membrane (Hegde2022The).

The EMC3 subunit is also implicated in maintaining ER homeostasis and is associated with the unfolded protein response, ensuring the correct folding and surface expression of certain proteins (Hegde2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the EMC3 gene can lead to significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of respiratory and developmental disorders. EMC3 is crucial for the stability and processing of surfactant proteins and lipids, which are essential for lung function at birth. The deletion of EMC3 in mice results in disrupted surfactant protein and lipid homeostasis, leading to respiratory failure and neonatal lethality due to surfactant deficiency (Tang2017EMC3). This suggests that mutations or dysregulation of EMC3 could be linked to conditions involving surfactant deficiency and respiratory distress in newborns (Tang2017EMC3).

The absence of EMC3 also induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which can cause cell injury and contribute to severe lung diseases (Tang2017EMC3). Additionally, EMC3 is involved in the biogenesis of transmembrane proteins, and mutations in EMC3 can affect the stability and abundance of these proteins, potentially impacting various cellular processes (MillerVedam2020Structural). While specific diseases directly linked to EMC3 mutations are not detailed, the gene's role in protein homeostasis and cellular stress responses indicates its broader clinical significance.

## Interactions
EMC3, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), is involved in various interactions crucial for the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins. EMC3 interacts cotranslationally with nascent polypeptides, stabilizing them and preventing premature degradation. This interaction is essential for the proper folding and function of these proteins, particularly those with destabilizing transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Shurtleff2018The). EMC3 is part of a subcomplex with EMC6, forming a hydrophobic groove that spans the membrane, and interacts with other EMC components such as EMC4 and EMC7 (Hegde2022The). 

EMC3's interactions are not limited to the EMC subunits. It has been shown to physically interact with the C-terminal TMDs of multipass membrane proteins during their insertion process. This interaction is facilitated by EMC3's hydrophilic vestibule, which plays a role in substrate access and TMD insertion (Wu2023EMC). The structural arrangement of EMC3 within the EMC complex, including its interactions with EMC6 and other transmembrane helices, has been elucidated through cryo-electron microscopy, providing insights into its role in the complex's function (MillerVedam2020Structural).
