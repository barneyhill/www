# C5

## Overview
The C5 gene encodes the complement component 5 protein, a critical element of the immune system's complement cascade. This protein is categorized as a component of the complement system, which plays a pivotal role in innate immunity. Upon activation, the C5 protein is cleaved into two fragments: C5a and C5b. C5a acts as a potent anaphylatoxin, mediating inflammatory responses and recruiting immune cells to sites of infection or injury, while C5b initiates the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which targets pathogens for lysis (Cheng2012Complement; Manthey2009Complement). The C5 protein's interactions with its receptors and other complement components underscore its importance in immune regulation and pathogen defense. Mutations in the C5 gene can lead to increased susceptibility to infections and are associated with various autoimmune conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Degn2011DiseaseCausing; Chaturvedi2021Antiphospholipid).

## Structure
The human complement component C5 is a 1676 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 188 kDa. It is composed of alpha and beta chains linked by disulfide bonds, forming a precursor to the active fragments C5a and C5b (Manthey2009Complement). The primary structure of C5 includes a signal peptide and multiple domains, such as the macroglobulin (MG) domains, which are crucial for its function in the complement system (Rawal2001Structurefunction).

The secondary structure of C5 is characterized by a combination of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing C5 to interact with other components of the complement system (Rawal2001Structurefunction). The quaternary structure of C5 is significant in its role in the complement cascade, as it assembles into complexes that facilitate the cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b (Rawal2001Structurefunction).

Post-translational modifications of C5 include glycosylation, which is not essential for its function, and cleavage by C5 convertase enzymes to release the active fragment C5a (Manthey2009Complement). These modifications are crucial for the regulation and activation of C5 in the immune response.

## Function
The C5 gene encodes the complement component 5 protein, which plays a crucial role in the immune system. In healthy human cells, C5 is cleaved into two fragments: C5a and C5b. C5a functions as a potent anaphylatoxin, promoting inflammation and recruiting immune cells to sites of infection or injury. It binds to receptors C5aR and C5L2 on immune cells, with C5aR being a G protein-coupled receptor involved in signaling pathways that enhance cytokine production and immune cell activation (Monk2007Function; Cheng2012Complement).

C5a is also involved in T cell responses, acting as an autocrine regulator that supports T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. This is achieved through its interaction with C5aR on T cells and antigen-presenting cells, which is essential for maintaining T cell viability and function (Strainic2008Locally). C5a signaling is linked to the activation of PI3-Kg and subsequent AKT phosphorylation, crucial for T cell survival and proliferation (Strainic2008Locally).

C5b, on the other hand, initiates the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which targets pathogens for lysis, contributing to pathogen elimination (Hansen2019Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C5 gene are associated with increased susceptibility to infections, particularly those caused by Neisseria species, such as Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Individuals with C5 deficiency are at a significantly higher risk of developing recurrent invasive infections due to the inability to form the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is crucial for lysing these bacteria (Degn2011DiseaseCausing; Mayilyan2012Complement). C5 deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive condition, with fewer than 100 cases reported, often in individuals with consanguineous parents (Ikeuchi2021Chronic).

The absence of C5a, a potent chemotactic factor and anaphylatoxin, due to C5 deficiency, does not lead to different bacterial infections compared to other terminal component deficiencies, although it might suggest different infection susceptibilities (Skattum2011Complement). C5 deficiency is also linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and meningitis caused by Neisseriae (Grumach2014Are).

Alterations in C5 activity are implicated in autoimmune diseases and conditions like antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), where complement activation plays a critical role in pregnancy loss and thrombosis (Chaturvedi2021Antiphospholipid). These findings underscore the clinical significance of C5 in immune defense and disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
The human gene C5 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the complement system, primarily through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. Upon activation, C5 is cleaved by C5 convertases into two fragments: C5a and C5b. C5a is a potent inflammatory mediator that interacts with its receptors, CD88 (C5aR1) and C5L2 (C5aR2), on various immune and non-immune cells. CD88 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that triggers inflammatory responses, while C5L2 may act as a decoy receptor, modulating the bioavailability of C5a and its signaling (Pandey2020Emerging; Noris2013Overview; Woodruff2011Inhibiting).

C5b initiates the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) by sequentially binding to complement components C6, C7, C8, and C9. This complex can insert into cell membranes, leading to cell lysis or other non-cytolytic roles such as promoting inflammation and coagulation (Woodruff2011Inhibiting). The interactions of C5 with other proteins are not limited to the complement system; for instance, thrombin and other coagulation factors can cleave C5, linking the complement and coagulation systems (Amara2010Molecular). Additionally, RNA aptamers have been developed to inhibit C5 cleavage, preventing the formation of C5a and C5b, thus offering potential therapeutic applications (Biesecker1999Derivation).
