# PAX3

## Overview
PAX3 is a gene that encodes the paired box 3 protein, a transcription factor integral to the regulation of developmental processes, particularly in neural crest and myogenic cell lineages. The PAX3 protein is characterized by a paired domain and a homeodomain, which facilitate its binding to DNA and subsequent regulation of gene expression. This protein plays a pivotal role in the development of various cell types, including melanocytes and muscle precursor cells, by influencing pathways critical for cell migration, differentiation, and proliferation. Mutations in the PAX3 gene are associated with Waardenburg syndrome, a genetic disorder marked by auditory and pigmentary abnormalities, and have been implicated in certain cancers, such as rhabdomyosarcoma and melanoma. The gene's ability to produce multiple isoforms through alternative splicing underscores its evolutionary significance and functional versatility (Blake2014Pax; Birrane2009Structural; Pingault2010Review).

## Structure
The PAX3 protein is a transcription regulatory protein characterized by a paired domain and a homeodomain, both crucial for DNA binding. The homeodomain is a 60-residue DNA-binding module that is conserved across a large family of transcription regulatory proteins. It binds to DNA as a symmetric dimer, inducing a slight bend in the DNA helix. The N-terminal arm of the homeodomain inserts into the minor groove of the DNA, while the recognition helix fits into the major groove, interacting with bases in both strands and the sugar-phosphate backbone (Birrane2009Structural).

The PAX3 homeodomain forms a globular structure with an extended N-terminal arm and three alpha-helices (R1, R2, and R3). Helices R1 and R2 are antiparallel and perpendicular to R3, which fits into the DNA's major groove. The dimeric interface of the homeodomain forms a continuous surface interacting with DNA, involving hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions (Birrane2009Structural).

Alternative splicing of the PAX3 gene results in different isoforms, which can affect the protein's structure and function. For example, the presence of intron 8 in the mature mRNA leads to a different C-terminus in the protein (Barber1999PAX3). These isoforms are conserved across species, indicating their evolutionary significance (Barber1999PAX3).

## Function
PAX3 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of various cell types, particularly neural crest cells and myogenic cells. In neural crest cells, PAX3 is essential for the induction and specification of these multipotent cells, which give rise to diverse cell types, including melanocytes and Schwann cells. It regulates the expression of early neural crest specifiers such as snail1, sox8, and myc, which are crucial for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process necessary for cell migration and differentiation (Blake2014Pax).

PAX3 also plays a significant role in myogenesis, where it is expressed in the presomitic mesoderm and early somites, contributing to the development of skeletal muscle and the vertebral column. It regulates the hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met, which is necessary for muscle precursor cell migration, particularly in limb development (Blake2014Pax). In adult muscle, PAX3 is involved in satellite cell function, promoting proliferation and maintaining a progenitor state necessary for muscle regeneration (Collins2009Integrated).

In melanocyte development, PAX3 initiates a melanogenic cascade by activating the expression of MITF, a transcription factor essential for melanogenesis, while preventing terminal differentiation until external signals relieve its repressive effects (Lang2005Pax3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PAX3 gene are primarily associated with Waardenburg syndrome (WS), a genetic disorder characterized by auditory and pigmentary abnormalities. Waardenburg syndrome is divided into several types, with PAX3 mutations most commonly linked to types 1 (WS1) and 3 (WS3). WS1 is characterized by features such as congenital sensorineural hearing loss, dystopia canthorum, heterochromia irides, and white forelock (Tassabehjl1994PAX3; Pingault2010Review). WS3, also known as Klein-Waardenburg syndrome, includes additional musculoskeletal abnormalities (Baldwin1995Mutations).

PAX3 mutations can be diverse, including point mutations, splice-site mutations, and chromosomal deletions. These mutations often lead to loss of function, resulting in haploinsufficiency and affecting the development of neural crest derivatives, such as melanocytes, and limb buds (Read1997Waardenburg; Baldwin1995Mutations). The phenotypic variability observed in individuals with identical PAX3 mutations suggests the influence of other genetic or environmental factors (Machado2001Pax3).

Altered PAX3 expression is also implicated in certain malignancies, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma, and neuroblastoma, highlighting its role in both developmental disorders and cancer (Pingault2010Review).

## Interactions
PAX3 is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in developmental processes. It interacts with the HIRA protein, a transcriptional co-repressor, through two independent binding domains located C-terminal to the WD repeat region of HIRA. This interaction is significant in the context of developmental syndromes such as Waardenburg syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome, where altered stoichiometry of complexes containing HIRA may contribute to the phenotypes observed (Magnaghi1998HIRA).

PAX3 also forms complexes with Meis2 and Pax7 during dorsal midbrain development. These interactions are important for regulating the expression of Meis2 and its target gene efnb1, as well as maintaining a balance between Pax3 and Pax7 expression. This regulatory network is crucial for proper midbrain development and the specification of tectal fate (Agoston2012Genetic).

In the context of myogenic lineage specification, PAX3 interacts with chromatin looping proteins such as LDB1 and the Cohesin complex. These interactions facilitate chromatin architecture changes and enhancer activity, influencing gene expression during embryonic mesoderm development (Magli2019Pax3).
