# RNF183

## Overview
RNF183 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 183, which is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is predominantly expressed in the kidney, particularly within the renal medullary collecting duct, where it plays a significant role in cellular adaptation to hypertonic conditions. As a transmembrane protein, RNF183 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and stress response pathways through its interactions with various substrates, including the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit and Bcl-xL. The protein's stability and localization are influenced by its interaction with Sec16A, which prevents its degradation via the ER-associated degradation pathway. RNF183's involvement in disease pathogenesis, such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Geng2017RNF183; Wu2018Transmembrane; Okamoto2020The).

## Structure


## Function
RNF183 is a tissue-specific ubiquitin ligase predominantly expressed in the kidney, particularly in the renal medullary collecting duct. It plays a crucial role in cellular adaptation to hypertonic conditions, which are characteristic of the kidney environment. RNF183 is regulated by the transcription factor NFAT5, which is essential for cellular adaptation to hypertonicity. Under these conditions, RNF183 helps protect renal medullary cells from apoptosis by ubiquitylating specific substrates, such as the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit. This ubiquitylation leads to the degradation of the Na,K-ATPase complex, aiding in the kidney's adaptation to osmotic stress by regulating cell volume and solute absorption (Okamoto2020Hypertonicityresponsive; Okamoto2020The).

RNF183 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosome. Its stability is influenced by its interaction with Sec16A, a protein involved in COPII vesicle formation, although Sec16A is not a substrate for RNF183. This interaction prevents RNF183 from undergoing rapid degradation through the ER-associated degradation pathway, thereby stabilizing the protein and promoting its proper localization within the cell (Wu2018Sec16A).

## Clinical Significance
RNF183 is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), RNF183 is upregulated in the inflamed colon, where it promotes the lysosomal degradation of DR5, a death receptor involved in apoptosis. This process may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD by affecting epithelial cell apoptosis and necroptosis, suggesting RNF183 as a potential drug target (Wu2019Inflammatory).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), RNF183 is significantly upregulated and associated with larger tumor size, deeper invasion, and advanced disease stages. It promotes CRC cell proliferation and metastasis through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which increases IL-8 expression. This oncogenic role makes RNF183 a potential target for therapeutic intervention in CRC (Geng2017RNF183).

RNF183 is also a prognostic biomarker in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), where its high expression correlates with favorable survival outcomes. It is linked to tumor purity and immune infiltrates, indicating a role in tumor immunity regulation (Geng2020RNF183). These findings highlight RNF183's involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RNF183, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, participates in several protein interactions that influence its function and stability. It interacts with Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, promoting its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which triggers apoptosis during prolonged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Wu2018Transmembrane). RNF183 also interacts with Sec16A, a protein involved in COPII vesicle formation. This interaction stabilizes RNF183 by preventing its degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, highlighting Sec16A's role in regulating RNF183's stability and localization (Wu2018Sec16A).

In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), RNF183 interacts with DR5, a death receptor, leading to its ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. This interaction facilitates TRAIL-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role in IBD pathogenesis (Wu2019Inflammatory). RNF183 also interacts with the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit, promoting its ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, which is crucial for cellular adaptation to hypertonic stress (Okamoto2020Hypertonicityresponsive). These interactions underscore RNF183's involvement in apoptosis regulation and stress response pathways.
