# PRPF18

## Overview
PRPF18 is a gene that encodes the pre-mRNA processing factor 18, a protein integral to the spliceosome complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is categorized as a spliceosomal component and plays a crucial role in the second step of pre-mRNA splicing. The PRPF18 protein interacts with various spliceosomal proteins, including PRPF4, and is involved in critical biological processes such as oocyte maturation and early embryonic development (Nemcova2016Detection). Additionally, PRPF18 has been implicated in host-pathogen interactions, as it can interact with proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, potentially affecting host RNA splicing (Chauhan2024AMycobacterium). Its expression is also linked to pluripotency and RNA processing pathways, with alterations in its levels associated with fertilization failure in human oocytes (Suo2018Transcriptome).

## Interactions
PRPF18 is a component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with various proteins within the spliceosome, including PRPF4 and other tri-snRNP components (Rajiv2018Structural). PRPF18 is involved in the second step of pre-mRNA splicing and its transcript levels change during oocyte maturation and early embryonic development, indicating its role in these processes (Nemcova2016Detection).

PRPF18 has been shown to physically interact with Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins, such as Rv1435c, which can alter host RNA splicing. This interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting a direct interaction between PRPF18 and the bacterial protein (Chauhan2024AMycobacterium).

In the context of pluripotency, PRPF18 expression is affected by the depletion of proteins like PNN, which are crucial for the second catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing. This suggests that PRPF18 is part of a network of interactions that maintain pluripotency-specific spliceosome assembly (Kim2017The).

PRPF18 is also involved in RNA processing pathways, and its downregulation has been associated with fertilization failure in human oocytes, indicating its critical role in RNA splicing (Suo2018Transcriptome).
