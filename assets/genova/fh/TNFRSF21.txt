# TNFRSF21

## Overview
TNFRSF21, also known as death receptor 6 (DR6), is a gene that encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, specifically a transmembrane receptor protein. This receptor is involved in mediating apoptosis and regulating immune responses, playing a crucial role in both physiological and pathological processes. DR6 is expressed in various tissues, including the lymphoid organs, heart, brain, and pancreas, indicating its widespread functional significance (Unknownauthors2009Therapeutic). The protein encoded by TNFRSF21 is implicated in the activation of key signaling pathways such as JNK and NF-κB, which are essential for cell survival and immune function (Unknownauthors2009Therapeutic). Additionally, TNFRSF21 has been associated with several diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Pan2019TNFRSF21; Zhou2021Aberrant).

## Function
TNFRSF21, also known as death receptor 6 (DR6), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and immune regulation. DR6 is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels in lymphoid organs, heart, brain, and pancreas, indicating its significant role in these tissues (Unknownauthors2009Therapeutic). 

In terms of molecular function, DR6 is involved in the activation of the JNK and NF-κB pathways, which are crucial for cell survival and immune responses (Unknownauthors2009Therapeutic). It forms complexes with the adaptor protein TRADD, leading to NF-κB activation, which is essential for immune responses and cell survival (Unknownauthors2009Therapeutic). DR6 also modulates NF-ATc transcription activity in T-cells and affects NF-κB signaling in B-cells, influencing their proliferation and survival (Unknownauthors2009Therapeutic).

In DR6-deficient mice, there is enhanced T-cell proliferation and skewed Th2 cytokine production, suggesting that DR6 plays a regulatory role in adaptive immunity (Unknownauthors2009Therapeutic). The absence of DR6 leads to increased Th2 immune responses and resistance to certain autoimmune conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Unknownauthors2009Therapeutic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNFRSF21 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TNFRSF21 is frequently upregulated, correlating with high-grade tumors and advanced stages, which are associated with poor prognosis. This upregulation promotes tumor aggressiveness through the ERK/FOXM1 signaling pathway, suggesting that targeting this axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy (Zhou2021Aberrant).

In high myopia, a condition characterized by severe nearsightedness, TNFRSF21 mutations such as the P146A variant have been identified. These mutations are associated with increased apoptosis in retinal pigment epithelial cells, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of high myopia (Pan2019TNFRSF21).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, TNFRSF21 is significantly upregulated, with lower expression levels linked to better overall survival. Its expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration, indicating a potential role in the tumor microenvironment (Xu2022N6methyladenosine).

In osteosarcoma, TNFRSF21 acts as an inhibitory factor, with overexpression leading to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Li2024Identification).

## Interactions
TNFRSF21, also known as death receptor 6 (DR6), is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in apoptosis and other cellular processes. TNFRSF21 interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, facilitating its translocation to the mitochondria, which is crucial for DR6-induced apoptosis. This interaction bypasses the traditional apoptotic pathways involving caspase-8 and Bid, highlighting a unique mitochondria-dependent mechanism (Zeng2012Death).

In the context of immune regulation and inflammation, TNFRSF21 interacts with the TNFR type 1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), which subsequently activates NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. These interactions are significant for modulating inflammation and immune response-related gene expression (Pan2019TNFRSF21).

In lung cancer, TNFRSF21 is part of a regulatory axis involving the lncRNA MIR31HG and miR-193a-3p. The lncRNA MIR31HG sponges miR-193a-3p, leading to the upregulation of TNFRSF21, which is implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma (Mo2022A). This axis highlights the complex regulatory networks in which TNFRSF21 participates, influencing cancer cell behavior and offering potential therapeutic targets.
