# DLAT

## Overview
The DLAT gene encodes the enzyme dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase, a critical component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which is essential for cellular respiration. This enzyme is categorized as a transferase, specifically involved in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, thereby linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The protein is localized in the mitochondria, where it plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism and ATP production. Beyond its metabolic functions, DLAT is involved in immune regulation, influencing CD8+ T cell activation. Mutations in the DLAT gene are associated with various medical conditions, including primary biliary cholangitis and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and have implications in cancer progression and prognosis (Qin2024Identification; Bai2022A; Zhang2023Comprehensive).

## Structure
The human gene DLAT encodes the dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase, a key component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The primary structure of DLAT consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the foundation for its higher-level structures. In terms of secondary structure, DLAT includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of DLAT results in a stable three-dimensional conformation essential for its enzymatic activity.

DLAT's quaternary structure involves the assembly of multiple subunits, which is crucial for its role in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This complex assembly allows DLAT to interact effectively with other components of the complex, facilitating the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. The protein contains specific domains, such as the lipoyl domain and the catalytic domain, which are integral to its function. These domains enable DLAT to bind lipoic acid and catalyze the transfer of acetyl groups.

Common post-translational modifications of DLAT include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions within the cell. These modifications play a role in the dynamic regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, impacting cellular metabolism.

## Function
DLAT (dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase) is a key component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It plays a crucial role in cellular respiration by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, a pivotal step that links glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This conversion is essential for the production of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell, thereby supporting various cellular functions and energy metabolism in healthy human cells (Qin2024Identification; Bai2022A).

DLAT is involved in the lipoylation process, which is critical for the proper functioning of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Lipoylation defects can lead to altered mitochondrial morphology and reduced activity of the PDC, impacting energy metabolism (Monteuuis2017A; Wehbe2019The). The protein is exclusively localized in the mitochondria, highlighting its role in mitochondrial function and energy production (Qin2024Identification).

In addition to its metabolic functions, DLAT is implicated in the regulation of immune responses, as it mediates metabolic changes that can affect the activation of CD8+ T cells (Bai2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DLAT gene have been linked to several medical conditions. In primary biliary cholangitis, an autoimmune liver disease, patients lose immune tolerance to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex component PDC-E2, leading to destructive lymphocytic cholangitis and potentially cirrhosis or liver failure (Zhang2023Comprehensive). Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, characterized by primary lactic acidosis and neurological dysfunction, is also associated with DLAT gene mutations (Zhang2023Comprehensive).

In cancer, DLAT is implicated in tumor development and progression. It acts as an upstream acetyltransferase promoting cell growth in cancer cells, with increased expression observed in gastric cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Chen2022PM2.5; Zhang2023Comprehensive). In NSCLC, DLAT overexpression enhances glycolysis metabolism, promoting cell viability and inhibiting apoptosis, which correlates with poorer prognosis and lower overall survival (Chen2022PM2.5).

DLAT is also a significant prognostic marker in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), where high expression levels correlate with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival. It is associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints, suggesting a role in immune response modulation and potential as a biomarker for immunotherapy sensitivity (Fang2023CuproptosisRelated; Zhang2023Comprehensive).
