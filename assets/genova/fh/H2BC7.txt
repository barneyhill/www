# H2BC7

## Overview
The H2BC7 gene encodes the protein H2B clustered histone 7, which is a member of the histone H2B family. Histones are essential nuclear proteins that package and order DNA into structural units called nucleosomes, playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. H2B clustered histone 7 is involved in the formation of the nucleosome core, around which DNA is wrapped, and is crucial for maintaining chromatin stability and facilitating transcriptional regulation. This protein is part of the larger histone H2B family, which is characterized by its role in chromatin compaction and gene regulation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
