# NT5M

## Overview
NT5M is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme 5',3'-nucleotidase, which plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism within the mitochondria. This enzyme is categorized as a nucleotidase, responsible for the dephosphorylation of nucleotides, thereby regulating the balance of nucleotide pools essential for mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. The protein encoded by NT5M is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with proteins such as TM4SF1 and DDR1, which are implicated in cancer pathways, particularly in epithelial ovarian cancer (Huang2021Prognostic; Huang2023Prognostic). Additionally, NT5M is a substrate for the Zika virus ns2B/ns3 protease, indicating its role in viral pathogenesis (Morazzani2019Proteolytic). The gene is located on chromosome 17p11.2, a region associated with Smith-Magenis syndrome, suggesting potential clinical significance in genetic disorders (Rampazzo2002Mouse). Alterations in NT5M expression have been linked to cancer, particularly affecting nucleotide metabolism in triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease mechanisms (Kim2022Nucleotide).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the NT5M gene, which encodes a mitochondrial 5',3'-nucleotidase, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. The NT5M gene is located on chromosome 17p11.2, a region associated with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), a genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, behavioral problems, and distinct facial features. Although the direct clinical significance of NT5M mutations in SMS is not fully established, its proximity to the critical region suggests a potential link (Rampazzo2000A; Rampazzo2002Mouse).

In cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), NT5M plays a role in nucleotide metabolism. Alterations in NT5M expression can lead to imbalances in deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pools, affecting cell viability and inducing apoptosis in metabolically vulnerable cancer cells. This suggests that NT5M's substrate specificity and its impact on nucleotide metabolism could be relevant for understanding its role in cancer cell viability and apoptosis (Kim2022Nucleotide).

Overall, disruptions in NT5M may affect mitochondrial function, potentially contributing to mitochondrial disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, impacting energy production and cellular homeostasis (Rampazzo2000A).

## Interactions
NT5M, also known as 5',3'-nucleotidase, mitochondrial, is involved in nucleotide metabolism within the mitochondria. It has been identified as a protein that interacts with both TM4SF1 and DDR1, which are highly expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer. These interactions were identified using the STRING database, which revealed that NT5M is part of a network of proteins enriched in pathways related to the extracellular matrix and cell adhesion (Huang2021Prognostic; Huang2023Prognostic).

In the context of viral infections, NT5M is a substrate for the Zika virus (ZIKV) ns2B/ns3 protease. This interaction involves the cleavage of NT5M by the viral protease, which may play a role in the virus's strategy to evade host immune responses (Morazzani2019Proteolytic). The cleavage site of NT5M by the ZIKV protease is located near the mitochondrial processing peptidase site, suggesting a potential impact on mitochondrial function (Morazzani2019Proteolytic).

These interactions highlight NT5M's involvement in both cancer-related pathways and viral pathogenesis, indicating its potential significance in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
