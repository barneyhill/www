# TMEM8B

## Overview
TMEM8B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 8B, which is a crucial component of the cell membrane in humans. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in maintaining cellular structure and facilitating various cellular processes, including signaling and communication. These functions are essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, thereby contributing to tissue development and homeostasis. The protein's role in cell signaling pathways suggests it may interact with other membrane proteins or intracellular molecules to modulate cellular responses. Understanding TMEM8B's function is vital for elucidating its involvement in diseases where these processes are disrupted, such as cancer (Pemov2017The; Yarza2021Current; Wu2020Circulating).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM8B, or transmembrane protein 8B, is a protein encoded by the TMEM8B gene in humans. It is primarily located in the cell membrane, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and function. TMEM8B is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and communication, which are essential for normal cellular and organismal homeostasis. The protein's activity influences key cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. These processes are vital for the development and maintenance of healthy tissues and organs. By regulating these cellular activities, TMEM8B contributes to the balance between cell growth and death, ensuring proper tissue function and organismal health. The precise molecular mechanisms by which TMEM8B exerts its effects are still under investigation, but its role in cell signaling pathways suggests it may interact with other membrane proteins or intracellular signaling molecules to modulate cellular responses. Understanding the function of TMEM8B in healthy human cells is important for elucidating its potential involvement in various diseases where these processes are dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM8B has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), TMEM8B-a, an isoform of the NGX6 gene product, acts as a metastasis suppressor. However, it is rapidly degraded via the proteasome pathway, mediated by Ezrin, in many NPC and lung cancer cell lines. This degradation occurs despite the protein not being ubiquitinated. Stabilizing TMEM8B-a expression with proteasome inhibitors like MG-132 or bortezomib can prevent its degradation, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach by targeting proteasome dysregulation in NPC (Yarza2021Current).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMEM8B is included in a diagnostic panel for predicting prognosis, although specific mutations or expression alterations directly associated with TMEM8B in HCC are not detailed (Wu2020Circulating).

In neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas, TMEM8B is noted among genes with down-regulated expression in tumors compared to normal Schwann cells, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis (Pemov2017The).

These findings highlight the significance of TMEM8B in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
