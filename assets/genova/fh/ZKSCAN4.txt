# ZKSCAN4

## Overview
ZKSCAN4 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein with KRAB and SCAN domains 4, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in transcriptional regulation, primarily within the nucleus of human cells. It contains several conserved domains, including a SCAN domain, a KRAB domain, and a zinc finger domain, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Ecker2008A). ZKSCAN4 is notably involved in modulating gene expression in response to glucocorticoid signaling through its interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Ecker2008A). The protein's expression is particularly high in the brain, suggesting a potential role in neurological processes (Sun2015Association). Clinically, ZKSCAN4 has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and is implicated in cancer risk, highlighting its significance in both psychiatric and oncological research (AlNaama2020C2H2Type; Zhang2023Exposing).

## Structure
The ZKSCAN4 protein is characterized by several conserved domains that contribute to its function and localization. It contains an N-terminal SCAN domain, which is leucine-rich, a middle KRAB (Kruppel-associated box)-A domain, and a C-terminal zinc finger domain comprising seven C2H2 zinc fingers (Ecker2008A). These domains are involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation (Ecker2008A).

The zinc finger domain is particularly important for nuclear localization and interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). It includes a nucleolar targeting signal sequence, as indicated by the nucleolar localization of the C-terminal fragment (Ecker2008A). A nuclear localization signal (NLS) is identified within the protein, specifically between amino acids 295 and 365, which includes a KHRR sequence. Mutations in this sequence affect the protein's nuclear localization, underscoring its role as an NLS (Ecker2008A).

ZKSCAN4 does not overlap with certain subnuclear structures but partially co-localizes with regions enriched in histone H3 mono-methylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me1), associated with transcriptional activation (Ecker2008A). The protein's interaction with GR and its chromatin-dependent transcriptional repression suggest a complex regulatory role in gene expression (Ecker2008A).

## Function
ZKSCAN4 is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation within the nucleus of healthy human cells. It contains a KRAB domain, which is typically associated with transcriptional repression, and a SCAN domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Sun2015Association). ZKSCAN4 interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), suggesting a role in modulating gene expression in response to glucocorticoid signaling. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that ZKSCAN4 may influence GR-mediated signaling pathways (Ecker2008A).

The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and is highly expressed in the brain, indicating its potential involvement in neurological processes (Sun2015Association). ZKSCAN4 has been shown to co-localize with chromatin regions enriched in histone H3 mono-methylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me1), which are associated with transcriptional activation. However, its overexpression can reduce glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional activation in a chromatin-dependent manner, suggesting a potential repressive role in certain contexts (Ecker2008A). Despite its involvement in these molecular processes, the specific function of ZKSCAN4 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The ZKSCAN4 gene has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia. It is located on chromosome 6p21p22.1, a region previously identified as associated with schizophrenia. Several polymorphisms in ZKSCAN4 have shown strong associations with schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear (Zhang2013Replication; AlNaama2020C2H2Type). 

In addition to its role in neuropsychiatric conditions, ZKSCAN4 has been identified as one of the pleiotropic genes associated with genetic risk loci for esophageal and lung cancers. Its expression patterns have shown significant enrichment in various tissues, including the brain, suggesting its involvement in regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across different tissues (Zhang2023Exposing).

ZKSCAN4 also interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), potentially modulating GR activity through chromatin-dependent mechanisms. This interaction may influence transcriptional regulation, although specific diseases directly linked to this interaction have not been detailed (Ecker2008A). The gene's involvement in these diverse conditions highlights its clinical significance in both psychiatric and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
ZKSCAN4 is known to interact with several proteins and participate in various cellular processes. It has been identified as a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-interacting protein, where it co-precipitates with GR in HEK293 cells and Hct116 cells, but not in HeLa or CEM-C7H2 cells (Ecker2008A). This interaction is specific, as ZKSCAN4 does not co-immunoprecipitate with the progesterone receptor (PR) (Ecker2008A). The interaction with GR suggests a role in nuclear receptor signaling, as ZKSCAN4 overexpression leads to the redistribution of GR to granular nucleoplasmic structures (Ecker2008A).

ZKSCAN4 also interacts with several subunits of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), indicating a potential role in RNA-related functions (Helleboid2019The). It is associated with unique preys that may provide insights into its biological roles, and it shares subcellular localization patterns with its interactors (Helleboid2019The). Additionally, ZKSCAN4 is involved in the regulation of chromatin-dependent transcriptional repression, as it reduces glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional activation in certain contexts (Ecker2008A). These interactions highlight ZKSCAN4's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its potential impact on cellular signaling pathways.
