# CORO1C

## Overview
CORO1C is a gene that encodes the protein coronin 1C, a member of the coronin family of actin-binding proteins. Coronin 1C plays a pivotal role in the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for various cellular processes such as motility, cytokinesis, and signal transduction. The protein is characterized by a seven-bladed WD40 repeat-containing β-propeller structure, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and a coiled-coil motif that is crucial for oligomerization and membrane association (Spoerl2002Oligomerization; Chan2012Coronin). Coronin 1C is ubiquitously expressed across multiple tissues, with significant expression in the brain, lung, intestine, and kidney, and is involved in regulating cell morphology and intracellular trafficking (Spoerl2002Oligomerization; Rybakin2005Coronin). Its interactions with various proteins, including Rac1 and the Arp2/3 complex, underscore its role in actin dynamics and cellular invasiveness, particularly in the context of cancer (Tilley2015Integration; Castagnino2018Coronin).

## Structure
The CORO1C protein, encoded by the human CORO1C gene, is a member of the coronin family of actin-binding proteins. It consists of 474 amino acids and features several structural motifs that are characteristic of this protein family. The primary structure includes a seven-bladed WD40 repeat-containing β-propeller, which serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions (Tilley2015Integration; Chan2012Coronin). This β-propeller is flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions that contribute to the protein's stability (Chan2012Coronin).

The C-terminal region of CORO1C contains a coiled-coil motif, which is crucial for oligomerization and membrane association (Spoerl2002Oligomerization). This region is also responsible for binding and cross-linking F-actin, facilitating the protein's role in cytoskeletal organization (Spoerl2002Oligomerization). The protein's quaternary structure involves the formation of oligomers, which are essential for its function (Spoerl2002Oligomerization).

CORO1C also harbors a unique region with a second actin-binding site, which is not present in other coronin proteins, allowing for cooperative binding to F-actin (Chan2012Coronin). This cooperative binding is a distinguishing feature of CORO1C, enhancing its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton (Chan2012Coronin).

## Function
The human gene CORO1C encodes the protein coronin 1C, which is a member of the coronin family of actin-binding proteins. Coronin 1C is involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as motility, cytokinesis, and signal transduction (Iizaka2000Isolation). It is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the brain, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, ovary, and thymus, and is particularly prominent in the brain, lung, intestine, and kidney (Spoerl2002Oligomerization; Rybakin2005Coronin).

Coronin 1C localizes to F-actin-rich structures in the cytosol and is involved in cell morphology regulation. It interacts with F-actin and is associated with the submembranous cytoskeleton, particularly during cell spreading, adhesion, and migration (Spoerl2002Oligomerization; Rybakin2005Coronin). The protein's COOH-terminal region is crucial for its interaction with F-actin and for oligomerization, which is necessary for its membrane association (Spoerl2002Oligomerization). Coronin 1C is also involved in intracellular trafficking processes, contributing to the regulation of vesicular transport and cytoskeletal rearrangements (Rybakin2005Coronin). These functions are vital for maintaining cellular structure and dynamics, influencing processes like cell migration and immune response.

## Clinical Significance
The CORO1C gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting cell invasiveness and metastasis. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high expression of CORO1C is associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of metastasis. It is involved in the formation and function of invadopodia, which are actin-rich protrusions that facilitate cancer cell invasion by degrading the extracellular matrix (Castagnino2018Coronin). CORO1C's upregulation is linked to aggressive cancer markers such as estrogen receptor negativity and high Ki-67 levels (Castagnino2018Coronin).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), CORO1C overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and promotes metastasis through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Its high expression correlates with increased invasiveness and is linked to various pathological parameters, including lymph node and distant metastases (Wang2021CORO1C).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), CORO1C is significantly upregulated and associated with poor survival rates. It contributes to cancer cell aggressiveness and is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a critical step in metastasis. CORO1C expression is regulated by multiple microRNAs, which are often downregulated in PDAC tissues (Fukuda2023Coronin). These findings suggest that CORO1C is a potential therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
CORO1C, or coronin 1C, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with Rac1, a small GTPase, through its propeller domain, facilitating Rac1's redistribution and activation at the leading edge of cells (Tilley2015Integration). CORO1C also binds to RCC2 in its unique linker region, which influences Rac1 activation by sequestering it and preventing GEF-mediated activation (Williamson2014Coronin1C).

In the context of cancer, CORO1C interacts with cortactin (CTTN) in invadopodia, structures essential for cell invasion, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells (Castagnino2018Coronin). It also associates with the Arp2/3 complex, which is crucial for actin polymerization and invadopodia function (Castagnino2018Coronin). In colorectal cancer, CORO1C interacts with RAD23B, promoting invadopodia formation and enhancing cell migration and invasion (Li2021Cytoplasmic).

CORO1C is also involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, interacting with proteins like cofilin to maintain actin filament turnover (Castagnino2018Coronin). These interactions highlight CORO1C's role in cytoskeletal organization and its impact on cancer cell invasiveness.
