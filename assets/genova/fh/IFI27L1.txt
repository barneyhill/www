# IFI27L1

## Overview
IFI27L1, or interferon alpha inducible protein 27 like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the cellular response to interferons, which are critical components of the immune system's defense against pathogens. The protein encoded by IFI27L1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in regulating immune responses, apoptosis, and cellular stress responses. As a cytoplasmic protein, it may interact with other proteins or signaling pathways to influence cell survival and proliferation, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The involvement of IFI27L1 in these processes underscores its importance in balancing cell survival and death, particularly in response to external stressors and during immune challenges (Badla2023Genetic; Shojaei2023IFI27; Li2023Decoding).

## Structure


## Function
IFI27L1, or interferon alpha inducible protein 27 like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the cellular response to interferons. These signaling proteins are released in response to pathogens and play a crucial role in the immune response. The IFI27L1 protein is implicated in the regulation of immune responses, apoptosis, and cellular stress responses. It is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it may influence cell survival and proliferation. The protein's involvement in these processes suggests it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to external stressors. By modulating apoptosis, IFI27L1 can affect cell turnover and tissue remodeling, which are essential for normal development and immune function. Its activity in the cytoplasm indicates that it may interact with other cytoplasmic proteins or signaling pathways to exert its effects on cell biology. The precise molecular mechanisms by which IFI27L1 influences these processes remain an area of active research, but its role in immune regulation and cellular stress responses highlights its importance in maintaining the balance between cell survival and death in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
IFI27L1, or interferon alpha inducible protein 27 like 1, has been implicated in the clinical outcomes of several diseases, particularly in the context of viral infections and immune responses. In the case of COVID-19, rare truncating variants in IFI27L1 have been identified in patients with severe disease, suggesting a potential role in influencing disease severity. These genetic variants were more prevalent in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to those with mild or asymptomatic cases, indicating a possible genetic predisposition to severe outcomes (Badla2023Genetic). 

The gene is also associated with the severity of influenza virus infections, where its expression levels correlate with disease outcomes (Shojaei2023IFI27). In the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), IFI27L1 is involved in immune and inflammatory pathways, and its interactions with other genes in these pathways have been explored as potential biomarkers for SLE classification and treatment (Li2023Decoding). These findings highlight the significance of IFI27L1 in modulating immune responses and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in viral and autoimmune diseases.
