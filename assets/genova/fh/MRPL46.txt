# MRPL46

## Overview
MRPL46 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L46, which is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (Cheong2020Expression). As a structural constituent of the ribosome, MRPL46 is involved in maintaining translation fidelity and proper assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome, particularly in the integration of tRNA (Key2023Translation). The protein's function is crucial for mitochondrial health, and its dysregulation has been associated with clinical conditions such as non-syndromic hearing loss and potential implications in cancer prognosis (Liu2024The; PerezMartinez2008Protein).

## Function
MRPL46 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in cells (Cheong2020Expression). MRPL46 is involved in the structural constitution of ribosomes and exhibits hydrolase activity, indicating its role in mitochondrial protein synthesis and ribosomal function (Zhang2019iTRAQBased).

MRPL46 is located in the nucleoplasm, mitochondrion, and mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit, highlighting its involvement in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Zhang2019iTRAQBased). In the context of CLPP-null tissues, MRPL46 co-migrates and co-accumulates with CLPX in intermediate assemblies of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit, suggesting its role in the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, particularly in tRNA integration and translation fidelity (Key2023Translation). The protein is part of a cluster that holds mitochondrial tRNA-valine or tRNA-phenylalanine in the central protuberance of the mtLSU, which is crucial for translation fidelity (Key2023Translation).

## Clinical Significance
MRPL46 is associated with several clinical implications due to its role in mitochondrial function. Mutations or alterations in MRPL46 expression have been linked to non-syndromic hearing loss, specifically DFNA30, highlighting its potential impact on auditory function (PerezMartinez2008Protein). The gene is part of a protein cluster in the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) that is affected by the absence of CLPP, a protease involved in mitochondrial protein quality control. This cluster, which includes MRPL46, is crucial for the connection between mtLSU and the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mtSSU), and its disruption can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired translation efficiency (Key2023Translation).

In the context of cancer, MRPL46 has been identified as a potential protective gene in ovarian cancer prognosis, although it is not highlighted among the most significant genes in this context (Liu2024The). The role of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, including MRPL46, in cancer therapy is being explored, with mitochondrial translation being a target for therapeutic strategies (Kim2017Mitochondrial). However, specific diseases directly caused by MRPL46 mutations are not well-documented.
