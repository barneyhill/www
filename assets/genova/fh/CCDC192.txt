# CCDC192

## Overview
The CCDC192 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 192 protein, which is characterized by its structural motif known as the coiled-coil domain. This domain is often involved in facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC192 may play a role in various cellular processes. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC192 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in critical pathways is suggested by its association with certain clinical conditions. Notably, alterations in the CCDC192 gene have been linked to auditory and balance dysfunctions in animal models, as well as to oncogenic processes in human cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer (Lewis2021Collateral; Chang2021The). Further research is necessary to understand the precise mechanisms by which CCDC192 influences these diverse biological and pathological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC192 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In mice, a deletion involving CCDC192 is associated with complete deafness and vestibular dysfunction, characterized by behaviors such as circling and head bobbing. This phenotype suggests that CCDC192 may play a role in auditory and balance functions, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Lewis2021Collateral).

In human studies, CCDC192 has been identified in fusion genes associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Specifically, the SLC12A2-CCDC192 fusion was found among known gene fusions in a study of Taiwanese NSCLC patients. This fusion was present in a subset of patients, indicating a potential role in cancer development. The study suggests that fusion genes involving CCDC192 may contribute to oncogenic processes, although the precise impact on tumor biology requires further investigation (Chang2021The).

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of CCDC192 in both genetic hearing disorders and cancer, underscoring the need for additional research to elucidate its role in these conditions.
