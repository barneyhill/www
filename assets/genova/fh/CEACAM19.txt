# CEACAM19

## Overview
CEACAM19 is a gene that encodes the CEA cell adhesion molecule 19, a protein belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family. This protein is categorized as a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in cell adhesion and intracellular signaling processes. CEACAM19 is expressed in various human tissues, including the prostate, uterus, and breast, indicating its broad functional significance. The protein features conserved domains typical of eukaryotic translation initiation factors, suggesting a potential role in protein synthesis. Structurally, CEACAM19 includes IgV-like and IgC-like domains, which are crucial for its function in maintaining tissue architecture and regulating cellular processes. The gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple splice variants, although these do not encode functional protein isoforms. CEACAM19's expression and function are implicated in several cancers, making it a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis (MICHAELIDOU2013The; Pavlopoulou2014A; Zisi2020Identification).

## Structure
The CEACAM19 protein is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule family, characterized by its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling. The protein is encoded by a gene consisting of eight exons and seven introns, with a protein-coding region of 903 nucleotides, resulting in a 300-amino acid polypeptide (Zisi2020Identification). CEACAM19 contains a highly conserved domain typical of eukaryotic translation initiation factors, which is common among CEA proteins (Zisi2020Identification).

The extracellular region of CEACAM19 is organized into major protein domains, including IgV-like and IgC-like domains. The IgV-like domain's 3D structure was modeled using homology modeling, revealing conserved secondary structures and specific residues such as arginine and aspartate forming a salt bridge (Pavlopoulou2014A). The IgC-like domain also exhibits conserved secondary structures with invariant cysteine residues forming disulfide bridges (Pavlopoulou2014A). The transmembrane domains are predicted to adopt an alpha-helical conformation (Pavlopoulou2014A).

CEACAM19 is subject to alternative splicing, with 15 novel splice variants identified, although these transcripts do not encode functional protein isoforms and may function as non-coding RNAs (Zisi2020Identification). The protein's molecular structure, including its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, is not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Function
CEACAM19, a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule family, is involved in various molecular processes essential for normal cellular function. It is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, including the prostate, uterus, breast, skeletal muscle, small intestine, and kidney, indicating its functional importance across different cell types (Hu2019Aberrant; Zisi2020Identification). The protein encoded by CEACAM19 contains a conserved domain of eukaryotic translation initiation factors, which is common among carcinoembryonic antigen proteins, suggesting a role in protein synthesis (Zisi2020Identification).

CEACAM19 is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in intercellular adhesion and intracellular signaling events. These processes are crucial for maintaining tissue architecture and integrity, as well as regulating cell growth, differentiation, and immune responses (MICHAELIDOU2013The). Although the specific functions of CEACAM19 in healthy cells are not fully elucidated, its broad expression pattern and involvement in fundamental cellular processes suggest it plays a significant role in maintaining normal cellular and tissue homeostasis (Hu2019Aberrant; Zisi2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
CEACAM19 has been implicated in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and penile cancers, due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, CEACAM19 is significantly overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, with a 23-fold higher median expression in malignant tissues. This overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics, such as high tumor grade and a high Ki67 proliferative index, and is negatively associated with estrogen receptor status, being more prevalent in ER-negative tumors. These findings suggest that CEACAM19 could serve as a biomarker for breast cancer progression and prognosis (MICHAELIDOU2013The).

In ovarian cancer, CEACAM19 is also overexpressed, indicating its potential as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker (Zisi2020Identification). In penile cancer, CEACAM19 overexpression is linked to distant and lymph node metastasis, correlating with poor cancer-specific survival. Knockdown studies in penile cancer cells have shown that reducing CEACAM19 expression decreases cell growth, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in promoting a metastatic phenotype (Hu2019Aberrant).

These studies highlight CEACAM19's potential as a target for cancer diagnosis and treatment, given its involvement in tumor aggressiveness and metastasis.
