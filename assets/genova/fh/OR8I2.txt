# OR8I2

## Overview
The OR8I2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily I member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. Olfactory receptors, including OR8I2, are integral membrane proteins expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons of the main olfactory epithelium. They are responsible for initiating a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the perception of smell. The olfactory receptor gene family, to which OR8I2 belongs, is the largest in the mammalian genome, highlighting its evolutionary importance in sensory perception (Hughes2014Loss; DeMaria2010The).

## Function
The OR8I2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons located in the main olfactory epithelium. Upon binding to specific odorants, OR8I2 activates a signaling cascade involving the G protein (Gαolf), adenylyl cyclase, and cyclic AMP (cAMP). This cascade leads to the opening of ion channels and the depolarization of the neuron, resulting in the transmission of signals to the olfactory bulb in the brain, contributing to the perception of smell (DeMaria2010The).

The olfactory receptor family, to which OR8I2 belongs, is the largest gene family in mammals and is responsible for the sense of smell. These receptors are involved in both sensory detection and developmental processes, such as regulating their own expression and the patterning of synaptic connections (DeMaria2010The). The OR8I2 gene, like other olfactory receptors, is primarily active in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Hughes2014Loss).
