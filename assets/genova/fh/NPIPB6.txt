# NPIPB6

## Overview
NPIPB6 is a gene that encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member B6, a protein involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. This protein is part of a primate-specific sub-family characterized by Alu-derived insertions, which contribute to its unique structure and function (MartinezGomez2019Few). NPIPB6 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the testis and skin, and is influenced by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (Kim2021A). The protein plays a role in cellular processes such as transcription, cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix organization, and is particularly upregulated in high Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) producers, suggesting a potential involvement in viral production and replication (Tworig2024Transcriptomicsinformed). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and interactions of NPIPB6 in normal human physiology remain to be fully understood.

## Function
NPIPB6 is a member of the nuclear pore complex-interacting protein family, which plays a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. This protein family is involved in the regulation of the movement of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, crucial for gene expression regulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. NPIPB6 is expressed in the testis and is part of a primate-specific sub-family with Alu-derived insertions in its coding regions, which extend exons (MartinezGomez2019Few). These Alu elements are incorporated into the main coding isoform of NPIPB6, and the gene contains three Alu-derived exons validated by peptide evidence (MartinezGomez2019Few).

NPIPB6 shows tissue-specific expression patterns, with increased expression in skin sun-exposed lower leg and decreased expression in testis, suggesting a regulatory role influenced by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (Kim2021A). The protein is also implicated in processes related to Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) production, where it is upregulated in high AAV producers, indicating a potential role in transcription, cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix organization (Tworig2024Transcriptomicsinformed). Despite these insights, the specific function of NPIPB6 in healthy human cells remains unclear.

## Interactions
NPIPB6 is a member of the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, which is involved in interactions with components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). These interactions are crucial for nucleocytoplasmic transport, gene expression regulation, and cellular signaling pathways. The protein is upregulated in high Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) producers, indicating its potential role in enhancing AAV production through its involvement in nuclear transport and viral DNA replication (Tworig2024Transcriptomicsinformed).

NPIPB6 contains Alu-derived exons, which have been validated by peptide evidence, suggesting that these exons are translated into protein. This indicates that NPIPB6 may participate in interactions involving Alu-derived sequences, although specific protein interactions are not detailed (MartinezGomez2019Few).

The gene is also associated with tissue-specific expression changes linked to type 1 diabetes risk, mediated by enhancer SNPs. These genetic variations suggest complex transcriptional regulatory circuits involving NPIPB6, although specific protein interactions are not described (Kim2021A).

Overall, while NPIPB6 is implicated in various cellular processes and disease contexts, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
