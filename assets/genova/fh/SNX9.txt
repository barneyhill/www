# SNX9

## Overview
The SNX9 gene encodes the protein sorting nexin 9, a member of the sorting nexin family, which is characterized by its involvement in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. Sorting nexin 9 is a multidomain scaffold protein that includes a phox-homology (PX) domain, an SH3 domain, a low complexity (LC) domain, and a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain. These domains facilitate its role in binding lipids and proteins, enabling membrane interactions and deformation (TEASDALE2001A; Bendris2017Endocytosis). SNX9 is integral to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, insulin signaling, and angiogenesis, highlighting its importance in cellular processes such as membrane remodeling, receptor cycling, and actin cytoskeleton organization (Tanigawa2019SNX9; MACAULAY2003Insulin). The protein's interactions and functions underscore its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases like cancer and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (Shen2020SNX9; Bendris2016SNX9).

## Structure
Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) is a multidomain scaffold protein involved in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. It is part of the sorting nexin family and contains several key domains: a phox-homology (PX) domain, an SH3 domain at the N terminus, a low complexity (LC) domain, and a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain at the C terminus (TEASDALE2001A; Bendris2017Endocytosis). The PX domain is approximately 110 residues long, featuring three β-strands followed by three α-helices, and is involved in binding phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) (Teasdale2011Insights). The BAR domain facilitates membrane curvature and dimerization among SNX9 family members (Bendris2017Endocytosis).

SNX9's SH3 domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly binding to polyproline sequences (Teasdale2011Insights). The protein can form dimeric complexes through its PX-BAR module, which is crucial for membrane attachment and remodeling (Teasdale2011Insights). SNX9 also contains a DPW motif downstream of the SH3 domain, which is likely a binding site for adaptor protein complexes (LUNDMARK2002The). SNX9 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms and can undergo post-translational modifications, which may influence its function and interactions (Teasdale2011Insights).

## Function
Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) is a multifunctional scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It is part of the sorting nexin family, characterized by a phox-homology (PX) domain, an SH3 domain, a low complexity (LC) domain, and a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain, which enable SNX9 to bind to lipids and proteins, facilitating membrane interactions and deformation (Bendris2017Endocytosis). SNX9 is crucial for endocytosis and trafficking from the Golgi, necessary for membrane remodeling during cell division. It localizes to the midbody, suggesting a role in abscission, and is involved in the assembly of the contractile ring and recruitment of myosin-II, likely through N-WASP-dependent actin assembly (Bendris2017Endocytosis).

SNX9 also plays a role in insulin signaling by associating with insulin and IGF1 receptors, affecting receptor cycling and potentially influencing GLUT4 translocation, which is crucial for glucose transport in response to insulin (MACAULAY2003Insulin). In endothelial cells, SNX9 is essential for angiogenesis, as it regulates the recycling of integrin β1, affecting cell migration and proliferation (Tanigawa2019SNX9). SNX9's involvement in these processes highlights its critical role in maintaining cellular functions and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in SNX9 expression have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In breast cancer, increased SNX9 expression enhances cell invasion and metastasis through the RhoA-ROCK pathway and N-WASP activation, contributing to the cancer's aggressiveness and metastatic potential (Bendris2016SNX9). SNX9 acts as a scaffold interacting with RhoA and Cdc42, which is crucial for actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell motility, further promoting metastasis (Bendris2016SNX9).

In colorectal cancer, SNX9 is highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells, correlating with poor prognosis. It plays a role in angiogenesis by regulating integrin β1 recycling, which is essential for tumor progression (Tanigawa2019SNX9). SNX9's involvement in angiogenesis suggests it could be a target for antiangiogenic therapies in colorectal cancer (Tanigawa2019SNX9).

Conversely, in ADPKD, SNX9 is significantly downregulated, and its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and cyst development. This effect is mediated through the activation of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, suggesting SNX9's potential as a therapeutic target for managing ADPKD (Shen2020SNX9).

## Interactions
Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) is a multifunctional scaffold protein that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. SNX9 interacts with the insulin and IGF1 receptors, influencing insulin receptor trafficking and GLUT4 translocation, which are key processes in insulin-mediated glucose transport (MACAULAY2003Insulin). It binds specifically to the β2-appendage of the AP-2 complex, a component involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, through a DPW motif downstream of its SH3 domain (LUNDMARK2002Thea).

SNX9 also interacts with dynamin, a GTPase essential for vesicle scission during endocytosis, and is required for efficient clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Soulet2005SNX9). Through its SH3 domain, SNX9 binds to N-WASP, stimulating Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization, which is crucial for actin cytoskeleton organization and cell morphology (Bendris2017Endocytosis). SNX9's interactions extend to proteins involved in endocytic trafficking, such as WASP and AP-50, and it plays a role in membrane fission and actin regulation (MACAULAY2003Insulin). These interactions highlight SNX9's role in mediating cellular processes related to membrane dynamics and receptor expression.
