# OBSL1

## Overview
The OBSL1 gene encodes the protein obscurin-like cytoskeletal adaptor 1, which is a crucial component of the cellular cytoskeleton. This protein is characterized by its modular structure, comprising multiple immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and a fibronectin type III (Fn) domain, which facilitate its role as a cytoskeletal adaptor. OBSL1 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of cells by linking cytoskeletal elements with membrane-bound complexes, particularly in muscle tissues where it stabilizes sarcomere structures. It interacts with proteins such as titin and myomesin, contributing to the structural organization of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells (Geisler2007Obscurinlike; Fukuzawa2008Interactions). Beyond its structural role, OBSL1 is implicated in cellular signaling and is expressed in various tissues, indicating its broader significance in cellular architecture and function (Fukuzawa2008Interactions). Mutations in the OBSL1 gene are linked to 3-M syndrome, a disorder characterized by growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities, highlighting its clinical importance (Huber2010OBSL1mutations).

## Structure
The OBSL1 protein is characterized by a modular architecture that includes multiple immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and a fibronectin type III (Fn) domain. Structurally, it comprises four tandem amino-terminal Ig domains, a central Fn domain, and three carboxy-terminal Ig domains. The longest transcript of OBSL1 is predicted to encode 13 carboxy-terminal Ig domains (Geisler2007Obscurinlike). The protein's fibronectin-like domain is similar to the amino-terminal domain of obscurin, indicating a close evolutionary relationship (Geisler2007Obscurinlike).

OBSL1 interacts with other proteins through its Ig domains, forming complexes that stabilize cytoskeletal structures. It localizes to the intercalated disc, perinuclear region, and areas overlying the Z discs and M bands, suggesting its role as a cytoskeletal adaptor linking cellular support networks to membrane-bound structures (Geisler2007Obscurinlike). The protein forms a binary complex with titin through a parallel intermolecular beta-sheet, resulting in a V-shaped, zipper-like arrangement (Sauer2010Molecular).

OBSL1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. Western analysis has identified several isoforms, including the OBSL1 A isoform at 230 kDa and the OBSL1 B isoform at 130 kDa (Geisler2007Obscurinlike). These isoforms may have different structural and functional roles within the cell.

## Function
OBSL1, or obscurin-like 1, is a cytoskeletal adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of cells by linking cytoskeletal elements with membrane-bound complexes. It is primarily composed of immunoglobulin-like domains and a fibronectin-like adhesive domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for stabilizing sarcomere structure in muscle cells (Geisler2007Obscurinlike). OBSL1 localizes to intercalated discs, costameres, and the perinuclear region in cardiac myocytes, suggesting its involvement in the structural organization of cardiac cells (Geisler2007Obscurinlike).

In addition to its structural role, OBSL1 is implicated in cellular signaling processes. It may function as a scaffold for signaling complexes at the nuclear envelope, participating in signaling cascades that regulate cellular responses (Geisler2007Obscurinlike). OBSL1 also interacts with proteins such as titin and myomesin, contributing to the structural integrity of the M-band in muscle fibers (Fukuzawa2008Interactions).

OBSL1's role extends beyond muscle-specific functions, as it is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and non-muscle tissues like the lung and kidney, indicating its broader significance in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Fukuzawa2008Interactions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OBSL1 gene are associated with 3-M syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth retardation, facial dysmorphism, and skeletal abnormalities. These mutations often result in truncated proteins due to frameshift or nonsense mutations, leading to the absence of the protein via nonsense-mediated decay (Blondelle2019Murine; Huber2010OBSL1mutations). The clinical features of 3-M syndrome include slender long bones, a fleshy tipped nose, a triangular face, and midface hypoplasia (Hanson2009The). 

Research has identified several distinct mutations in the OBSL1 gene across different families, indicating genetic heterogeneity in 3-M syndrome (Huber2010OBSL1mutations). These mutations are linked to abnormal expression levels of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP2 and IGFBP5), suggesting their involvement in the pathogenesis of growth retardation (Huber2010OBSL1mutations). 

In some cases, OBSL1 mutations have been identified in consanguineous families with recurrent pregnancy losses, where affected fetuses exhibited skeletal abnormalities consistent with 3-M syndrome (Marshall2015Wholeexome). The OBSL1 gene's role in cytoskeletal organization and its interaction with other proteins, such as CUL7, further implicates it in growth factor signaling pathways (Hanson2009The).

## Interactions
OBSL1 (obscurin-like 1) is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in muscle structure and function. It interacts with myomesin, specifically binding to the linker region between domains My4 and My5, a connection confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens and pulldown assays (Fukuzawa2008Interactions). OBSL1 also interacts with titin, particularly the C-terminal Ig-domain M10, forming a ternary complex with titin and myomesin, which is crucial for maintaining sarcomeric structure (Fukuzawa2008Interactions).

In addition to its role in muscle tissues, OBSL1 is involved in the endocytosis of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) by interacting with the HPV16 L2 capsid protein. This interaction is essential for the virus's entry into host cells, as demonstrated by co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Wüstenhagen2016The). OBSL1 also associates with the ubiquitin ligase scaffold protein Cul7, localizing it to the Golgi apparatus, which is important for Golgi morphology and dendrite patterning in neurons (Litterman2011An). These interactions highlight OBSL1's diverse roles in cellular processes beyond muscle function.
