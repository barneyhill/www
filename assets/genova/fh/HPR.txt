# HPR

## Overview
The HPR gene encodes the haptoglobin-related protein, a member of the haptoglobin family, which plays a crucial role in the immune response and lipid metabolism. Unlike haptoglobin, the haptoglobin-related protein is primarily involved in the formation of trypanosome lytic factors, which are essential for the immune defense against Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis. The protein achieves this by forming complexes with apolipoprotein L1, facilitating a 'Trojan horse' mechanism to deliver lethal agents into the parasite. Additionally, HPR is implicated in cholesterol metabolism, with genetic variations in the HPR gene linked to differences in cholesterol levels. The gene's expression is modulated by a retrovirus-like element within its structure, which may contribute to its relatively low expression compared to haptoglobin (Guthrie2012Complexity; Maeda1986Polymorphisms; Hardwick2013Haptoglobin).

## Structure
The haptoglobin-related protein (HPR) shares structural similarities with haptoglobin, with notable differences in its amino acid sequence. The primary structure of HPR includes 28 amino acid differences compared to haptoglobin, with 16 differences located in the B chain, which are on the surface of the molecule and do not affect hemoglobin binding (Maeda1985Nucleotide). The HPR protein maintains an intact reading frame and potentially stable structure due to compensatory cysteine residues, despite having 27 amino acid substitutions compared to haptoglobin (Maeda1985Nucleotide).

The HPR gene contains a retrovirus-like element in its first intron, which may influence its transcription and expression levels (Maeda1986Polymorphisms). This element, named RTVL-Ia, includes sequences that can lead to aberrant splicing, reducing the steady-state levels of HPR mRNA (Hatada2003An). The presence of this retrovirus-like sequence is hypothesized to contribute to the low expression of HPR compared to the haptoglobin gene (Hatada2003An).

The HPR protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common in proteins of the haptoglobin family, although specific modifications for HPR are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The HPR gene encodes the haptoglobin-related protein, which plays a significant role in the immune response and inflammation. In healthy human cells, HPR is primarily active in the bloodstream and liver, where it binds free hemoglobin released from erythrocytes. This binding prevents oxidative damage by facilitating the recycling of iron and protecting tissues from oxidative stress (Hardwick2013Haptoglobin). The HPR protein forms a complex with apolipoprotein L1 (ApoL1) and is involved in the trypanolytic factor TLF-1, which targets Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis. This complex uses a 'Trojan horse' mechanism to deliver ApoL1 into the lysosomal compartment of the trypanosome, where it induces lysis and kills the parasite (Hardwick2013Haptoglobin).

HPR is also linked to the cholesterol system, as it acts as a ligand guiding the lytic complex to the parasite surface, providing a functional explanation for the association between HPR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cholesterol levels (Guthrie2012Complexity). The protein's interaction with lipoproteins suggests a specific role in modulating cholesterol metabolism and immune cell activity (Guthrie2012Complexity).

## Clinical Significance
The HPR (haptoglobin-related protein) gene is associated with several clinical conditions due to its genetic variations and expression levels. One significant association is with cholesterol levels, where the rs2000999 SNP in the HPR gene has been linked to variations in total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. This SNP is thought to influence cholesterol levels through its role in the trypanosome lytic factors, which are part of the immune response (Guthrie2012Complexity; Wang2019Association).

HPR gene variations also play a role in resistance to human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). The duplication of the HPR gene, particularly in African populations, may confer resistance to HAT by enhancing the effectiveness of trypanolytic factors. However, the evidence for a selective advantage due to this duplication is not definitive (Hardwick2013Haptoglobin).

Additionally, the HPR gene's association with hemoglobin levels and red cell count (RCC) has been noted, with the HP CNV affecting these traits. The Hp2 allele of the HP gene, which is in linkage disequilibrium with HPR, offers a selective advantage in conditions causing hemolysis or blood loss (Guthrie2012Complexity).

## Interactions
The haptoglobin-related protein (HPR) is involved in several interactions, primarily related to its role in the immune response against Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis. HPR forms a complex with hemoglobin, known as the Hpr-Hb complex, which does not bind to the macrophage scavenging receptor CD163. Instead, it remains in the serum bound to apolipoprotein L1 (ApoL1). Together, Hpr-Hb and ApoL1 constitute the trypanosome lytic factor-1 (TLF-1), which is crucial for lysing trypanosomes. This complex uses the trypanosome's receptor for haptoglobin to deliver ApoL1 into the lysosomal compartment of the trypanosome, where the low pH triggers lysis, effectively killing the parasite. This mechanism is described as a 'Trojan horse' approach (Hardwick2013Haptoglobin).

HPR is also a component of trypanosome lytic factor 2 (TLF-2), although this complex is less stable and less studied (Hardwick2013Haptoglobin). The interactions of HPR with ApoL1 and its role in forming TLF-1 and TLF-2 highlight its significance in the immune response and its potential impact on cholesterol levels due to its association with lipoproteins (Guthrie2012Complexity).
