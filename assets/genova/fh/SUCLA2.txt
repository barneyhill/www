# SUCLA2

## Overview
The SUCLA2 gene encodes the beta subunit of succinate-CoA ligase, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle. This enzyme is categorized as a ligase, specifically involved in the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, a reaction that is coupled with the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, thus contributing to cellular energy metabolism. The protein encoded by SUCLA2 is predominantly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, highlighting its importance in maintaining energy homeostasis (Dobolyi2013Exclusive; Matilainen2014Mitochondrial). Mutations in the SUCLA2 gene are linked to mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, type 5 (MTDPS-5), a severe metabolic disorder characterized by early-onset encephalomyopathy and other systemic manifestations (Jaberi2013The; Zhang2024Two). The enzyme's function and its interactions with other proteins underscore its significance in both normal physiology and disease states, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Tong2021SUCLA2coupled; Gut2020SUCLA2).

## Structure
The SUCLA2 gene encodes the beta subunit of succinate-CoA ligase, an enzyme involved in the Krebs cycle. The protein is approximately 463 amino acids in length and is primarily expressed in cardiac, skeletal muscle, and cerebral tissues (Zhang2024Two). The SUCLA2 protein is part of a heterodimeric enzyme complex, where it pairs with an invariant alpha subunit encoded by SUCLG1, forming either an ATP-forming or GTP-forming enzyme depending on the beta subunit (Dobolyi2013Exclusive).

The secondary structure of SUCLA2 includes critical domains such as the ATP-grasp domain, which is essential for its function. Mutations in this domain, such as p.Asp251Asn, can lead to structural changes like the formation of an α-helix from a loop, potentially affecting interactions between the alpha and beta subunits (Jaberi2013The). The protein's tertiary structure involves the 3D folding necessary for its enzymatic activity, and structural modeling has been used to predict these configurations (Jaberi2013The).

Post-translational modifications, such as succinylation, occur at specific lysine residues (Lys108, Lys116, and Lys143), which are crucial for substrate binding and are regulated by SIRT5. These modifications can alter the charge and potentially reduce the affinity for ADP, impacting the enzyme's function (Gut2020SUCLA2).

## Function
The SUCLA2 gene encodes the beta subunit of succinate-CoA ligase, an enzyme integral to the citric acid cycle. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, a reaction coupled with the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. This process is crucial for cellular energy metabolism, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (Nogueira2014A; Dobolyi2013Exclusive; Matilainen2014Mitochondrial).

In healthy human cells, SUCLA2 is predominantly expressed in neurons within the brain, where it plays a vital role in ATP production through the Krebs cycle. This neuronal-specific expression suggests that SUCLA2 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in neurons (Dobolyi2013Exclusive; Dobolyi2014Localization). The enzyme's activity is particularly important during conditions of anoxia or ischemia, as it can operate in the absence of oxygen, providing a critical energy source for cells under stress (Dobolyi2013Exclusive).

SUCLA2's function is also linked to the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA copy number, as it forms a complex with nucleoside diphosphate kinase, which is important for the salvage of deoxyribonucleotides necessary for mitochondrial DNA synthesis (Nogueira2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUCLA2 gene, which encodes the β-subunit of succinate-CoA ligase, are associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, type 5 (MTDPS-5). This condition is a severe, early-onset encephalomyopathy characterized by symptoms such as hypotonia, dystonia, sensorineural deafness, and developmental delays. Patients often exhibit elevated levels of methylmalonic acid and succinylcarnitine, as well as mitochondrial DNA depletion in muscle tissue (Jaberi2013The; Zhang2024Two). 

The clinical presentation of SUCLA2-related disorders can vary significantly. Some patients experience a rapidly progressive form of the disease, leading to early death, while others have a slower disease course. The severity of the condition is linked to the nature of the mutations, with more severe mutations causing instability or absence of functional SUCLA2 protein (Gut2020SUCLA2). 

Increased succinyl-CoA levels due to SUCLA2 mutations lead to global protein hypersuccinylation, which affects proteins across various cellular compartments and contributes to disease pathology. This hypersuccinylation is a target for the desuccinylase SIRT5, and therapeutic strategies targeting succinylation and SIRT5 activity are being explored (Gut2020SUCLA2).

## Interactions
SUCLA2, the beta subunit of succinate-CoA ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular metabolism. It forms a heterodimer with the alpha subunit SUCLG1, which is essential for the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate in the Krebs cycle (Gut2020SUCLA2). SUCLA2 also interacts with GLS (glutaminase), a key enzyme in glutamine metabolism. This interaction is regulated by oxidative stress and post-translational modifications. Under oxidative stress, SUCLA2 is phosphorylated at serine 79, leading to its dissociation from GLS. This dissociation is associated with increased succinylation of GLS at lysine 311, which enhances GLS activity and supports tumor cell proliferation (Tong2021SUCLA2coupled).

In addition to its role in the Krebs cycle, SUCLA2 mutations can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased protein succinylation, affecting various cellular pathways. This is particularly evident in mitochondrial diseases where SUCLA2 mutations cause global protein succinylation, impacting mitochondrial energy production and other metabolic processes (Gut2020SUCLA2). These interactions and modifications highlight SUCLA2's role in regulating metabolic pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
