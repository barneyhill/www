# SLC12A3

## Overview
The SLC12A3 gene encodes the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC), a critical membrane glycoprotein involved in electrolyte balance and blood pressure regulation. This protein is predominantly expressed in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, where it facilitates the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions. Structurally, NCC is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function and interaction with thiazide diuretics, commonly used in hypertension treatment (Hebert2004Molecular; Moes2013The). The activity of NCC is modulated by phosphorylation and interactions with various kinases, including WNK1, WNK4, SPAK, and OSR1, which are integral to its regulation (Yang2003WNK; Moes2013The). Mutations in SLC12A3 are linked to Gitelman syndrome, a condition marked by electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, underscoring the gene's vital role in maintaining ion homeostasis (Lemmink1998Novel; Lee2016Mutations).

## Structure
The SLC12A3 gene encodes the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC), a membrane glycoprotein consisting of 1,021 amino acid residues. The protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane (TM) spanning regions, with a central hydrophobic domain. Between TM7 and TM8, there is a large extracellular hydrophilic loop containing two glycosylation sites, N404 and N424, which are crucial for the protein's function and surface expression (Moes2013The; Hebert2004Molecular).

The NCC protein's secondary structure includes these transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with specific residues in TM regions affecting the protein's affinity for ions and thiazide diuretics. A conserved glycine in TM4 is particularly important for chloride affinity, while a single residue in TM11 influences thiazide affinity differences between species (Moes2013The).

Phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification for NCC, with conserved phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal domain. Phosphorylation at threonine 60 is critical for NCC activity, and mutations here are linked to Gitelman syndrome (Moes2013The). The protein likely functions as a dimer, suggesting a quaternary structure (Moes2013The).

## Function
The SLC12A3 gene encodes the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC), which is primarily expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) of the kidney. This cotransporter plays a crucial role in the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions, a process essential for maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure regulation in healthy human cells (Hebert2004Molecular; Lemmink1998Novel). The NCC operates in an electroneutral manner, meaning it does not generate a net charge across the membrane, and is a major target for thiazide diuretics used in treating hypertension (Hebert2004Molecular).

The activity of NCC is regulated by various hormones, including aldosterone and angiotensin II, which modulate its function through phosphorylation and changes in protein abundance (Moes2013The). This regulation is part of a broader homeostatic mechanism to control blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The SLC12A3 gene's function is integral to the regulation of sodium and potassium levels, impacting blood pressure and overall fluid balance (Moes2013The).

Mutations in SLC12A3 can lead to Gitelman syndrome, characterized by impaired ion transport and symptoms such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, highlighting the gene's critical role in ion transport (Lemmink1998Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC12A3 gene are primarily associated with Gitelman syndrome (GS), an autosomal recessive renal disorder. GS is characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria, resulting from inactivating mutations in the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter encoded by SLC12A3 (Cruz2001Gitelman’s; Lee2016Mutations). The condition presents with a wide range of symptoms, from mild weakness to severe complications such as tetany, paralysis, and cardiac arrhythmia (Nozu2016Cryptic).

The genetic diversity of SLC12A3 mutations varies across different populations. For instance, common mutations in Chinese patients include T60M, T163M, D486N, R913Q, and R928C, which affect the protein's structure and function, leading to reduced Na+ uptake activity (Jiang2022Frequent). These mutations are distributed across most exons of the gene, with T60M being particularly prevalent (Jiang2022Frequent).

The clinical severity of GS does not always correlate with the number of mutant alleles, although lower plasma magnesium concentrations are observed in patients with more severe mutations (Lee2016Mutations). Genetic testing is the gold standard for diagnosing GS, but the Hydrochlorothiazide test is a cost-effective alternative for evaluating the function of the sodium-chloride cotransporter in vivo (Peng2018Hydrochlorothiazide).

## Interactions
The SLC12A3 gene encodes the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC), which is primarily expressed in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. NCC interacts with several proteins that regulate its activity through phosphorylation and trafficking. WNK kinases, particularly WNK1 and WNK4, play a significant role in this regulation. WNK4 inhibits NCC by reducing its delivery to the plasma membrane, while WNK1 can attenuate the inhibitory effect of WNK4, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism (Yang2003WNK).

SPAK and OSR1 are other kinases involved in NCC regulation. SPAK is crucial for NCC phosphorylation, and its isoforms have distinct roles in the distal convoluted tubule (Moes2013The). SGK1, sensitive to aldosterone, indirectly affects NCC through interactions with WNK4 and the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, which promotes NCC ubiquitylation and reduces its activity (Moes2013The).

Mutations in proteins like Kelch-like 3 and Cullin 3, which are part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, can lead to altered NCC activity, contributing to conditions such as hyperkalemic hypertension (Moes2013The). These interactions highlight the intricate network of protein interactions that modulate NCC function and influence electrolyte balance and blood pressure regulation.
