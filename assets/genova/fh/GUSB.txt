# GUSB

## Overview
The GUSB gene encodes the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, a lysosomal hydrolase critical for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. This enzyme is categorized as a glycoside hydrolase and is essential for the hydrolysis of glucuronic acid residues, facilitating the breakdown and recycling of GAGs within lysosomes (Tomatsu2009Mutations; Dubot2019First). The protein is synthesized as a precursor that undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, to become a mature, active enzyme in lysosomes (Oshima1987Cloning). Beta-glucuronidase's activity is vital for cellular metabolism and waste processing, and its deficiency due to mutations in the GUSB gene leads to mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII), a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of undegraded GAGs (Dubot2019First; Sly1973Beta).

## Structure
The GUSB gene encodes the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which is crucial for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans. The primary structure of the GUSB protein consists of 651 amino acids, with a 22-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved to form the mature enzyme (Tomatsu2009Mutations). The mature enzyme is a 78-kDa monomer that undergoes further cleavage into 60-kDa and 18-kDa subunits within lysosomes (Tomatsu2009Mutations). 

The secondary structure of GUSB includes a TIM barrel domain, which houses the active site, and a jelly roll-like domain containing lysosomal targeting residues (Khan2016Large). The tertiary structure forms a globular shape, and the quaternary structure involves the formation of a homotetramer, with each subunit having a molecular weight of approximately 75,000 (Oshima1987Cloning; Brot1978Purification).

Post-translational modifications of GUSB include glycosylation, with four potential N-linked glycosylation sites identified (Oshima1987Cloning). These modifications are essential for the enzyme's stability and function. The protein also contains six cysteine residues, which may form disulfide bonds contributing to its structural integrity (Oshima1987Cloning).

## Function
The GUSB gene encodes the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which plays a crucial role in the lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. This enzyme is responsible for hydrolyzing the glycosidic bonds of glucuronic acid residues in GAGs, facilitating their breakdown and recycling within lysosomes (Tomatsu2009Mutations; Dubot2019First). In healthy human cells, beta-glucuronidase activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of undegraded GAGs, which is critical for maintaining normal cellular and organ function (Tomatsu2009Mutations).

Beta-glucuronidase is synthesized as a 651-amino acid precursor that undergoes processing to become a mature enzyme active in lysosomes (Tomatsu2009Mutations). Its activity is vital for cellular metabolism and waste processing, contributing to the normal turnover and recycling of cellular components (Bhattacherjee2019Identification). The enzyme's function is particularly important in preventing the symptoms associated with mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII), a lysosomal storage disorder caused by GUSB mutations that lead to deficient enzymatic activity and subsequent GAG accumulation (Sly1973Beta; Dubot2019First).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GUSB gene lead to mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII), also known as Sly syndrome, a rare lysosomal storage disorder. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, resulting in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes. The buildup of these substrates causes cellular and tissue damage, leading to symptoms such as skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, coarse facial features, and mental retardation (Tomatsu2009Mutations; Khan2016Large).

MPS VII is an autosomal recessive disorder with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from severe cases with hydrops fetalis to milder forms with later onset and normal intelligence (Tomatsu2009Mutations). The GUSB gene mutations include missense, nonsense, deletions, and splice-site mutations, with missense mutations being the most common (Tomatsu2009Mutations; Dubot2019First). The most prevalent mutation is p.Leu176Phe, associated with an attenuated form of the disease (Tomatsu2009Mutations).

Treatment options for MPS VII include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which aim to reduce GAG accumulation and improve symptoms. ERT can improve organomegaly, while HSCT may address neurological symptoms by delivering the enzyme to the brain (Dubot2019First).
