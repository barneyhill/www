# WWTR1

## Overview
WWTR1, also known as the WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1, is a gene that encodes the TAZ protein, a transcriptional coactivator involved in the Hippo signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, thereby influencing tissue growth and organ size (Varelas2014The; Yu2015Hippo). TAZ, the protein product of WWTR1, lacks a DNA-binding domain and functions by interacting with DNA-binding transcription factors to modulate gene expression. It contains a WW domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, which are essential for its regulatory functions (Varelas2014The). TAZ is implicated in various cellular processes, including stem cell differentiation and maintaining cilia integrity in kidney cells, with its dysregulation linked to diseases such as polycystic kidney disease and cancer (Hong2005TAZ; Errani2011A; Hossain2007Glomerulocystic). The gene can undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, and is subject to regulation by phosphorylation through the Hippo pathway kinases, which affects its localization and stability (Errani2011A; Tanas2015Mechanism).

## Structure
The WWTR1 gene encodes the TAZ protein, which is a transcriptional coactivator involved in the Hippo signaling pathway. TAZ contains several important domains, including a TEAD binding domain, a 14-3-3 protein binding motif, and a WW domain. These domains are crucial for its function as a transcriptional coactivator (Tanas2015Mechanism). The WW domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, while the coiled-coil domain contributes to the structural stability of the protein (Errani2011A).

TAZ lacks a DNA-binding domain and must interact with DNA-binding transcription factors, such as TEAD1-4, to stimulate gene expression (Errani2011A). The protein is regulated by phosphorylation through the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1 and LATS2, which leads to its cytoplasmic localization and subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation (Tanas2015Mechanism). This post-translational modification is a key aspect of its role in cellular processes.

The WWTR1 gene can undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may affect its function and interactions (Errani2011A). The TAZ-CAMTA1 fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation, combines the N-terminal portion of TAZ with the C-terminal portion of CAMTA1, leading to its nuclear localization and constitutive activation (Seavey2021WWTR1(TAZ)CAMTA1 page 0 of 10).

## Function
The WWTR1 gene, also known as TAZ, encodes a transcriptional co-activator involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TAZ functions by interacting with transcription factors in the nucleus to regulate gene expression, influencing tissue growth and organ size (Varelas2014The; Yu2015Hippo). It contains a WW domain that recognizes PPxY motifs in proteins, which is essential for its regulatory functions (Varelas2014The).

TAZ is involved in various cellular processes, including the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. It acts as a coactivator for Runx2, promoting osteoblast differentiation, while inhibiting PPARg-driven adipocyte differentiation (Hong2005TAZ). In embryonic stem cells, TAZ helps maintain pluripotency by integrating growth factor signals with core transcriptional regulators like OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 (Varelas2014The).

TAZ is also implicated in maintaining cilia integrity in kidney cells, with its absence leading to renal cysts and end-stage renal disease in mice, suggesting a role in renal health (Hossain2007Glomerulocystic). Its activity is regulated by mechanical cues and G-protein-coupled receptors, affecting its localization and function within the cell (Varelas2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WWTR1 gene, also known as TAZ, have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of kidney disease, WWTR1 is critical for maintaining cilia integrity. Its inactivation in mice leads to glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD), characterized by renal cysts and compromised cilia integrity, suggesting a potential role in human polycystic kidney disease (PKD) (Hossain2007Glomerulocystic). The absence of WWTR1 results in the down-regulation of genes associated with cilia structure and function, such as Dctn5, Kif3a, Pkhd1, and Ofd1, which are crucial for preventing cyst formation (Hossain2007Glomerulocystic).

In cancer, WWTR1 is involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. Dysregulation of this pathway, where WWTR1 plays a key role, can lead to tumorigenesis. The WWTR1-CAMTA1 gene fusion is a consistent abnormality in epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), a rare vascular tumor, and is considered a defining feature of this disease (Errani2011A; Tanas2011Identification). This fusion results from a translocation that combines the transcriptional coactivator domains of WWTR1 with those of CAMTA1, potentially driving oncogenesis (Tanas2011Identification).

## Interactions
WWTR1, also known as TAZ, is a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with various proteins to regulate gene expression. It forms a functional complex with Polycystin-1 (PC1), where the C-terminal tail of PC1 (PC1-CTT) significantly enhances TAZ activity. This interaction is crucial for bone development, as it stimulates the RunX2 transcriptional pathway by recruiting the p300 transcriptional coregulatory protein (Merrick2018Polycystin1).

TAZ also interacts with the Glis3 protein, a transcriptional regulator associated with primary cilia and implicated in polycystic kidney disease. This interaction is mediated through the P/LPXY motifs in Glis3, particularly the fourth motif at the C terminus, enhancing Glis3's transcriptional activity and promoting TAZ's nuclear localization (Kang2009Glis3).

In the context of glomerulocystic kidney disease, TAZ interacts with several transcription factors and is crucial for maintaining renal cilia integrity. Its inactivation leads to polycystic kidney disease in mice, highlighting its role in regulating genes associated with cilia structure and function (Hossain2007Glomerulocystic).

TAZ's interaction with Amot and AmotL1 is mediated by its WW domain, which binds to the PPXY motifs in these proteins. This interaction is essential for the regulation of TAZ's activity independent of the Hippo pathway (Chan2011Hippo).
