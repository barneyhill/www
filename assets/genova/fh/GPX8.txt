# GPX8

## Overview
GPX8 is a gene that encodes the protein glutathione peroxidase 8 (putative), a member of the glutathione peroxidase family. This protein is categorized as a type-II transmembrane peroxidase and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining redox homeostasis and regulating calcium dynamics. Glutathione peroxidase 8 is enriched at the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM), a critical site for calcium signaling, and is involved in modulating intracellular calcium levels by interacting with key proteins such as the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) (Buday2020Emerging; Yoboue2017Regulation). Additionally, GPX8 is implicated in the oxidative folding of proteins, utilizing hydrogen peroxide to prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis (Nguyen2011Two). The gene's expression has been linked to various cancers, where it is often upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior (Zhang2020Glutathione; Ren2022A).

## Function
GPX8 is a type-II transmembrane peroxidase located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a crucial role in regulating calcium (Ca2+) dynamics and maintaining redox homeostasis. It is enriched at the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM), a key site for Ca2+ signaling. GPX8 modulates intracellular Ca2+ levels by influencing the steady-state Ca2+ concentration in the ER and controlling Ca2+ release to the mitochondria and cytosol. Overexpression of GPX8 results in reduced Ca2+ levels in the ER and decreased IP3-dependent Ca2+ fluxes, indicating an impaired capacity of the ER to release Ca2+ in response to stimuli (Yoboue2017Regulation).

GPX8 also interacts with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R), which are involved in Ca2+ refilling and release, respectively. Its transmembrane domain and peroxidatic cysteines are essential for these regulatory functions (Buday2020Emerging). Additionally, GPX8 is involved in the oxidative folding of proteins by utilizing hydrogen peroxide produced during disulfide bond formation, thus preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Nguyen2011Two).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GPX8 gene have been implicated in various cancers. GPX8 is significantly upregulated in several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and lung adenocarcinoma. This upregulation is associated with poorer prognosis in cancers such as brain, colorectal, and lung cancer (Ren2022A). In glioblastoma multiforme, GPX8 expression is linked to the migration and invasion of cancer cells, suggesting a role in cancer aggressiveness (Ren2022A). 

In gastric cancer, high GPX8 expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor overall survival. It is associated with higher tumor and node classifications, indicating a potential role in poor prognosis (Zhang2020Glutathione). GPX8 expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, which may exacerbate inflammation and cancer progression (Zhang2022Immunohistochemistry).

The gene's expression is negatively correlated with DNA methylation in certain cancers, such as glioblastoma multiforme and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, suggesting a mechanism for its altered expression (Ren2022A). Genetic alterations, primarily amplifications, and a significant missense mutation (S61Y/F) have been identified, which may impact its function in cancer (Ren2022A).

## Interactions
GPX8, a member of the glutathione peroxidase family, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with Ero1α, a sulfhydryl oxidase, suggesting a role in facilitating the productive use of hydrogen peroxide during disulfide bond formation, thereby enhancing oxidative protein folding efficiency (Nguyen2011Two). GPX8 also interacts with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), acting as a PDI peroxidase. This interaction enhances the oxidation of PDI by peroxide, indicating a synergistic relationship that increases the rate of disulfide bond formation (Nguyen2011Two).

In addition to its interactions with Ero1α and PDI, GPX8 is enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and plays a role in calcium regulation. It interacts with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), affecting calcium homeostasis and signaling (Yoboue2017Regulation). These interactions highlight GPX8's involvement in both redox and calcium signaling processes, positioning it as a significant component in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oxidative stress.
