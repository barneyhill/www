# ZDHHC21

## Overview
ZDHHC21 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 21, an enzyme categorized as a palmitoyl acyltransferase. This enzyme is integral to the post-translational modification process known as S-palmitoylation, where it facilitates the attachment of palmitic acid to cysteine residues on target proteins. This modification is crucial for regulating protein localization, stability, and function, impacting various cellular processes and signaling pathways. ZDHHC21 is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, where it modulates the function of sex steroid receptors and adrenergic receptors, among others. The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including immune response, skin barrier function, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease (Marin2016The; Pedram2012DHHC-7; Li2023Aberrant).

## Function
ZDHHC21 encodes a palmitoyl acyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation. This process involves the attachment of palmitic acid to cysteine residues, which affects protein localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC21 is active in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, where it influences various signaling pathways and cellular communication (Pedram2012DHHC-7).

In healthy human cells, ZDHHC21 is involved in the palmitoylation of sex steroid receptors, such as estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors. This modification is essential for the trafficking of these receptors to the plasma membrane, which is important for both genomic and nongenomic functions, including rapid signaling pathways (Pedram2012DHHC-7). ZDHHC21 also plays a role in modulating the function of α1 adrenergic receptors, particularly the α1D subtype, by increasing their palmitoylation and total expression. This enhances receptor function, which is crucial for maintaining vascular tone and regulating hemodynamics (Marin2016The).

The enzyme's activity in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, impacting processes like immune response and skin barrier function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZDHHC21 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the context of SIRS, ZDHHC21 is identified as a critical mediator of endothelial dysfunction. Studies have shown that deficiency in ZDHHC21 can ameliorate endothelial barrier dysfunction and reduce inflammation, as evidenced by experiments in Zdhhc21 dep/dep mice, which exhibit resistance to organ injury and reduced lung inflammation compared to wild-type controls (Beard2016Palmitoyl). This suggests that ZDHHC21 plays a significant role in the severity of inflammatory responses and associated endothelial injury.

In Alzheimer's disease, a novel heterozygous missense mutation (p.T209S) in the ZDHHC21 gene has been identified in a family with AD, suggesting a potential pathogenic role. This mutation enhances the palmitoylation of proteins such as APP and FYN, leading to increased amyloid-beta production and synaptic dysfunction, contributing to cognitive decline. The ZDHHC21-FYN-NMDAR2B pathway is implicated in these pathological processes, and targeting palmitoylation has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy (Li2023Aberrant). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZDHHC21 in both inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
ZDHHC21 is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes through its palmitoyltransferase activity. It interacts with the α1D adrenergic receptor (AR), enhancing its palmitoylation and expression, which affects receptor function and vascular tone (Marin2016The). This interaction is specific, as ZDHHC21 does not palmitoylate Gαq, another protein involved in α1 AR signaling (Marin2016The).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, ZDHHC21 interacts with FYN tyrosine kinase and amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to their increased palmitoylation. This interaction is implicated in synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss, contributing to the disease's pathophysiology (Li2023Aberrant). The ZDHHC21-FYN-NMDAR2B pathway is particularly significant, as it results in heightened neuronal sensitivity to excitotoxicity (Li2023Aberrant).

ZDHHC21 also interacts with fatty acid synthase (FASN) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mediating its S-palmitoylation at the Cys1317 site. This interaction decreases FASN protein stability and affects fatty acid synthesis, thereby inhibiting DLBCL cell proliferation (Liu2024Targeting). These interactions highlight ZDHHC21's role in modulating protein function through palmitoylation, impacting various physiological and pathological processes.
