# S100PBP

## Overview
S100PBP is a gene that encodes the S100P binding protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The protein encoded by S100PBP is known for its interactions with other proteins, such as the tumor suppressor p53 and the small GTP-binding protein RhoB, playing a crucial role in modulating cell morphology, motility, and invasion (Srivast2023S100PBP). S100P binding protein is categorized as a cytoplasmic protein that influences cytoskeletal reorganization and is implicated in the regulation of tumor suppressive pathways, especially in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and breast cancer (Srivast2023S100PBP). The gene's expression and regulation are affected by oncogenic mutations, such as those in the KRAS gene, which can lead to altered signaling pathways and contribute to cancer progression and chemoresistance (Srivast2023S100PBP). Understanding the function and interactions of S100PBP is essential for exploring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Clinical Significance
The S100PBP gene plays a significant role in various cancers, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and breast cancer. In PDAC, S100PBP acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression decreasing as the cancer progresses. This reduction is associated with oncogenic transformation, increased cell migration, and invasion (Srivast2023S100PBP). The gene is regulated by the mutated KRAS gene, specifically the Kras G12D mutation, which leads to its downregulation. This downregulation is linked to decreased RhoB signaling and increased AKT signaling, contributing to chemoresistance and poor prognosis in PDAC patients (Srivast2023S100PBP).

In breast cancer, S100PBP is involved in cellular processes influenced by fluid flow, with its expression being upregulated in response to such stimuli. This upregulation is part of a network involving other S100 proteins, which may contribute to cancer progression (Fuh2021Fluid). Additionally, S100PBP is a target of miR-944 in cervical cancer, where its downregulation by miR-944 enhances cell migration and invasion, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Xie2014Novel). These findings highlight the potential of S100PBP as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
S100PBP interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in pancreatic cancer. It is known to interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53, forming a complex that includes S100P and ubiquitin. This interaction is significant as it may lead to the destabilization and degradation of both S100PBP and p53, suggesting a mechanism by which S100PBP could influence p53 activity and tumor progression (Srivast2023S100PBP). The interaction between S100PBP and p53 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation studies, indicating that this interaction occurs in the nucleus and modulates p53 expression levels (Srivast2023S100PBP).

S100PBP also interacts with the small GTP-binding protein RhoB and its effector Rho-kinase (ROCK)-1/2, affecting cytoskeletal reorganization, cell morphology, motility, and invasion. This interaction influences the stabilization and destabilization of filamentous (F)-actin, impacting cell shape and motility (Srivast2023S100PBP). The regulation of S100PBP by mutated KRAS further affects its interactions and signaling pathways, including those involving RhoB, AKT, and p53 (Srivast2023S100PBP). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving S100PBP, which are crucial for its tumor suppressive functions in pancreatic cancer.
