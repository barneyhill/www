# ZFP90

## Overview
ZFP90 is a gene that encodes the ZFP90 zinc finger protein, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The ZFP90 protein is primarily involved in modulating gene expression by interacting with chromatin remodeling complexes and other transcription factors, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as self-renewal and differentiation in hematopoietic stem cells, as well as cardiac gene regulation (Hata2011Zincfinger; Liu2018The). Additionally, ZFP90 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including colorectal and ovarian cancer, where it may function as an oncogene and contribute to chemoresistance (Yu2019A; Wu2023Zinc). The gene's expression and interactions are critical for maintaining normal cellular functions and have significant implications in disease contexts, particularly in cancer biology (Han2021ZFP90).

## Function
ZFP90 is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation within healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcription of target genes by modulating chromatin accessibility and gene expression. ZFP90 interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the NURF complex, to regulate the expression of genes crucial for cellular processes. For instance, in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), ZFP90 is essential for maintaining self-renewal and differentiation by regulating the expression of Hoxa9, a gene critical for HSC function (Liu2018The).

ZFP90 also plays a role in cardiac cells by interacting with the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), where it acts as a negative regulator of NRSF-mediated transcriptional repression. This interaction affects the expression of fetal cardiac genes, suggesting a role in cardiac gene regulation and potentially in cardiac development and function (Hata2011Zincfinger).

In the context of colitis-associated colorectal cancer, ZFP90 has been implicated in modulating gut barrier integrity and local inflammation, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains less clear (Han2021ZFP90).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZFP90 gene have been implicated in several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). ZFP90 is identified as a potential oncogene in CRC, with increased expression correlating with poor prognosis and advanced pathological grades in patients. Knockout studies in CRC cell lines and mouse models show that loss of ZFP90 impairs tumorigenic potential, suggesting its role as a clinical oncogene (Yu2019A). The gene is also involved in the NFATC2-ZFP90-BMP4 pathway, which contributes to CRC risk and progression (Yu2019A).

In CAC, ZFP90's tumorigenic effects are dependent on the gut microbiota. Depletion of gut microbiota in mice eliminates the tumor-promoting effects of ZFP90, indicating a microbiota-dependent mechanism (Han2021ZFP90). ZFP90 deletion in intestinal epithelial cells reduces CAC formation and improves gut barrier function, highlighting its protective role against inflammation and tumorigenesis (Han2021ZFP90).

In ovarian cancer, ZFP90 knockdown enhances cisplatin sensitivity, suggesting its role in chemoresistance. This effect is mediated through the modulation of apoptosis-related proteins and pathways, indicating that targeting ZFP90 could improve chemotherapy efficacy (Wu2023Zinc).

## Interactions
ZFP90, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It physically interacts with the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), a zinc-finger transcription factor, through its N-terminal and C-terminal regions. This interaction occurs specifically at the DNA-binding domain of NRSF, inhibiting NRSF's ability to bind DNA and repress target genes, such as those involved in cardiac development (Hata2011Zincfinger). ZFP90's interaction with NRSF has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells, including 293T and Cos7 cells (Hata2011Zincfinger).

In the context of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), ZFP90 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) complex, specifically binding to Snf2l, a component of the complex. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Hoxa9 expression, a gene important for HSC proliferation (Liu2018The). ZFP90's role in colorectal cancer involves its interaction with the NFATC2 transcription factor, where a genetic variant affects the NFATC2-ZFP90-BMP4 pathway, influencing tumorigenesis (Yu2019A). These interactions highlight ZFP90's role in various biological processes and diseases.
