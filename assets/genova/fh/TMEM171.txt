# TMEM171

## Overview
TMEM171 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 171, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the context of cancer biology. TMEM171 is involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, a critical pathway in the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC). The protein functions by dephosphorylating IκBα, thereby inactivating NF-κB signaling, which influences cell proliferation and apoptosis (Li2022A). As a result, TMEM171 is considered a novel tumor suppressor gene, with its expression levels being inversely correlated with tumor growth and patient prognosis in GC (Li2022A). The gene's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target underscores its clinical significance in cancer research (Li2022A).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM171 has been identified as a novel tumor suppressor gene with significant implications in gastric cancer (GC). Alterations in the expression of TMEM171 are closely associated with the progression and prognosis of GC. The gene is typically down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues compared to noncancerous tissues, both at the mRNA and protein levels (Li2022A). This down-regulation is linked to increased tumor growth and poorer patient outcomes. Overexpression of TMEM171 in GC cells has been shown to suppress cell proliferation, promote apoptosis, and increase the proportion of cells in the G1 phase, indicating its role in inhibiting cancer progression (Li2022A). Conversely, depletion of TMEM171 promotes cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis, further underscoring its tumor-suppressive function (Li2022A).

The mechanism by which TMEM171 exerts its effects involves the dephosphorylation of IκBα, leading to the inactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer development (Li2022A). High expression levels of TMEM171 are associated with better overall survival in GC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Li2022A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TMEM171 in gastric cancer.

## Interactions
TMEM171 is involved in interactions with components of the NF-κB signaling pathway, particularly with IκBα. TMEM171 dephosphorylates IκBα, leading to the inactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial in the development of gastric cancer (GC) (Li2022A). This interaction suggests that TMEM171 may play a role in modulating the activity of NF-κB by affecting the phosphorylation status of IκBα, thereby influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis in GC cells (Li2022A).

The study also indicates that TMEM171 affects the expression of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as MCM2 and PCNA. Overexpression of TMEM171 results in decreased expression of these proteins, while its depletion leads to increased expression, suggesting that TMEM171 may interact with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Li2022A). These interactions highlight TMEM171's potential role as a tumor suppressor by modulating key signaling pathways and protein expressions associated with cancer progression.
