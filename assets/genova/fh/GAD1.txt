# GAD1

## Overview
The GAD1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD67), a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system by catalyzing the conversion of glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. GAD67 is essential for maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain, which is vital for normal neuronal function and development (Hyde2011Expression). The gene is expressed in various isoforms, including GAD67 and GAD25, with distinct roles during different developmental stages (Hyde2011Expression). Alterations in GAD1 expression and function have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Neuray2020Earlyinfantile; Tao2017GAD1).

## Function
The GAD1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 1, which is responsible for the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from glutamate. GABA is a critical inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, playing a significant role in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain (Hyde2011Expression). This balance is essential for proper brain function, as it regulates neuronal excitability and prevents excessive neuronal firing.

GAD1 produces two main isoforms, GAD67 and GAD25. GAD67 is expressed throughout life and is crucial for GABA synthesis, while GAD25 is predominantly expressed during fetal development and may be involved in cell proliferation, migration, and synaptogenesis (Hyde2011Expression). The transition from GAD25 to GAD67 expression is associated with increased GABA synthesis, which is vital for the development of inhibitory neurotransmission (Hyde2011Expression).

In healthy human cells, GAD1's role in synthesizing GABA is essential for normal brain development and function, particularly in establishing the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals. This process is crucial for cortical development and the maturation of GABA signaling, which shifts from excitatory to inhibitory during brain maturation (Hyde2011Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GAD1 gene, which encodes the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67), are implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, there is a consistent finding of decreased GAD67 expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, contributing to the disorder's pathophysiology (Mitchell2015Transcriptional; Tao2017GAD1). This downregulation is linked to genetic variations near the GAD1 promoter, affecting DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation (Tao2017GAD1). 

GAD1 mutations are also associated with early-infantile onset epilepsy and developmental delay. Individuals with bi-allelic GAD1 variants exhibit severe phenotypes, including early-onset seizures and developmental delays, often accompanied by skeletal abnormalities and cleft palate (Neuray2020Earlyinfantile). 

In bipolar disorder, decreased levels of GAD67 protein and mRNA have been observed, although the association with GAD1 variants is less clear (Lundorf2005Mutational). 

GAD1 is also implicated in prostate cancer, where its expression and methylation levels correlate with disease progression and drug resistance, suggesting a potential role in cancer pathogenesis (Wan2023GAD1).

## Interactions
The GAD1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), which is involved in the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. GAD67 functions as a dimer, and its enzymatic activity is dependent on homodimerization or heterodimerization with GAD65, another isoform of glutamate decarboxylase. The active site of GAD is formed by the interaction of two GAD monomers, highlighting the importance of these protein-protein interactions for its function (Lee2019The; Magri2018A).

GAD67 is hydrophilic and can cluster at the presynapse through heterodimerization with the hydrophobic GAD65 or through its intrinsic membrane anchoring properties (Lee2019The). The dimerization process is mediated by their cofactor-binding and C-terminal domains, a conserved feature among PLP-dependent enzymes (Lee2019The). 

In Drosophila, the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 regulates the splicing of GAD1 pre-mRNA, influencing GABA neurotransmission. Although TDP-43 does not directly bind to GAD1 mRNA, it may interact with other RNA-binding proteins to form splicing complexes, affecting the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission (Romano2021TDP43).
