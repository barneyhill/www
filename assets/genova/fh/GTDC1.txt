# GTDC1

## Overview
The GTDC1 gene encodes the protein glycosyltransferase-like domain containing 1, which is involved in the glycosylation process, a critical post-translational modification that influences protein folding, stability, and cell-cell interactions. This protein is categorized as a glycosyltransferase, playing a significant role in the nervous system, particularly in the cerebral cortex, where it contributes to neurite outgrowth, axon guidance, and synaptogenesis. GTDC1 is essential for normal cellular functions and neurogenesis, with its disruption linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delay and epilepsy. The protein's involvement in glycine metabolism further highlights its importance in synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment (Aksoy2016Personalized; Errichiello2024Further).

## Function
The GTDC1 gene encodes a protein involved in glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification process that affects protein folding, stability, and cell-cell interactions. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation and neural cell proliferation (Aksoy2016Personalized). GTDC1 is particularly active in the nervous system, with high expression in the cerebral cortex, where it plays a role in neurite outgrowth, axon guidance, synaptogenesis, membrane excitability, neurotransmission, and neuroinflammation (Errichiello2024Further).

In healthy human cells, GTDC1 contributes to the synthesis of glycans, which are crucial for maintaining proper glycosylation. This is important for normal cellular functions and neurogenesis, as evidenced by the mislocalization of ICAM-1, a glycosylation biomarker, when GTDC1 is disrupted (Aksoy2016Personalized). The protein is also implicated in glycine metabolism, which is vital for synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment, as glycine acts as a co-agonist of NMDARs involved in these processes (Errichiello2024Further). GTDC1's role in glycosylation and glycine metabolism underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions, particularly in the context of neurodevelopment.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GTDC1 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders. Disruptions in GTDC1, such as de novo translocations and deletions, have been associated with conditions like developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech delay, microcephaly, and epilepsy (Bonaglia2023Further; Aksoy2016Personalized). The gene encodes a protein involved in glycosylation, a process crucial for neural development. Alterations in GTDC1 expression can lead to defects in neural progenitor cells and neurons, affecting neuronal maturation and connectivity (Aksoy2016Personalized).

Studies using zebrafish models and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have demonstrated that GTDC1 disruption results in developmental defects, such as microcephaly and impaired central nervous system development (Aksoy2016Personalized). In humans, GTDC1 mutations have been linked to altered glycine metabolism, which is significant for central nervous system function. Increased glycine levels and changes in related metabolic pathways have been observed in patients with GTDC1 deletions, potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental impairments and epilepsy (Bonaglia2023Further).

These findings underscore the importance of GTDC1 in maintaining normal neurodevelopmental processes and suggest its potential role in the etiology of various neurodevelopmental disorders.
