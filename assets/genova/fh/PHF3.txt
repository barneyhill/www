# PHF3

## Overview
PHF3 (PHD finger protein 3) is a gene that encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein involved in the modulation of gene expression and mRNA stability, particularly within neuronal contexts. The protein, also named PHD finger protein 3, is characterized by its distinct domains, including a Plant Homeodomain (PHD), a TFIIS-like domain (TLD), and a SPOC domain, which facilitate its interaction with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and other RNA processing factors. Notably, the SPOC domain serves as a CTD reader, binding specifically to phosphorylated serine-2 residues of Pol II, thereby playing a critical role in transcription elongation and mRNA decay (Appel2021PHF3; Benedum2023The). PHF3's regulatory functions are essential for proper neuronal differentiation, as it acts as a negative regulator of neuronal gene expression, ensuring the timely expression of these genes (Appel2021PHF3). The protein's involvement in forming liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates further underscores its role in transcription regulation and RNA processing (Benedum2023The). Clinically, PHF3 has been linked to glioblastoma and autism, highlighting its significance in both oncological and neurological disorders (Appel2021PHF3; Fischer2001PHF3).

## Structure
PHF3 (PHD finger protein 3) is a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The protein contains a Plant Homeodomain (PHD), a TFIIS-like domain (TLD), and a SPOC domain. The PHD domain in PHF3 does not bind histones, unlike its paralogue DIDO3, which recognizes H3K4me3 (Benedum2023The). The TLD of PHF3 shares homology with the transcription factor TFIIS but lacks domain III, which is responsible for stimulating RNA cleavage by Pol II (Benedum2023The). The SPOC domain is a key feature of PHF3, acting as a CTD reader domain that specifically binds to phosphorylated Serine-2 marks in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Appel2021PHF3).

PHF3 also contains large N- and C-terminal intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), with the C-terminus having a low complexity domain enriched with arginine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid, which can form condensates and drive nuclear speckle assembly (Benedum2023The). These IDRs contribute to the protein's ability to form liquid-like condensates and colocalize with Pol II clusters in cells (Benedum2023The). The SPOC domain of PHF3 is crucial for its interaction with Pol II, and its deletion abrogates this interaction (Appel2021PHF3).

## Function
PHF3 (PHD finger protein 3) is a crucial regulator of transcription and mRNA stability in human cells, particularly influencing neuronal gene expression. It interacts with the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex through its SPOC domain, which specifically binds to the phosphorylated serine-2 of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD). This interaction is essential for coordinating transcription elongation and mRNA decay, linking these processes to ensure proper gene expression (Appel2021PHF3).

PHF3 plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation by acting as a negative regulator of neuronal gene expression. It competes with transcription factors like TFIIS for binding to Pol II, which affects transcription elongation and prevents premature expression of neuronal genes. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the proper timing of neuronal differentiation (Appel2021PHF3; Benedum2023The).

PHF3 also contributes to the formation of liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates, which are important for Pol II clustering and transcription regulation. These condensates influence gene expression by sequestering Pol II and modulating the recruitment of RNA processing factors (Appel2021PHF3; Benedum2023The). PHF3's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin and RNA processing factors to regulate gene expression and mRNA stability (Appel2021PHF3).

## Clinical Significance
PHF3 (PHD finger protein 3) has been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its altered expression or mutations. In glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, PHF3 expression is significantly reduced or lost, suggesting a role in tumor development. This downregulation may lead to the derepression of transcription factors such as ASCL1, POU3F2, and SOX2, which are involved in neuronal differentiation and contribute to the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma (Appel2021PHF3; Fischer2001PHF3). The presence of autoantibodies against PHF3 in glioblastoma patients has been associated with prolonged survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Pallasch2005Autoantibodies).

PHF3 is also identified as an autism-risk gene due to deletion mutations in its linker region, leading to a frameshift and premature termination, which results in a SPOC-less protein. This highlights the importance of the SPOC domain for PHF3's function in neuronal gene regulation (Appel2021PHF3). Additionally, PHF3 knockout mice exhibit neuronal dysfunction, further supporting its role in neurological conditions (Benedum2023The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PHF3 in both cancer and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
PHF3 (PHD finger protein 3) interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) through its SPOC domain, which binds specifically to the phosphorylated serine-2 residues in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II. This interaction is crucial for PHF3's role in transcription regulation, as it colocalizes with Pol II clusters and tracks with Pol II across genes (Appel2021PHF3). PHF3 competes with the transcription factor TFIIS for binding to the Pol II elongation complex, affecting transcription elongation by displacing TFIIS, which is involved in rescuing backtracked Pol II (Appel2021PHF3).

PHF3 also interacts with several RNA processing and alternative splicing factors, including SON, ZNF326, SAFB, RBMX, and RBM15. Its interaction with RBM15, part of the m6A writer complex, may influence m6A RNA levels and mRNA stability (Appel2021PHF3). PHF3's interaction with SPT6, a regulator of mRNA stability, suggests a role in recruiting the CCR4-NOT complex to Pol II, promoting mRNA degradation (Appel2021PHF3). These interactions highlight PHF3's involvement in coupling transcription elongation with RNA processing and stability, particularly in the context of neuronal gene expression.
