# CDYL2

## Overview
CDYL2 is a gene that encodes the chromodomain Y like 2 protein, which is a member of the chromodomain Y (CDY) family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in epigenetic regulation, primarily through interactions with chromatin. The CDYL2 protein contains a chromodomain that facilitates binding to methylated lysine residues on histone tails, playing a crucial role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation (Fischle2008Specificity; Siouda2020CDYL2). Additionally, CDYL2 features an enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase (ECH) domain, which is linked to fatty acid metabolism and cancer progression (Yang2020Discrete). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, prostate, spleen, and leukocytes, indicating its role in tissue-specific epigenetic regulation (Fischle2008Specificity). CDYL2 is implicated in several cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, and has been associated with cancer, particularly breast cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease prognosis (Siouda2020CDYL2).

## Structure
The CDYL2 protein is part of the chromodomain Y (CDY) family and contains two main domains: an N-terminal chromodomain and a C-terminal enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase (ECH) catalytic domain (Yang2020Discrete). The chromodomain is involved in chromatin binding and recognition of lysine-methylated histone tails, while the ECH domain is linked to fatty acid metabolism and cancer progression (Yang2020Discrete). The CDYL2 chromodomain is structurally similar to HP1 and Polycomb chromodomains, although it lacks the first aromatic cage residue typically necessary for methyllysine binding, indicating a functional difference (Fischle2008Specificity). The three-dimensional structure of the CDYL2 chromodomain has been deposited in the protein data bank (PDB accession code 2dnt) and shows a tertiary structure similar to HP1 despite moderate sequence identity (Fischle2008Specificity).

CDYL2 has four transcript variants, with CDYL2a and CDYL2b being predominant in breast cancer. These variants have distinct roles, with CDYL2a promoting cancer cell proliferation and CDYL2b suppressing migration and invasion (Yang2020Discrete). The protein's subcellular localization varies, with CDYL2a localizing to nuclear speckles and CDYL2b to heterochromatin (Yang2020Discrete).

## Function
CDYL2 (chromodomain Y like 2) is a protein involved in epigenetic regulation, primarily through its interaction with chromatin. It contains a chromodomain that binds to methylated lysine residues on histone tails, particularly H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, which are crucial for chromatin modification and gene expression regulation (Fischle2008Specificity; Siouda2020CDYL2). CDYL2 is part of transcriptional co-repressor complexes and interacts with lysine methyltransferases such as G9a, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Fischle2008Specificity).

In healthy human cells, CDYL2 is selectively expressed in tissues like the testis, prostate, spleen, and leukocytes, suggesting a role in tissue-specific epigenetic regulation (Fischle2008Specificity). It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it exhibits a distinct nuclear distribution pattern, often co-localizing with regions of heterochromatin enriched with H3K9me3 modifications (Fischle2008Specificity). This localization indicates its involvement in the organization and function of heterochromatin, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability and regulating access to DNA for transcription and replication processes (Fischle2008Specificity).

CDYL2's role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation is further supported by its involvement in histone modification processes, such as acetylation and deacetylation, through its enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase/isomerase (ECH) domain (Fischle2008Specificity).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDYL2 gene have significant implications in breast cancer. CDYL2 is frequently upregulated in breast cancer, with high expression levels correlating with poor prognosis, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive/human EGF receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) and triple-negative (TN) breast cancer subtypes (Siouda2020CDYL2). The gene plays a role in the epigenetic regulation of microRNA-124 (miR-124), impacting the STAT3 and NF-kB signaling pathways, which are crucial for processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, invasion, and stemness of cancer cells (Siouda2020CDYL2).

CDYL2 has distinct transcript variants, CDYL2a and CDYL2b, which have different roles in breast cancer progression. CDYL2a is upregulated in most breast cancer types and promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth by influencing alternative splicing of genes involved in cancer cell proliferation (Yang2020Discrete). In contrast, CDYL2b is mainly expressed in luminal and HER2-positive breast cancer types and suppresses cell migration and invasion by repressing metastasis-promoting genes (Yang2020Discrete). These findings suggest that targeting CDYL2a could be a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor growth, while CDYL2b's role in suppressing metastasis highlights its potential protective function (Yang2020Discrete).

## Interactions
CDYL2 interacts with several proteins, playing a role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It forms a complex with the H3K9 di-methyltransferases G9a and GLP, which is crucial for its function in regulating the expression of miR-124. This interaction is supported by immunoprecipitation assays showing co-immunoprecipitation of CDYL2 with G9a and GLP, indicating a strong physical association (Siouda2020CDYL2). CDYL2 also shows a marginal interaction with components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), specifically EZH2 and SUZ12, although these interactions are of low abundance or labile (Siouda2020CDYL2).

In breast cancer, CDYL2 interacts with the G9a/GLP methyltransferase complex, and its activity is modulated by the G9a/GLP inhibitor UNC0642, which affects miR-124-3p levels (Siouda2020CDYL2). CDYL2's interaction with G9a is significant for its role in epigenetic repression, while its interaction with EZH2 is weaker and possibly indirect (Siouda2020CDYL2).

The CDYL2-60aa protein, encoded by circCDYL2, interacts with APAF1 in cardiomyocytes, stabilizing it by blocking its ubiquitination. This interaction is direct, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses (Deng2023Cdyl260aa).
