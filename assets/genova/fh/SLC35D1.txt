# SLC35D1

## Overview
The SLC35D1 gene encodes the solute carrier family 35 member D1 protein, which is a crucial component of the nucleotide sugar transporter family. This protein is an integral membrane protein predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is characterized by its barrel-shaped structure with 10 transmembrane helices. SLC35D1 facilitates the transport of UDP-sugars, such as UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid, from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen, where they serve as substrates for glycosylation reactions essential for proteoglycan biosynthesis. This process is vital for the formation of chondroitin sulfate, a key component of cartilage. Mutations in the SLC35D1 gene can lead to skeletal disorders, such as Schneckenbecken dysplasia, due to disrupted proteoglycan synthesis, underscoring the gene's significance in cartilage and bone development (Furuichi2009Identification; Rautengarten2019A).

## Structure
The SLC35D1 protein is modeled as a barrel-shaped structure with 10 transmembrane helices surrounding a central channel, consistent with its role as an integral membrane protein (Rautengarten2019A). This structure is based on comparative modeling with other nucleotide sugar transporters, such as the yeast GDP-mannose transporter Vrg4, due to the lack of experimental structures for SLC35D1 itself (Rautengarten2019A). The protein is predicted to be open to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with specific residues like Pro133 and Thr65 located at the periphery of the substrate channel, playing crucial roles in substrate binding (Rautengarten2019A).

The tertiary structure of SLC35D1 is important for its function, as the Pro133 residue is crucial for maintaining structural integrity by separating different secondary structure regions. A missense variant, p.(Pro133Leu), is predicted to cause modest changes to the surface properties of the protein around the substrate channel, potentially leading to misfolding or incorrect membrane insertion (Rautengarten2019A). The protein functions as a general UDP-sugar transporter, involved in glycosylation reactions within the ER, and is essential for chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis (Rautengarten2019A).

## Function
The SLC35D1 gene encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter protein that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of proteoglycans, which are essential components of cartilage. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells, where it facilitates the transport of UDP-sugars, such as UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) and UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA), from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen (Furuichi2009Identification; Rautengarten2019A). These UDP-sugars are substrates for the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate, a key glycosaminoglycan involved in cartilage formation (Rautengarten2019A).

SLC35D1 functions as a general UDP-sugar transporter, capable of transporting a variety of UDP-sugars, which are necessary for glycosylation reactions within the ER. This activity is critical for the formation of glycosaminoglycan chains and other glycoconjugates, contributing to the proper development and function of the extracellular matrix and cell surface components (Rautengarten2019A). The transport activity of SLC35D1 is dependent on UMP as a counter exchange substrate, ensuring efficient function under normal cellular conditions (Rautengarten2019A). Loss-of-function mutations in SLC35D1 can lead to skeletal disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (Furuichi2009Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC35D1 gene are primarily associated with Schneckenbecken dysplasia (SBD), a severe skeletal disorder characterized by a snail-like configuration of the iliac bone, thoracic hypoplasia, and severe flattening of the vertebral bodies. This condition results from loss-of-function mutations in SLC35D1, which disrupts nucleotide sugar transport essential for proteoglycan synthesis, leading to defects in cartilage and bone development (Furuichi2009Identification). Specific mutations identified include heterozygous nonsense mutations, splice donor site mutations, and homozygous deletions, all contributing to abnormal protein function and structure (Furuichi2009Identification).

A variant of SBD, termed "Schneckenbecken-like dysplasia," has been linked to a hypomorphic allele of SLC35D1, specifically the p.(Pro133Leu) mutation. This variant results in significantly reduced transport activity, leading to a milder phenotype compared to classic SBD (Rautengarten2019A).

Alterations in SLC35D1 expression levels have also been implicated in leprosy. Studies have shown that certain SNPs associated with leprosy affect SLC35D1 mRNA expression, suggesting a potential role in the disease's metabolic pathways (Li2016Fine).
