# DEK

## Overview
The DEK gene encodes the DEK proto-oncogene, a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a significant role in chromatin organization and gene regulation. The DEK protein is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and transcriptional regulation, functioning as both a histone chaperone and a chromatin remodeler. It contains a unique SAP domain and other DNA-binding modules that facilitate its interaction with chromatin and nucleic acids, influencing chromatin architecture and gene expression (Liu2022DEK; Sandén2015The). DEK is implicated in maintaining genomic stability and is associated with several cancers, where its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and tumor progression (Yang2020DEK; Lin2013DEK). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, which affect its DNA binding and chromatin association, highlighting its complex regulatory role in cellular homeostasis (Sandén2015The; Kappes2008DEK).

## Structure
The DEK proto-oncogene encodes a protein that is 43 kDa in size and consists of 375 amino acids. The DEK protein features a unique SAP domain, which is centrally located within the protein sequence and contains a helix-turn-helix motif. This motif is similar to the Hox protein homeodomain and is involved in DNA binding, cell signaling, DNA repair, and chromosomal organization (Sandén2015The). The DEK protein has two DNA binding modules, including the SAP domain and a second structure at the C-terminal end, which facilitate its interaction with DNA (Liu2022DEK; Sandén2015The).

DEK does not exhibit specific affinity for DNA sequences but preferentially binds to superhelical and cruciform DNA, inducing positive supercoils into closed circular DNA (Liu2022DEK). Post-translational modifications of DEK include phosphorylation, acetylation, and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 (CK2) affects its DNA binding and histone chaperone activity, while acetylation reduces DNA binding and relocates DEK to interchromatin granule clusters. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by PARP1 leads to its removal from chromatin during apoptosis (Sandén2015The). The DEK protein is also involved in chromatin remodeling and interacts with various histone modifications (Sandén2015The).

## Function
The DEK proto-oncogene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a crucial role in maintaining chromatin integrity and regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. DEK is involved in various DNA and RNA-dependent processes, including DNA replication, splice site recognition, and gene transcription, functioning as both an activator and a repressor of chromatin architecture (Kappes2008DEK). It interacts with Heterochromatin Protein 1 alpha (HP1a) to enhance its binding to trimethylated H3K9, a key mark of repressive chromatin, which is essential for maintaining heterochromatin integrity and epigenetic silencing (Kappes2011The).

DEK also acts as a histone chaperone, facilitating nucleosome assembly and influencing chromatin structure through its interactions with chromatin-associated proteins and transcription factors (Sandén2015The; Kappes2011The). It is involved in DNA repair processes, particularly in resolving DNA lesions and maintaining genomic stability, which is crucial for normal cellular function and organismal development (Kappes2008DEK; Deutzmann2014The). DEK's activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, which affect its DNA binding affinity and chromatin association (Kappes2008DEK).

## Clinical Significance
The DEK proto-oncogene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. Overexpression of DEK is associated with several malignancies, including lung cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In lung adenocarcinomas, high DEK expression correlates with poor prognosis and is linked to cancer progression through the Wnt signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Yang2020DEK). In melanoma, DEK overexpression is observed in metastatic stages, promoting proliferation and chemoresistance, and is associated with the transcriptional activation of antiapoptotic proteins like MCL-1 (Khodadoust2009Melanoma).

In colorectal cancer, DEK overexpression is linked to poor prognosis, larger tumor size, and lower survival rates, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Lin2013DEK). DEK is also involved in acute myeloid leukemia through chromosomal translocation events (Lin2013DEK). Despite its frequent upregulation in cancers, no mutations in the DEK coding sequence have been reported, suggesting that its oncogenic role is primarily due to altered expression levels and interactions (Ishida2020Role).

## Interactions
The DEK proto-oncogene encodes a protein that participates in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene regulation and chromatin architecture. DEK is associated with chromatin in vivo, binding specifically to histone H2A/H2B dimers, which is crucial for its role in altering chromatin topology and structure (Alexiadis2000The; Kappes2001Subcellular). It co-sediments with oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragments, indicating its association with chromatin, and is involved in both transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin regions (Kappes2001Subcellular).

DEK interacts with activating histone modifications such as H3K4me 2/3 and is enriched at the promoters of active genes, acting as a histone chaperone to incorporate activating histones into chromatin (Sandén2015The). It also forms part of the chromatin remodeling complex B-WICH, which is involved in heterochromatin replication (Sandén2015The). DEK's interactions extend to RNA-processing complexes, where it co-localizes with splicing complexes and is released from nuclei by RNase treatment, indicating its association with RNA-containing complexes (Kappes2001Subcellular).

DEK also interacts with transcriptional activators such as AP-2α and C/EBPα, enhancing their activity, while also associating with heterochromatin binding protein 1α (HP1α) to preserve heterochromatin (Sandén2015The). These interactions highlight DEK's dual role in both activation and repression of gene expression, though the specific factors determining its role in different contexts remain unclear (Sandén2015The).
