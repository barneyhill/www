# FYTTD1

## Overview
FYTTD1, or forty-two-three domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to RNA processing and splicing in human cells. The protein is a key component of the TREX complex, which is crucial for the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby facilitating proper protein synthesis and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Savitski2018Multiplexed). FYTTD1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it aids in the assembly of spliceosomal complexes necessary for pre-mRNA splicing, a process vital for gene expression regulation (Savitski2018Multiplexed). The protein's interactions, including those with UAP56 and MKRN2, underscore its role in RNA metabolism and nuclear export (Bonazza2023Identifying). Additionally, FYTTD1 is implicated in various diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Shao2019Copy; Li2021Differentially).

## Function
FYTTD1, also known as forty-two-three domain containing 1, is a protein that plays a critical role in RNA processing and splicing within healthy human cells. It functions as an adaptor of the TREX complex, which is essential for the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This process is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions, as it ensures that mRNA is properly transported for translation into proteins (Savitski2018Multiplexed).

The degradation of FYTTD1, as observed in studies involving the JQ1-VHL PROTAC, leads to the inactivation of the TREX complex, resulting in RNA accumulation in the nucleus and subsequent arrest of protein synthesis. This highlights the importance of FYTTD1 in facilitating mRNA export and maintaining protein homeostasis (Savitski2018Multiplexed).

FYTTD1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly of spliceosomal complexes necessary for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA. This activity is vital for the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of cellular function (Savitski2018Multiplexed).

## Clinical Significance
FYTTD1 is implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In esophageal cancer (ESCA), FYTTD1 is frequently amplified and overexpressed, with 24.73% of patients showing high levels of copy number amplification. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that FYTTD1 may serve as a potential prognostic marker in ESCA. The gene's role in RNA splicing is believed to contribute to tumorigenesis, highlighting its significance in cancer-related processes (Shao2019Copy).

In addition to its role in cancer, FYTTD1 has been studied in the context of Alzheimer's disease. It has been identified as a hub gene in the superior temporal gyrus, associated with Alzheimer's traits such as amyloid plaque and neurofibril tangle density. This suggests a potential involvement in neurodegenerative processes, although specific diseases or conditions directly linked to FYTTD1 mutations are not detailed (Li2021Differentially).

While FYTTD1 is mentioned in studies of ocular diseases and canine genetic research, specific conditions directly resulting from its mutations or dysregulation in these contexts are not clearly defined (Schilter2013Whole‐genome; Mooney2020The).

## Interactions
FYTTD1, also known as forty-two-three domain containing 1, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the context of RNA processing and export. It is a component of the TREX complex, which is essential for mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. FYTTD1 interacts with UAP56, a known interactor of the TREX complex, highlighting its role in RNA splicing and nuclear export (Savitski2018Multiplexed; Bonazza2023Identifying). 

The protein is also implicated in interactions with MKRN2, which supports its role in the nuclear export of bound RNA, potentially regulating this process positively (Bonazza2023Identifying). Additionally, FYTTD1 is affected by the JQ1-VHL PROTAC, which leads to its degradation and results in RNA accumulation in the nucleus, indicating its critical role in mRNA transport (Savitski2018Multiplexed).

FYTTD1 is also phosphorylated by the human cytomegalovirus UL97 kinase, which may regulate the selective translation of viral mRNAs by affecting components of the transcription-transport machinery (Oberstein2015Human). These interactions underscore FYTTD1's significant involvement in RNA metabolism and its potential impact on cellular and viral processes.
