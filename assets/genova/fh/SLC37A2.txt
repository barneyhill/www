# SLC37A2

## Overview
SLC37A2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 37 member 2 (SPX2), which is a member of the solute carrier family of proteins. This protein is characterized as a 12-transmembrane spanning protein, primarily localized to endolysosomal membranes, and plays a significant role in cellular glucose metabolism and bone homeostasis. SLC37A2 functions as a phosphate-linked glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) antiporter, facilitating the exchange of G6P and inorganic phosphate across cellular membranes, which is crucial for maintaining glucose metabolism within cells (Ng2022Sugar; Ng2023Sugar). The protein exists in two isoforms that differ in their subcellular localization, impacting their functional roles in osteoclasts and other cell types (Ng2022Sugar; Ng2023Sugar). Alterations in the expression or function of SLC37A2 have been linked to various pathological conditions, including bone disorders and metabolic diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Hytönen2016Molecular; Zhao2021Hematopoietic).

## Structure
The SLC37A2 protein, also known as SPX2, is encoded by the SLC37A2 gene located on chromosome 11q24.2. It consists of 505 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 55 kDa. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, specifically N-linked glycosylation, resulting in a heterogeneous species ranging from 50-75 kDa (Cappello2018The). SLC37A2 is a 12-transmembrane spanning protein with an extended N-terminal loop that undergoes N-linked glycosylation, indicating its localization to endolysosomal membranes (Ng2022Sugar; Ng2023Sugar). 

The protein exists in two splice variant isoforms that differ by five amino acids at their C-terminus. Isoform 2 contains a canonical lysosomal sorting signal, while isoform 1 has an alternative sequence that targets it to the plasma membrane (Ng2022Sugar; Ng2023Sugar). The subcellular distribution of these isoforms was studied using tagged variants, revealing that they co-occupy a network of dynamic tubulo-vesicular compartments in osteoclasts (Ng2022Sugar). The protein's structure and modifications suggest its role in the lysosomal membrane rather than the endoplasmic reticulum (Ng2023Sugar).

## Function
SLC37A2 is a phosphate-linked glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) antiporter that facilitates the transport of G6P in exchange for inorganic phosphate (Pi) across cellular membranes. This activity is crucial for the regulation of glucose metabolism within cells. SLC37A2 is primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it co-localizes with ER-marker proteins, indicating its role in phosphate and G6P transport across the ER membrane (Pan2011SLC37A1). Despite its transport activity, SLC37A2 does not couple with glucose-6-phosphatase enzymes, which are essential for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis, suggesting that its role in glucose regulation is independent of these enzymes (Pan2011SLC37A1).

In addition to its role in glucose metabolism, SLC37A2 is involved in bone metabolism, particularly in osteoclasts, where it regulates the export of monosaccharide sugars from lysosomal structures. This function is essential for maintaining the size and function of secretory lysosomes, which are crucial for bone resorption and metabolism (Ng2022Sugar). The absence of SLC37A2 leads to impaired osteoclast function and increased bone mass, highlighting its importance in bone homeostasis (Ng2023Sugar).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC37A2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of atherosclerosis, SLC37A2 deficiency in hematopoietic cells accelerates the disease in LDL receptor-deficient mice. This is linked to increased macrophage inflammation and reduced production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which contributes to plaque instability and progression of atherosclerosis (Zhao2021Hematopoietic).

In dairy cattle, a specific mutation in SLC37A2 introduces a stop codon early in the protein, which is associated with prenatal death and is suggested to be the causative mutation for the harmful MH2 haplotype. This mutation affects glucose-6-phosphate metabolism, potentially leading to embryonic lethality (Fritz2013Detection).

In dogs, a splicing variant in SLC37A2 is associated with craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO), a condition characterized by abnormal bone growth. This variant leads to a frameshift and premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein. The condition is considered a model for human Caffey disease, suggesting a potential role for SLC37A2 in similar human bone disorders (Hytönen2016Molecular; Letko2020Whole).

## Interactions
SLC37A2, a member of the solute carrier family, is involved in several interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It is part of the METTL3-SLC37A2-YTHDF1 axis, where METTL3 binds to a specific site on SLC37A2 mRNA, facilitating m6A modification. This modification is recognized by the RNA-binding protein YTHDF1, which enhances the translation and expression of the m6A-modified mRNA, thereby regulating macrophage activity and inflammatory responses (Xu2024hucMSCEx).

SLC37A2 also interacts with vitamin D, as it is a target gene with a conserved vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding site. This interaction suggests that SLC37A2 expression can be modulated by vitamin D3 levels, potentially serving as a biomarker for vitamin D3 status (Cappello2018The).

In the context of glioblastoma, SLC37A2 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, although it does not directly interact with G6PC3 in the G6Pase system. This suggests that while SLC37A2 is significantly expressed in glioma tissues, its interactions in this context are not fully understood (Torabidastgerdooei2023A).
