# NCOR1

## Overview
NCOR1 (nuclear receptor corepressor 1) is a gene that encodes the nuclear receptor corepressor 1 protein, a pivotal transcriptional corepressor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional corepressor and plays a crucial role in modulating various physiological processes, including metabolism, inflammation, and circadian rhythm regulation. The NCOR1 protein functions by interacting with nuclear receptors and transcription factors, facilitating the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to repress gene expression through chromatin remodeling (Lima2018Role; Mottis2013Emerging). It is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis by influencing metabolic pathways and energy metabolism, as well as playing a role in the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and other cellular processes (Doyon2009Nuclear; Lima2018Role). The gene's involvement in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, underscores its clinical significance (NoblejasLópez2018Evaluation; Geiger2020Role).

## Structure


## Function
NCoR1 (nuclear receptor corepressor 1) is a transcriptional corepressor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It interacts with nuclear receptors and transcription factors to repress gene expression, primarily through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), such as HDAC3, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression (Lima2018Role; Mottis2013Emerging). NCoR1 is involved in various physiological processes, including metabolism, inflammation, and circadian rhythm regulation. It influences metabolic pathways by interacting with nuclear receptors like PPARg, PPARb/d, and Rev-erba, impacting insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis (Mottis2013Emerging).

In the context of energy metabolism, NCoR1 modulates mitochondrial function by repressing genes crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. Its deletion in specific tissues, such as the liver and muscle, enhances mitochondrial function and energy expenditure, indicating its role in energy homeostasis (Yamamoto2011NCoR1; Lima2018Role). NCoR1 also plays a role in maintaining the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells by repressing genes like the pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), which is associated with growth inhibition (Doyon2009Nuclear). Overall, NCoR1 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by balancing metabolic and inflammatory processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NCOR1 gene are implicated in various diseases. In cancer, NCOR1 is considered a potential tumor suppressor gene. Mutations in NCOR1 are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer subtypes, including triple-negative, HER2 positive, and luminal B tumors, as well as in lung adenocarcinomas. High expression levels of NCOR1 correlate with better relapse-free survival, suggesting its protective role (NoblejasLópez2018Evaluation). In bladder cancer, NCOR1 mutations are linked to enhanced tumor immunogenicity and improved response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, indicating a potential biomarker role for predicting treatment efficacy (Lin2021Effect).

NCOR1 also plays a role in metabolic disorders. It is a central regulator in atherosclerosis and related immunometabolic diseases, influencing inflammatory and metabolic processes in the liver and macrophages. Alterations in NCOR1 function can affect lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and cholesterol absorption, contributing to conditions like type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Geiger2020Role).

In thyroid disorders, NCOR1 is involved in resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH). Mutations affecting its interaction with thyroid hormone receptors can ameliorate RTH symptoms, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of this condition (Fozzatti2011Resistance). Additionally, NCOR1 mutations have been identified in congenital heart defects, indicating its role in heart development (Gholipoorfeshkecheh2020Wholeexome).

## Interactions
NCOR1 (nuclear receptor corepressor 1) is involved in various protein interactions that facilitate its role in transcriptional repression. It forms complexes with histone deacetylases (HDACs), particularly HDAC3, which is crucial for its repressive activity. These complexes also include proteins such as transducin β-like 1 (TBL1), TBL-related 1 (TBLR1), and G-protein-pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2), which are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Perissi2010Deconstructing; Lima2018Role).

NCOR1 interacts with nuclear receptors and transcription factors, acting as a docking hub for chromatin-modifying enzymes. It is recruited to promoters by nuclear receptors and transcription factors, such as NF-κB, AP1, and Tel, to mediate repression (Perissi2010Deconstructing). NCOR1 also interacts with c-Jun at AP1-binding sites to silence inflammatory genes and is involved in the repression of PPARα targets, influencing metabolic processes (Mottis2013Emerging).

In the context of chronic myelogenous leukemia, NCOR1 has been shown to interact with ETS family transcription factors, suggesting a role in erythroid differentiation and drug sensitivity (Long2015Integrative). These interactions highlight NCOR1's versatile role in gene regulation across different biological contexts.
