# LARS1

## Overview
LARS1 (leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1, which is a crucial component in the process of protein synthesis and cellular metabolism. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNA molecules, a fundamental step in translating genetic information into proteins (Kim2021Leucinesensing). Beyond its canonical role in protein synthesis, leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1 functions as a leucine sensor that regulates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism (Kim2021Leucinesensing; Yu2021Aminoacyl-tRNA). The enzyme's ability to sense leucine levels and modulate mTORC1 activity underscores its importance in integrating nutrient and energy signals to control various cellular processes, including lipid and protein synthesis, nucleotide synthesis, and autophagy (Kim2021Leucinesensing). Mutations in the LARS1 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as Infantile Liver Failure Syndrome Type 1 (ILFS1), highlighting its significance in human health (Peroutka2018Severe; Casey2015Clinical).

## Structure
LARS1 (leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1) is a protein involved in leucine sensing and mTORC1 activation. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains: the catalytic domain (CD), the editing domain (CP1), and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD is further divided into the RagD-binding domain (RBD) and a long variable arm motif. The CD features a Rossmann fold with eight alpha helices and five beta strands, containing HIGH and KMSKS motifs crucial for ATP recognition (Kim2021Leucinesensing).

LARS1 can exist in different conformational states, known as 'sensing-on' and 'sensing-off', which are influenced by the binding of leucine and ATP. These states are determined by the orientation of the R-lever and the swing helix, with the 'sensing-on' state associated with LARS1-Leu syn and the 'sensing-off' state linked to LARS1-ATP syn and LARS1-Leu-AMS syn (Kim2021Leucinesensing).

Post-translational modifications of LARS1 include O-GlcNAcylation at the S1042 residue, which affects its interaction with RagD and mTORC1 signaling. This modification is crucial for structural changes in the VC domain, impacting the protein's function in leucine metabolism (Kim2022OGlcNAc).

## Function
LARS1 (leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1) is a multifunctional enzyme that plays a critical role in protein synthesis and cellular metabolism. It catalyzes the attachment of leucine to its corresponding tRNA, a fundamental step in translating genetic information into proteins (Kim2021Leucinesensing). Beyond its role in protein synthesis, LARS1 functions as a leucine sensor that regulates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and metabolism (Kim2021Leucinesensing; Yu2021Aminoacyl-tRNA).

LARS1 senses leucine levels and, upon binding leucine, undergoes conformational changes that facilitate its interaction with RagD, a component of the mTORC1 pathway, leading to mTORC1 activation (Kim2021Leucinesensing). This activation is essential for integrating signals from nutrients and energy status to regulate cellular processes such as lipid and protein synthesis, nucleotide synthesis, and autophagy (Kim2021Leucinesensing).

LARS1 is also involved in glucose-dependent regulation of leucine metabolism. Under glucose starvation, LARS1 is phosphorylated, which decreases its leucine-binding ability, redirecting leucine to catabolic pathways for energy production (Yoon2020Glucose-dependent). This regulatory mechanism helps maintain cellular energy balance and survival during nutrient scarcity (Kim2022OGlcNAc).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LARS1 gene are associated with Infantile Liver Failure Syndrome Type 1 (ILFS1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. ILFS1 is characterized by recurrent liver dysfunction, acute liver failure, microcytic anemia, developmental delays, and seizures. The condition often presents in infancy and can be triggered by febrile illnesses, leading to severe liver crises (Peroutka2018Severe; Casey2015Clinical). The pathophysiology of ILFS1 involves impaired leucine incorporation during protein synthesis, which affects organs with high protein synthesis rates, such as the liver and bone marrow (Peroutka2018Severe).

Specific mutations, such as the Y373C variant, have been identified in the LARS gene, which is located in the editing domain crucial for maintaining protein stability and function. This mutation is predicted to destabilize the protein, potentially leading to errors in amino acid incorporation during protein synthesis (Casey2012Identification). The LARS1 gene mutations may lead to the incorporation of incorrect amino acids, causing misfolded proteins and contributing to liver disease through endoplasmic reticulum stress (Casey2015Clinical).

Management of ILFS1 includes ensuring adequate protein intake during illness to prevent hepatic and encephalopathic episodes, as traditional strategies of reducing protein intake may be detrimental (Casey2015Clinical).

## Interactions
Leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (LARS1) is involved in several critical interactions that influence the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. LARS1 acts as a leucine sensor, facilitating the conversion of RagD-GTP to RagD-GDP, which is essential for mTORC1 activation (Kim2021Leucinesensing). The binding of leucine to LARS1 induces a conformational change that enhances its interaction with RagD, a key component of the mTORC1 pathway (Kim2021Leucinesensing). This interaction is further modulated by ATP, which increases leucine binding to LARS1, promoting the synthesis of Leu-AMP, a crucial step for mTORC1 activation (Kim2021Leucinesensing).

The structural changes in LARS1 upon leucine binding, particularly in the CP1 hairpin motif and the R-lever, are vital for its interaction with RagD. Mutations in specific residues, such as H251 and R517, disrupt this interaction, leading to decreased mTORC1 activation (Kim2021Leucinesensing). These interactions highlight the role of LARS1 in amino acid sensing and its impact on cellular growth and metabolism through the mTORC1 pathway.
