# XRCC5

## Overview
The XRCC5 gene encodes the Ku80 protein, a pivotal component of the DNA repair machinery, particularly within the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Ku80, a DNA-binding protein, forms a heterodimer with Ku70, facilitating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by stabilizing and protecting DNA ends (Thacker2004The; Bau2011Role). Beyond its primary role in DNA repair, Ku80 is involved in V(D)J recombination, telomere maintenance, and transcriptional regulation, highlighting its multifaceted functions in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression (Fantini2017Chromatin; Thacker2003The). The protein's interactions with various cellular partners, such as DNA-PKcs and DDB2, underscore its importance in cellular processes beyond DNA repair, including roles in cancer progression and immune system development (Fantini2017Chromatin; Zhang2017XRCC5). Alterations in XRCC5 expression and function have been linked to increased cancer susceptibility, emphasizing its clinical significance in oncology (Wang2008A; Bau2011Role).

## Structure
The XRCC5 protein, also known as Ku80, is a crucial component of the DNA repair machinery, particularly in the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. The primary structure of XRCC5 includes a DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal domain, which are essential for its function in DNA repair (Bau2011Role). The secondary structure of XRCC5 features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and interaction with DNA (Bau2011Role).

In terms of tertiary structure, XRCC5 forms a ring-like configuration when it heterodimerizes with Ku70, allowing it to encircle and bind to DNA ends effectively (Bau2011Role). This structural arrangement is critical for recognizing and stabilizing DNA double-strand breaks. The quaternary structure involves the formation of the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, which is one of the first complexes to associate with DNA ends during the repair process (Thacker2004The).

Post-translational modifications of XRCC5, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, play significant roles in modulating its activity and interactions with other proteins involved in DNA repair (Bau2011Role). These modifications can influence the protein's ability to recruit additional factors necessary for efficient DNA repair.

## Function
The XRCC5 gene encodes the Ku80 protein, which is a critical component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, a major mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in eukaryotic cells. Ku80 forms a heterodimer with Ku70, and this complex is one of the first to bind to DNA ends at a DSB, acting as a sensor and protector of broken DNA. This binding facilitates the recruitment of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which is essential for the repair process (Thacker2003The; Bau2011Role).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, XRCC5 is involved in V(D)J recombination, a process critical for the development of the immune system, and in telomere maintenance, preventing chromosome end-to-end fusions that can lead to genomic instability (Thacker2004The; Thacker2003The). XRCC5 also plays a role in transcriptional regulation, interacting with DDB2 to regulate gene expression in the absence of DNA damage (Fantini2017Chromatin). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, but it can also be involved in cytosolic processes related to copper regulation (Du2011A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the XRCC5 gene, also known as Ku80, have been implicated in various cancers. In bladder cancer, a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in the XRCC5 promoter affects transcriptional activity, with fewer repeats leading to increased XRCC5 expression and a higher cancer risk. Individuals lacking the 2R allele have a 1.75-fold increased risk of bladder cancer (Wang2008A; Bau2011Role). In breast cancer, the 0R/0R genotype of XRCC5 is associated with increased risk, while the 1R/3R genotype decreases risk (Rajaei2014Association). 

In oral cancer, particularly in Taiwan, the XRCC5 rs828907 SNP is linked to increased susceptibility, especially among betel quid chewers (Bau2011Role). XRCC5 polymorphisms also play a role in colorectal cancer, with the rs828907 polymorphism increasing risk in smokers (Bau2011Role). 

Altered XRCC5 expression due to promoter hypermethylation is observed in non-small cell lung cancer, contributing to chromosome instability (Lee2007Epigenetic). XRCC5 overexpression is linked to the progression of bladder, gastric, and breast cancers (Wang2008A). These findings highlight the gene's role in cancer susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
XRCC5, also known as Ku80, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in DNA repair and other cellular processes. It forms a heterodimer with XRCC6 (Ku70), which is essential for binding to DNA ends during the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway (Fantini2017Chromatin). XRCC5 interacts with the DNA-PKcs to form the DNA-PK complex, facilitating DNA repair (Fantini2017Chromatin).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, XRCC5 interacts with DDB2, a protein involved in chromatin association and transcriptional regulation. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of XRCC5 to chromatin in the absence of DNA damage and is involved in the transcriptional activation of genes such as SEMA3A (Fantini2017Chromatin).

XRCC5 also interacts with the transcription co-activator p300, which acetylates XRCC5, enhancing its ability to bind to the COX-2 promoter and promote COX-2 expression in colon cancer cells (Zhang2017XRCC5). This interaction suggests a role for XRCC5 in cancer progression through the regulation of gene expression.

Furthermore, XRCC5 has been shown to interact with the centromeric protein K (CENPK) in gastric cancer cells, promoting cancer proliferation and migration by reducing apoptosis (Tian2022Centromeric). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of XRCC5 in cellular processes beyond DNA repair.
