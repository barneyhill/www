# WIF1

## Overview
WIF1 (WNT inhibitory factor 1) is a gene that encodes a secreted protein known for its role as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. The WIF1 protein is characterized by its N-terminal WIF domain and multiple EGF-like domains, which facilitate its interaction with Wnt proteins, thereby inhibiting their signaling activity. This protein is crucial in various biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, by modulating the expression of key signaling molecules. WIF1's function as a tumor suppressor is underscored by its frequent downregulation in several cancers, often due to promoter hypermethylation, which leads to the aberrant activation of oncogenic pathways. The structural features of WIF1, such as its ability to bind palmitoylated Wnt proteins, are essential for its inhibitory function, making it a significant focus of research in cancer biology and developmental processes (Kerekes2015Wnts; Urakami2006Epigenetic; Chen2016Inhibition).

## Structure
The Wnt Inhibitory Factor 1 (WIF1) protein is a secreted protein characterized by its N-terminal WIF domain and five EGF-like domains. The WIF domain is primarily responsible for its Wnt inhibitory activity and has been structurally characterized using NMR spectroscopy. This domain contains an alkyl-binding site crucial for interacting with the lipid groups of Wnt proteins, which is essential for Wnt binding (Kerekes2015Wnts; Kerekes2019Structure). The WIF domain is approximately 140 residues long and acts as a palmitoyl binding domain, necessary for binding to palmitoylated Wnt proteins (Malinauskas2008Docking).

The secondary structure of WIF1 includes beta-sheets and alpha-helices, and its tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds. WIF1 functions as a monomer, lacking a quaternary structure. Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which can affect the binding affinity of Wnt proteins to the WIF domain (Kerekes2015Wnts).

The EGF-like domains of WIF1 are implicated in Wnt binding and may contain a heparan sulfate proteoglycan-binding site. These domains interface with the WIF domain, contributing to the protein's overall structure and function (Kerekes2019Structure).

## Function
WIF1 (WNT inhibitory factor 1) is a secreted protein that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes by antagonizing the Wnt signaling pathway. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), WIF1 suppresses angiogenesis by inhibiting cell migration and tube formation. This is achieved through the downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at both the protein and mRNA levels. WIF1 also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by suppressing the expression of cyclin D1, a key regulator of the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. It interacts directly with Wnt ligands, leading to the downregulation of β-catenin and Wnt5a expression, which are components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Chen2016Inhibition).

In normal human melanocytes, WIF1 influences melanogenesis by modulating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Overexpression of WIF1 leads to increased levels of β-catenin, which translocates into the nucleus, and upregulates the expression of MITF and tyrosinase, key factors in melanogenesis. This results in increased melanin content and tyrosinase activity, suggesting that WIF1 acts as an autocrine or paracrine modulator of Wnt signaling, promoting skin pigmentation (Park2013Wnt).

## Clinical Significance
The WIF1 gene, encoding the Wnt inhibitory factor 1, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its function as a tumor suppressor. In bladder cancer, WIF1 expression is often reduced due to promoter hypermethylation, leading to aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This results in increased expression of oncogenes such as c-myc and cyclin D1, contributing to tumorigenesis (Urakami2006Epigenetic).

In breast cancer, WIF1 is frequently silenced through promoter hypermethylation, which is observed in a significant proportion of primary tumors. This epigenetic alteration is associated with the dysregulation of Wnt signaling, a key factor in breast cancer development (Ai2006Inactivation).

WIF1 is also implicated in glioblastoma, where its expression is often downregulated due to genomic deletions or promoter hypermethylation. This downregulation is linked to the activation of oncogenic pathways and contributes to the malignancy of glioblastoma (Lambiv2011The).

In colorectal cancer, WIF1 promoter methylation is associated with aggressive disease features, such as distant metastasis and vascular invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (AbdelmaksoudDammak2014Downregulation).

## Interactions
WIF1 (WNT inhibitory factor 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in modulating signaling pathways. One of its primary interactions is with Wnt proteins, where WIF1 binds directly to these proteins, preventing their interaction with receptor complexes and thereby inhibiting Wnt signaling. This interaction is crucial for its function as a negative regulator of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, which is significant in processes like stem cell control and carcinogenesis (Cheng2014Insights; Kerekes2019Structure).

WIF1 also interacts with Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), primarily through the CT domain of CTGF. This interaction has been shown to impair CTGF's activity in enhancing the expression of cartilage matrix genes such as aggrecan and collagen2a1 in chondrocytes. The interaction between WIF1 and CTGF suggests that WIF1 may have roles beyond Wnt signaling, potentially affecting other pathways like Hedgehog signaling (Surmann‐Schmitt2012The).

The WIF domain of WIF1 is responsible for its high affinity for palmitoylated Wnt proteins, which is essential for its inhibitory function. This domain's structure allows it to recognize and bind to lipid-modified Wnt proteins, further emphasizing its role in Wnt signaling inhibition (Liepinsh2006NMR).
