# CACNG3

## Overview
The CACNG3 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma 3, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the modulation of neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels. This protein is part of the stargazin-like family, known for their function as transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), which are essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Moss2003Human). The CACNG3 protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains and is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex and amygdala, where it influences neuronal signaling and plasticity (Moss2003Human; green2001kinetic). The gene is located on chromosome 16p12-p13.1 and has been implicated in neurological conditions, including childhood absence epilepsy and gliomas, highlighting its clinical significance (Shan2023Integrated; Everett2007Linkage).

## Structure
The CACNG3 protein is a gamma subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel complex. It is predicted to have a structure consisting of four transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-termini located intracellularly, suggesting a conserved membrane topology across gamma subunits (Moss2003Human; green2001kinetic). The primary structure of CACNG3 includes a 948-bp open reading frame encoding 315 amino acids (Xia2000Identification). Sequence alignments show that CACNG3 shares 75% identity with the mouse stargazin protein, indicating a high degree of conservation (green2001kinetic).

The protein is part of a family of stargazin-like proteins, which are known to function as transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) and may influence calcium channel activity (Moss2003Human). Although specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CACNG3 are not provided, the protein's role in modulating channel activity and its structural similarity to other gamma subunits suggest it may participate in complex interactions within the channel complex (Moss2003Human). The protein is expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex and amygdala (Moss2003Human).

## Function
The CACNG3 gene encodes a protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel complex. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating the activity and kinetics of the channel, thereby influencing the flow of calcium ions into cells. Calcium ion regulation is vital for various cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and gene expression (Xia2000Identification).

In the brain, CACNG3 is primarily active, affecting neuronal signaling and plasticity. It is part of a family of genes known as g-subunit genes, which are transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs). These proteins mediate the surface expression of AMPA receptors, which are critical for synaptic transmission and plasticity. The expression pattern of the g3 subunit is specific to the cortex and hippocampus, with low levels in the cerebellum, suggesting its involvement in brain-specific functions such as learning and memory (Everett2007Linkage).

The CACNG3 gene is located on chromosome 16p12-p13.1 and is part of the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) family. These channels are implicated in the trafficking of transmembrane receptor regulatory proteins, contributing to the etiology of neurological conditions like childhood absence epilepsy (Everett2007Linkage).

## Clinical Significance
The CACNG3 gene has been implicated in several neurological disorders due to its role in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. In childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), CACNG3 is considered a susceptibility locus. Studies have shown significant linkage and association with CAE, although no definitive causal mutations in the coding regions have been identified. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CACNG3 gene, such as rs2021512, have shown significant transmission disequilibrium, suggesting potential regulatory effects that may contribute to the disease (Everett2007Linkage).

In gliomas, a type of brain tumor, CACNG3 expression is notably lower in tumor tissues compared to normal brain tissues. This reduced expression is associated with higher glioma grades and poorer overall survival in patients. CACNG3 is particularly downregulated in the mesenchymal subtype of gliomas, which is more aggressive and treatment-resistant. The gene's expression is also linked to specific genetic alterations in gliomas, such as IDH1 mutations and 1p/19q codeletion, which have prognostic significance. These findings suggest that CACNG3 could serve as an independent prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in glioma treatment (Shan2023Integrated).
