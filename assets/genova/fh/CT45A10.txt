# CT45A10

## Overview
The CT45A10 gene encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 45 member A10, which is part of a group of proteins known as cancer/testis antigens (CTAs). These proteins are typically expressed in various types of cancer and in the testis, but not in most normal tissues, making them of particular interest in cancer research and immunotherapy. The CT45A10 protein is implicated in several cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Due to its restricted expression pattern, CT45A10 is being investigated as a potential target for cancer vaccines and other therapeutic strategies (Qiu2020aarFDC).
