# NSUN5

## Overview
NSUN5 is a gene that encodes the NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 5, a member of the RNA methyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the methylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), specifically at cytosine 3782 within the 28S rRNA, which is crucial for ribosome stability and function (Heissenberger2019Loss; Janin2019Epigenetic). The NSUN5 protein is characterized by its conserved RNA methyltransferase domain, which includes a SAM binding pocket essential for its catalytic activity (Heissenberger2019Loss). NSUN5 plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and global protein synthesis, with its activity localized in the nucleolus (Heissenberger2019Loss). Alterations in NSUN5 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and Williams-Beuren syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Heissenberger2019Loss; Zhang2022NSUN5).

## Structure
The NSUN5 protein is composed of three distinct domains: an N-terminal domain of unknown function, a conserved RNA methyltransferase domain, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function (Heissenberger2019Loss). The RNA methyltransferase domain includes a SAM (S-adenosyl methionine) binding pocket and two critical cysteine residues, C308 and C359, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Heissenberger2019Loss). Mutations at these cysteine residues, such as C308S and C359S, abolish the methylation activity, highlighting their importance in substrate binding and release (Heissenberger2019Loss).

The N-terminal domain is crucial for the nucleolar localization of NSUN5, as its absence results in the exclusion of the protein from the nucleoli (Heissenberger2019Loss). The C-terminal domain, while less critical for nucleolar localization, slightly redistributes NSUN5 from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm when absent (Heissenberger2019Loss).

NSUN5 is a member of the NOP2/Sun family of RNA methyltransferases, which are characterized by their conserved catalytic domains (Heissenberger2019Loss). The protein's structure is likely stabilized by interactions among its secondary structural elements, although specific details on its alpha-helices and beta-sheets are not provided in the context.

## Function
NSUN5 encodes a ribosomal RNA methyltransferase that plays a critical role in the methylation of cytosine 3782 (m5C3782) within the 28S rRNA in human cells. This methylation is essential for maintaining the structural stability and function of ribosomes, which are crucial for global protein synthesis and normal cellular growth (Heissenberger2019Loss; Janin2019Epigenetic). NSUN5's activity is localized primarily in the nucleolus, where it participates in early ribosome biogenesis, ensuring proper ribosomal assembly and function (Heissenberger2019Loss).

The methylation process facilitated by NSUN5 is necessary for the formation of the eukaryote-specific bridge eB14 in ribosomes, which is involved in global protein translation (Heissenberger2019Loss). The absence of NSUN5 leads to impaired ribosome function, reduced protein synthesis, and decreased cell proliferation, particularly affecting highly proliferative cells (Heissenberger2019Loss).

NSUN5's role extends to influencing organismal physiology, as its deficiency is associated with conditions such as Williams-Beuren Syndrome, where its haploinsufficiency results in partial loss of rRNA modification, potentially contributing to the syndrome's pathology (Heissenberger2019Loss). The gene's expression is tightly regulated and varies across different tissues, potentially through epigenetic mechanisms (Heissenberger2019Loss).

## Clinical Significance
NSUN5 is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NSUN5 is significantly upregulated, promoting tumor proliferation and migration, and is associated with poor prognosis. This suggests that NSUN5 could be a potential target for HCC treatment (Zhang2022NSUN5).

In gliomas, NSUN5 is often epigenetically silenced through promoter hypermethylation, leading to reduced expression. This silencing is linked to improved overall survival and progression-free survival in glioma patients, indicating that NSUN5 hypermethylation serves as a favorable prognostic biomarker. The loss of NSUN5 activity in gliomas is associated with a stress-adaptive translational program, which helps tumor cells survive under stress conditions (Janin2019Epigenetic).

NSUN5 is also associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a neurodevelopmental disorder. The gene is deleted in approximately 95% of WBS patients, contributing to cognitive deficits and neural abnormalities. NSUN5 deficiency affects the development of the corpus callosum and cerebral cortex, leading to impaired neuronal migration and myelination, which are linked to the cognitive and behavioral profiles observed in WBS (Yuan2019Agenesis; Heissenberger2019Loss; Chen2019Expression).

## Interactions
NSUN5, a ribosomal RNA methyltransferase, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It directly interacts with RIG-I, a key receptor in the RIG-I signaling pathway, enhancing the recognition and binding of viral RNA. This interaction is facilitated by the CARD and CTD domains of RIG-I and the N-terminal of NSUN5, and is crucial for the induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, which are essential for antiviral responses (Sun2020NSUN5).

NSUN5 also interacts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA), specifically methylating the C3782 position in human 28S rRNA. This methylation is important for maintaining normal cell proliferation and protein synthesis. The loss of NSUN5 leads to reduced global protein translation, although it does not affect ribosome biogenesis or translational fidelity (Heissenberger2019Loss).

In the context of glioma, NSUN5 is epigenetically silenced, resulting in hypomethylation of 28S rRNA and a decrease in overall protein synthesis. This silencing allows glioma cells to engage in a stress adaptive translational program, selectively translating certain mRNAs to cope with oxidative stress (Janin2019Epigenetic).
