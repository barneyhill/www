# MKI67

## Overview
The MKI67 gene encodes the Ki-67 protein, a nuclear protein that serves as a key marker for cellular proliferation. Ki-67 is a non-histone protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, being expressed in all active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and mitosis) but absent in quiescent cells (G0) (Schlüter1993The). Structurally, Ki-67 is characterized by its large size and amphiphilic nature, which facilitate its function in chromatin organization and mitotic chromosome dispersion (Cuylen2016Ki67). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), underscore its role in maintaining chromosomal integrity and regulating cell cycle progression (Scholzen2001The; Sun2018Ki-67:). Clinically, Ki-67 is widely used as a proliferation marker in cancer diagnostics, with its expression levels often correlating with tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis (Wei2018Augmented). Despite its association with cell proliferation, research indicates that Ki-67 is not essential for cell division, as cells can proliferate without it (Sobecki2016The).

## Structure
The MKI67 protein, commonly known as Ki-67, is a large nuclear protein with isoforms of approximately 320-360 kDa. It is characterized by a high net electrical charge and an amphiphilic structure, which contribute to its function as a biological surfactant in mitotic chromosome dispersion (Cuylen2016Ki67). The protein's structure includes an N-terminal Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-binding site, and a central region composed of 16 tandem repeats. The C-terminal region is enriched in leucine and arginine (LR) residue pairs, which are crucial for DNA binding and chromatin compaction (Sobecki2016The).

Ki-67's amphiphilic nature and high charge allow it to stabilize chromosome dispersion through steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion, forming brush-like structures on the chromosome surface (Cuylen2016Ki67). This structural feature is essential for maintaining chromosome separation after nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis (Cuylen2016Ki67). The protein's ability to bind directly to DNA and HP1 proteins is facilitated by its C-terminal LR domain, which plays a role in heterochromatin organization (Takagi2016Perichromosomal).

## Function
The MKI67 gene encodes the Ki-67 protein, a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation. Ki-67 is expressed during all active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and mitosis) but is absent in quiescent cells (G0) (Schlüter1993The). It is involved in various molecular processes, including chromatin organization and cell cycle progression. During mitosis, Ki-67 is crucial for forming the perichromosomal layer, which prevents chromosome aggregation and ensures proper chromosome segregation (Sun2018Ki-67:). The protein's interaction with Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) isoforms is essential for targeting PP1γ to anaphase chromosomes, facilitating histone dephosphorylation during mitotic exit (Sun2018Ki-67:).

Ki-67 also influences the regulation of the G1/S checkpoint through modulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, affecting S phase entry and DNA replication-related mRNA levels in certain cell types (Sun2018Ki-67:). Its expression is tightly regulated by transcription factors and complexes, ensuring synchronization with the cell cycle (Uxa2021Ki67). Despite its association with cell proliferation, studies suggest that Ki-67 is not essential for cell proliferation, as cells can proliferate efficiently without it (Sobecki2016The).

## Clinical Significance
The MKI67 gene, encoding the Ki-67 protein, is a critical marker for cell proliferation and is widely used in cancer diagnostics. Alterations in MKI67 expression are associated with various cancers, often indicating aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis. High Ki-67 expression is linked to poorer overall survival and disease-free survival in lung cancer patients, correlating with clinical parameters such as tumor size and pathologic stages (Wei2018Augmented). In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), increased MKI67 expression is associated with early cancer relapse and advanced tumor grade, serving as a potential prognostic biomarker (Wu2021Correlation). 

Mutations in the MKI67 gene can lead to structural and functional changes in the Ki-67 protein, potentially resulting in abnormal cell cycles and tumor development. A study identified eight different mutations in the MKI67 gene across four tumor cell lines, including a single base deletion causing a truncated protein and several mutations resulting in amino acid changes (Bubán2004Detection). These genetic alterations may contribute to tumorigenesis by disrupting normal cell cycle regulation. The regulation of MKI67 expression is also influenced by transcriptional control mechanisms involving the DREAM complex and the p53-p21 pathway, which are crucial for maintaining proper cell cycle progression (Uxa2021Ki67).

## Interactions
The MKI67 gene encodes the Ki-67 protein, which is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin organization and cell cycle regulation. Ki-67 interacts with members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family, specifically HP1a, HP1b, and HP1c, through its C-terminal region. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of higher-order chromatin structure and is mediated by the chromo shadow domain of HP1b (Scholzen2001The).

Ki-67 also binds to Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) via a canonical RVxF motif and a novel KiR-SLiM motif, which is important for targeting PP1γ to anaphase chromosomes, facilitating histone dephosphorylation during mitotic exit (Sun2018Ki-67:). Additionally, the Ki-67 FHA domain interacts with the kinesin-like protein Hklp2 and NIFK, influencing spindle bipolarity and cell proliferation, respectively (Sun2018Ki-67:).

The protein is part of a complex network involving chromatin regulators and nucleolar processes, affecting chromatin compaction and gene expression. Ki-67's interactions with proteins such as CDK1, NIFK, and components of the nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC) further underscore its role in chromatin regulation and ribosomal biogenesis (Sobecki2016The).
