# EGFL8

## Overview
EGFL8 is a gene that encodes the protein EGF-like domain multiple 8, which is a secreted protein involved in cellular signaling and protein-protein interactions. The protein is characterized by the presence of two epidermal growth factor-like (EGFL) domains, an Emilin-like (EMI) domain, and a calcium-binding EGFL domain, which are indicative of its functional roles in various biological processes (SONG2015Molecular). The EGFL8 protein is highly conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary importance (SONG2015Molecular). It is expressed in various tissues and has been implicated in the regulation of cellular differentiation and proliferation, particularly in the context of cancer, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Shi2020A; Weiss2021Schwann). The protein's structure and function suggest it may serve as a potential therapeutic target in oncology (Shi2020A).

## Structure
The EGFL8 protein, also known as C6 or f8, NG3, and VE-statin-2, is a secreted protein consisting of 293 amino acids with a molecular mass of 32 kDa and an isoelectric point of pH 6.13 (SONG2015Molecular). It contains two epidermal growth factor-like (EGFL) domains, an Emilin-like (EMI) domain, and a Ca2+-binding EGFL domain, which are indicative of its role in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling (SONG2015Molecular). The EGFL domains are highly conserved across species, suggesting evolutionary significance (SONG2015Molecular).

The protein is predicted to be secreted, featuring a signal sequence at the N-terminus (SONG2015Molecular). An alternative splicing variant, EGFL8-2, has been identified, which is a 296-bp isoform containing an open reading frame resulting from alternative splicing of the full-length EGFL8 gene transcript (SONG2015Molecular). The amino acid sequence of EGFL8 is highly conserved across various vertebrates, sharing significant sequence identity with human and rat EGFL8 (SONG2015Molecular). The protein's 3-dimensional structure was modeled using the Swiss-Model server, including a Delta:Serrate:LAG2 domain, which is conserved in ligands of Notch receptors (SONG2015Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EGFL8 gene have been associated with various cancers and their prognoses. In neuroblastic tumors, particularly neuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas, EGFL8 is expressed by stromal and repair Schwann cells and has been shown to induce neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. This pro-differentiating and anti-proliferative effect is linked to better clinical outcomes, with higher EGFL8 expression correlating with increased patient survival (Weiss2021Schwann). In contrast, in colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC), EGFL8 expression is significantly reduced compared to normal tissues, and this downregulation is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis (Shi2020A).

The expression of EGFL8 also varies across different cancer types, influencing patient survival outcomes. High EGFL8 expression predicts poor prognosis in colorectal adenocarcinoma and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, while it is associated with a survival advantage in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and thymoma (Shi2020A). EGFL8 is also involved in modulating tumor immunity and stromal cell infiltration, potentially impacting cancer progression and patient prognosis (Shi2020A). These findings suggest that EGFL8 could serve as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
