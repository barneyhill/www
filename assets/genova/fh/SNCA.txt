# SNCA

## Overview
The SNCA gene encodes the protein alpha-synuclein, which is predominantly expressed in neural tissue and plays a critical role in the regulation of synaptic vesicle dynamics. Alpha-synuclein is categorized as an intrinsically disordered protein, capable of adopting multiple conformations, including α-helical structures upon interaction with lipid membranes and β-sheet-rich structures that can lead to aggregation (Ulmer2005Structure; Mehra2021Structural). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, such as neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and mitochondrial function, and interacts with numerous proteins to maintain neuronal health (Snead2014AlphaSynuclein; BernalConde2020AlphaSynuclein). Mutations and alterations in the SNCA gene are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, highlighting its clinical significance (Zarranz2003The; Deng2014Genetic).

## Structure
The SNCA gene encodes alpha-synuclein, a protein primarily found in neural tissue. Alpha-synuclein is a 140 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 14.4 kDa (Mehra2021Structural). Its primary structure includes three domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1-60), which is amphipathic and lipid-binding; the NAC domain (residues 61-95), which forms the hydrophobic core and is prone to aggregation; and the C-terminal domain (residues 95-140), which is flexible and negatively charged (Mehra2021Structural).

In terms of secondary structure, alpha-synuclein can adopt multiple conformations. It is intrinsically disordered in solution but can form α-helices upon binding to lipid membranes or micelles (Ulmer2005Structure). The micelle-bound structure consists of two curved, anti-parallel α-helices connected by a short linker (Ulmer2005Structure).

The tertiary structure of alpha-synuclein is less defined due to its intrinsically disordered nature, but it can transition to a β-sheet-rich structure under certain conditions, leading to aggregation (Meade2019Alphasynuclein). The quaternary structure involves the formation of fibrils, which exhibit polymorphic forms such as 'rod' and 'twister' polymorphs, characterized by distinct β-sheet arrangements (Li2018CryoEM; Mehra2021Structural).

Post-translational modifications of alpha-synuclein include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence its aggregation properties (Meade2019Alphasynuclein).

## Function
The SNCA gene encodes the alpha-synuclein protein, which plays a multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in neurons. Alpha-synuclein is primarily located at presynaptic terminals, where it is involved in synaptic vesicle homeostasis, including docking, priming, clustering, fusion, and recycling of synaptic vesicles (Snead2014AlphaSynuclein; Emanuele2015Mechanisms). It acts as a negative regulator of neurotransmitter release, influencing the trafficking of synaptic vesicles and maintaining synaptic function and plasticity (Benskey2016The; Emanuele2015Mechanisms).

Alpha-synuclein also interacts with various cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane, lipid rafts, and mitochondrial membranes, and may contribute to fatty acid metabolism and oxidative stress protection (Snead2014AlphaSynuclein). It is involved in dopamine synthesis and regulation by interacting with tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter, affecting dopamine biosynthesis and reuptake (Snead2014AlphaSynuclein; Kanaan2012Loss).

In addition to its synaptic roles, alpha-synuclein is found in the nucleus, where it may influence gene expression and transcriptional regulation by interacting with DNA and histones (BernalConde2020AlphaSynuclein). It is also implicated in mitochondrial function, where it may regulate ATP synthesis and mitochondrial dynamics (BernalConde2020AlphaSynuclein; Kanaan2012Loss). These diverse functions highlight alpha-synuclein's critical role in maintaining neuronal health and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SNCA gene are significantly associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations such as p.A53T, p.A30P, and p.E46K in the SNCA gene lead to early-onset PD and are linked to various clinical features, including cognitive impairments and response to L-dopa therapy (Polymeropoulos1997Mutation; Deng2014Genetic). The SNCA gene is also implicated in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), with the E46K mutation causing parkinsonism, dementia, and visual hallucinations (Zarranz2003The).

Genomic multiplications, such as duplications and triplications of the SNCA gene, result in increased α-synuclein expression, contributing to familial parkinsonism and dementia (Farrer2004Comparison). These alterations lead to the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates, known as Lewy bodies, which are characteristic of these diseases (Deng2014Genetic).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SNCA gene, such as rs356219, are associated with increased PD risk by potentially upregulating α-synuclein expression (Mata2010SNCA; Fernández‐Santiago2019SNCAandmTORPathway). These genetic variations highlight the role of SNCA in modulating susceptibility to neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
Alpha-synuclein (SNCA) is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function and role in disease. It interacts with synaptobrevin-2, a component of the SNARE complex, facilitating SNARE-complex assembly essential for neurotransmitter release in presynaptic nerve terminals (Burré2010αSynuclein). This interaction is significant for maintaining synaptic activity and is confirmed through methods like co-immunoprecipitation (Burré2010αSynuclein).

SNCA also interacts with a wide network of proteins involved in its biogenesis, including chaperones for folding, ubiquitin ligases for modification, and proteins involved in mitochondrial homeostasis (Hernandez2020ProteinProtein). These interactions are categorized into clusters based on their functions, such as transcription, translation, and degradation, highlighting the complexity of SNCA's interaction network (Hernandez2020ProteinProtein).

During its aggregation process, SNCA interacts with various proteins, including those in Lewy bodies, with specificity to different conformers of SNCA, such as monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar forms (Leitão2021Selectivity). These interactions are crucial for understanding SNCA's role in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's (Leitão2021Selectivity).
