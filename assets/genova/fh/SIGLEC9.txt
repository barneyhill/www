# SIGLEC9

## Overview
SIGLEC9 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 9 (Siglec-9), which is a member of the Siglec family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind sialic acids, which are commonly found on the surface of cells. Siglec-9 is a type I transmembrane protein that functions primarily as an inhibitory receptor on various immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer cells. The protein plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by recognizing sialic acid-containing glycoproteins, thereby helping to distinguish between self and non-self entities. This function is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune activation (Foussias2000Identification; Varki2005Siglecs—the). Siglec-9's involvement in immune regulation and its interactions with other cellular components make it a significant focus of research, particularly in the context of cancer and inflammatory diseases (Wu2022Siglec9; Lin2021Functions).

## Structure
SIGLEC9 encodes a protein that is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) family, characterized by its ability to bind sialic acids. The protein structure of Siglec-9 includes three immunoglobulin (Ig) domains: one N-terminal V-set domain and two C2-set domains, which are typical of Siglec family proteins (Foussias2000Identification). The V-set domain contains a conserved arginine essential for sialic acid binding, forming a salt bridge with the carboxylate of sialic acid (Varki2005Siglecs—the). 

Siglec-9 is a type I transmembrane protein, featuring an N-terminal signal sequence and a transmembrane domain consisting of approximately 25 residues (Foussias2000Identification). The cytoplasmic domain contains two conserved motifs: one similar to an immunoreceptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory motif (ITIM) and another homologous to a sequence found in the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) (Foussias2000Identification).

Post-translational modifications of Siglec-9 may include glycosylation, which is common among Siglec proteins, affecting their binding properties and interactions (Varki2005Siglecs—the). The protein's quaternary structure can involve monomers, dimers, or higher-level multimers, influencing its functional binding avidity (Varki2005Siglecs—the).

## Function
SIGLEC9 encodes a protein that is part of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family, which plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses. Siglec-9 is primarily expressed on various immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, B cells, NK cells, and some T cells, where it functions as an inhibitory receptor (Zhang2000Siglec-9; Zheng2020The). It recognizes sialic acid-containing glycoproteins on cell surfaces, facilitating the distinction between self and non-self, which is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune activation (Läubli2019Sialic).

The protein contains intracellular immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which, upon phosphorylation, recruit SHP phosphatases (SHP-1 and SHP-2) to mediate inhibitory signaling, thus dampening immune cell activation (Zhang2000Siglec-9; Zheng2020The). Siglec-9 is involved in regulating osteoclast activity, where it supports osteoclast differentiation but reduces the resorption activity of mature osteoclasts, aligning with its anti-inflammatory functions (Andes2021The). Additionally, Siglec-9 plays a role in immune cell-tumor cell interactions by binding to mucin MUC16, influencing immune surveillance and potentially affecting tumor progression (Belisle2010Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the SIGLEC9 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions. In cancer, SIGLEC9 is often overexpressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and is associated with immune evasion mechanisms. It is co-expressed with checkpoint inhibition receptors such as PD-1 and Tim3, suggesting that targeting SIGLEC9 alongside these receptors could enhance anti-tumor immunity in patients with solid tumors (Lin2021Functions). In gliomas, high SIGLEC9 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with immune cell infiltration, indicating its role in tumor progression and immune suppression (Wu2022Siglec9).

In inflammatory diseases, SIGLEC9 is involved in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses. It can induce neutrophil apoptosis, which varies between newborns and adults, and is implicated in controlling inflammatory reactions in human airways (Lin2021Functions). SIGLEC9 polymorphisms have been associated with the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), highlighting its role in respiratory conditions (Lin2021Functions). These findings suggest that SIGLEC9 plays a significant role in both cancer progression and inflammatory diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
SIGLEC9, a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family, participates in several key interactions that modulate immune responses. It is known to interact with Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatases, specifically SHP-1 and SHP-2, upon phosphorylation. These interactions are crucial for its role as an inhibitory receptor on immune cells such as monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells (Avril2004The). The membrane-proximal tyrosine motif of SIGLEC9 is essential for these interactions, as mutations in this motif can disrupt the recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2, thereby impairing its inhibitory function (Avril2004The).

In the context of CD8+ T cells, SIGLEC9 engagement triggers SHP-1-associated inhibitory pathways, leading to reduced cytotoxic activity and cytokine production (Haas2019Siglec9). SIGLEC9 also interacts with sialylated glycoproteins such as MUC16, facilitating immune cell-tumor cell adhesion. This interaction is mediated by the binding of sialic acid residues on MUC16 to SIGLEC9, which is significant in the context of ovarian cancer (Belisle2010Identification). These interactions highlight SIGLEC9's role in modulating immune cell activity and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and infectious diseases.
