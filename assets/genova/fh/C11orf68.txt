# C11orf68

## Overview
C11orf68 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 68. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. Emerging research suggests that C11orf68 may play a significant role in cancer biology, particularly in the invasiveness of certain cancer types such as breast and prostate cancer. The protein encoded by C11orf68 has been associated with oncogenic activities, as evidenced by its overexpression in invasive cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is linked to a common promoter hypomethylation signature observed in invasive cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential mechanism by which C11orf68 contributes to cancer progression (Cheishvili2015A; Sudhakar2022Novel).

## Clinical Significance
C11orf68 has been implicated in the invasiveness of certain cancer types. Studies have shown that C11orf68 is overexpressed in invasive lobular and ductal carcinomas of the breast compared to normal and cancer-adjacent tissues, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Cheishvili2015A). Its expression is notably higher in invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas than in medullary carcinoma, which is associated with BRCA1 mutation (Cheishvili2015A). In prostate cancer, C11orf68 is not expressed in normal tissues but is positively stained in a subset of prostate adenocarcinoma tissues, indicating potential overexpression in these cancer types (Cheishvili2015A).

Research has also demonstrated that the depletion of C11orf68 in breast and liver cancer cell lines results in a significant reduction of invasiveness, although this effect is not observed in prostate cancer cells (Cheishvili2015A). This suggests that C11orf68 may play a role in the invasiveness of specific cancer types, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention. The gene has been identified as part of a common promoter hypomethylation signature in invasive cancer cell lines, further supporting its involvement in cancer invasiveness (Cheishvili2015A). Additionally, C11orf68 has been predicted as an oncogene in cancer research, highlighting its potential role in cancer development (Sudhakar2022Novel).
