# SEPTIN14

## Overview
SEPTIN14 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 14, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins are integral to various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell cycle control, and membrane dynamics. Septin 14 is characterized by a conserved GTPase domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which are essential for its role in forming hetero-oligomeric complexes and filamentous structures that contribute to cellular scaffolding and signaling (Vahabi2020Expression; Wang2020Septin14). The protein is particularly significant in the nervous system, where it influences neuronal migration and maturation, impacting brain development and function (Shinoda2010Septin; Dolat2013Septin). Mutations in the SEPTIN14 gene have been linked to male infertility and may also play a protective role against Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Rozenkrantz2016SEPT14; Lin2020ACTN4).

## Structure
SEPTIN14 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, characterized by a conserved GTPase domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The protein consists of 432 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa (Vahabi2020Expression; Wang2020Septin14). The GTPase domain is a common feature among septins, facilitating their role in cellular processes such as cytokinesis and cell polarity (Wang2020Septin14). The coiled-coil domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with other septins like SEPT4, and is essential for the formation of filamentous structures (Shinoda2010Septin; Wang2019SEPT14).

SEPTIN14 forms hetero-oligomeric complexes, which are important for its function in cellular scaffolding and signaling (Wang2019SEPT14). The protein's ability to form these structures is impaired by mutations, such as A123T and I333T, which affect its filament-forming capacity (Wang2019SEPT14). These mutations occur within the GTP-binding and coiled-coil domains, respectively, highlighting the importance of these regions in maintaining the protein's structural integrity and function (Wang2019SEPT14). Common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may also play a role in regulating SEPTIN14's activity and interactions.

## Function
SEPTIN14 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell cycle control, and membrane dynamics. SEPTIN14 is particularly active in the cytoskeleton, where it forms hetero-oligomeric complexes and filaments that act as scaffolds for other proteins, contributing to cell division, vesicle trafficking, and maintaining cell shape (Bukharaeva2018Participation).

In the nervous system, SEPTIN14 plays a crucial role in neuronal migration, particularly in the developing cerebral cortex. It is highly expressed in the cortical plate of developing mouse embryos, where it is essential for proper neuronal migration. Knockdown of SEPTIN14 disrupts this process, causing neurons to stall at the ventricular and intermediate zones without reaching the cortical plate (Dolat2013Septin). SEPTIN14 interacts with SEPT4, and both are involved in the formation of leading processes in migrating cortical neurons, which are essential for proper brain development (Shinoda2010Septin).

SEPTIN14 is also implicated in neuronal maturation, including spine morphogenesis and synaptic contact, potentially through its modulation of cytoskeleton dynamics and interactions with microtubules and actin filaments (Shinoda2010Septin). These functions suggest that SEPTIN14 is integral to the development, activity, and connectivity of the nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEPTIN14 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly through their impact on sperm morphology and DNA integrity. Specific mutations, such as A123T and I333T, are associated with teratozoospermia, a condition characterized by abnormal sperm morphology, primarily due to head defects. These mutations disrupt the polymerization ability and co-localization of F-actin filaments, leading to malformed sperm heads and increased DNA fragmentation, which contribute to infertility (Wang2019SEPT14; Lin2020ACTN4).

Alterations in SEPTIN14 expression levels have also been observed in infertile men, particularly those with non-obstructive azoospermia. Lower expression levels of SEPTIN14 are found in patients with conditions like hypospermatogenesis and Sertoli cell-only syndrome, suggesting a link between reduced SEPTIN14 expression and certain forms of male infertility (Vahabi2020Expression).

In addition to its role in male infertility, SEPTIN14 has been associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson's disease. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the SEPTIN14 gene, such as rs10241628 and rs11981883, have been linked to a decreased risk of developing this neurological disorder, indicating a potential protective role of SEPTIN14 in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis (Rozenkrantz2016SEPT14).

## Interactions
SEPTIN14 interacts with SEPTIN4, a relationship that plays a crucial role in neuronal migration. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen, which revealed SEPTIN4 as a binding partner for SEPTIN14, particularly in the brain and testis (Shinoda2010Septin). The C-terminal coiled-coil region of SEPTIN14 is essential for its interaction with SEPTIN4, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation analyses in COS7 cells and mouse brain lysates (Shinoda2010Septin). Functional studies using siRNA knockdown showed that both SEPTIN14 and SEPTIN4 are necessary for proper neuronal positioning during corticogenesis. Knockdown of either protein resulted in abnormal neuronal positioning, indicating their roles in neuronal migration (Shinoda2010Septin).

SEPTIN14 and SEPTIN4 are also involved in the formation of leading processes in migrating neurons. Knockdown of either SEPTIN14 or SEPTIN4 led to shorter leading processes in bipolar cells in the lower cortical plate, although the morphology of multipolar cells in the intermediate zone was unaffected (Shinoda2010Septin). These findings suggest that SEPTIN14 and SEPTIN4 may modulate the dynamics of the cytoskeleton by interacting with microtubules and actin filaments, influencing cytoskeleton-regulating proteins (Shinoda2010Septin).
