# MESP2

## Overview
MESP2 is a gene that encodes the mesoderm posterior bHLH transcription factor 2, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor. This protein is integral to the process of somitogenesis, which is crucial for the development of the vertebral column and skeletal muscles. MESP2 is expressed in the anterior presomitic mesoderm and plays a pivotal role in establishing segmental borders by modulating Notch signaling pathways. It achieves this by activating the lunatic fringe (Lfng) gene, thereby defining segmental boundaries and contributing to the rostrocaudal patterning of somites. The protein's activity is regulated through a proteasome-mediated pathway, ensuring its rapid turnover necessary for its function. Beyond its developmental roles, MESP2 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including spondylocostal dysostosis and certain congenital heart defects, as well as acting as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer (Morimoto2005The; Ge2023MESP2; Saga2007Segmental).

## Function
MESP2 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays a critical role in somitogenesis, the process of forming somites, which are precursors to the vertebral column and skeletal muscles. In healthy cells, MESP2 is expressed in the anterior presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and is essential for establishing segmental borders by modulating Notch signaling. It suppresses Notch activity by activating the lunatic fringe (Lfng) gene, which helps define segmental boundaries and the rostrocaudal patterning of somites (Morimoto2005The; Saga2007Segmental).

MESP2's expression is tightly regulated and appears as a band in the S-1 or S-2 regions of the PSM, crucial for defining segmental borders. It initially overlaps with the Notch activation domain, but as MESP2 levels increase, the domains separate, forming a clear boundary (Saga2007Segmental). MESP2 also represses the Notch ligand Dll1, contributing to the establishment of rostrocaudal polarity in somites (Takahashi2000Mesp2).

The protein's activity is regulated by a proteasome-mediated pathway, with a specific degradation domain identified as crucial for its rapid turnover, necessary for its function in somitogenesis (Morimoto2006Cooperative). MESP2's role is more about patterning than differentiation, as it is not directly linked to general chondrogenic, osteogenic, or myogenic differentiation (Takahashi2007Transcription).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MESP2 gene are associated with spondylocostal dysostosis, a rare heritable disorder characterized by segmentation defects of the vertebrae and abnormalities of the thoracic cage. This condition results from disruptions in the Notch signaling pathway, where MESP2 plays a crucial role (Liang2015The; Gucev2010Autosomal). MESP2 mutations can lead to impaired segmentation of the somitic mesoderm, resulting in fused vertebral columns and caudal truncation, as observed in mouse models (Liang2015The).

In addition to its role in skeletal development, MESP2 has been implicated in cardiac development. Variants of the MESP2 gene, such as G116R, Y307X, and Q20L, have been identified in patients with conotruncal heart defects (CTDs), a subgroup of congenital heart defects. These variants disrupt cardiac neural crest cell proliferation, which is essential for the proper development of the heart's outflow tract (Zhang2020MESP2).

MESP2 also plays a role in cancer biology. In gastric cancer, MESP2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its overexpression inhibits cancer progression by stabilizing the protein p27 and interfering with the TCF4/beta-catenin transcriptional complex, which is part of the Wnt signaling pathway (Ge2023MESP2).

## Interactions
MESP2 interacts with several proteins and pathways, playing a crucial role in both embryonic development and cancer progression. In the context of somitogenesis, MESP2 modulates Notch signaling by destabilizing mastermind-like 1 (Maml1), a core component of the Notch pathway. This interaction is essential for establishing rostro-caudal polarity in somites, as MESP2 represses Notch signaling independently of its transcription factor activity (Sasaki2011The).

MESP2 also interacts with the Lfng enhancer, where it acts as an activator alongside NICD, while Hes7 suppresses these activities. MESP2 specifically binds to a portion of the Lfng enhancer, suggesting its role in activating Lfng and inhibiting Notch activity oscillation (Morimoto2005The).

In gastric cancer, MESP2 competes with beta-catenin for binding to TCF4, inhibiting the TCF4/beta-catenin transcriptional complex. This interaction reduces the complex's occupancy on the SKP2 promoter, leading to the stabilization of p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, thereby suppressing cancer cell proliferation and migration (Ge2023MESP2).
