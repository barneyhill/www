# PATL2

## Overview
The PATL2 gene encodes the protein PAT1 homolog 2, an RNA-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation during oocyte maturation. This protein is categorized as a translational repressor and is essential for the formation of mRNA-protein complexes that control the translation of specific mRNAs, particularly during the oogenesis process when active transcription is not feasible due to chromatin condensation (Maddirevula2017Female). PAT1 homolog 2 is crucial for the progression of oocytes to the metaphase II stage, a necessary step for successful fertilization and embryo development (Christou‐Kent2018PATL). Mutations in the PATL2 gene are associated with female infertility, particularly due to oocyte maturation arrest, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health (Christou‐Kent2018PATL; Chen2017Biallelic).

## Function
The PATL2 gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in oocyte maturation by regulating mRNA stability and translation. In healthy human cells, PATL2 is involved in the formation of mRNA-protein complexes that are essential for controlling the translation of specific mRNAs during oogenesis. This regulation is critical because active transcription is not possible due to chromatin condensation in oocytes (Maddirevula2017Female).

PATL2 functions as a translational repressor, sequestering mRNA in a manner similar to P-bodies in somatic cells. These complexes are vital for maintaining mRNA stability and ensuring the proper timing of protein synthesis necessary for oocyte growth and maturation (Christou‐Kent2018PATL; Maddirevula2017Female). The protein's expression begins at the primary follicle stage, peaks in secondary follicle oocytes, and is localized in the cytoplasm, indicating its role in the primordial/primary follicle transition (Christou‐Kent2018PATL).

PATL2's involvement in mRNA regulation is crucial for the progression of oocytes to the metaphase II stage, which is essential for successful fertilization and embryo development. Its absence leads to transcriptomic deregulation, affecting pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, protein synthesis, and DNA repair, ultimately impacting oocyte maturation and fertility (Christou‐Kent2018PATL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PATL2 gene are significantly associated with female infertility, particularly due to oocyte maturation arrest. Biallelic mutations in PATL2 have been linked to various stages of oocyte arrest, including germinal vesicle (GV) arrest, metaphase I (MI) arrest, and early embryonic arrest, leading to fertilization failure (Huang2018Novel; Chen2017Biallelic). These mutations often result in the production of immature oocytes, a condition known as oocyte meiotic deficiency (OMD), which is a form of primary infertility (Christou‐Kent2018PATL). 

PATL2 mutations are also implicated in the deregulation of genes involved in oocyte maturation and early embryonic development, contributing to infertility (Christou‐Kent2018PATL). In some populations, such as North African women, a significant percentage of patients with OMD have been found to carry homozygous truncations of PATL2, suggesting a potential founder effect (Christou‐Kent2018PATL).

Alterations in PATL2 expression levels have been observed in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where reduced expression in ovarian granulosa cells is associated with increased apoptosis and abnormal follicular development (Peng2021PATL2). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PATL2 in reproductive health and its potential role in diagnosing and understanding infertility related to oocyte maturation defects.

## Interactions
PATL2 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In Arabidopsis, PATL2 interacts with the IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER 1 (IRT1), which is essential for iron acquisition. This interaction is potentially regulated by the phosphorylation of PATL2's N region under conditions of iron deficiency and stress (Montag2023Role). PATL2 also co-immunoprecipitates with AMSH3, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in intracellular trafficking, indicating its role in membrane dynamics and protein trafficking (Montag2023Role).

In mammals, PATL2 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in oocyte maturation. It is involved in mRNA stability and translational repression, potentially interacting with other RNA-binding proteins such as Msy2 and Ddx6. These interactions suggest that PATL2 may be part of a complex involved in mRNA processing and stability, similar to P-bodies in somatic cells (Christou‐Kent2018PATL). The PAT1 domain of PATL2 is crucial for its function, as it is involved in interactions necessary for RNA binding (Zhou2023High). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PATL2 in both plant and mammalian systems.
