# SGMS1

## Overview
The SGMS1 gene encodes the enzyme sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1), which is integral to the synthesis of sphingomyelin, a crucial component of cellular membranes. As a member of the lipid phosphate phosphatase superfamily, SMS1 is characterized by its transmembrane topology, featuring six membrane-spanning alpha-helices. Predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus, SMS1 catalyzes the conversion of ceramide and phosphatidylcholine into sphingomyelin and diacylglycerol, playing a vital role in maintaining membrane integrity and facilitating lipid signaling pathways (Daian2020Regulation; Unknownauthors2019SphingomyelinSynthasesinNeuropsychiatricHealthandDisease). The enzyme's activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and protein trafficking, and it is implicated in several pathological conditions, such as heart failure and melanoma (Bilal2019Sphingomyelin; PérezCarrillo2022Implication).

## Structure
The SGMS1 gene encodes the sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) protein, which is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus. The protein is involved in the synthesis of sphingomyelin from ceramide and phosphatidylcholine. SMS1 is characterized by a membrane topology similar to the lipid phosphate phosphatase superfamily, featuring six membrane-spanning alpha-helices connected by hydrophilic regions that form extramembrane loops. Both the N- and C-termini of SMS1 face the cytosol (Unknownauthors2019SphingomyelinSynthasesinNeuropsychiatricHealthandDisease).

SMS1 forms homodimers mediated by the carboxyl-terminal tail, and it contains four highly conserved sequence motifs, D1, D2, D3, and D4. The motifs D3 and D4 are thought to be part of the catalytic site. The catalytic activity of SMS1 is not affected in C-terminal mutants, but truncation from the fourth to the sixth transmembrane region or mutagenesis of certain residues results in a loss of sphingomyelin synthesis activity (Unknownauthors2019SphingomyelinSynthasesinNeuropsychiatricHealthandDisease).

The protein is ubiquitously expressed in humans and is mainly responsible for de novo sphingomyelin synthesis, which is limited by substrate availability (Unknownauthors2019SphingomyelinSynthasesinNeuropsychiatricHealthandDisease).

## Function
SGMS1, also known as sphingomyelin synthase 1, is a crucial enzyme in the synthesis of sphingomyelin (SM), a key component of cell membranes. It catalyzes the transfer of a phosphocholine group from phosphatidylcholine to ceramide, producing SM and diacylglycerol (DAG) in the process. This reaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and signaling functions of cellular membranes, particularly in the central nervous system (Daian2020Regulation; Unknownauthors2019SphingomyelinSynthasesinNeuropsychiatricHealthandDisease).

SGMS1 is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it accounts for 60-80% of total sphingomyelin synthase activity. Its activity is limited by substrate availability, and it plays a significant role in regulating the balance between SM and DAG, which influences apoptosis and cell proliferation (Unknownauthors2019SphingomyelinSynthasesinNeuropsychiatricHealthandDisease). The enzyme is also involved in lipid signaling, utilizing ceramide and phosphatidylcholine as substrates, and is crucial for the activation of several membrane receptors, such as CD95, TCR, and BCR (Daian2020Regulation).

SGMS1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is involved in regulating protein trafficking and secretion, as well as maintaining ceramide homeostasis. It is essential for processes like transferrin internalization and cell proliferation, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and response to stress (Unknownauthors2019SphingomyelinSynthasesinNeuropsychiatricHealthandDisease).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SGMS1 gene, which encodes sphingomyelin synthase 1, have been implicated in several diseases. In heart failure patients, SGMS1 expression is significantly reduced, leading to increased ceramide levels and associated apoptosis in cardiac tissue. This dysregulation in sphingolipid metabolism is linked to the pathophysiology of heart failure (PérezCarrillo2022Implication).

In melanoma, SGMS1 is frequently downregulated, which is associated with sphingolipid metabolism reprogramming. This downregulation correlates with a worse prognosis in metastatic melanoma patients, suggesting that SGMS1 expression levels could serve as a biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes. The study also found a higher mutation rate in the SGMS1 coding sequence in melanoma, with some mutations affecting the catalytic domain, and DNA methylation changes associated with decreased expression (Bilal2019Sphingomyelin).

SGMS1 also plays a role in viral infections. A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen identified SGMS1 as a critical host factor for pseudorabies virus infection. The absence of SGMS1 significantly reduced the infection efficiency, highlighting its importance in viral entry pathways (Hölper2021A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SGMS1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SGMS1, or sphingomyelin synthase 1, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), which affects its activity and plays a role in sphingolipid metabolism (Daian2020Regulation). SGMS1 is also associated with circular RNAs (circRNAs) that are highly expressed in the nervous system, suggesting a role in post-transcriptional regulation (Unknownauthors2019SphingomyelinSynthasesinNeuropsychiatricHealthandDisease).

In the context of viral infections, SGMS1 is crucial for the entry of pseudorabies virus (PrV) into host cells. The absence of SGMS1 significantly reduces the infection efficiency of PrV, indicating its potential interactions with viral components or other host factors during the infection process (Hölper2021A). SGMS1's role in sphingomyelin synthesis is critical for maintaining membrane structure and function, which is essential for viral entry (Hölper2021A).

SGMS1 also plays a role in the toxicity of Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin (α HL) by regulating sphingomyelin content in the plasma membrane, which is important for lipid raft formation. These lipid rafts are necessary for α HL pore formation, highlighting SGMS1's involvement in host-pathogen interactions (Virreira2016Genome-wide).
