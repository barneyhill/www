# TMA7

## Overview
The TMA7 gene encodes the protein translation machinery associated 7 homolog, which is involved in the cellular processes related to protein synthesis. This protein is categorized as a component of the translation machinery, playing a crucial role in the assembly and function of ribosomes, which are essential for translating mRNA into proteins. The TMA7 protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular biology. It is implicated in various cellular pathways and may interact with other proteins to facilitate efficient protein synthesis. Understanding the function and interactions of TMA7 is important for elucidating its role in normal cellular physiology and its potential implications in disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
