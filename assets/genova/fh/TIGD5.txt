# TIGD5

## Overview
TIGD5 is a gene that encodes the protein tigger transposable element derived 5, which is a transposase-derived protein. This protein is characterized by its DNA-binding domain and a partially conserved DDE domain, features typical of pogo transposases, suggesting a role in DNA binding and regulation of genetic elements (Gao2020Evolutiona). TIGD5 is expressed in various tissues, including muscle and glandular tissues, and has been implicated in several biological processes and diseases. It is involved in protein-protein interactions and has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer, as well as a candidate gene in autism spectrum disorder (Xie2021Comprehensive; Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic; Bartolome2024Quantitative). The gene's expression and mutations are associated with clinical significance in conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma and meningiomas, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and its involvement in complex cellular pathways (Xu2018Identification; Chen2021m6A).

## Structure
The TIGD5 protein is derived from Tigger transposases and retains structural features typical of transposase-derived proteins. It includes a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a partially conserved DDE domain, which are characteristic of pogo transposases (Gao2020Evolutiona). The DBD of TIGD5-like proteins contains two submotifs: CENP-B_N and HTH_Tnp_Tc5, located in the N-terminus, while the catalytic domain (DDE_1) is found in the C-terminal regions (Gao2020Evolution). These domains suggest a role in DNA binding and possibly in the regulation of genetic elements.

TIGD5 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the quadriceps femoris muscle, deltoid muscle, parotid gland, and the epithelium of the nasal cavity and kidney (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). The protein's catalytic motif varies across species, with DA60E in mammals, DS/T48E in birds, and DN33D in reptiles, indicating evolutionary adaptations (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic).

In the context of disease, TIGD5 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer, with its protein product being a substrate for proteasome degradation (Bartolome2024Quantitative). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TIGD5 are not provided in the available sources.

## Clinical Significance
The TIGD5 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs75547282 in the TIGD5 gene is identified as a risk variant. The T allele of this SNP is associated with increased expression of TIGD5, which may contribute to ASD risk (Xie2021Comprehensive). The study suggests that alterations in TIGD5 expression or mutations could be clinically significant in ASD (Xie2021Comprehensive).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TIGD5 is one of the hub genes associated with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging and overall survival. Its overexpression is linked to a worse prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker for HCC (Mansur2023The; Xu2018Identification). 

TIGD5 is also noted in meningiomas, where its differential expression helps segregate these tumors into distinct subtypes. This suggests a role in tumor development and progression, although the specific clinical implications are not fully detailed (Chen2021m6A).

## Interactions
TIGD5, a gene derived from Tigger transposable elements, is involved in various protein-protein interactions within the human genome. The BioGrid database lists 50 protein-protein interactions for TIGD5, indicating its extensive interaction network with host proteins, which suggests an embedded role in the host genome (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), TIGD5 has been identified as a candidate causal gene, with the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs75547282 associated with increased risk. This SNP affects the expression of TIGD5, potentially influencing its interactions in the brain (Xie2021Comprehensive).

TIGD5 is also implicated in cancer biology. It has been identified as a proteasome substrate, suggesting a role in protein degradation pathways, which may contribute to its function as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer (Bartolome2024Quantitative). In ovarian cancer, TIGD5 is part of a network of differentially expressed genes involved in immune system pathways, indicating its participation in complex signaling networks (Krishnamoorthy2020Insilico). These interactions highlight TIGD5's potential involvement in regulating gene expression and cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and possibly nucleic acids.
