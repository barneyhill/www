# CYP4X1

## Overview
CYP4X1 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily X member 1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This protein is primarily expressed in the brain, where it is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and signaling molecules, playing a potential role in neurovascular processes. As a monooxygenase, CYP4X1 contributes to the conversion of the endocannabinoid anandamide into bioactive metabolites, implicating it in brain signaling pathways and the regulation of cerebral blood flow (Hardwick2008Cytochrome; Jarrar2019Molecular). The gene's expression is modulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, suggesting its involvement in specific receptor-mediated pathways (Savas2005Conditional). Although the precise physiological roles of CYP4X1 remain to be fully elucidated, its potential impact on cancer prognosis and therapy response, particularly in breast cancer, highlights its clinical significance (Hlaváč2021Role).

## Structure
The human cytochrome P450 4X1 (CYP4X1) protein is composed of 509 amino acids and is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 1, consisting of 12 exons (Kumar2015Computational). The secondary structure of CYP4X1 includes twelve helices (A-L) and five antiparallel beta sheets, with connecting loops. The heme group, essential for its enzymatic activity, is positioned between helices I and L (Kumar2015Computational). A highly conserved threonine residue in helix I is crucial for proton delivery and dioxygen bond cleavage during the catalytic cycle (Kumar2015Computational).

The tertiary structure of CYP4X1 was modeled using homology modeling techniques, and the model was validated through various structural validation programs, indicating a reliable structure (Kumar2015Computational). The model was deposited in the Protein Model Database under ID: PM0079202 (Kumar2015Computational). The protein's functional regions were characterized using ConSurf, identifying conserved amino acid sites important for its biological function (Kumar2015Computational).

No specific information is available regarding the quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of CYP4X1 in the provided context.

## Function
CYP4X1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons and vascular endothelial cells. Its specific function in healthy human cells remains largely undefined, but it is implicated in neurovascular processes. CYP4X1 is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and signaling molecules, which are abundant in the brain and play crucial roles in cell signaling and metabolism (Hardwick2008Cytochrome; Bylund2002Identification).

The enzyme has been shown to convert the endocannabinoid anandamide into 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic ethanolamide, suggesting a role in brain signaling pathways (Jarrar2019Molecular). Additionally, CYP4X1 is involved in the production of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which are potent vasodilators that regulate cerebral blood flow. This activity is rhythmically expressed, potentially contributing to circadian changes in blood flow and cardiovascular risk (Carver2014Rhythmic).

CYP4X1 expression is also regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, indicating that its transcription can be modulated by specific receptor pathways (Savas2005Conditional). Despite these insights, the full physiological roles of CYP4X1 in human health and disease remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The CYP4X1 gene has been implicated in breast cancer prognosis and therapy response. A specific genetic variant, rs17102977, located in the intron of CYP4X1, is associated with the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. Individuals carrying the rare allele G of this variant tend to have a poorer response to chemotherapy but exhibit longer disease-free survival compared to those with the wild-type genotype (Hlaváč2021Role). The expression of CYP4X1 has also been linked to tumor grade in breast cancer, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression (Hlaváč2021Role).

While the specific clinical implications of CYP4X1 mutations or expression alterations are not fully detailed, the gene's involvement in the epoxidation of endogenous cannabinoids indicates a possible influence on cancer chemotherapy response through physiological processes (Hlaváč2021Role). The need for further research on the gene locus 1p33, which includes CYP4X1, is emphasized to better understand its role in cancer and potentially other diseases (Hlaváč2021Role). Despite its expression in various tissues, including the brain and bronchial airways, the clinical significance of CYP4X1 mutations remains largely unexplored (Jarrar2019Molecular).
