# SAXO3

## Overview
SAXO3 is a gene that encodes the protein stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 3, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella. The protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, specifically involved in the stabilization of axonemal microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton in ciliated and flagellated cells. This stabilization is vital for the proper motility and sensory functions of these cellular structures. Mutations or dysregulation of SAXO3 can lead to defects in ciliary function, which are implicated in a range of ciliopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
