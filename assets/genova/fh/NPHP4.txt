# NPHP4

## Overview
The NPHP4 gene encodes the protein nephrocystin-4, which is integral to the function and structure of primary cilia, cellular organelles crucial for signaling and sensory perception. Nephrocystin-4 is categorized as a ciliary protein and is involved in the regulation of protein trafficking and structural organization at the ciliary transition zone, a critical area for maintaining ciliary function (Awata2014Nephrocystin4). The protein interacts with several other ciliary proteins, including nephrocystin-1 (NPHP1) and RPGRIP1, forming complexes that are essential for ciliary and photoreceptor maintenance (Won2010NPHP4). Mutations in the NPHP4 gene are linked to a range of ciliopathies, such as nephronophthisis and Senior-Løken syndrome, which are characterized by renal, retinal, and neurological defects (Otto2010Mutation). The study of NPHP4 and its interactions provides significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders and highlights its importance in cellular signaling pathways and structural integrity (Blasius2019NPHP).

## Structure
The NPHP4 protein, also known as nephrocystin-4, is characterized by a proline-rich domain located between amino acids 458-514, which is a notable feature of its primary structure (Won2010NPHP4). This domain may play a role in protein-protein interactions, as proline-rich regions are often involved in such functions. The protein is phylogenetically conserved, indicating a stable structure across different species (Won2010NPHP4).

NPHP4 interacts with several other proteins, including NPHP1, RPGRIP1, NPHP8, and RPGR, suggesting a quaternary structure where it forms complexes with these proteins (Won2010NPHP4). These interactions are crucial for its role in ciliary function and photoreceptor maintenance. The protein localizes to the transition zone of cilia, where it is involved in regulating the trafficking of membrane and soluble proteins, indicating a structural role in ciliary architecture (Awata2014Nephrocystin4).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are suggested to regulate NPHP4's function, particularly in its interaction with NPHP1, where it modulates Pyk2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Liebau2011Nephrocystin4). This regulatory mechanism highlights the dynamic nature of NPHP4's structure and function.

## Function
The NPHP4 gene encodes the protein nephrocystin-4, which plays a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of primary cilia, essential for cell signaling and sensory perception. Nephrocystin-4 is involved in several cellular processes, including ciliary trafficking and the structural organization of the transition zone (TZ) in cilia. It controls the trafficking of membrane and large soluble proteins at the TZ, ensuring proper protein composition in the flagellar membrane and matrix (Awata2014Nephrocystin4). Nephrocystin-4 is localized to organelles associated with centrosomes and primary cilia, indicating its involvement in ciliary function (Won2010NPHP4).

In the retina, NPHP4 is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor ribbon synapses and proper outer segment formation. It localizes to the connecting cilia region, suggesting a structural or transport role (Won2010NPHP4). NPHP4 interacts with other proteins such as NPHP1 and RPGRIP1, indicating its role in cellular signaling and structural organization (Won2010NPHP4). It also regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of nephrocystin-1 (NPHP1), affecting its targeting to monocilia, which is crucial for ciliary function (Liebau2011Nephrocystin4). These functions highlight the importance of NPHP4 in cellular processes and its potential involvement in ciliopathies.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPHP4 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including nephronophthisis, Senior-Løken syndrome, and Joubert syndrome. Nephronophthisis is an autosomal recessive kidney disease characterized by progressive renal failure, often accompanied by vision and brain defects (Otto2010Mutation; Won2010NPHP4). Senior-Løken syndrome involves both kidney abnormalities and retinal degeneration, while Joubert syndrome includes cerebellar and brainstem malformations (Won2010NPHP4).

In animal models, such as Nphp4 nmf192/nmf192 mice, mutations lead to severe photoreceptor degeneration and male infertility, although these mice do not exhibit the kidney defects typical of human NPHP4 mutations (Won2010NPHP4). In zebrafish, NPHP4 is crucial for normal cardiac development and left-right patterning, with mutations causing heart laterality defects (French2012NPHP4).

In dogs, a deletion in NPHP4 is linked to recessive cone-rod dystrophy in standard wire-haired dachshunds, causing retinal degeneration without affecting the kidneys (Wiik2008A). In humans, NPHP4 variants have been associated with pleiotropic heart malformations and laterality defects, such as heterotaxy, which includes cardiac laterality defects and situs abnormalities (French2012NPHP4).

## Interactions
NPHP4 (nephrocystin 4) is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its function in ciliary processes. It interacts with nephrocystin-1 (NPHP1), where it regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1 through its interaction with the kinase Pyk2. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of NPHP1 to cilia, as NPHP4 reduces Pyk2-induced phosphorylation, thereby modulating the binding of NPHP1 to the transport protein PACS-1 (Liebau2011Nephrocystin4).

NPHP4 also forms part of a complex with RPGRIP1, RPGR, and SDCCAG8, which is vital for the ciliary targeting of these proteins in photoreceptor neurons. The absence of RPGRIP1 disrupts the localization of NPHP4 and its associated proteins, leading to photoreceptor degeneration (Patil2012Selective).

Additionally, NPHP4 interacts with nucleoporins, such as Nup205 and Nup133, at the base of the primary cilium. These interactions suggest a role for NPHP4 in the structural organization of the nuclear pore complex and in regulating protein entry into the ciliary compartment (Blasius2019NPHP). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of NPHP4 in maintaining ciliary function and cellular signaling pathways.
