# MFSD11

## Overview
MFSD11 is a gene that encodes the protein major facilitator superfamily domain containing 11, which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters. This protein is characterized by its role in facilitating the transport of small solutes across cell membranes, a function that is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Structurally, the protein is predicted to have 12 transmembrane helices, a hallmark of MFS proteins, which are essential for its transport function (Perland2016The; Ceder2021The). MFSD11 is expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with significant expression in neurons, and is implicated in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Perland2016The; Ceder2021The). The gene's expression is responsive to nutritional changes, such as amino acid starvation and dietary conditions, suggesting its involvement in amino acid sensing and energy metabolism pathways (Perland2016The; Ceder2020Glucose). Additionally, MFSD11 has been associated with various health conditions, including intellectual disability and cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Abedalthagafi2019Precsion; Liu2023JMJD6).

## Structure
MFSD11 is a protein that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), characterized by its role in facilitating the transport of small solutes across cell membranes. The protein is predicted to have 12 transmembrane helices, a common feature among MFS proteins, which form a characteristic fold essential for its function (Perland2016The; Ceder2021The). The secondary structure of human MFSD11 was modeled with 11% identity, 100% confidence, and 94% amino acid coverage, indicating a reliable prediction of its structural features (Ceder2021The).

The tertiary structure of MFSD11 was modeled using the crystal structure of UNC93B1 as a template, suggesting significant similarities in global protein folding patterns (Ceder2021The). This modeling was performed with high confidence, supporting the likelihood that MFSD11 adopts a similar overall fold to other MFS proteins. The protein is also noted to have short N-terminus and C-terminus regions, akin to its relative protein UNC93A (Ceder2021The).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, have been identified in MFSD11, which may influence its molecular weight and function (Perland2016The). However, specific details about splice variant isoforms or quaternary structure are not provided in the available data.

## Function
MFSD11 is a gene encoding a protein that is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), which is involved in the transport of small solutes across cell membranes. This protein is evolutionarily conserved and is expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with abundant expression in the mouse brain, particularly in neurons (Perland2016The; Ceder2021The). MFSD11 is thought to play a role in energy homeostasis, responding to changes in nutritional status. In mice, its expression is upregulated in response to amino acid starvation, suggesting involvement in amino acid sensing pathways such as the AAR and mTORC1 pathways (Perland2016The). 

The protein is also linked to metabolic regulation, with its expression influenced by dietary conditions, such as low sugar and low-calorie diets, indicating a potential role in energy metabolism (Ceder2020Glucose). MFSD11 may be involved in maintaining ion balance, which is crucial for the function of amino acid and sugar transporters (Ceder2021The). Although the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear, MFSD11's regulation by nutritional changes suggests it plays a significant role in cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
The MFSD11 gene has been implicated in several health conditions, although its precise role remains under investigation. Alterations in MFSD11 expression have been associated with intellectual disability. Studies have identified MFSD11 as a novel candidate gene linked to this condition, suggesting its potential involvement in neurological disorders (Borgio2021Heterogeneity; Abedalthagafi2019Precsion). 

In the context of cancer, MFSD11 expression has been correlated with poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). High expression levels of MFSD11, along with other genes, have been associated with adverse outcomes in ESCC patients, indicating a possible role in tumor progression (Liu2023JMJD6). Additionally, a significant correlation between MFSD11 expression and survival in ovarian cancer has been noted, although the mechanisms remain unclear (Liu2023JMJD6).

MFSD11 has also been mentioned in studies on metabolic processes. Its expression is dynamically regulated in response to glucose availability, suggesting a role in metabolic stress responses. In mouse cortex cell cultures, MFSD11 expression changes under conditions of glucose starvation and refeeding, indicating its involvement in energy metabolism (Ceder2020Glucose). However, the clinical significance of these findings in human diseases requires further research.
