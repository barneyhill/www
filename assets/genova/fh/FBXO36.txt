# FBXO36

## Overview
FBXO36 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 36, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif known as the F-box. F-box proteins are one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein), which plays a crucial role in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. This process is essential for the targeted degradation of proteins, thereby regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcription. The specific functions and interactions of F-box protein 36 remain under investigation, but it is implicated in the modulation of protein stability and cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
