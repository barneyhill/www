# CENPI

## Overview
CENPI, or centromere protein I, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the kinetochore, a critical structure for chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein, centromere protein I, is a component of the CENP-H/I complex, which is essential for the proper attachment of spindle microtubules to chromosomes, thereby ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation. This function is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy. CENPI is also involved in the stabilization of the RZZ-MAD1 complex at the kinetochore, which is crucial for the spindle assembly checkpoint, a mechanism that safeguards against chromosome missegregation. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in cancer biology, particularly in colorectal and breast cancers, where its overexpression is associated with chromosomal instability and poor prognosis (Thangavelu2017Overexpression; Basit2020Centromere; Ding2018CENPI).

## Function
CENPI (centromere protein I) is a crucial component of the kinetochore, a multi-protein structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. It is part of the CENP-H/I complex, which plays a significant role in linking the inner and outer kinetochore, facilitating the attachment of spindle microtubules to chromosomes. This connection is vital for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, ensuring proper mitotic progression and genomic stability (Thangavelu2017Overexpression; Basit2020Centromere).

CENPI is involved in stabilizing the binding of the RZZ-MAD1 complex to the kinetochore, which is necessary for the correct localization of other proteins such as MAD1, MAD2, and CENP-F. This stabilization is crucial for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a safety mechanism that prevents chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy (Thangavelu2017Overexpression). In healthy cells, CENPI ensures the establishment of strong kinetochore-microtubule connections, which are critical for accurate chromosome segregation and preventing chromosome instability (Thangavelu2017Overexpression).

CENPI is active in the centromere region of chromosomes, where it contributes to the structural integrity of the kinetochore and regulates the dynamics of microtubules, playing a role in signaling the spindle checkpoint (Basit2020Centromere).

## Clinical Significance
CENPI (centromere protein I) is implicated in several cancers due to its role in chromosomal instability and cell cycle regulation. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CENPI is overexpressed in tumor tissues and is associated with advanced clinical stages, tumor depth, and metastasis. Its overexpression is linked to increased cell migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, suggesting that CENPI functions as an oncogene in CRC. However, there is no significant association between CENPI expression and overall survival in CRC patients (Ding2018CENPI).

In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtypes, CENPI overexpression is associated with chromosome instability (CIN) and poor prognosis. It is identified as a target of the E2F1 transcription factor and is linked to defects in the Retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway. CENPI overexpression is more prevalent in ER+ breast cancers and correlates with aneuploidy and poor patient outcomes. It serves as a prognostic marker for poor outcomes, particularly in terms of distant metastasis-free survival (Thangavelu2017Overexpression).

## Interactions
CENPI, or centromere protein I, is a crucial component of the HIKM complex at the inner kinetochores, which includes CENP-H, CENP-K, and CENP-M. This complex is essential for proper kinetochore function and chromosome segregation during cell division. CENPI plays a significant role in facilitating correct kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which are vital for chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis (Thangavelu2017Overexpression).

CENPI is involved in stabilizing the RZZ complex, which consists of Rod, Zwilch, and ZW10 proteins, and in maintaining the binding of MAD1 to the kinetochore. This stabilization prevents the removal of these proteins by dynein stripping, which is crucial for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) function and correct chromosome segregation (Thangavelu2017Overexpression).

The protein also interacts with the histone H3 variant CENP-A, which regulates the tri-laminar structure linking the inner and outer kinetochore. Mutations in CENP-A can affect the localization of CENPI, highlighting the interdependent relationship between these proteins (Thangavelu2017Overexpression). CENPI's interactions are critical for the recruitment of the NDC80 complex, which is essential for microtubule attachment (Basit2020Centromere).
