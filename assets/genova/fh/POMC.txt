# POMC

## Overview
The proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene is a critical component of the human genome, encoding the precursor polypeptide proopiomelanocortin, which is subsequently processed into several biologically active peptides. These peptides, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), and β-endorphin, play pivotal roles in various physiological processes such as energy balance, stress response, skin pigmentation, and immune modulation. The POMC gene is primarily expressed in the pituitary gland and certain regions of the brain, where it influences appetite regulation and energy homeostasis through interactions with melanocortin receptors (Harno2018POMC:; Millington2007The). Mutations and epigenetic modifications in the POMC gene can lead to significant clinical conditions, including early-onset obesity and adrenal insufficiency, highlighting its importance in maintaining metabolic and endocrine health (Candler2019Epigenetic; Krude1998Severe).

## Structure
The proopiomelanocortin (POMC) protein is a precursor polypeptide that undergoes extensive post-translational processing to produce several peptide hormones, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), and β-endorphin. The primary structure of POMC includes multiple cleavage sites, typically pairs of basic amino acids, which serve as targets for peptidases, allowing the liberation of functional peptides from the precursor (EBERWINE1983Analysis). The POMC protein is characterized by a high degree of conservation in certain regions, such as the ACTH and endorphin regions, which show nucleic acid homology of greater than 90%, and the MSHs, with homology greater than 80% (EBERWINE1983Analysis).

Post-translational modifications of POMC include glycosylation, although specific glycosylation sites can vary between species. For instance, in humans, a single base change converts a potential glycosylation site from Asn to Asp, eliminating the site (EBERWINE1983Analysis). The POMC gene is generally present as a single copy in most species, with the exception of mice, where two genes have been identified (EBERWINE1983Analysis). The structure of the POMC signal sequence is highly hydrophobic across species, suggesting functional significance (EBERWINE1983Analysis).

## Function
The proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene encodes a precursor protein that is processed into several biologically active peptides, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSHs), and β-endorphin. These peptides play significant roles in various physiological processes. In the central nervous system, POMC neurons are primarily located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem, areas associated with appetite and food intake regulation (Millington2007The). 

POMC-derived peptides are involved in energy balance and feeding behavior. For instance, α-MSH, a product of POMC processing, binds to melanocortin receptors (MC3R and MC4R) to suppress feeding and regulate energy homeostasis (Millington2007The). ACTH, another POMC-derived peptide, is crucial for adrenal gland function and development, playing a central role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by stimulating cortisol production in response to stress (Harno2018POMC:).

In addition to its role in energy balance and stress response, POMC is involved in skin pigmentation and immune modulation. The melanocyte-stimulating hormones influence skin pigmentation, while β-endorphin, an endogenous opioid peptide, can modulate immune responses (Harno2018POMC:; Kono2001In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POMC gene can lead to several clinical conditions, primarily characterized by early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and pigmentation abnormalities. One notable mutation, R236G, disrupts a dibasic prohormone processing site, leading to the production of an aberrant fusion protein that interferes with signaling through the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R). This mutation is associated with increased susceptibility to early-onset obesity, as it reduces the effectiveness of natural agonists in the central melanocortin system, crucial for energy homeostasis (Challis2002A).

POMC mutations can also result in severe early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair pigmentation. These symptoms arise from the absence of POMC-derived peptides, such as ACTH and α-MSH, which are essential for melanocortin receptor signaling involved in pigmentation and adrenal function (Krude1998Severe).

Epigenetic alterations in POMC expression, such as DNA methylation, can influence the gene's role in energy balance and are linked to obesity and metabolic disorders. These changes can be triggered by early life exposures and nutritional factors, affecting POMC expression and contributing to obesity and related metabolic outcomes (Candler2019Epigenetic).

## Interactions
Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function and regulation. POMC interacts with carboxypeptidase E (CPE) and secretogranin III (SgIII) for sorting into dense-core secretory granules. CPE acts as a sorting receptor, binding to the N-terminal motif of POMC, which is essential for its proper trafficking and processing. In CPE-deficient conditions, SgIII compensates to facilitate the release of ACTH from the pituitary (Cawley201660).

POMC transcription is regulated by interactions with transcription factors such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and nuclear receptors like NGFI-B and Nurr1. GR forms a trans-repression complex with Brg1 and HDAC2 at the POMC promoter, which is crucial for transcriptional repression. This complex is stabilized by Brg1, which is necessary for the interaction between GR and NGFI-B (Bilodeau2006Role).

FoxO1 negatively regulates POMC transcription by interacting with STAT3, preventing STAT3 from binding to the POMC promoter. This interaction involves specific residues in FoxO1 that are critical for binding to STAT3, highlighting a mechanism by which FoxO1 modulates POMC expression (Ma2015FoxO1).
