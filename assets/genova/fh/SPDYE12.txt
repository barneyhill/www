# SPDYE12

## Overview
SPDYE12 is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E12, which is part of the speedy/RINGO family of proteins. These proteins are known for their role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to modulate their activity. The SPDYE12 gene is involved in various cellular processes, including cell division and proliferation, by influencing the activity of CDKs, which are crucial for the progression of the cell cycle. The protein encoded by SPDYE12 is characterized by its ability to bind and activate CDKs, thereby playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and potentially impacting cellular responses to DNA damage and repair mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
