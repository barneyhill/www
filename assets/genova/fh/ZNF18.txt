# ZNF18

## Overview
ZNF18 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 18, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, characterized by its ability to bind specific DNA sequences through its zinc finger domains, which are essential for its role in gene regulation (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). Zinc finger protein 18 contains both a SCAN domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and a KRAB domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression by recruiting corepressors for chromatin remodeling (Collins2001All). The protein's activity is crucial for regulating gene expression, impacting various cellular processes such as differentiation and development. Notably, ZNF18's transcriptional repression activities are independent of the KAP1 co-repressor, highlighting its unique regulatory mechanisms within the KRAB-ZNF family (Itokawa2009KAP1independent).

## Structure
ZNF18, or zinc finger protein 18, is a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding. The primary structure of ZNF18 includes cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate with zinc ions to form the zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). The secondary structure of these motifs typically involves alpha helices and beta sheets, allowing the protein to interact with DNA and other proteins (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

ZNF18 contains a SCAN domain, which is a protein interaction domain that mediates homo- and heterodimerization among SCAN family members (Collins2001All). This domain is vertebrate-specific and consists of about 87 highly conserved amino acids. The SCAN domain is not directly associated with transcriptional activation or repression but may contribute to the protein's structural complexity and functional diversity (Collins2001All).

ZNF18 also includes a KRAB domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression. This domain recruits corepressors, leading to gene silencing through chromatin remodeling (Collins2001All). The presence of both SCAN and KRAB domains suggests that ZNF18 may have a complex structure involving multiple domains, contributing to its role in gene regulation (Collins2001All).

## Function
ZNF18, a member of the zinc finger protein family, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, influencing the transcriptional landscape within the nucleus of healthy human cells. By modulating the transcription of target genes, ZNF18 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development. Its activity in the nucleus is essential for maintaining proper cellular function and ensuring the correct expression of genes necessary for normal cellular and organismal outcomes. Through its role in transcriptional regulation, ZNF18 contributes to the intricate network of gene expression that underpins cellular identity and function.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF18, a member of the KRAB-ZNF family, exhibits transcriptional repression activities that are independent of the KAP1 co-repressor. This was demonstrated through experiments showing that the transcriptional repression activities of ZNF18's SCAN/KRAB domains were not significantly affected by the reduction of endogenous KAP1 expression (Itokawa2009KAP1independent). ZNF18 interacts with several proteins, including DHX9, hnRNPU, and NCL, as identified through pull-down assays. These interactions were confirmed by measuring the recovery of luciferase activities, indicating that ZNF18 can bind to these proteins (Itokawa2009KAP1independent).

The SCAN domain of ZNF18, which is capable of mediating homo- and heterodimerization, plays a crucial role in its repression activity. The full-length sequences of ZNF18, including the SCAN domain, were necessary for effective transcriptional repression, suggesting that the SCAN domain is essential for its function (Itokawa2009KAP1independent). Despite the SCAN domain's role in protein-protein interactions, it is not directly associated with transcriptional activation or repression, unlike other domains such as KRAB (Collins2001All). The specific mechanisms of dimerization and partner selection for SCAN domains remain unknown (Collins2001All).
