# GPR183

## Overview
GPR183, also known as Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2), is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 183, a member of the rhodopsin-like subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices and plays a crucial role in immune cell migration and positioning. The protein encoded by GPR183 is activated by its endogenous ligand, 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC), and primarily couples with Gαi proteins to mediate signaling pathways involved in immune responses and behavioral hypersensitivity (Braden2022Activation; BennedJensen2012Molecular). GPR183 is implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases, multiple sclerosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Misselwitz2021The; Guillemot‐Legris2021The; Zhao2021The).

## Structure
GPR183, also known as Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2), is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of the rhodopsin-like subfamily of GPCRs (Zhao2021The). The primary structure of GPR183 includes key residues such as Arg-87, Tyr-112, Tyr-116, and Tyr-260, which are crucial for binding its endogenous ligand, 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC) (BennedJensen2012Molecular). These residues interact with specific hydroxyl groups on the oxysterol, contributing to the receptor's binding affinity and selectivity (BennedJensen2012Molecular).

The tertiary structure of GPR183 involves the 3D folding of its transmembrane helices, which facilitates ligand binding and receptor activation. Notably, the movement of transmembrane helix VI is a significant conformational change during receptor activation, creating space for G protein binding (BennedJensen2012Molecular). The receptor's quaternary structure may involve dimerization, although specific details are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are common in GPCRs, potentially affecting GPR183's function and signaling, though specific modifications for GPR183 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
GPR183, also known as Epstein-Barr virus-induced receptor 2 (EBI2), is implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases due to its role in immune cell migration and positioning. Alterations in GPR183 expression or function have been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Genome-wide association studies have identified GPR183 as a risk locus for these conditions, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as rs9557195, associated with an increased risk of CD (Misselwitz2021The). In IBD, GPR183 is involved in the accumulation of lymphoid tissue in the colon during chronic inflammation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Misselwitz2021The).

GPR183 is also associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), where it is expressed in infiltrating macrophages in the central nervous system, contributing to the migration of inflammatory Th17 cells (Wang2020Neuro‐oxysterols; Zhao2021The). In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the GPR183-7α,25-diOHC axis is central to disease pathogenesis, with alterations in GPR183 expression linked to emphysema and inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue development (Guillemot‐Legris2021The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GPR183 in various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

## Interactions
GPR183, also known as EBI2, is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with several proteins and participates in various signaling pathways. Upon activation by its ligand, 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC), GPR183 couples with Gαi proteins, which are essential for its role in signaling pathways related to behavioral hypersensitivity and immune cell migration (Braden2022Activation; BennedJensen2012Molecular). This interaction is crucial for the receptor's function, as demonstrated by the use of pertussis toxin, which inactivates Gαi proteins and prevents the development of hypersensitivity (Braden2022Activation).

GPR183 also interacts with β-arrestin proteins, which are involved in receptor desensitization and internalization. While β-arrestin 2 recruitment is not necessary for 7α,25-OHC-induced hypersensitivity, it plays a role in receptor internalization (Braden2022Activation). In certain cellular contexts, such as in zebrafish and mouse embryonic endothelial cells, GPR183 can recruit β-arrestin 1 (Braden2022Activation).

The receptor's activation leads to the engagement of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, specifically p38 and ERK, which are important for central sensitization in chronic pain states (Braden2022Activation). GPR183 activation is also associated with nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways, although its direct impact on NF-κB activation remains an area of interest (Braden2022Activation).
