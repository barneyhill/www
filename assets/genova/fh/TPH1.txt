# TPH1

## Overview
Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 1, which is a member of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases family. This enzyme is pivotal in the biosynthesis of serotonin, a neurotransmitter and hormone that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including mood regulation, sleep, and appetite. TPH1 is primarily expressed in peripheral tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, adrenal glands, and pineal gland, where it catalyzes the conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, the rate-limiting step in serotonin production (Kuhn2020Tryptophan; Waløen2016Tyrosine). The protein's structure includes distinct domains for regulation, catalysis, and oligomerization, and it functions as a tetrameric enzyme with a non-heme iron at its active site (Kuhn2020Tryptophan; Waløen2016Tyrosine). TPH1's activity and interactions with various signaling pathways underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions such as renal fibrosis and glioma (Zhang2022Tryptophan; Chen2020Poricoic). Genetic variations in the TPH1 gene have been associated with psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and suicidal behavior, highlighting its clinical significance (GenisMendoza2022Association; Saetre2010The).

## Structure
The TPH1 protein is a member of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases family and is involved in the biosynthesis of serotonin. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids, with notable differences in the NH2-terminal region across species; fishes, amphibians, and reptiles have about 39 more amino acids compared to mammals and birds (Xu2019Molecular). The secondary structure of TPH1 includes 14 α-helices and six β-strands (Xu2019Molecular). 

The tertiary structure of TPH1 is characterized by a catalytic domain that is largely α-helical, similar to other aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, and includes a non-heme iron at the active site (Waløen2016Tyrosine). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the protein into a tetrameric form, which is common among aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (Kuhn2020Tryptophan).

TPH1 contains distinct domains: an N-terminal regulatory domain, a central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal oligomerization domain (Waløen2016Tyrosine). Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification, with eight phosphorylation sites identified, although there are variations between species (Xu2019Molecular). TPH1 also exhibits substrate inhibition, a feature not shared with its isoform TPH2 (Tidemand2017IsoformSpecific).

## Function
Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of serotonin, a neurotransmitter and hormone involved in various physiological functions. TPH1 catalyzes the conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, the rate-limiting step in serotonin production. This process requires substrates and cofactors, including tryptophan, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), molecular oxygen, and ferrous iron (Fe2+) (Kuhn2020Tryptophan; Waløen2016Tyrosine).

TPH1 is primarily active in peripheral tissues, such as the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract, where it contributes to gastrointestinal motility and homeostasis. It is also expressed in the adrenal glands, kidney, and pineal gland (Waløen2016Tyrosine). The serotonin produced by TPH1 is predominantly found in the intestine and is crucial for regulating platelet aggregation, enhancing vasoconstriction, and influencing vascular remodeling (Waløen2016Tyrosine).

In healthy human cells, TPH1-derived serotonin is involved in various physiological processes, including mood regulation, sleep, appetite, and bone density remodeling. It also plays a role in metabolic processes, as evidenced by studies showing that Tph1 knockout mice are protected from obesity and insulin resistance (Waløen2016Tyrosine).

## Clinical Significance
The TPH1 gene, encoding tryptophan hydroxylase 1, plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of serotonin, a neurotransmitter implicated in various psychiatric disorders. Alterations in TPH1 expression or genetic polymorphisms have been associated with several conditions. 

Studies have shown that specific polymorphisms in the TPH1 gene, such as the A218C variant, are linked to an increased risk of suicidal behavior, particularly in European populations (GenisMendoza2022Association). This polymorphism may affect serotonin levels, contributing to mood regulation and psychiatric disorders (GenisMendoza2022Association). 

The TPH1 gene has also been investigated for its association with schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that certain alleles of TPH1 may increase susceptibility to schizophrenia, although the evidence for its role in suicidal behavior among individuals with psychiatric disorders is less consistent (Saetre2010The). 

In the context of bipolar affective disorder, research has not consistently demonstrated a significant association between TPH1 polymorphisms and the disorder, although some studies have suggested potential links that require further investigation (Lai2005Polymorphism). 

Overall, TPH1 gene variations may influence psychiatric conditions through their impact on serotonin biosynthesis and regulation.

## Interactions
Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) is involved in several interactions that influence its function and regulation. TPH1 interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it plays a role in modulating the stability and transcriptional activity of β-catenin. This interaction is crucial in the context of renal fibrosis, as TPH1 facilitates the degradation of β-catenin by promoting its interaction with the cytoplasmic destruction complex components, Axin1 and GSK-3β (Chen2020Poricoic). The absence of TPH1 leads to inhibited ubiquitin-dependent degradation of β-catenin, resulting in increased stability and transcriptional activity of β-catenin (Chen2020Poricoic).

TPH1 also interacts with the serotonin/L1CAM/NF-κB signaling pathway, particularly in glioma progression. TPH1 overexpression leads to increased serotonin production, which enhances NF-κB signaling through the upregulation of L1-cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM). This interaction contributes to cellular proliferation, invasive migration, and drug resistance in glioma cells (Zhang2022Tryptophan). The modulation of these pathways by TPH1 suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions like renal fibrosis and glioma (Zhang2022Tryptophan; Chen2020Poricoic).
