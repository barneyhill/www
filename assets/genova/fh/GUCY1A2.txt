# GUCY1A2

## Overview
The GUCY1A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key enzyme in the nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway. This enzyme is a heterodimer composed of alpha and beta subunits, with the alpha-2 subunit playing a crucial role in the enzyme's function as a receptor for NO. The protein guanylate cyclase 1 soluble subunit alpha 2, encoded by GUCY1A2, is involved in catalyzing the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cGMP, a secondary messenger that regulates various physiological processes such as vasodilation, neurotransmission, and platelet aggregation (Li2021Overexpression; Wobst2018Genetic). The structural features of the protein include a heme-binding domain, a Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain, a coiled-coil signaling helix, and a cyclase domain, which are integral to its function and regulation (Montfort2017Structure). The gene's expression and regulation are critical for maintaining cardiovascular health, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including gastric cancer and ovarian hyperfunction (Li2021Overexpression; Rühle2024Heterozygous).

## Structure
The GUCY1A2 gene encodes the alpha 2 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), which is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of alpha and beta subunits. The protein structure includes several domains: a heme-binding domain, a Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain, a coiled-coil signaling helix, and a cyclase domain, all integrated into a single polypeptide chain of approximately 600-700 amino acids (Montfort2017Structure). The heme-binding domain, known as the H-NOX domain, is located in the N-terminal region of the beta subunit and is crucial for nitric oxide (NO) binding, although the alpha subunit's H-NOX domain has lost the ability to bind heme (Montfort2017Structure).

The coiled-coil domain, formed by parallel helices, plays a significant role in signal transduction and is involved in the structural rearrangement upon NO binding (Montfort2017Structure). The cyclase domain belongs to the class III cyclase family and forms the active site at the interface of two cyclase homology domains (Montfort2017Structure).

Alternative splicing of the GUCY1A2 gene results in various isoforms, including the α2i splice variant, which acts as a dominant negative mutant (Sharina2011RNA). The functional roles and biochemical properties of these splice forms require further investigation (Sharina2011RNA). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and nitrosylation.

## Function
The GUCY1A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a heterodimeric enzyme that plays a crucial role in the nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for various physiological processes, including vasodilation, neurotransmission, and platelet aggregation (Li2021Overexpression; Wobst2018Genetic). sGC functions as a primary receptor for NO, catalyzing the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cGMP. This conversion activates cGMP-dependent protein kinases, which influence vascular functions such as inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell migration and platelet aggregation (Wobst2018Genetic).

In healthy human cells, sGC mediates the biological function of nitric oxide, resulting in the formation of cGMP and activation of protein kinase G, which is crucial for vasodilation and neurotransmission (Rotimi2019Gene). The alpha and beta subunits of sGC, including the one encoded by GUCY1A2, are independently regulated in most human tissues, allowing for precise control of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway (Li2021Overexpression). This regulation is vital for maintaining vascular tone and blood pressure, highlighting the importance of GUCY1A2 in cardiovascular health (Wobst2018Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
The GUCY1A2 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression and mutations. In gastric cancer (GC), GUCY1A2 is significantly overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to noncancerous tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor overall survival and is considered an independent prognostic factor for GC patients. High levels of GUCY1A2 expression correlate with advanced histological grades and T stages, suggesting its role as an oncogene in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. The gene's expression is linked to several cancer-related signaling pathways, including ECM receptor interaction and calcium signaling, which are involved in tumor progression and drug resistance (Li2021Overexpression).

Additionally, a heterozygous gain of function variant in GUCY1A2 has been suggested to cause autonomous ovarian hyperfunction. This implies that mutations in the gene could lead to increased ovarian activity, although specific clinical details and implications are not extensively documented (Rühle2024Heterozygous). These findings highlight the potential of GUCY1A2 as a prognostic marker in gastric cancer and suggest a possible role in ovarian function, warranting further research into its therapeutic targeting.
