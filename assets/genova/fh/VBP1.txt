# VBP1

## Overview
VBP1, or von Hippel-Lindau binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a molecular chaperone protein involved in various cellular processes, including protein stability and degradation. The VBP1 protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, where it interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) to regulate the degradation of specific transcription factors and other proteins. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and development (Hemberger1999Expression; Zhang2020VBP1). Additionally, VBP1 is implicated in the degradation of proteins involved in DNA repair and viral replication, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease contexts, including cancer and viral infections (Xu2013VBP1; Mousnier2007von).

## Function
VBP1 (VHL binding protein 1) plays a crucial role in regulating protein stability and degradation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for developmental processes, adult homeostasis, and stem cell self-renewal. VBP1 modulates this pathway by interacting with TCF/LEF transcription factors, promoting their degradation through the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) pathway. This interaction affects the stability of TCF/LEFs, thereby influencing Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity, which is vital for cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Zhang2020VBP1).

VBP1 also facilitates the degradation of the hMSH4 protein, which is involved in meiotic recombinational DNA double-strand break repair. It forms a complex with VHL and p97, promoting hMSH4 polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation through proteasome and autophagy pathways. This function highlights VBP1's role in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular stress responses (Xu2013VBP1).

VBP1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to protein folding and assembly as part of its molecular chaperone activity. Its interaction with the VHL tumor suppressor protein underscores its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, crucial for protein turnover and cellular regulation (Hemberger1999Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the VBP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In colorectal cancer, VBP1 modulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by affecting the stability of TCF/LEF transcription factors. Dysregulation of this pathway is linked to cancer progression, and VBP1's role in promoting the degradation of TCF/LEFs suggests it may influence colorectal cancer development (Zhang2020VBP1).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), VBP1 is part of a hypoxia-related gene signature that correlates with poor prognosis. Elevated VBP1 expression is associated with increased tumor proliferation and reduced survival outcomes in ESCC patients. This suggests that VBP1 plays a critical role in ESCC progression, particularly under hypoxic conditions (Miao2024VBP1).

VBP1 is also involved in the degradation of HIV-1 integrase, a process crucial for the HIV-1 replication cycle. This interaction highlights VBP1's potential role in viral infections, although the precise implications for disease progression remain unclear (Mousnier2007von).

Overall, VBP1's interactions and expression levels are significant in the context of cancer and viral infections, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
VBP1 (VHL binding protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. VBP1 interacts with the human MutS family protein hMSH4, facilitating its degradation through proteasome and autophagy pathways. This interaction involves the formation of a complex with VHL and p97, where VBP1 acts as a bridge, promoting hMSH4 polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Xu2013VBP1).

VBP1 also interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) and TCF/LEF transcription factors, modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. VBP1 binds to all four TCF/LEF family members, promoting their degradation by enhancing the association between TCF/LEFs and pVHL, which leads to their proteasomal degradation (Zhang2020VBP1).

In the context of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, VBP1 binds to the VirD2 protein, playing a role in the T-DNA transfer process during tumorigenesis. This interaction suggests that VBP1 is part of a DNA transfer and replication system, contributing to the bacterium's virulence (Guo2007Agrobacterium).
