# ASIC4

## Overview
ASIC4 is a gene that encodes the protein acid-sensing ion channel subunit family member 4, which is part of the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) family. These proteins are proton-gated ion channels that play a role in detecting changes in extracellular pH. Unlike other ASIC family members, ASIC4 does not form functional ion channels independently and is considered inactive on its own. However, it can modulate the activity of other ASIC isoforms when co-expressed, suggesting a role in forming heterotrimeric complexes (Vullo2020A; Gründer2001Acidsensing). ASIC4 is expressed throughout the central nervous system, with notable expression in the pituitary gland, indicating a potential role in endocrine functions and neuronal signaling (Akopian2000A; Gründer2000A). Despite its widespread expression, the precise physiological and clinical significance of ASIC4 remains largely unexplored, with ongoing research investigating its potential involvement in modulating fear and anxiety responses (Lin2015Genetic).

## Structure
The ASIC4 protein is part of the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) family, which are proton-gated ion channels. ASIC4 is characterized by a primary structure that includes two hydrophobic transmembrane regions (TM1 and TM2), short intracellular N- and C-termini, and a large extracellular domain (ECD) (Benarroch2014Acidsensing). The ECD is crucial for the protein's function, containing an acidic pocket responsible for acid-dependent gating and inactivation (Sherwood2012Structure). 

The secondary structure of ASICs includes α-helices in the transmembrane regions, which are involved in forming the channel pore. The tertiary structure of ASICs is described as a chalice-like shape, with the ECD comprising several subregions, including the wrist, palm, finger, knuckle, thumb, and β-ball domains (Sherwood2012Structure). 

ASIC4 does not form functional channels on its own but can modulate the activity of other ASIC isoforms when co-expressed, indicating a role in the quaternary structure as part of heterotrimeric complexes (Vullo2020A). Despite its expression throughout the nervous system, the precise physiological role of ASIC4 remains unclear, and it is considered inactive by itself (Gründer2001Acidsensing).

## Function
ASIC4 is a member of the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) family, which are proton-gated ion channels involved in detecting changes in extracellular pH. Despite its structural similarity to other ASICs, ASIC4 does not function as a typical proton-gated ion channel. It is expressed throughout the central nervous system, with the strongest expression in the pituitary gland, suggesting a potential role in endocrine functions (Gründer2001Acidsensing; Gründer2000A). 

In the brain, ASIC4 is expressed in various regions, including the cerebellar cortex and cerebral cortex, indicating a possible involvement in sensory processing and neuronal signaling (Akopian2000A). However, ASIC4 is inactive by itself and may require association with other subunits or activation by different ligands to perform its function (Gründer2000A). 

The specific physiological role of ASIC4 in healthy human cells remains unclear, as it does not exhibit the typical channel activity seen in other ASICs. Its expression pattern suggests it may have a unique function distinct from other ASIC family members, potentially related to its presence in the pituitary gland and other brain regions (Akopian2000A; Gründer2000A).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the ASIC4 gene remains largely unexplored, with no direct association with specific diseases or conditions established. Although ASIC4 is expressed throughout the central nervous system and is most abundant in the pituitary gland, its function is not well understood, and it is inactive by itself (Gründer2001Acidsensing). The gene was investigated as a candidate for paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis (PDC) due to its chromosomal location near the PDC locus. However, identified polymorphisms in ASIC4 were found in both affected and unaffected individuals, suggesting they do not cause PDC (Gründer2001Acidsensing).

Research on ASIC4 knockout mice indicates that ASIC4 may play a role in modulating innate fear and anxiety, potentially by counteracting ASIC1a activity. ASIC4 knockout mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and heightened fear responses to predator odor, contrasting with ASIC1a knockout mice, which showed reduced anxiety and fear responses (Lin2015Genetic). Despite these findings, no direct link between ASIC4 mutations and specific human neurological disorders has been reported (Lin2015Genetic). The potential involvement of ASIC4 in neurological conditions remains an area for further investigation.
