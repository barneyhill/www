# AOX1

## Overview
The AOX1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde oxidase 1, a molybdoflavoenzyme that plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of aldehydes and nitrogenous bases, contributing significantly to drug metabolism and detoxification processes in humans. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver but is also found in other tissues such as the kidney, adrenal gland, and bronchi. Structurally, AOX1 is a homodimeric enzyme, with each monomer comprising three distinct domains that facilitate its catalytic activity. The enzyme's active site is characterized by a funnel-like cavity, which is crucial for substrate interaction and product release. AOX1's broad substrate specificity and its involvement in the production of reactive oxygen species highlight its importance in maintaining cellular redox balance and influencing various physiological processes (Cheshmazar2019Aldehyde; Weigert2008Small‐interference; Beedham2019Aldehyde).

## Structure
The human AOX1 protein is a homodimeric enzyme, with each monomer consisting of 1336 amino acids organized into three distinct domains. The N-terminal domain contains two iron-sulfur (2Fe/2S) redox centers, which are crucial for electron transfer during the enzyme's catalytic cycle (Cheshmazar2019Aldehyde; Terao2020Evolution). The central domain houses the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding site, while the C-terminal domain includes the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) binding site and the substrate-binding pocket (Cheshmazar2019Aldehyde; GARATTINI2003Mammalian).

The tertiary structure of AOX1 features a funnel-like active site cavity located in the C-terminal domain, with two flexible loops acting as gates to regulate substrate access and product release (Cheshmazar2019Aldehyde; Terao2020Evolution). These gates are composed of conserved residues, with Gate 1 containing bulky hydrophobic residues and Gate 2 being more ordered (Terao2020Evolution).

AOX1 functions as a homodimer, representing its quaternary structure, and is characterized by a high degree of structural similarity to other molybdo-flavoenzymes, such as xanthine oxidase (Dalvie2019Aldehyde). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which may influence the enzyme's stability and activity.

## Function
Aldehyde oxidase 1 (AOX1) is a molybdoflavoenzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics in humans. It is primarily located in the liver but is also distributed in other tissues such as the kidney, adrenal gland, prostate, testis, and bronchi (Beedham2019Aldehyde). AOX1 is involved in the oxidation of aldehydes and nitrogenous bases, contributing to drug metabolism and detoxification processes (Beedham2019Aldehyde). The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of aldehydes to carboxylic acids, reducing their reactivity and potential toxicity (Weigert2008Small‐interference).

AOX1's activity involves a concerted mechanism where the molybdenum cofactor attacks an electropositive carbon atom, leading to substrate oxidation (Beedham2019Aldehyde). It also exhibits reductase activity towards N-substituted drugs and xenobiotics, and is involved in nitro-reduction under aerobic conditions, which is significant for the metabolism of nitro-substituted drugs (Beedham2019Aldehyde). AOX1 contributes to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are important for cellular redox balance and can influence processes like adipogenesis (Weigert2008Small‐interference). The enzyme's broad substrate specificity and involvement in various metabolic pathways underscore its importance in human physiology (Garattini2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the AOX1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in drug metabolism and associated conditions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as N1135S and H1297R are linked to variations in drug clearance rates. For instance, the N1135S SNP is associated with increased clearance of azathioprine in kidney transplant patients, necessitating higher doses, while the H1297R SNP affects allopurinol dosing in gout patients (Beedham2019Aldehyde). The L438V variant significantly increases superoxide radical production, which could lead to oxidative stress and related pathologies (Foti2017A).

The AOX1 gene's role in drug metabolism is also highlighted by its impact on the clearance of the drug XK469. Although some AOX1 SNPs showed associations with drug clearance, the overall variability in XK469 clearance could not be solely attributed to AOX1 polymorphisms (Ramírez2014A). Additionally, non-functional variants of the molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (MOCOS) gene, which affects AOX1 activity, can lead to type II xanthinuria, characterized by low uric acid levels and an inability to metabolize allopurinol (Beedham2019Aldehyde). These genetic variations underscore the importance of AOX1 in personalized medicine, influencing drug efficacy and toxicity.
