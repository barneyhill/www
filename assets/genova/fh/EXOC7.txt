# EXOC7

## Overview
EXOC7 is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 7, also known as Exo70, which is a critical part of the exocyst complex. This complex is an octameric assembly involved in the tethering of vesicles to the plasma membrane, a key step in the process of exocytosis. The protein encoded by EXOC7 is characterized by its N-terminal domain, which is essential for interactions with other components of the exocyst complex and the Wave regulatory complex, facilitating cell migration and vesicle trafficking (Coulter2020Regulation; Mei2018Cryo-EM). EXOC7 plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including insulin-regulated glucose uptake and neural development, and is implicated in several clinical conditions, such as neurodevelopmental disorders and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (Wang2019Inducible; Coulter2020Regulation; Chen2021A).

## Structure
EXOC7, a component of the exocyst complex, plays a crucial role in human cerebral cortical development. The protein structure of EXOC7 includes an N-terminal domain essential for binding to EXOC8 and the Wave regulatory complex, which is vital for the assembly of the exocyst complex and cell migration (Coulter2020Regulation). Variants in EXOC7, such as a homozygous 3-base-pair deletion in exon 3, can disrupt this domain, leading to severe developmental disorders (Coulter2020Regulation).

The exocyst complex, of which EXOC7 is a part, is an octameric protein complex involved in vesicle tethering to the plasma membrane during exocytosis. The complex consists of eight subunits, including EXOC7, which are organized into two sub-complexes. These subunits share less than 10% sequence identity but have similar folds, characterized by an N-terminal long coiled-coil followed by a region of contiguous rod composed of anti-parallel short helical bundle units, known as CAT domains (Mei2018Cryo-EM). The hierarchical assembly of these subunits into the exocyst complex involves interactions through coiled-coil regions forming antiparallel 'zippers' and CAT domains stabilizing the sub-complexes (Mei2018Cryo-EM).

## Function
EXOC7, a component of the exocyst complex, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by facilitating the tethering of vesicles to the plasma membrane, which is essential for exocytosis. This protein is involved in insulin-regulated GLUT4 exocytosis in adipocytes, a process critical for glucose uptake. In this context, EXOC7 is necessary for the translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane in response to insulin, highlighting its importance in maintaining glucose homeostasis (Wang2019Inducible).

In the developing human cerebral cortex, EXOC7 is highly expressed in regions such as the ventricular zone and cortical plate, where it supports neural progenitor cell proliferation and survival. This expression pattern is consistent with its role in cortical development, where it helps maintain the balance between proliferating progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons, essential for normal brain development (Coulter2020Regulation).

EXOC7 is also involved in the regulation of protein degradation pathways, particularly in the context of protein aggregation and toxicity, as seen in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. It interacts with Prpf19, influencing the degradation of aggregated proteins and suppression of cell death (Chen2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXOC7 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Variants in EXOC7 have been linked to recessive developmental disorders characterized by brain atrophy, seizures, developmental delay, microcephaly, and infantile death. These conditions are often observed in families with consanguineous backgrounds, where specific mutations such as homozygous deletions, splice variants, and missense variants disrupt the gene's function (Coulter2020Regulation). In zebrafish models, the absence of EXOC7 results in microcephaly, highlighting its essential role in neuron survival and cortical development (Coulter2020Regulation).

EXOC7 also plays a role in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), a neurodegenerative disorder. It interacts with Prpf19, an E3 ligase, to modulate the degradation of the ATXN3-polyQ protein. EXOC7 inhibits Prpf19's activity, exacerbating the accumulation of toxic proteins and contributing to neurodegeneration (Chen2021A). Additionally, EXOC7 has been implicated in male fertility, where its deletion in mice leads to severe spermatogenesis failure (Mikami2024Deletion). These findings underscore the diverse clinical significance of EXOC7 mutations and their impact on human health.

## Interactions
EXOC7, also known as Exo70, is a component of the exocyst complex and participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with Prpf19, an E3 ligase, in the context of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of EXOC7, which inhibits Prpf19's E3 ligase activity, affecting the degradation of the ATXN3-polyQ protein (Chen2021A).

EXOC7 is also involved in the exocyst complex, which includes other subunits such as Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, and Exo84. This complex is essential for polarized exocytosis and cell migration by targeting and tethering post-Golgi secretory vesicles to specific membrane sites (Biondini2016Direct). EXOC7 interacts with the Wave Regulatory Complex (WRC), particularly with Abi1/Abi2, facilitating actin polymerization at cell protrusions (Biondini2016Direct).

In the context of insulin-regulated GLUT4 exocytosis, EXOC7 interacts with molecules like Rab10 and RalA, which are associated with GLUT4 vesicles, promoting vesicle tethering and possibly fusion (Wang2019Inducible). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of EXOC7 in cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cell motility, and protein degradation regulation.
