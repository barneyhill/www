# MAJIN

## Overview
The MAJIN gene encodes the membrane-anchored junction protein, a critical component of the meiotic telomere complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in anchoring telomeres to the nuclear envelope during meiosis, a process essential for proper chromosomal movement and pairing. Structurally, MAJIN is characterized by an N-terminal domain that forms a stable interaction with TERB2, and a C-terminal transmembrane helix that anchors it to the inner nuclear membrane (Dunce2018Structural; Wang2019The). The protein's ability to bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner further supports its function in stabilizing telomere attachment (Dunce2018Structural). Disruptions in MAJIN expression or function have been linked to reproductive disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability during meiosis (Rockenbach2023Expression; Fakhro2024Conserved).

## Structure
The MAJIN protein is a component of the TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN complex, crucial for meiotic telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope. Structurally, MAJIN features an N-terminal domain (NTD) that adopts a compact fold with a curved four-stranded β-sheet holding a central α-helix (Wang2019The). This NTD interacts with the C-terminus of TERB2, forming a stable 2:2 heterotetrameric assembly, where two TERB2 chains wrap around a core globular MAJIN dimer (Dunce2018Structural). The MAJIN protomers exhibit a β-grasp fold, characterized by a β-sheet encircling a core α-helix in a β(2)-α-β(3) configuration (Dunce2018Structural).

The C-terminal region of MAJIN includes a hydrophobic transmembrane helix, which anchors the protein to the inner nuclear membrane (Dunce2018Structural). This transmembrane domain is moderately conserved among different taxa and is predicted to have a helical structure (da2020The). The interaction between MAJIN and TERB2 is mediated by hydrophobic side-chain insertions and a salt bridge, contributing to the stability of the complex (Dunce2018Structural).

MAJIN also possesses DNA-binding activity, facilitated by basic patches on its surface, which allows it to bind strongly to double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner (Dunce2018Structural). This DNA-binding property is crucial for stabilizing the tethering of telomeres to the inner nuclear membrane (da2021investigating).

## Function
MAJIN (membrane anchored junction protein) is a crucial component of the meiotic telomere complex, which includes TERB1 and TERB2, and is involved in tethering telomeres to the nuclear envelope during meiosis. This attachment is essential for the transmission of cytoskeletal forces, enabling rapid chromosomal movements necessary for recombination-mediated homology searches and synapsis (Dunce2018Structural; Wang2019The). MAJIN contains an N-terminal globular core that interacts with the C-terminus of TERB2 and a C-terminal transmembrane helix that anchors it to the inner nuclear membrane (Dunce2018Structural).

The MAJIN-TERB2 complex forms a DNA-binding interface, which is crucial for telomere attachment. This complex binds DNA cooperatively, with MAJIN's β-grasp surface playing a significant role in this interaction (Dunce2018Structural). The MAJIN-TERB2-TERB1 complex forms a hetero-hexamer structure, essential for the stability and function of the telomere complex during meiosis (Dunce2018Structural). The interaction of MAJIN with SUN1, another nuclear envelope protein, is also important for telomere tethering, and this interaction is regulated by SPDYA and CDK2 (Wang2020Tethering). These molecular interactions are vital for maintaining genomic stability and ensuring successful meiotic division (Wang2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MAJIN gene have been linked to several reproductive disorders, particularly affecting male fertility. In men, downregulation of MAJIN is associated with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in the ejaculate due to impaired spermatogenesis (Rockenbach2023Expression; Fakhro2024Conserved). The MAJIN protein is part of a complex crucial for telomere adhesion to the nuclear envelope during meiosis, and disruptions in this complex can lead to meiotic arrest and infertility (Fakhro2024Conserved; Dunce2018Structural).

In female reproductive health, MAJIN expression is downregulated in germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes of young maternal age patients, which may impact oocyte quality and fertility (Rockenbach2023Expression). Although the specific clinical implications of MAJIN mutations are not fully detailed, the gene's role in meiotic processes suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to broader issues in chromosomal segregation and fertility (Rockenbach2023Expression; Dunce2018Structural). The structural integrity of the MAJIN-TERB2-TERB1 complex is essential for proper meiotic progression, and any disruption could potentially lead to reproductive challenges (Dunce2018Structural).

## Interactions
MAJIN, a membrane-anchored junction protein, is a key component of the meiotic telomere complex, interacting with TERB1 and TERB2 to anchor telomeres to the nuclear envelope. The MAJIN-TERB2 complex forms a stable 2:2 heterotetramer, with MAJIN's N-terminal domain interacting with the C-terminal fragment of TERB2. This interaction is characterized by hydrophobic and electrostatic forces, with TERB2 wrapping around MAJIN's surface to form an intermolecular anti-parallel β sheet (Dunce2018Structural; Wang2019The).

MAJIN also interacts with DNA, facilitated by an extensive basic patch on its surface, which allows for electrostatic interactions with the DNA's phosphodiester backbone. This interaction is strong and does not show sequence specificity, binding both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA (Dunce2018Structural).

In the broader meiotic telomere complex, MAJIN is linked to TERB1 through TERB2, forming a 2:2:2 hetero-hexamer. This complex is crucial for the attachment of meiotic telomeres to the nuclear envelope, facilitating chromosome movement and pairing during meiosis (Dunce2018Structural). MAJIN's interaction with SUN1, a component of the LINC complex, further supports its role in telomere tethering, with this interaction being modulated by CDK2 activity (Wang2020Tethering).
