# DQX1

## Overview
The DQX1 gene encodes the DEAQ-box RNA dependent ATPase 1, a protein that belongs to the RNA-dependent ATPase family, characterized by the presence of a DEAQ box motif. This motif distinguishes it from other members of the DEAD/H family, which typically contain DEAH or DEAD motifs (Ji2001DQX1). The protein plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism, including processes such as transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, RNA editing, RNA export, translation, and RNA degradation (Ji2001DQX1). It is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with notable expression in muscle and liver, suggesting its significant role in these organs (Ji2001DQX1). The DQX1 protein is also suggested to be membrane-localized due to a potential prenylation site, which may influence its involvement in cellular RNA metabolism (Ji2001DQX1). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with diseases such as lung squamous cell carcinoma and type 2 diabetes, where alterations in its methylation and expression levels have been observed (Han2019Monitoring; Li2020Integrative; Willmer2018BloodBased; Al2016Epigenetic).

## Structure
The DQX1 protein is a member of the RNA-dependent ATPase family, characterized by the presence of a unique DEAQ box motif, distinguishing it from other members of the DEAD/H family, which typically contain DEAH or DEAD motifs (Ji2001DQX1). The protein consists of 717 amino acids and includes a 630-residue core region with homology to DEAH box proteins, showing approximately 35% identity and 55% similarity to this family (Ji2001DQX1). It contains ATP binding and hydrolysis motifs I, Ia, and II, but lacks the helicase motif III (Ji2001DQX1).

The DQX1 protein is related to yeast pre-mRNA processing proteins, suggesting a role in RNA metabolism (Ji2001DQX1). It has a potential prenylation site at its C-terminus, indicating possible membrane localization (Ji2001DQX1). The protein's expression is ubiquitous, with a 3.2 kb transcript detected in muscle and liver tissues (Ji2001DQX1). Phylogenetic analysis places DQX1 on a separate branch from other DEAH family members, indicating it represents a distinct subfamily (Ji2001DQX1). The study notes the presence of in-frame stop codons in some RT-PCR products, indicating potential splice variants (Ji2001DQX1).

## Function
The DQX1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the RNA-dependent ATPase family, specifically characterized by the DEAQ box motif. This protein is involved in various RNA metabolic processes, including transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, RNA editing, RNA export, translation, and RNA degradation. These processes are crucial for maintaining RNA integrity and proper gene expression in cells (Ji2001DQX1). 

DQX1 is suggested to be membrane-localized due to a potential prenylation site, indicating its involvement in cellular RNA metabolism (Ji2001DQX1). The protein contains ATP binding and hydrolysis motifs, which are essential for its function as an ATPase, utilizing energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind RNA structures. This activity facilitates processes such as RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and RNA transport, primarily within the nucleus (Ji2001DQX1).

The gene is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression levels observed in muscle and liver tissues, suggesting a significant role in these organs (Ji2001DQX1). Despite its widespread expression, the specific functional role of DQX1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
The DQX1 gene has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its methylation and expression levels. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), hypermethylation of the DQX1 gene, particularly at the cg02034222 site, is associated with lower gene expression and poorer patient survival rates. This suggests that DQX1's methylation status could serve as a prognostic biomarker for LUSC (Han2019Monitoring; Li2020Integrative). 

In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), DQX1 has been identified as a potential biomarker. Studies have found significant associations between methylation at specific CpG sites within DQX1 and T2D, indicating that changes in its methylation may play a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Willmer2018BloodBased; Al2016Epigenetic). 

Additionally, DQX1 has been suggested as a potential oncogene in liver cancer. Mutations at CTCF binding sites affecting DQX1 may disrupt chromatin loops, potentially contributing to cancer development by altering gene regulation (Wang2024DeepCBS:). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DQX1 in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
