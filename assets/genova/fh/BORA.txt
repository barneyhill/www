# BORA

## Overview
BORA is a gene that encodes the BORA aurora kinase A activator protein, which plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. The BORA protein is categorized as an intrinsically disordered protein, characterized by its lack of a stable tertiary structure under physiological conditions, yet it contains specific motifs essential for its function (Tavernier2021Bora). It is primarily involved in the activation of Aurora kinase A (AURKA), a crucial enzyme for mitotic entry, centrosome maturation, and spindle assembly (Tavernier2021Bora). BORA facilitates AURKA activation through direct binding, which is mediated by Tpx2-like motifs and a phosphoSerine-Proline motif, stabilizing AURKA in its active conformation (Tavernier2021Bora). Additionally, BORA interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), promoting its activation and ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Seki2008Bora). The gene's expression and regulation have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where its overexpression is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Parrilla2020Aurora).

## Structure
BORA is an intrinsically disordered protein, meaning it lacks a stable tertiary structure under physiological conditions (Tavernier2021Bora). This disordered nature is supported by NMR analysis, which shows that Bora's resonance peaks cluster in a narrow range, indicative of a disordered state (Tavernier2021Bora). Despite its disordered nature, BORA contains specific functional motifs that are crucial for its role in activating Aurora A kinase (AURKA). These include two Tpx2-like motifs, motif 1 (residues 25-34) and motif 2 (residues 101-110), which are essential for binding to AURKA (Tavernier2021Bora). Additionally, BORA has a phosphorylated motif at Ser112, which is important for its function in activating AURKA (Tavernier2021Bora).

BORA is phosphorylated by Cyclin-Cdk, which enhances its affinity for AURKA and is necessary for its function in mitotic entry (Tavernier2021Bora). The phosphorylation of BORA by ERK kinase is also crucial for its activity (Tavernier2021Bora). While the context does not provide detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of BORA, it emphasizes the importance of its motifs and phosphorylation sites in regulating AURKA activity.

## Function
BORA (BORA aurora kinase A activator) is a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of mitosis in human cells. It is primarily involved in the activation of Aurora kinase A (AURKA), a key enzyme necessary for mitotic entry, centrosome maturation, and spindle assembly. BORA facilitates the activation of AURKA by binding to it through Tpx2-like motifs and a phosphoSerine-Proline motif at Serine 112, which substitutes for the Thr288 phospho-regulatory site of AURKA, stabilizing it in an active conformation (Tavernier2021Bora).

BORA also plays a significant role in the activation of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) by promoting its phosphorylation at Thr210 through AURKA. This phosphorylation is crucial for the G2/M transition in the cell cycle, ensuring proper mitotic progression (Seki2008Bora; Tavernier2021Bora). BORA's activity is regulated by its phosphorylation status, which is controlled by Cyclin-Cdk complexes, and it is active in the cytoplasm and centrosomes during mitosis (Chan2008Plk1; Hutterer2006Mitotic).

The proper function of BORA is essential for maintaining the mitotic state and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation, which is vital for healthy cell division and organismal development (Tavernier2021Bora).

## Clinical Significance
The BORA gene, known for its role in activating Aurora A kinase, has significant clinical implications in cancer, particularly ovarian cancer. Overexpression of BORA is frequently observed in ovarian cancer tissues compared to healthy ovarian tissues, and this upregulation is associated with poor overall survival and advanced clinical stages of the disease (Parrilla2020Aurora). BORA's overexpression correlates with high tumor aggressiveness, as indicated by its association with proliferation markers like Ki67 and the CIN25 score (Parrilla2020Aurora). 

In ovarian cancer, BORA promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing cell proliferation and migration, contributing to malignant transformation (Parrilla2020Aurora). Its interaction with PLK1 is crucial for cell cycle progression, and BORA silencing has been shown to impair ovarian cancer cell growth by inducing G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis (Parrilla2020Aurora). 

Beyond ovarian cancer, elevated BORA levels have been linked to worse survival outcomes in other cancers, including breast, lung, and liver tumors (Parrilla2020Aurora). The gene's location on chromosome 13, a region associated with breast cancer susceptibility, further underscores its potential role in tumorigenesis (Hutterer2006Mitotic). These findings suggest that BORA could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
BORA interacts with Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and plays a crucial role in its activation during mitosis. This interaction is both genetic and physical, as demonstrated by rescue experiments and binding assays. BORA can coprecipitate with AURKA in Drosophila tissue culture cells, and in vitro binding experiments show that AURKA binds directly to a GST-Bora fusion protein. The interaction is dependent on a conserved region of BORA, as deletions in this region disrupt binding (Hutterer2006Mitotic). BORA is also phosphorylated by AURKA, which is essential for AURKA's activation (Hutterer2006Mitotic).

BORA interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) to facilitate its activation by AURKA. This interaction is specific and independent of BORA's phosphorylation status. BORA and AURKA synergistically enhance Plk1 kinase activity, crucial for the phosphorylation of the T-loop at Thr210, which is necessary for Plk1 activation (Seki2008Bora). BORA's interaction with Plk1 is confirmed by co-precipitation and mass spectrometric analysis, indicating that BORA forms a complex with Plk1 that peaks in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (Seki2008Bora).

BORA also interacts with Pin1, a negative regulator of the G2/M transition. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and occurs during the G2/M phase, promoting the degradation of BORA through the β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (Lee2013Pin1).
