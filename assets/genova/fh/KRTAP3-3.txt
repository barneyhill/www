# KRTAP3-3

## Overview
KRTAP3-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 3-3, a member of the KAP3 family, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair. The protein is categorized as a high sulfur keratin-associated protein, characterized by its small size and high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds essential for stabilizing its structure. These bonds enable KRTAP3-3 to interact with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers. The gene is expressed primarily in the differentiated portions of the hair cortex, where it co-expresses with other KAP proteins to form a compact and durable hair structure (Rogers2006Human).

## Structure
The KRTAP3-3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the KAP3 family, which includes KRTAP3-1, KRTAP3-2, and KRTAP3-3. These proteins are among the smallest high sulfur keratin-associated proteins, with a molecular weight of approximately 10.3-10.5 kDa (Rogers2006Human). The primary structure of KRTAP3-3 is characterized by a high cysteine content, ranging from 18.4-19.4 mol %, which is essential for forming disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein's structure (Rogers2006Human). The protein also contains a significant amount of proline and serine/threonine, similar to KAP2 proteins (Rogers2006Human).

The secondary structure of KRTAP3-3 likely includes alpha helices, which are common in keratin-associated proteins. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds formed by the cysteine residues. The quaternary structure involves interactions with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the structural integrity of hair (Rogers2006Human). The KAP3 family exhibits only a weak repeat structure, distinguishing it from other KAP families with more pronounced repeat motifs (Rogers2006Human). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, although specific modifications for KRTAP3-3 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
KRTAP3-3 is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, specifically part of the high sulfur KAPs, which are integral to the structural integrity of hair. These proteins are relatively small, with a size of approximately 10.3-10.5 kDa, and share a strong sequence identity of about 71% within the KAP3 family (Rogers2006Human). KRTAP3-3, like other KAP3 proteins, has a lower cysteine content compared to KAP1 and KAP2 proteins but is rich in proline and serine/threonine, which are important for its function in hair structure (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP3-3 is primarily active in the differentiated portions of the hair cortex, where it is co-expressed with other KAP proteins. This co-expression is crucial for the formation of a hard and compact hair fiber, as KAP proteins cross-link with keratin intermediate filaments to provide mechanical strength and resilience to hair (Rogers2006Human). The specific function of KRTAP3-3 in healthy human cells is not detailed, but its classification as a keratin-associated protein implies a role in maintaining the structural integrity and texture of hair (Rogers2006Human).
