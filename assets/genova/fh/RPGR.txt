# RPGR

## Overview
The RPGR gene, or retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator, encodes a protein that plays a pivotal role in the maintenance and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. This protein is primarily involved in ciliary trafficking, a process essential for the transport of proteins to the photoreceptor outer segments, thereby ensuring photoreceptor health and function (Megaw2015RPGR:; Khanna2018More). The RPGR protein is characterized by its RCC1-like domain (RLD), which is crucial for its function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for small GTPases, facilitating processes such as rhodopsin trafficking and cilia maintenance (Khanna2018More). Mutations in the RPGR gene are a significant cause of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), a severe retinal degenerative disease, and are also associated with other retinal disorders due to their impact on ciliary function and protein trafficking (Nguyen2020RPGRAssociated; Parmeggiani2016Novel).

## Structure
The RPGR (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator) protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes several domains and isoforms. The primary structure of RPGR consists of 19 exons encoding a protein of 815 amino acids, with two major isoforms: the constitutive variant (RPGR Ex1-19) and the RPGR ORF15 splice variant (MartinezFernandez2019RPGR; Khanna2018More). The RPGR protein contains a region homologous to the regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1), known as the RCC1-like domain (RLD), which is crucial for its function in ciliary trafficking (Khanna2018More).

The secondary structure of RPGR likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of proteins with RCC1-like domains. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, facilitating interactions with other proteins such as RAB8A, CEP290, and PCM1, which are important for ciliary localization and function (Khanna2018More). The quaternary structure of RPGR involves its participation in multiprotein complexes essential for photoreceptor function (Khanna2018More).

Post-translational modifications of RPGR include prenylation, which aids in membrane association and protein trafficking, particularly in the RPGR const isoform (Khanna2018More). The RPGR ORF15 isoform is notable for its retina-specific expression and is a mutation hotspot due to its purine-rich repetitive sequence (MartinezFernandez2019RPGR; Khanna2018More).

## Function
The RPGR (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator) gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. It is primarily involved in ciliary trafficking, which is essential for maintaining photoreceptor health and function. RPGR localizes to the connecting cilia of photoreceptors, where it regulates the transport of proteins, such as opsins, to the photoreceptor outer segments (Megaw2015RPGR:; Khanna2018More). This transport is crucial for photoreceptor maintenance, as the outer segments cannot synthesize their resident proteins (Khanna2018More).

RPGR interacts with several proteins, including RPGRIP1, PDE6δ, and CEP290, forming complexes that are important for ciliary gate functions and protein trafficking (Megaw2015RPGR:). It acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for small GTPases like RAB8A, facilitating rhodopsin trafficking and cilia maintenance (Khanna2018More). The protein is also involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and focal adhesion turnover, which are essential for ciliogenesis and cellular function (Gakovic2011The). Mutations in RPGR can disrupt these processes, leading to retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (Hong2001Retinitis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RPGR gene are a major cause of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), accounting for 70-90% of cases. XLRP is characterized by early onset and rapid progression to blindness, often by the third or fourth decade of life (Nguyen2020RPGRAssociated; Tee2016RPGRassociated). The RPGR gene is also associated with other retinal disorders, including cone-rod dystrophy and cone dystrophy, due to its role in ciliary function and protein trafficking in photoreceptors (Tee2016RPGRassociated; Parmeggiani2016Novel).

The ORF15 exon of RPGR is a mutational hotspot, with mutations often resulting in truncated proteins that disrupt normal photoreceptor function (Vervoort2002Mutations; Shu2007RPGRmutation). These mutations can lead to a range of phenotypes, from severe retinal degeneration to milder forms of the disease (Vervoort2002Mutations). The clinical variability is influenced by allelic heterogeneity and genetic modifiers, which can affect the severity of the disease (Fahim2011Allelic).

RPGR mutations are also linked to other conditions, such as X-linked cone-rod dystrophy and Coats'-like exudative vasculopathy, and may present with extraocular symptoms like recurrent respiratory infections and primary ciliary dyskinesia (Pelletier2006Comprehensive).

## Interactions
The retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) protein is involved in several critical interactions that are essential for retinal function. RPGR interacts with the delta subunit of rod cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE␦), a relationship confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens, pull-down assays, and plasmon surface resonance, with a binding affinity of 90 nM. This interaction is crucial for maintaining retinal health, as mutations in RPGR that reduce its interaction with PDE␦ are linked to retinal degeneration (Linari1999The).

RPGR also interacts with RPGR-interacting protein 1 (RPGRIP1), particularly in the outer segments of rod photoreceptors. This interaction is vital for the maintenance and remodeling of photoreceptor outer segments. Mutations in RPGR associated with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa significantly reduce its interaction with RPGRIP1, which may contribute to the disease's pathogenesis (Roepman2000The).

Additionally, RPGR is involved in ciliary trafficking, interacting with proteins such as nephrocystin6 (NPHP6/CEP290) and microtubule-associated proteins like IFT88, dynein, and kinesin II. These interactions highlight RPGR's role as a scaffold protein in ciliary targeting and trafficking (Wätzlich2013The).
