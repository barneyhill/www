# HPF1

## Overview
Histone PARylation Factor 1 (HPF1) is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the DNA damage response. The HPF1 protein is a key modulator of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and PARP2 activities, influencing their role in ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification critical for DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. As a regulatory protein, HPF1 forms a composite active site with PARP1, facilitating the transfer of ADP-ribose units to serine residues on histones, thereby promoting efficient DNA repair processes (Sun2021HPF1; GibbsSeymour2016HPF1C4orf27). The interaction between HPF1 and PARP1 is essential for maintaining genomic stability and is implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage, highlighting its potential significance in cancer therapy, particularly in the context of PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Prokhorova2021Serinelinked; Langelier2021HPF1).

## Structure
Histone PARylation Factor 1 (HPF1) is a protein that interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to regulate DNA repair processes. The primary structure of HPF1 includes a sequence of amino acids that are crucial for its interaction with PARP1, particularly in the C-terminal region, where residues such as Tyr238 and Arg239 play significant roles in binding (GibbsSeymour2016HPF1C4orf27). 

The secondary structure of HPF1 is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall fold. The tertiary structure of HPF1 involves a distinct fold that facilitates its interaction with PARP1, forming a composite active site when bound to PARP1. This interaction is stabilized by key residues such as Arg239, which is important for maintaining the local conformation of HPF1 and facilitating its binding to PARP1 (Sun2021HPF1).

HPF1 does not form a quaternary structure independently but associates with PARP1 to modulate its activity. The interaction between HPF1 and PARP1 involves the catalytic domain of PARP1, and HPF1 contributes to the remodeling of the active site to enable serine ADP-ribosylation of histones (Sun2021HPF1; GibbsSeymour2016HPF1C4orf27).

## Function
Histone PARylation Factor 1 (HPF1) is a crucial regulator of the DNA damage response in human cells. It interacts with Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and PARP2, modulating their ADP-ribosylation activity, which is essential for DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability (Kurgina2021Dual; GibbsSeymour2016HPF1C4orf27). HPF1 facilitates the switch from auto-modification of PARP1 to trans-modification of histones, enhancing the initiation of ADP-ribose modifications on serine residues, which is critical for chromatin remodeling and efficient DNA repair (Rudolph2020HPF1; Langelier2021HPF1).

HPF1's interaction with PARP1 involves forming a composite active site that enables serine ADP-ribosylation of histones, a key step in the cellular response to DNA damage (Sun2021HPF1). This interaction is independent of PARP1's catalytic activity, suggesting a structural or regulatory role for HPF1 (GibbsSeymour2016HPF1C4orf27). HPF1 also limits the hyper-automodification of PARP1, preventing excessive PARylation and ensuring balanced ADP-ribosylation signaling (GibbsSeymour2016HPF1C4orf27).

In the cellular context, HPF1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in directing PARP1 activity towards histones, particularly in the presence of nucleosomes (Rudolph2020HPF1). This regulation is vital for maintaining genome integrity and facilitating effective DNA repair processes in healthy human cells (Langelier2021HPF1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the HPF1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer therapy. HPF1 is crucial for the regulation of PARP1 activity, which is involved in DNA damage repair. Mutations or changes in HPF1 expression can affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to PARP inhibitors, a class of drugs used in cancer treatment. Loss of HPF1 enhances sensitivity to PARP1/PARP2 inhibitors, such as Olaparib, Talazoparib, Veliparib, Niraparib, and Rucaparib, especially in cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deficiencies, which impair homologous recombination repair (Rose2020PARP; Prokhorova2021Serinelinked).

HPF1 deficiency leads to increased DNA double-strand break formation and cell cycle disruptions, resulting in heightened cell death when treated with PARP inhibitors. This suggests that HPF1 plays a protective role against the cytotoxic effects of these inhibitors by preventing PARP1 trapping and subsequent DNA damage (Prokhorova2021Serinelinked). Additionally, HPF1's role in modulating serine-linked ADP-ribosylation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability, and its absence can lead to hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, potentially contributing to genomic instability and related pathologies (Smith2021HPF1dependent; Rose2020PARP).

## Interactions
Histone PARylation Factor 1 (HPF1) is known for its interactions with Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, particularly PARP1 and PARP2, playing a crucial role in the DNA damage response. HPF1 interacts with the catalytic domain of PARP1, modulating its activity by redirecting ADP-ribosylation from auto-modification to histone modification, specifically targeting serine residues instead of acidic residues like glutamate and aspartate (GibbsSeymour2016HPF1C4orf27; Rudolph2020HPF1). This interaction is facilitated by HPF1 binding to a negatively charged region of PARP1, which includes several conserved acidic residues (Yun2020HPF1).

HPF1 also forms a complex with PARP2 and nucleosomes, enhancing PARP2's ability to PARylate histones. This interaction is crucial for bridging DNA ends in nucleosomes, which is important for DNA repair (Gaullier2019Bridging; Bilokapic2020Bridging). The HPF1-PARP2-nucleosome complex is stabilized by specific binding interactions, which are essential for chromatin modification and the DNA damage response (Bilokapic2020Bridging).

The interaction between HPF1 and PARP1 is relatively weak and transient, allowing for some degree of poly-ADP-ribosylation to occur, albeit at a reduced rate (Yun2020HPF1). HPF1's role in modulating PARP1 and PARP2 activities highlights its importance in maintaining genomic stability and facilitating efficient DNA repair processes (Kurgina2021Dual).
