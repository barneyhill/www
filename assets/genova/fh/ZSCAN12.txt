# ZSCAN12

## Overview
ZSCAN12 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 12 protein, which is categorized as a transcription factor. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly through its role as a transcriptional repressor. It modulates the expression of synuclein proteins, such as alpha-synuclein and beta-synuclein, by interacting with their promoter regions (Wright2013Counterregulation). ZSCAN12 is also implicated in various diseases, including schizophrenia and certain cancers, where its expression and methylation patterns are altered (Qi2020Integrating; Beinse2022Highly). The gene's involvement in these conditions underscores its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease pathogenesis.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZSCAN12 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and methylation patterns. In schizophrenia, ZSCAN12 is identified as a candidate gene, with significant associations found through genome-wide association studies and methylation functional annotation data. It is suggested to play a causal role in schizophrenia, particularly in the hippocampus, and is associated with reduced gray matter volume in certain brain regions of patients (Qi2020Integrating).

In cancer, ZSCAN12 is involved in endometrial carcinoma, where it is hypermethylated in tumor cells but not in non-cancerous tissues. This hypermethylation is consistent with patterns observed in other cancers like breast and ovarian cancer, suggesting a role in neoplastic transformation (Beinse2022Highly). In gastric carcinoma, ZSCAN12's methylation status correlates with the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and is associated with patient prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Wen2022Methylation).

ZSCAN12 is also part of a haplotype associated with hereditary hemochromatosis, where it may influence the severity of the disease through its association with CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers (Cruz2008A). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various pathological conditions through its regulatory functions.

## Interactions
ZSCAN12 is involved in various interactions that influence gene expression. It acts as a transcriptional repressor for both alpha-synuclein (α-syn) and beta-synuclein (β-syn) by decreasing the activity of their promoter fragments, suggesting its role in modulating synuclein expression (Wright2013Counterregulation). ZSCAN12 may also interact with other ZSCAN family members, such as ZSCAN21, potentially forming heterodimers that significantly alter synuclein promoter activity (Wright2013Counterregulation). This interaction suggests a complex regulatory mechanism where ZSCAN12 and ZSCAN21 together influence the balance of synuclein expression, with ZSCAN21 decreasing α-syn expression while increasing β-syn expression (Wright2013Counterregulation).

In the context of schizophrenia, ZSCAN12 has been identified as a significant gene associated with the disease, particularly in the hippocampus region, and is linked to reduced gray matter volume in certain brain regions of patients. This association is supported by its involvement in methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) and m6A RNA methylation, indicating its potential role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Qi2020Integrating). These interactions highlight ZSCAN12's involvement in both transcriptional regulation and disease-related pathways.
