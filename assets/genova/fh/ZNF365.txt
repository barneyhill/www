# ZNF365

## Overview
ZNF365 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 365, a crucial component in maintaining genomic stability. This protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein, which is involved in DNA binding and repair processes. ZNF365 plays a significant role in telomere function and the maintenance of common fragile sites, acting as a transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53. It is activated in response to telomere dysfunction and is essential for preventing chromosomal aberrations by ensuring the timely completion of replication at fragile sites. The protein's involvement in DNA repair and replication processes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing tumorigenesis (Zhang2013ZNF365).

## Function
ZNF365 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability, particularly in the context of telomere function and fragile site maintenance. It is a transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53, activated in response to telomere dysfunction, and is involved in suppressing the expression of common fragile sites, including telomeres, to prevent chromosomal aberrations (Zhang2013ZNF365). ZNF365 is essential for the timely completion of replication at fragile sites, which helps suppress cytokinesis failure and aneuploidy (Zhang2013ZNF365).

In healthy human cells, ZNF365 is active in the nucleus, where it participates in DNA repair and replication processes. It helps maintain genomic integrity by resolving stalled replication forks and preventing telomere defects such as fragility, heterogeneity, and fusion (Zhang2013ZNF365). The protein's role in telomere maintenance is highlighted by its partial colocalization with telomeres under replication stress (Zhang2013ZNF365). ZNF365's involvement in these molecular processes is vital for preventing genomic instability, which is crucial for healthy cell function and preventing tumorigenesis (Zhang2013ZNF365).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF365 gene have been associated with several diseases, particularly Crohn's disease (CD) and breast cancer. Variants in ZNF365, specifically isoform D, have been linked to an increased risk of CD. The non-synonymous SNP rs7076156 (Ala62Thr) in ZNF365 is over-represented in CD cases, suggesting it as a causative variant. This SNP is associated with reduced expression levels of ZNF365D in CD patients, particularly those homozygous for the risk allele, and may alter gene expression under the control of ZNF365 isoform D, contributing to CD pathogenesis (Haritunians2011Variants).

In breast cancer, the ZNF365 locus has been associated with risk modification, particularly in BRCA2 mutation carriers. The rs16917302 variant at the ZNF365 locus is linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer in these individuals, indicating a potential protective role (Couch2012Common). Additionally, ZNF365 variants have been implicated in other conditions such as urolithiasis, where the Ala62Thr variant is associated with uric acid nephrolithiasis, suggesting a broader clinical significance (MedinaEscobedo2014Metabolic). These findings highlight the importance of ZNF365 in disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
ZNF365, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), ZNF365 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction is mediated through proteins such as RPRM and MAP4, as identified using the GeneMANIA database. The study found a positive correlation between ZNF365 expression and phosphorylated p53 (P-p53 Ser15) expression, suggesting that ZNF365 may influence CRC progression through its interaction with p53, particularly its phosphorylated form (Wang2020Downregulation).

ZNF365 is also involved in maintaining genomic integrity by participating in the homologous recombination repair pathway. It interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to tether MRE11 to DNA end resection sites, which is crucial for DNA repair and genomic stability (Wang2020Downregulation). This interaction highlights ZNF365's role in DNA repair processes and its potential impact on genomic stability.

These interactions underscore the significance of ZNF365 in cellular processes related to DNA repair and cancer progression, particularly through its association with key proteins like p53 and PARP1, which are critical in maintaining genomic stability and regulating cell cycle processes.
