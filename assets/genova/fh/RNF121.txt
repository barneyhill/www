# RNF121

## Overview
RNF121 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 121, which is characterized as a Golgi-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, immunity, and inflammation. The RNF121 protein is composed of 327 amino acids and features a RING domain essential for its function in ubiquitination, as well as six transmembrane domains that anchor it to cellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (Cheung2024Golgilocalized; Zemirli2014The). RNF121 is implicated in oncogenic processes, particularly in neuroblastoma, where it interacts with the transcription factor MYCN, enhancing its stability and contributing to tumorigenesis (Cheung2024Golgilocalized). Additionally, RNF121 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of adeno-associated viral genomes, highlighting its diverse roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer (Madigan2019Ring).

## Structure
RNF121 is a protein composed of 327 amino acids, featuring a RING domain and six transmembrane domains. The RING domain, located at the N-terminus, is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for ubiquitination processes (Cheung2024Golgilocalized; Zemirli2014The). The RING domain's structure involves zinc ion coordination, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Zemirli2014The). 

The six transmembrane domains anchor RNF121 to cellular membranes, specifically the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, which is significant for its role in various signaling pathways, including NF-κB activation and neuroblastoma tumorigenesis (Cheung2024Golgilocalized; Zemirli2014The). The transmembrane domain, particularly Helix 5, is critical for its oncogenic function in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma (Cheung2024Golgilocalized).

RNF121 is involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation and may undergo post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively documented (Cheung2024Golgilocalized). The protein's stability and localization can be affected by mutations, such as the M158R mutation, which impacts its function and localization in neuroblastoma cells (Cheung2024Golgilocalized). Specific details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
RNF121 is a Golgi apparatus-anchored E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, a critical pathway for cell proliferation, differentiation, immunity, and inflammation (Zemirli2014The). It facilitates the proteasomal degradation of IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB, thereby promoting NF-κB activation. This process is crucial for the transcription of NF-κB target genes, such as IL-8, and for protecting cells from apoptosis in response to TNFα (Cai2022The; Zemirli2014The). RNF121 does not directly ubiquitinate IκBα, suggesting an indirect mechanism of action (Zemirli2014The).

In addition to its role in NF-κB signaling, RNF121 is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of adeno-associated viral (AAV) genomes. It is essential for preventing transcriptional arrest of AAV genomes, potentially through interactions with DNA-PKcs and VCP, which are involved in DNA damage response and transcriptional silencing (Madigan2019Ring). RNF121's E3 ligase activity is crucial for these processes, highlighting its role in maintaining normal transcriptional processes and cellular homeostasis (Madigan2019Ring).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RNF121 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer, RNF121 is a critical oncogenic cofactor for MYCN, a gene associated with poor prognosis. High RNF121 expression correlates with poor outcomes in neuroblastoma patients, particularly those with MYCN amplification (Cheung2024Golgilocalized). A specific mutation, RNF121 M158R, has been associated with a loss of tumorigenicity in neuroblastoma-prone mouse models, indicating its role in tumor progression (Cheung2024Golgilocalized).

RNF121 is also involved in other cancers. Its amplification is observed in esophageal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where high expression levels correlate with poor survival (Cheung2024Golgilocalized). In colorectal cancer, circ-RNF121, a circular RNA derived from RNF121, is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, promoting cell proliferation and survival (Jiang2021CircRNF121).

RNF121's role extends to the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is involved in tumor progression. Overexpression of RNF121 has been linked to increased NF-κB activity and poorer prognosis in certain cancers, such as oral verrucous hyperplasia (Donizy2019Selected; Zemirli2014The). These findings suggest that RNF121 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various MYC-driven cancers.

## Interactions
RNF121, a Golgi-localized ring finger protein, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It forms a protein complex with MYCN, a transcription factor, enhancing MYCN's stability and contributing to neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. This interaction is post-translational, as RNF121 knockdown decreases MYCN protein levels and half-life without affecting MYCN mRNA levels (Cheung2024Golgilocalized). RNF121 is also a transcriptional target of MYCN, creating a positive feedback loop where RNF121 stabilizes MYCN, which in turn promotes RNF121 transcription (Cheung2024Golgilocalized).

In the context of NF-κB signaling, RNF121 acts as a positive regulator. It is involved in the proteasomal degradation process of IκBα, which is crucial for NF-κB activation, although it does not directly ubiquitinate IκBα (Zemirli2014The). RNF121's role in NF-κB activation is specific and does not affect other signaling pathways like IFNβ, ISRE, NFAT, AP1, or p53 (Zemirli2014The).

RNF121 also plays a role in regulating adeno-associated viral (AAV) genome transcription. Although it does not directly interact with AAV capsids, its E3 ligase activity is essential for AAV genome expression, suggesting involvement in ubiquitination pathways (Madigan2019Ring).
