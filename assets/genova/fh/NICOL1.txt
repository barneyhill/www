# NICOL1

## Overview
NICOL1 is a gene that encodes the protein NELL2 interacting cell ontogeny regulator 1, which is a secreted micropeptide involved in various biological processes, including male reproductive signaling and renal fibrosis. In the male reproductive system, NICOL1 is co-expressed with the protein NELL2 and plays a crucial role in testis-epididymis signaling, facilitating sperm maturation through its interaction with the ROS1 receptor (Kiyozumi2024Expression). This interaction is essential for the differentiation of luminal epithelial cells, which is vital for male fertility (Kiyozumi2024Expression). Additionally, NICOL1 is implicated in renal fibrosis by stabilizing Serpine1 mRNA, thereby enhancing the production of fibrotic proteins (Yang2024The). The protein's ability to bind to nucleic acids and interact with cellular receptors underscores its multifaceted role in cellular communication and differentiation.

## Structure


## Function
The NICOL1 gene, also known as NELL2 interacting cell ontogeny regulator 1, plays a significant role in the human male reproductive tract, particularly in testis-epididymis signaling. NICOL1 is co-expressed with NELL2 in various spermatocyte subpopulations, including spermatogonia and pachytene spermatocytes, suggesting its involvement in trans-luminal signaling processes similar to those observed in rodents (Kiyozumi2024Expression). In rodents, NELL2 and NICOL are secreted in the seminiferous lumen and travel to the epididymis, where they bind to the ROS1 receptor, regulating differentiation and gene expression necessary for sperm maturation (Kiyozumi2024Expression). 

In humans, NICOL1 is expressed in almost all cell populations within the testis, indicating a potential role in cellular communication and differentiation within the male reproductive system (Kiyozumi2024Expression). The interaction between NELL2 and NICOL1 forms a ligand molecular complex, which is crucial for binding to the ROS1 receptor, thereby influencing intracellular signaling pathways that lead to the differentiation of luminal epithelial cells (Kiyozumi2024Expression). This suggests that NICOL1 is integral to the molecular processes that facilitate sperm maturation and male fertility.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
NICOL1, also known as Cf48, is a secreted micropeptide that participates in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In the context of renal fibrosis, NICOL1 is known to bind to the 3'-most 134 nucleotides of Serpine1 mRNA, stabilizing it and enhancing the production of fibrotic proteins. This interaction is crucial for its role in promoting renal fibrosis, as it increases the half-life of Serpine1 mRNA in renal fibroblasts (Yang2024The). NICOL1 is also internalized by renal fibroblasts via the transferrin receptor (TFRC), which is essential for its uptake and subsequent fibrotic effects (Yang2024The).

In the realm of male fertility, NICOL1, referred to as NICOL, interacts with the testis-secreted protein NELL2. This interaction is vital for lumicrine signaling, which is crucial for sperm maturation and male fertility. NICOL forms a complex with NELL2, and this interaction is necessary for the activation of the ERK signaling pathway, which is involved in the differentiation of the epididymal IS epithelium (Kiyozumi2023A). NICOL also binds to the ROS1 ectodomain, suggesting a multivalent interaction that modulates NELL2-ROS1-mediated signaling, which is critical for male fertility (Kiyozumi2023A).
