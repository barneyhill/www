# H2AX

## Overview
H2AX is a gene that encodes a variant of the histone H2A family, known as H2A.X, which plays a crucial role in the cellular response to DNA damage. The H2A.X protein is a histone variant that is integral to the structure of chromatin and is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Upon DNA damage, H2A.X is phosphorylated at serine 139, forming γ-H2AX, a key marker for the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to the site of damage. This phosphorylation event is mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase related protein kinases (PIKKs) such as ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs, and is essential for maintaining genomic stability (Srivastava2009Role; Paull2000A). The γ-H2AX foci serve as a platform for the assembly of repair complexes, facilitating the repair of DSBs through pathways such as homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (Scully2013Double; Paull2000A). The H2AX gene and its protein product are thus critical for the preservation of genomic integrity and have significant implications in cancer biology and other diseases associated with DNA damage.

## Structure
The H2AX protein is a variant of the canonical histone H2A, distinguished by its unique C-terminal region containing an SQ[E/D] motif, which is crucial for the DNA damage response through serine phosphorylation by PIKKs (Pinto2009Structure). The primary structure of H2AX includes four key amino acid differences from H2A: Gln6Thr, Thr16Ser, Asn38His, and Lys99Gly, which suggest potential sites for post-translational modifications (Pinto2009Structure). 

The secondary structure of H2AX consists of α-helices and loops typical of histones, with Asn38His located in a loop between α1 and α2 helices, affecting nucleosome stability and dynamics (Pinto2009Structure). The tertiary structure involves the histone fold domain, facilitating DNA interaction (Pinto2009Structure). In its quaternary structure, H2AX forms part of the nucleosome core particle, associating with other histones (Pinto2009Structure).

H2AX undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine 139 to form γH2AX, acetylation at lysine 5, and ubiquitination at lysine 119, which are essential for its role in DNA repair (Chen2013Systematic; Thambirajah2009New). These modifications contribute to chromatin remodeling and the recruitment of DNA repair factors (Chen2013Systematic).

## Function
The H2AX gene encodes a variant of the histone H2A family, playing a critical role in the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells. Upon DNA damage, H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated at serine 139, forming γ-H2AX, which marks the chromatin surrounding the break site. This phosphorylation event is crucial for recruiting various DNA repair proteins to the site of damage, including the MRN complex (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1), BRCA1, and MDC1, which are essential for both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathways (Scully2013Double; Paull2000A).

The γ-H2AX foci serve as a platform for the assembly of repair complexes, facilitating the repair of DSBs and maintaining genomic stability. The phosphorylation of H2AX is an early event in the DNA damage response, occurring within minutes of damage, and is mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase related protein kinases (PIKKs) such as ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs (Srivastava2009Role; Paull2000A). This process is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing the accumulation of DNA damage, which could lead to genomic instability and diseases such as cancer (Pinto2009Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the H2AX gene have significant clinical implications. H2AX deficiency is linked to genomic instability, which increases sensitivity to ionizing radiation and impairs DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, leading to higher levels of chromosomal aberrations and decreased survival after radiation exposure (Celeste2002Genomic). This instability is associated with an increased risk of cancer, as evidenced by the accumulation of γ-H2AX foci in various tumor cell cultures and malignant tissues, suggesting its role as a biomarker for DNA damage in cancer diagnostics (Martin2006γH2AX).

H2AX deficiency also affects neurobehavioral functions and redox homeostasis. Mice lacking H2AX exhibit neurobehavioral deficits, such as impaired motor coordination and increased oxidative stress, which are partially reversible with antioxidant treatment (Weyemi2018Histone). This deficiency impairs the NRF2-regulated antioxidant response, leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial abnormalities (Weyemi2018Histone).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), elevated levels of phosphorylated H2AX (phospho-H2AX) correlate with increased DNA double-strand breaks and disease activity, indicating its potential as a biomarker for environmental stress and disease progression in SLE (Namas2016Histone).

## Interactions
H2AX, a variant of the histone H2A family, plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response through its phosphorylated form, γ-H2AX. This phosphorylation event is crucial for the recruitment of various DNA repair proteins to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). γ-H2AX interacts with MDC1, which binds directly to γ-H2AX through its BRCT domain, facilitating the recruitment of the MRN complex (Mre11/Nbs1/Rad50) and activating the ATM signaling kinase (Scully2013Double; Stucki2005MDC1). This interaction is essential for the formation of ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) by DNA damage response factors such as 53BP1 and phosphorylated ATM (Stucki2005MDC1).

NBS1, part of the MRN complex, specifically interacts with γ-H2AX through its FHA/BRCT domain, which is critical for the recruitment of the complex to DSB sites (KOBAYASHI2004Molecular). The interaction between γ-H2AX and proteins like BRCA1, 53BP1, and MDC1 is mediated through their BRCT domains, which is vital for the formation of nuclear foci in response to DNA damage (KOBAYASHI2004Molecular).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, H2AX interacts with a variety of proteins involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell cycle control, including RAD51, RAD52, Ku70/Ku80, and PARP-1. These interactions are enhanced upon DNA damage, indicating H2AX's role in coordinating multiple cellular processes (Yang2010Proteomic).
