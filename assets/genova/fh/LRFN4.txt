# LRFN4

## Overview
LRFN4 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 4, also known as SALM3. This protein is a type I transmembrane synaptic adhesion molecule that plays a significant role in the development and function of synapses within the nervous system. Characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain, and fibronectin type III (Fn) domain, LRFN4 is involved in protein-protein interactions essential for synaptic connectivity and plasticity (Liu2019Synaptic; Lie2018SALMLrfn). The protein interacts with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and presynaptic LAR family receptor tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), facilitating synapse formation and differentiation (Lie2018SALMLrfn; Mah2010Selected). LRFN4's expression and function have implications in neurological health, including epilepsy regulation, and its altered expression is associated with various cancers, such as stomach and lung adenocarcinomas, where it may serve as a prognostic marker (Han2021A; Zhu2022Expression).

## Structure
The LRFN4 protein, also known as SALM3, is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by its domain organization, which includes leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain, and a fibronectin type III (Fn) domain in its extracellular region (Liu2019Synaptic; Lie2018SALMLrfn). These domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and are common in cell adhesion molecules. The LRR domains are crucial for dimerization, which is a feature observed in other SALM family members (Liu2019Synaptic). 

The cytoplasmic region of LRFN4 ends with a PDZ domain-binding motif, which is important for its interactions with other proteins, such as sorting nexin-27 (SNX27), and plays a role in membrane trafficking (McMillan2020Sorting). The protein's structure allows it to interact with presynaptic LAR family receptor tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), contributing to its synaptogenic activities (Lie2018SALMLrfn). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, although specific details on these modifications for LRFN4 are not provided in the context. The protein's involvement in synaptic adhesion and its interactions with other synaptic proteins suggest a complex role in synapse development and function (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

## Function
LRFN4, also known as SALM3, is a synaptic adhesion molecule involved in the development and function of synapses in the nervous system. It plays a crucial role in the formation of excitatory synapses by interacting with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), a scaffolding protein at excitatory synapses, and inducing its clustering on dendrites (Mah2010Selected). LRFN4 is primarily active in neuronal cells, where it influences synaptic connectivity and plasticity by regulating actin-rich structures essential for synapse development (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

The protein is involved in trans-synaptic interactions with presynaptic LAR family receptor tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), promoting presynaptic differentiation (Lie2018SALMLrfn). LRFN4's role in synapse development is further supported by its ability to form complexes with other synaptic proteins, enhancing the diversity and function of synaptic connections (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

In terms of organismal outcomes, LRFN4 is implicated in maintaining normal locomotor activity and has been associated with the regulation of seizure activity, suggesting its importance in neurological health and disease (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LRFN4 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurological disorders. In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), LRFN4 is part of a prognostic signature with CTHRC1, where its low expression is linked to better survival outcomes. This suggests that LRFN4 expression levels may have clinical significance in predicting patient prognosis in STAD (Han2021A). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), LRFN4 is expressed at higher levels in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this elevated expression is associated with worse prognosis, higher T-stage, and more advanced disease stages. The gene's expression is also linked to changes in immune cell infiltration, which may influence the tumor immune microenvironment and affect prognosis (Zhu2022Expression).

Beyond cancer, LRFN4, also known as SALM3, has been implicated in synaptic development and neurological conditions. Mice with a null mutation in LRFN4 exhibit reduced excitatory synapses, although inhibitory synapses remain unaffected. This gene has been associated with epilepsy regulation, where increased expression is observed in animal models of epilepsy, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

## Interactions
LRFN4, also known as SALM4, is a synaptic adhesion molecule that participates in various protein interactions crucial for synaptic development and function. It is part of the SALM family, which includes proteins characterized by leucine-rich repeats and fibronectin type III domains. LRFN4 interacts with other SALM family members, forming both homomeric and heteromeric complexes. Notably, it can interact with SALM2, SALM3, and SALM5, with the leucine-rich repeat domain being essential for its interaction with SALM2 and SALM5, while the transmembrane domain is important for its interaction with SALM3 (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

LRFN4 also interacts with presynaptic LAR family receptor tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), which are involved in synaptic organization. This interaction is significant for presynaptic differentiation and synapse development (Lie2018SALMLrfn). Additionally, LRFN4 is known to associate with 14-3-3 and NCK signaling adaptors, which regulate actin-rich lamellipodial structures through mechanisms involving the Rac1 small GTPase, suggesting a role in actin polymerization at synaptic sites (Lie2018SALMLrfn). These interactions highlight LRFN4's role in modulating synaptic architecture and its potential impact on neurological functions.
