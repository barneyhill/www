# DHRS4

## Overview
DHRS4, or dehydrogenase/reductase 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. The protein functions as an oxidoreductase, primarily involved in the metabolism of steroids, retinoids, and xenobiotics. It plays a crucial role in cellular detoxification and metabolic processes by catalyzing the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones within the endoplasmic reticulum (Ebert2016Transcriptional). The DHRS4 protein is particularly significant in retinoid metabolism, where it facilitates the reduction of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol, a key step in the synthesis of all-trans retinoic acid, which is vital for cellular differentiation and growth (Li2022Identification). The gene's expression and activity are regulated by various nuclear receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor, and it has binding sites for xenobiotic receptors, indicating its involvement in broader metabolic and signaling pathways (Ebert2016Transcriptional).

## Function
DHRS4 (dehydrogenase/reductase 4) is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which is involved in the metabolism of steroids, retinoids, and xenobiotics. It functions as an oxidoreductase, catalyzing the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. DHRS4 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in cellular detoxification and metabolic processes (Ebert2016Transcriptional).

In healthy human cells, DHRS4 is involved in retinoid metabolism, specifically in the reduction of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol in the presence of NADPH. This process is crucial for the synthesis of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a metabolite that plays a significant role in cellular differentiation and growth (Li2022Identification). The gene is also implicated in the regulation of retinoid availability, which can be influenced by glucocorticoid levels, potentially affecting cellular differentiation through increased retinoic acid synthesis (Ebert2016Transcriptional).

DHRS4 is regulated by various nuclear receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor, and has binding sites for xenobiotic receptors such as PXR, CAR, and VDR, suggesting its involvement in broader metabolic functions and signaling pathways (Ebert2016Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
The DHRS4 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), DHRS4 expression is upregulated in the spinal cords of SOD1 G93A transgenic mice, a model for ALS, suggesting it may exacerbate disease progression. This upregulation is associated with immune system interactions, including macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, and reduced synthesis of all-trans retinoic acid, which is linked to disease exacerbation (Li2022Identification). Pharmacological inhibition of DHRS4 has shown neuroprotective effects in ALS models, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2022Identification).

In cancer, DHRS4 has been identified as an oncogene in gliomas and is associated with poorer prognosis in breast cancer when underexpressed. Variants in DHRS4 have been found in a small percentage of breast cancer samples, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Passi2024Discovering). 

DHRS4 is also significantly associated with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), with a strong correlation found between DHRS4 expression and meiosis-related pathways in affected individuals (Zhang2022Whole). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of DHRS4 across different diseases.
