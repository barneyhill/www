# AGER

## Overview
The AGER gene encodes the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), a transmembrane receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. RAGE is characterized by its ability to bind multiple ligands, including advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), S100 proteins, and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which are involved in various cellular processes such as inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (Yan1994Enhanced; Hofmann1999RAGE). The receptor is predominantly expressed in the lung, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of alveolar cells, and is also implicated in neuronal development and immune responses (Hori1995The; Sessa2014The). RAGE's interactions with its ligands are significant in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (EgañaGorroño2020Receptor; Yan2008Mechanisms).

## Structure
The AGER gene encodes the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Structurally, RAGE consists of an extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like domains: one 'V'-type domain and two 'C'-type domains (C1 and C2), a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Sessa2014The; Bierhaus2005Understanding). The 'V'-type domain is primarily responsible for ligand binding, while the cytoplasmic tail is crucial for intracellular signaling (Bierhaus2005Understanding).

RAGE is known to form homophilic interactions, particularly through its V-domain, which facilitates cell adhesion and is involved in forming a stable dimeric assembly even in the absence of a ligand (Sessa2014The). The V-C1 domains of RAGE adopt a slightly bent structure, similar to other cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which is important for these interactions (Sessa2014The).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation can influence RAGE's function. Alternative splicing of the AGER gene can produce truncated isoforms that lack the transmembrane region and cytosolic tail, although their functional significance is not fully understood (Bierhaus2005Understanding). These structural features and modifications play a significant role in RAGE's involvement in various cellular processes.

## Function
The AGER gene encodes the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), a multi-ligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily. RAGE is involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. It is primarily active on the cell surface and interacts with ligands like advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), S100 proteins, and HMGB1, influencing cellular signaling pathways and contributing to homeostasis and immune responses.

RAGE is a member of the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) family and is expressed at low levels in most tissues, with high expression in the lung, particularly at the basal cell membrane of alveolar type I cells. This localization contributes to the flat morphology necessary for efficient gas exchange (Sessa2014The). RAGE enhances cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion, promoting adherence and cell spreading to extracellular matrix components (Sessa2014The). It mediates cell adhesion through homophilic and heterophilic interactions, primarily via its V-domain, and can form stable interactions even in the absence of a ligand (Sessa2014The).

RAGE also plays a role in neuronal development by interacting with amphoterin, a ligand that induces neurite outgrowth in neurons, suggesting a functional role in the nervous system (Hori1995The). This interaction is significant in neuronal differentiation and development, as RAGE and amphoterin mRNA are co-localized in the developing rat nervous system (Hori1995The).

## Clinical Significance
The AGER gene, encoding the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), is implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. Variants in the AGER gene, such as the rs2070600 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), result in a Gly82Ser amino acid change that enhances ligand binding and inflammatory responses. This variant is associated with increased prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and higher risks of acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease in certain populations (EgañaGorroño2020Receptor).

Alterations in AGER expression are linked to diabetes and its complications, including diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy. Overexpression of AGER in diabetic models accelerates nephropathy, while RAGE-null mice show reduced symptoms, indicating the gene's role in disease progression (Yan2008Mechanisms). In cardiovascular diseases, RAGE is involved in atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation, with soluble RAGE forms potentially serving as biomarkers (Ramasamy2011Receptor).

RAGE interactions with ligands like S100 proteins and HMGB1 contribute to inflammatory and prothrombotic mechanisms, influencing conditions such as myocardial infarction and obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions (EgañaGorroño2020Receptor). These interactions also play a role in Alzheimer's disease and various lung diseases, suggesting that RAGE antagonism could be a therapeutic strategy (EgañaGorroño2020Receptor).

## Interactions
The AGER gene encodes the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), which is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions. RAGE is a multiligand receptor that interacts with advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), S100 proteins, and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), among others. These interactions can activate signaling pathways related to inflammation and oxidative stress (Hofmann1999RAGE).

RAGE has been shown to bind specifically to AGEs on endothelial cells, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) and oxidative stress. This interaction is noncovalent and high-affinity, contributing to cellular perturbation and the activation of transcription factors such as NF-kB (Yan1994Enhanced). The binding of AGEs to RAGE can be inhibited by antibodies against RAGE, indicating a specific interaction (Yan1994Enhanced).

In renal tissue, RAGE can bind to double-stranded DNA and CpG oligonucleotides, particularly within the AGER promoter region. This binding is independent of known transcription factors like NF-kB or AP-1, suggesting a unique regulatory role in gene expression (Harcourt2019Nuclear). The nuclear isoform of RAGE, found in renal tissue, may originate from a cleavage product of the nt-RAGE isoform and is involved in regulating AGER transcription (Harcourt2019Nuclear).
