# ARHGEF39

## Overview
ARHGEF39 is a gene that encodes the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 39, a member of the Dbl-family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Rho GTPases, which are integral to numerous cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion, and cell cycle progression (Anijs2022ARHGEF39). As a RhoGEF, it facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho proteins, thereby activating them to transmit signals that influence cell morphology and movement (Anijs2022ARHGEF39). ARHGEF39 is notably involved in neurogenesis and brain development, with significant expression in neural progenitor cells during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Anijs2022ARHGEF39). The protein's role extends to oncogenesis, where it is implicated in the progression of various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, through pathways such as Rac1/P38 MAPK/ATF2 and AKT/ERK (Wang2020Rho; Zhou2018ARHGEF39; Gao2019Expression). Additionally, ARHGEF39 is associated with developmental language disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Anijs2022ARHGEF39).

## Function
ARHGEF39, a member of the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) family, plays a crucial role in activating Rho GTPases, particularly RHOA, which are involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion, and cell cycle progression (Anijs2022ARHGEF39). In healthy human cells, ARHGEF39 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho proteins, thereby activating them to transmit signals that influence cell morphology and movement (Anijs2022ARHGEF39).

ARHGEF39 is notably expressed in neural progenitor cells, marking these cells during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and is involved in cell division processes (Anijs2022ARHGEF39). It is co-expressed with genes involved in cell division, indicating its role in neurogenesis and the development of the brain (Anijs2022ARHGEF39). The gene's activation of RHOA is associated with cell de-adhesion, a process important for neural progenitor cell proliferation and potentially linked to developmental language disorders (Anijs2022ARHGEF39).

ARHGEF39 also contributes to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell shape, motility, and polarity, by acting as a downstream effector of receptor tyrosine kinases (Kazanietz2022Nonredundant). This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue development.

## Clinical Significance
ARHGEF39 is implicated in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In HCC, ARHGEF39 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to noncancerous tissues, with high expression levels associated with advanced disease stages and poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (Gao2019Expression). In NSCLC, ARHGEF39 promotes tumor progression by activating the Rac1-P38-ATF2 signaling pathway, leading to increased tumor proliferation and invasion. High ARHGEF39 expression correlates with larger tumor size and poorer prognosis in NSCLC patients (Zhou2018ARHGEF39). In ccRCC, ARHGEF39 expression is linked to poor prognosis, with its overexpression enhancing cell viability, migration, and invasion through the activation of the AKT/ERK signaling pathway (Wang2020Rho).

ARHGEF39 is also associated with developmental language disorder (DLD), where it affects post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs. It is co-expressed with genes involved in cell division, suggesting a role in neurodevelopment and potential disorders (Anijs2022ARHGEF39). These findings highlight ARHGEF39's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
ARHGEF39, a member of the Dbl-family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, is involved in the regulation of Rho GTPases, which are crucial for various cellular processes. In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ARHGEF39 has been shown to activate the Rac1/P38 MAPK/ATF2 signaling pathway, promoting tumor proliferation and invasion. Although a direct physical interaction between ARHGEF39 and Rac1 was not confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays, the activation of Rac1 by ARHGEF39 is suggested to be indirect (Zhou2018ARHGEF39). The study also explored potential interactions between ARHGEF39 and DVL2, a regulator of Rho GTPases, but no interaction was found (Zhou2018ARHGEF39).

In developmental language disorder, ARHGEF39 is implicated in activating the RHOA GTPase, leading to increased cell detachment in cultures. This activation was confirmed using a FRET-based Rho GTPase biosensor assay, which showed that ARHGEF39 specifically activates RHOA but not CDC42 or RAC1 (Anijs2022ARHGEF39). The study highlights ARHGEF39's role in cell de-adhesion and neural progenitor cell proliferation, suggesting its involvement in neurodevelopmental processes (Anijs2022ARHGEF39).
