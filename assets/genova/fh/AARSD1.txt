# AARSD1

## Overview
The AARSD1 gene encodes the protein alanyl-tRNA synthetase domain containing 1, which is categorized as a novel Hsp90 cochaperone. This protein plays a pivotal role in muscle differentiation by interacting with the Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex, particularly influencing the function of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) during this process. The muscle-specific isoform, Aarsd1L, is integral in remodeling the Hsp90 ensemble, replacing the cochaperone p23, and thereby modulating GR activity to protect against glucocorticoid-induced muscle wasting. Aarsd1L is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal tissues, where it competes with p23 for binding to Hsp90β, highlighting its specialized function in these tissues (Echeverría2016A).

## Function
The AARSD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in muscle differentiation by remodeling the Hsp90 molecular chaperone ensemble. This remodeling is crucial for adapting to the proteomic changes that occur as myoblasts differentiate into myotubes. The muscle-specific isoform, Aarsd1L, replaces the cochaperone p23 during this process, which is important for modulating the activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and protecting muscle cells against glucocorticoid-induced muscle wasting (Echeverría2016A).

Aarsd1L acts as a muscle-specific Hsp90 cochaperone, competing with p23 and affecting the function of Hsp90 client proteins such as GR. It inhibits the transactivation function of GR, which is a key regulator in muscle, mediating glucocorticoid-induced metabolic processes like muscle wasting. Overexpression of Aarsd1L represses GR activity, while p23 slightly stimulates it. The Hsp90-binding domain of Aarsd1L is crucial for this repression, and Aarsd1L also slows down the nuclear localization of GR, suggesting interference with GR maturation by the Hsp90 machinery (Echeverría2016A).

Aarsd1 is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal tissues, where p23 is found at low levels or is absent, indicating a specialized role in these tissues (Echeverría2016A).

## Interactions
The AARSD1 protein, specifically its splice variant Aarsd1L, interacts with the Hsp90 molecular chaperone, particularly the Hsp90β isoform. This interaction is facilitated by the CS domain of Aarsd1L, which is shared with other known Hsp90 cochaperones. The CS domain is sufficient for binding Hsp90β, as demonstrated by experiments with a mutant version of Aarsd1L that lacks the C-terminal domain. A conserved tryptophan within the CS domain is essential for this interaction (Echeverría2016A).

Aarsd1L competes with the cochaperone p23 for binding to Hsp90β, suggesting a role in remodeling the Hsp90 ensemble during muscle differentiation. This interaction is stable, as pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 does not lead to the degradation of Aarsd1L (Echeverría2016A). Aarsd1L also affects the function of Hsp90 client proteins, such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), by repressing its activity and slowing its nuclear localization. This indicates that Aarsd1L interferes with GR maturation by the Hsp90 machinery (Echeverría2016A).

The interaction of Aarsd1L with Hsp90β and its competition with p23 highlight its role as a novel Hsp90 cochaperone, particularly in the context of muscle differentiation (Echeverría2016A).
