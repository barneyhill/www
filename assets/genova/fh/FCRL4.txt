# FCRL4

## Overview
FCRL4, or Fc receptor-like 4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein known as Fc receptor-like 4 (FcRL4). This protein is predominantly expressed on a subset of memory B cells located in mucosal lymphoid tissues, such as the tonsils and Peyer's patches. FcRL4 is characterized by its role as a regulatory receptor, modulating immune responses through interactions with protein tyrosine phosphatases and immunoglobulin A (IgA). It functions by inhibiting B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and enhancing Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which influences the immune response, particularly under conditions of chronic antigen stimulation. The expression and function of FcRL4 have been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Su2023J; Sohn2011FcRL4; Jourdan2017Characterization).

## Function
Fc receptor-like 4 (FCRL4) is a protein expressed on a subset of memory B cells (MBCs) primarily located in mucosal lymphoid tissues such as tonsils and Peyer's patches in healthy individuals (Sohn2011FcRL4; Jourdan2017Characterization). FCRL4+ MBCs are characterized by their unique functional capabilities, including dampened B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and enhanced Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, particularly TLR9 (Sohn2011FcRL4). This modulation is achieved through the phosphorylation of tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of FCRL4, which recruits tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, inhibiting BCR signaling (Sohn2011FcRL4).

FCRL4+ B cells exhibit a reduced proliferation rate and are less prone to differentiate into plasma cells compared to FCRL4- cells, due to their hyporesponsive nature to stimuli that activate classical MBCs (Jourdan2017Characterization). These cells have undergone isotype switching and somatic hypermutation but do not express transcription factors associated with plasma-cell differentiation (Sohn2011FcRL4). FCRL4 acts as a molecular switch, potentially modulating immune responses by shifting B-cell responsiveness from adaptive to innate immune responses, particularly in the context of chronic antigen stimulation (Sohn2011FcRL4).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FCRL4 gene have been implicated in several autoimmune diseases and conditions. In primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), FcRL4+ B cells are found in inflamed salivary gland tissue and are associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. These cells are linked to lymphomagenesis, particularly in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B cell lymphomas, suggesting a role in the increased risk of lymphoma development in pSS patients (Verstappen2020Gene). The upregulation of genes involved in NF-κB signaling pathways in FcRL4+ B cells is associated with lymphoma development, particularly in pSS patients with specific genetic polymorphisms (Verstappen2020Gene).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), FcRL4+ B cells may play a pathogenic role by producing RANKL, contributing to disease progression (Verstappen2020Gene). The presence of FcRL4+ B cells in these autoimmune conditions highlights their potential as a treatment target. Although FCRL4 polymorphisms have been mentioned in the context of ankylosing spondylitis, specific details on their role in this condition are not provided in the context (Zhong2021Expression). Overall, the dysregulation of FCRL4 expression is linked to significant immune system disruptions, contributing to the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
Fc receptor-like 4 (FcRL4) is involved in several interactions that modulate immune responses. It interacts with the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, which are recruited to its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) upon phosphorylation. These interactions are crucial for FcRL4's role in inhibiting B cell receptor (BCR) signaling by affecting the phosphorylation of key signaling molecules such as Syk, PLC-γ2, and Vav, leading to reduced calcium responses and lower expression of activation markers like CD69 (Ehrhardt2003The; Sohn2011FcRL4).

FcRL4 also interacts with Immunoglobulin A (IgA) through its extracellular domains. It specifically binds to systemic IgA linked by the J chain, forming a complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry. This interaction is distinct from other IgA receptors and is inhibited by the presence of the secretory component in secretory IgA (SIgA) (Su2023J). The binding affinity of FcRL4 for the Fcα-J complex is high, suggesting a significant role in modulating immune responses through IgA recognition (Su2023J). These interactions highlight FcRL4's function as a regulatory receptor in immune signaling pathways.
