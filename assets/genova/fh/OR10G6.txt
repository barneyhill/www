# OR10G6

## Overview
OR10G6 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily G member 6, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a pivotal role in the olfactory system by detecting odorant molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. The OR10G6 protein is specifically expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odorants, facilitating the organism's ability to recognize and differentiate a diverse array of odors (Kennedy2012Genomewide). While primarily associated with olfactory functions, variations in the OR10G6 gene have also been linked to differences in immune responses to certain vaccines, such as the smallpox vaccine, although its primary role remains in olfactory processes (Goyache2021Functional; Kennedy2012Genomewide).

## Function
OR10G6 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The OR10G6 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants. This binding initiates a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell, contributing to the organism's ability to detect and differentiate a wide range of odors (Kennedy2012Genomewide).

In the context of immune response, OR10G6 has been associated with genetic variations that influence the immune response to vaccinations, such as the smallpox vaccine. Although the specific function of OR10G6 in healthy human cells is not detailed, its classification as an olfactory receptor suggests its primary role is related to olfactory processes rather than direct immune functions (Kennedy2012Genomewide). The gene's involvement in olfactory receptor activity is also noted in studies of other species, indicating a conserved function across different organisms (Goyache2021Functional).
