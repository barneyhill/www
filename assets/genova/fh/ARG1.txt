# ARG1

## Overview
Arginase 1 (ARG1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme arginase 1, a metalloenzyme that plays a pivotal role in the urea cycle by catalyzing the hydrolysis of L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the detoxification of ammonia in the liver, facilitating its conversion into urea for excretion (DiezFernandez2018Mutations; Yang2014Functions). Beyond its hepatic function, arginase 1 is expressed in various cell types, including endothelial cells and immune cells, where it influences nitric oxide production and immune responses, respectively (Munder2005Arginase; Zhang2001Constitutive). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a homotrimeric formation with a binuclear manganese cluster essential for its catalytic function (Di2005Crystal). Mutations in the ARG1 gene can lead to arginase deficiency, a condition marked by hyperargininemia and associated neurological symptoms (Scaglia2006Clinical). Additionally, ARG1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer, where it modulates immune responses and vascular function (Grzywa2020Myeloid; Li2020Common).

## Structure
The human arginase 1 (ARG1) protein is a metalloenzyme involved in the urea cycle, catalyzing the conversion of L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a trimeric structure, with each subunit contributing to the active site (Di2005Crystal). The secondary structure of ARG1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, adopting an α/β fold with a central parallel 8-stranded β-sheet, a common feature in metalloenzymes (DiezFernandez2018Mutations). 

The tertiary structure of ARG1 forms a homotrimer, where each subunit is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity. The quaternary structure involves three identical subunits, which together create the functional enzyme (Di2005Crystal). ARG1 contains a manganese-binding domain crucial for its catalytic function, with a binuclear manganese cluster playing a significant role in the enzyme's mechanism (Di2005Crystal). 

Post-translational modifications of ARG1 may include acetylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability. The enzyme is located in the cytoplasm and has splice variant isoforms that may affect its function (Mortier2017Arginase). These structural features are critical for understanding ARG1's role in metabolic processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Function
ARG1 (arginase 1) is a crucial enzyme in the urea cycle, primarily active in the liver, where it catalyzes the conversion of arginine into urea and ornithine. This process is essential for detoxifying ammonia, a byproduct of amino acid metabolism, by converting it into urea for excretion (DiezFernandez2018Mutations; Yang2014Functions). Beyond its hepatic role, ARG1 is expressed in various cell types, including erythrocytes, vascular endothelial cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, where it influences several physiological processes (DiezFernandez2018Mutations).

In endothelial cells, ARG1 competes with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) for the substrate L-arginine, thereby modulating nitric oxide (NO) production. This competition can affect NO-mediated vasodilation, impacting vascular function and blood pressure regulation (Zhang2001Constitutive). In neutrophils, ARG1 is localized in azurophil granules and contributes to antimicrobial defense by depleting arginine, which is necessary for the survival of certain pathogens (Munder2005Arginase).

ARG1 also plays a role in cell proliferation and tissue repair by generating ornithine, a precursor for polyamines and proline, which are vital for these processes (DiezFernandez2018Mutations). Its expression is regulated by various factors, including diet, hormones, and transcription factors, ensuring its optimal function in different physiological contexts (DiezFernandez2018Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARG1 gene can lead to arginase deficiency, a rare disorder characterized by hyperargininemia, which results in elevated arginine levels in the blood. This condition is associated with neurological dysfunction, including extreme spasticity and epilepsy, due to the accumulation of neurotoxic arginine metabolites that interfere with neurotransmission and inhibit antioxidant enzymes (Scaglia2006Clinical). Various mutations, such as missense mutations, affect the enzyme's structure and function, leading to clinical manifestations of the disease (DiezFernandez2018Mutations).

Alterations in ARG1 expression are linked to several cardiovascular conditions. In the Han Chinese population, specific ARG1 gene polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), particularly in younger individuals and females (Li2020Common). Similarly, ARG1 polymorphisms are linked to essential hypertension, with increased arginase activity correlating with higher blood pressure and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability (Shah2018ARG1Gene).

In cancer, ARG1 expression in myeloid-derived suppressor cells and other immune cells contributes to immune evasion by tumors, as it suppresses T-cell responses through L-arginine depletion, affecting T-cell proliferation and function (Grzywa2020Myeloid). This immunosuppressive role of ARG1 is significant in the tumor microenvironment, impacting cancer progression and patient prognosis (Grzywa2020Myeloid).

## Interactions
Arginase 1 (ARG1) participates in several protein-protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. ARG1 interacts directly with inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), a relationship crucial for the S-nitrosation and activation of ARG1. This interaction occurs at the oxygenase domain of NOS2, specifically between amino acids 115-499, and is necessary for ARG1's S-nitrosation in human aortic endothelial cells (Dunn2011SNitrosation).

In the context of COVID-19, ARG1 has been shown to interact with ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), and ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT), with high interaction scores, suggesting a role in enzymatic changes during the disease (Derakhshani2021Arginase).

ARG1 is also regulated by the transcription factor STAT3 in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) from cancer patients. Phosphorylated STAT3 binds to the ARG1 promoter, directly regulating its expression and activity, which is crucial for the suppressive function of MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment (VasquezDunddel2013STAT3). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of ARG1 in various physiological and pathological processes.
