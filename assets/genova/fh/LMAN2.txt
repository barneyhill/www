# LMAN2

## Overview
The LMAN2 gene encodes the protein lectin, mannose binding 2, also known as VIP36, which is a vesicular integral-membrane lectin. This protein plays a critical role in the intracellular transport and sorting of glycoproteins, functioning primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. As a cargo receptor, VIP36 is essential for maintaining protein quality control by facilitating the export of properly folded proteins from the ER and retrieving misfolded proteins from the Golgi back to the ER. It recognizes high-mannose type glycans and is involved in the transport and sorting of glycoproteins carrying these glycans, localizing to the early secretory pathway, plasma membrane, and Golgi structures. This localization suggests a role in segregating apical cargo into distinct vesicles within the trans-Golgi network (Bettencourt2019White; Gupta2012LType). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as SIRT2 and the Kv1.2 ion channel, further underscore its involvement in various cellular processes, including exosome biogenesis and ion channel modulation (Das2024Competitive; Lee2019Distinct). Alterations in LMAN2 expression and methylation have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and multiple myeloma, highlighting its clinical significance (Bettencourt2019White; Sariman2022TMED9).

## Function
The LMAN2 gene encodes a protein known as VIP36, which is a vesicular integral-membrane lectin involved in the intracellular transport and sorting of glycoproteins. This protein functions primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, where it acts as a cargo receptor. VIP36 is crucial for maintaining protein quality control by facilitating the export of properly folded proteins from the ER and retrieving misfolded proteins from the Golgi back to the ER (Bettencourt2019White; Gupta2012LType).

VIP36 recognizes high-mannose type glycans and is involved in the transport and sorting of glycoproteins carrying these glycans. It localizes to the early secretory pathway, plasma membrane, and Golgi structures, suggesting a role in segregating apical cargo into distinct vesicles within the trans-Golgi network (Gupta2012LType). The protein also interacts with an 80 kDa immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), a major protein of the Hsp70 chaperone family, indicating its role in the quality control of secretory proteins (Gupta2012LType).

LMAN2's function is essential for cellular homeostasis, as it ensures the proper folding and trafficking of glycoproteins, which are critical for various cellular processes and overall organismal health (Bettencourt2019White).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and methylation of the LMAN2 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly multiple system atrophy (MSA). In MSA, significant DNA methylation changes in LMAN2 are observed, especially in the sienna3 co-methylation module, which is negatively associated with the disease. This suggests that hypomethylation of LMAN2 may contribute to MSA pathophysiology by affecting protein quality control, potentially leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as α-synuclein, a hallmark of MSA (Bettencourt2019White).

LMAN2 is also overexpressed in multiple myeloma (MM) compared to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and control groups. This overexpression is associated with vesicular transport traffic in myeloma genesis, potentially impacting patient survival and serving as a risk factor for MM progression (Sariman2022TMED9).

While specific diseases directly resulting from LMAN2 mutations are not detailed, its altered expression and methylation patterns are linked to the pathogenesis of these conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Bettencourt2019White; Sariman2022TMED9).

## Interactions
LMAN2, also known as lectin, mannose binding 2, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the protein SIRT2, a member of the sirtuin family of protein deacetylases. This interaction is specific, as no similar interactions were observed with other sirtuin proteins or histone deacetylases (HDACs). The interaction between LMAN2 and SIRT2 is implicated in the regulation of exosome biogenesis, where SIRT2 acts as a negative regulator of exosome release. The loss of SIRT2 expression leads to increased exosomal release of LMAN2 and GPRC5B, suggesting that SIRT2 regulates cargo loading to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and MVB-to-exosome flux (Lee2019Distinct).

LMAN2 also interacts with the Kv1.2 ion channel, where it modulates the channel's gating properties. This interaction requires large depolarizing voltages to activate Kv1.2 channels, contrasting with the effects of another protein, Slc7a5, which causes a hyperpolarizing shift in channel activation. The presence of both LMAN2 and Slc7a5 results in a bi-modal voltage-dependence of Kv1.2 activation, indicating competitive modulation between these proteins (Das2024Competitive).
