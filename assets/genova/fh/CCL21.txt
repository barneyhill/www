# CCL21

## Overview
CCL21, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 21, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CC chemokine family, which is integral to the immune system's function. The protein product of CCL21 is a chemokine that plays a pivotal role in directing the migration of immune cells, such as T cells and dendritic cells, to lymphoid tissues. This process is crucial for immune surveillance and the initiation of immune responses. CCL21 achieves its function primarily through interaction with the CCR7 receptor, facilitating the homing of immune cells to lymph nodes and other secondary lymphoid organs (Eich2010The; Gunn1999Mice). The protein's structure, characterized by conserved cysteine motifs and a complex tertiary structure, is essential for its stability and function (Fernandez2002Structure). CCL21 is also involved in various pathological conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and lung adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and response to treatment (Ali2022Screening; Yin2023Tobacco).

## Structure
CCL21, a member of the CC chemokine subfamily, is characterized by its conserved cysteine motif, which plays a crucial role in its structural integrity. The primary structure of CCL21 includes a signal peptide and a mature peptide, essential for its secretion and function (Li2017Associations). The secondary structure of CCL21 typically involves an elongated N-terminus, a loop of approximately ten residues, a 3_10 helix, three β-strands, and a C-terminal α-helix. These elements are connected by loops containing cysteines, which form disulfide bonds crucial for maintaining the protein's stability and function (Fernandez2002Structure).

The tertiary structure of CCL21, like other chemokines, is stabilized by disulfide bonds that maintain its three-dimensional fold, characterized by β-strands forming a β-pleated sheet and a C-terminal α-helix (Fernandez2002Structure). Although specific details on the quaternary structure of CCL21 are not provided, chemokines generally can form oligomers, such as dimers, which may influence their biological activity and receptor interactions (Miller2017Chemokines).

CCL21 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function (Li2017Associations). The presence of splice variant isoforms can also influence the protein's function and localization.

## Function
CCL21, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 21, plays a crucial role in the immune system by facilitating the migration and homing of T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) to lymphoid tissues. It primarily functions by binding to the CCR7 receptor, which is highly expressed on mature DCs and T cells, guiding them to lymph nodes and other secondary lymphoid organs (Eich2010The; Gunn1999Mice). This interaction is essential for the initial recruitment of T cells to peripheral tissues and their subsequent migration to sites of infection or inflammation (Lo2003Differential).

CCL21 is expressed in high endothelial venules and T cell zones of lymph nodes and the spleen, where it acts as a chemotactic signal for lymphocyte migration through the endothelium (Gunn1999Mice). It also plays a significant role in modulating the adhesive properties of LFA-1 integrins on DCs, enhancing their binding to ICAM-1 and facilitating their migration to lymph nodes (Eich2010The). This process is vital for immune surveillance and response, as it ensures the proper localization and function of immune cells within the lymphatic system (Eich2010The). CCL21's expression and function are regulated by inflammatory signals, highlighting its role in immune responses (Johnson2010Inflammation-induced).

## Clinical Significance
The CCL21 gene is implicated in several diseases due to its role in immune cell trafficking and lymphoid tissue organization. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), CCL21 is upregulated in synovial tissue linings, contributing to joint inflammation and damage. This upregulation is associated with the activation of fibroblasts and macrophages, which produce proangiogenic factors, exacerbating the disease (Ali2022Screening; Manzo2005CCL21relationshipwithlymphoidneogenesisandlymphaticvascularsysteminchronicallyinflamedsynovium). 

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), tobacco exposure increases CCL21 expression, which is linked to the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). These structures are associated with improved responses to immunotherapy, suggesting that CCL21 could serve as a predictive biomarker for treatment efficacy (Yin2023Tobacco). 

CCL21 also plays a role in atherosclerosis, where its expression is observed in atherosclerotic lesions. It is involved in modulating the inflammatory environment, potentially affecting plaque stability and progression (Akhavanpoor2014CCL19). 

Mutations in the CCL21 gene, such as non-synonymous SNPs, may impact protein stability and function, contributing to autoimmune diseases like RA and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) (Ali2022Screening).

## Interactions
CCL21, a chemokine involved in immune cell trafficking, primarily interacts with the CCR7 receptor. This interaction is crucial for recruiting CCR7-expressing cells, such as dendritic cells and naïve T-cells, to lymph nodes, facilitating T-cell activation (Love2012Solution). The N-terminus of CCR7 binds to the N-loop and third β-strand of CCL21's chemokine domain, with specific residues in CCL21 involved in this binding (Love2012Solution). 

CCL21 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) through its extended C-terminal region, which is rich in basic amino acids. This interaction is necessary for its accumulation in lymphatic vessels (Moussouras2020Structural). The C-terminal peptide of CCL21, referred to as C21TP, enhances CCL21 activity by interacting with the CCR7 receptor's N-terminus, boosting dendritic cell chemotaxis and altering the signaling profile of CCL21 (Jørgensen2021The). 

The interaction of CCL21 with CCR7 is modulated by O-glycosylation in the receptor's N-terminus, which enhances the boosting effect of C21TP on CCL21-induced signaling (Jørgensen2021The). Sulfotyrosine modifications at specific tyrosine residues in the CCR7 N-terminus also enhance binding affinity to CCL21 (Phillips2017CCR7).
