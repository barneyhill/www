# LRRC37A

## Overview
The LRRC37A gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing 37A protein, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family known for their role in protein-protein interactions. This protein is characterized as a single-span transmembrane protein, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling and communication processes. The LRRC37A protein is primarily localized to cellular vesicles, including the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, where it may be cleaved and released into the extracellular space. It plays a significant role in cellular morphology, particularly in the formation of filopodia-like protrusions, which are essential for cellular migration and communication. The gene is notably expressed in the cerebellum and thymus, indicating its potential involvement in neurological and immune functions. The evolutionary expansion of the LRRC37A gene in primates underscores its importance in these biological systems (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary).

## Structure
The LRRC37A gene encodes a protein that is part of the leucine-rich repeat-containing (LRR) family, characterized by the presence of LRR motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. The LRRC37A protein is predicted to be a single-span transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of 188 kDa and consists of 1700 amino acid residues (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). It includes a signal peptide and a transmembrane helix, encoded by exons 1 and 10, respectively (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). The protein features six tandem extracellular LRR motifs, flanked by LRR N-terminal and C-terminal domains, with the motifs matching the consensus sequence LxxLxLxxNxL, except for LRR2 and LRR6, which are atypical (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary).

The LRRC37A protein is routed to the endoplasmic reticulum via its signal peptide and transmembrane domain, then to the Golgi apparatus, and finally to the plasma membrane, where it is likely cleaved and released into the extracellular space (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). Alternative splice variants of the LRRC37A gene have been identified, some lacking the transmembrane domain, suggesting direct secretion (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). The protein's structure includes several domains and motifs, such as signal peptides, LRR motifs, and transmembrane helices, as predicted by SMART and LRRscan tools (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary).

## Function
The LRRC37A gene encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. The protein contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are known for facilitating interactions between proteins, thereby influencing cellular communication and structural organization (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). In human cells, LRRC37A is localized to cellular vesicles, including the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. It is routed through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus before being delivered to the plasma membrane, where it is likely cleaved and released into the extracellular space (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary).

The protein is associated with changes in cell shape and the formation of filopodia-like protrusions, which are involved in cellular migration and communication (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). This suggests a role in cell morphology and possibly intercellular interactions. The expression of LRRC37A is more ubiquitous in humans compared to other species, with significant expression in the cerebellum and thymus, indicating its involvement in neurological and immune functions (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). The gene's evolutionary expansion in primates suggests its importance in the development and function of these systems (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC37A gene, located on chromosome 17, is implicated in several neurological conditions due to its association with the 17q21.31 locus. Alterations in the expression of LRRC37A and its paralog LRRC37A2 have been linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). Protective sub-haplotypes at this locus are associated with increased expression of LRRC37A/2, suggesting a potential protective role against PD. Conversely, reduced expression of these genes is observed in sub-haplotypes associated with increased PD risk (Bowles202217q21.31).

LRRC37A/2 is involved in cellular migration, chemotaxis, and inflammation, processes that are relevant to PD pathology. The gene's expression in astrocytes is particularly significant, as it is linked to the regulation of astroglial inflammation and the response to α-synuclein, a protein implicated in PD (Bowles202217q21.31). The interaction of LRRC37A/2 with α-synuclein and its co-localization with Lewy bodies in PD brain tissue further suggest its role in modifying disease pathology (Bowles202217q21.31).

The LRRC37 gene family has undergone significant expansion in humans, with some members associated with genomic instability and disease, including neuropsychiatric disorders (Bekpen2012Primate). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LRRC37A in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in the context of PD.

## Interactions
The LRRC37A gene encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with other proteins. Notably, LRRC37A interacts with α-synuclein, a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). This interaction is significant as LRRC37A co-localizes with α-synuclein and Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra, a brain region affected in PD. The interaction between LRRC37A and α-synuclein may influence the release, aggregation, and propagation of α-synuclein, which are critical processes in the pathology of PD (Bowles202217q21.31).

LRRC37A is also associated with cellular signaling and pro-inflammatory pathways, particularly in astrocytes, where it is expressed. The protein's presence in the plasma membrane of neurons and astrocytes suggests its involvement in cellular communication and response to external stimuli (Bowles202217q21.31; Bowles201917q21.31). The leucine-rich repeat motifs in LRRC37A are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which may contribute to its role in immune responses and cellular adhesion (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). These interactions highlight the potential regulatory and functional roles of LRRC37A in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
