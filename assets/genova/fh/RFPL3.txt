# RFPL3

## Overview
The RFPL3 gene encodes the ret finger protein-like 3, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, which is characterized by a RING finger domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a B30.2 domain. This protein is involved in protein-protein interactions and functions as a transcriptional regulator, with a significant role in cellular processes such as gene expression regulation and post-transcriptional modulation. The RFPL3 gene is located on human chromosome 22 and is part of a gene family that likely arose from intrachromosomal duplications. The protein's interaction with Importin 13 (IPO13) is crucial for its nuclear localization, which is essential for its function in transcriptional regulation. RFPL3 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including non-small cell lung cancer, where it is upregulated and contributes to tumorigenesis through the MEK signaling pathway (Lin2018EGF; Seroussi1999Duplications; Zohud2020Importin). Additionally, the antisense transcript RFPL3S, associated with the RFPL3 gene, acts as a tumor suppressor in testicular germ cell tumors (Guo2022Long).

## Structure
The RFPL3 protein is a member of the RFPL gene family located on human chromosome 22. It is characterized by a tripartite structure typical of the RING-B30 family, comprising a RING-finger domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a B30-2 domain (Seroussi1999Duplications). The RING-finger domain in RFPL3 is unique due to the presence of a cysteine residue instead of the typical histidine in the C3HC4 motif, and it lacks the B-box domain, which is common in other RING-B30 proteins (Seroussi1999Duplications). The B30-2 domain includes PRY and SPRY motifs, which are crucial for the protein's nuclear localization and interaction with Importin 13 (IPO13) (Zohud2020Importin).

The RFPL3 protein is involved in protein-protein interactions, facilitating homo- or heterodimerization, which is mediated by its domain structure (Seroussi1999Duplications). The coiled-coil domain contributes to the protein's structural integrity and interaction capabilities (Zohud2020Importin). The nuclear localization of RFPL3 is regulated by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the B30.2 domain, essential for its function as a transcriptional regulator (Zohud2020Importin). The RFPL3 gene also expresses an antisense transcript, RFPL3S, which may play a role in post-transcriptional regulation (Seroussi1999Duplications).

## Function
The RFPL3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, characterized by a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These structural features suggest that RFPL3 is involved in protein-protein interactions, potentially participating in multiprotein complexes within cells (Seroussi1999Duplications). The RFPL3 protein is implicated in the regulation of gene expression and may play a role in post-transcriptional regulation through its antisense transcript, RFPL3S. This antisense transcript is expressed in tissues such as the testis and is hypothesized to influence the expression of RFPL genes by forming RNA duplexes or interfering with splicing (Seroussi1999Duplications).

The RFPL3 gene is located on human chromosome 22 and shares a high degree of sequence similarity with other members of the RFPL gene family, such as RFPL1 and RFPL2. These genes are thought to have originated from intrachromosomal duplications and share an ancestral gene with the RING-B30 domain-containing genes from the major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6 (Seroussi1999Duplications). The specific function of RFPL3 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in neurodevelopmental processes has been suggested.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RFPL3 gene have been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RFPL3 is upregulated in NSCLC cells, where it plays a role in promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. This upregulation is mediated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) through the MEK signaling pathway, which increases the expression of RFPL3 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), contributing to tumorigenesis (Lin2018EGF). The interaction between RFPL3 and Importin 13 (IPO13) is also significant in NSCLC, as IPO13 facilitates the nuclear translocation of RFPL3, leading to increased hTERT expression and cancer cell proliferation. This interaction is associated with poor overall survival and nodal metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma patients (Zohud2020Importin).

In testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), the long non-coding RNA RFPL3S, an antisense transcript of RFPL3, acts as a tumor suppressor. Reduced expression of RFPL3S is linked to enhanced invasion and proliferation of TGCT cells, and its low levels are associated with shorter disease-free and progression-free intervals in patients (Guo2022Long).

## Interactions
RFPL3 is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its function in cellular processes. In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RFPL3 interacts with Importin 13 (IPO13), a nuclear transporter protein. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear translocation of RFPL3, allowing it to function as a transcriptional factor for the hTERT promoter, which is associated with cancer progression. The interaction between RFPL3 and IPO13 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in lung cancer cell lines (Zohud2020Importin).

RFPL3 contains specific domains, including the N-terminal zinc-finger RING domain and the C-terminal B30.2 domain, which are essential for its nuclear localization. The nuclear localization signal within RFPL3 regulates its shuttling by binding to IPO13. Experiments have shown that deletion of certain domains in RFPL3 affects its nuclear localization, highlighting the importance of the B30.2 domain in its interaction with IPO13 (Zohud2020Importin).

Additionally, RFPL3 is part of a larger protein family characterized by zinc finger motifs and a tripartite structure, suggesting its potential involvement in protein-protein interactions, possibly forming homo- or heterodimers (Seroussi1999Duplications).
