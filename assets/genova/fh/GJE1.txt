# GJE1

## Overview
GJE1 is a gene that encodes the gap junction protein epsilon 1, which is a member of the connexin family of proteins. These proteins are integral membrane proteins that form gap junctions, which are specialized intercellular connections that facilitate direct communication between adjacent cells. Gap junctions are crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and enabling the transfer of ions, metabolites, and other small molecules between cells. The gap junction protein epsilon 1 plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including cardiac and neural function, by contributing to the electrical and metabolic coupling of cells (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the structure and function of GJE1 and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its role in health and disease.
