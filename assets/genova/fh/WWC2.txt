# WWC2

## Overview
WWC2 is a gene that encodes the protein WW and C2 domain containing 2, which is a member of the WWC protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of WW domains, a C2-like domain, and other motifs that facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and membrane association. Functionally, WWC2 is involved in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, a critical pathway for controlling cell proliferation and organ growth. By interacting with LATS kinases, WWC2 influences the phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of the Yes-associated protein (YAP), thereby modulating transcriptional programs that affect cell proliferation. The protein is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the testis, where it plays a role in spermatogenesis. Additionally, WWC2 is implicated in synaptic regulation and has been associated with several clinical conditions, including male infertility, neurological disorders, and cancer (Dunham2024Modulation; Höffken2023WWC2; Wennmann2014Evolutionary).

## Structure
The WWC2 protein is part of the WWC family, which includes WWC1 and WWC3, and is characterized by a conserved structure with several protein interaction domains. The primary structure of WWC2 includes two amino-terminal WW domains, a C2-like domain, coiled-coil domains, an atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-binding motif, and a PDZ-binding motif (Höffken2021WWC; Wennmann2014Evolutionary). The WW domains are known for their role in binding to proline-rich motifs in interaction partners, while the C2-like domain binds to phospholipids, aiding in the localization of the protein to specific membrane structures and cellular vesicles (Höffken2021WWC).

The secondary structure of WWC2 includes regions with α-helix and β-sheet structures, as predicted by AlphaFold (Höffken2023WWC2). The tertiary structure is not fully determined, but the presence of coiled-coil domains suggests a role in protein-protein interactions (Höffken2023WWC2). WWC2 can form homo- and heterodimeric complexes, indicating a quaternary structure that allows interaction with other proteins in the WWC family (Wennmann2014Evolutionary).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at conserved sites, regulate WWC2's activity in cell migration and proliferation (Höffken2021WWC). The protein's expression is particularly high in the testis, where it plays a role in spermatogenesis (Höffken2023WWC2).

## Function
The WWC2 gene encodes a protein that is a part of the WWC protein family, which plays a significant role in regulating the Hippo signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for controlling cell proliferation and organ growth. WWC2, along with other WWC proteins, negatively regulates Hippo signaling by activating LATS kinases, which phosphorylate the Yes-associated protein (YAP). This phosphorylation prevents YAP from entering the nucleus, thereby inhibiting its ability to activate transcription programs that promote cell proliferation and organ growth (Zhang2017WWC2; Wennmann2014Evolutionary).

In healthy human cells, WWC2 is expressed in various organs, with particularly high expression in the testis, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis and male fertility. It is predominantly expressed in early spermatocytes, indicating its involvement in germ cell differentiation (Höffken2023WWC2). The protein contains WW domains for protein-protein interactions and a C2 domain for membrane association, which are essential for its function in cellular signaling pathways (Zhang2017WWC2). WWC2's activity in the Hippo pathway is crucial for maintaining normal cell size and preventing tumorigenesis by regulating cell proliferation and tissue growth (Zhang2017WWC2; Wennmann2014Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WWC2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of male infertility, WWC2 is highly expressed in early spermatocytes and plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis. Variants in the WWC2 gene, particularly rare heterozygous missense and splice site variants, have been associated with severe spermatogenic failure and conditions such as azoospermia and cryptozoospermia. These variants are significantly enriched in infertile patients compared to the general population, suggesting a potential link between WWC2 mutations and male infertility (Höffken2023WWC2).

In the central nervous system, WWC2 is associated with various pathologies. Increased expression of WWC2 is linked to schizophrenia risk, while decreased expression is observed in Huntington's disease. Additionally, copy number variations in WWC2 have been documented in autism spectrum disorder cases. WWC2 acts as a negative regulator of membrane GABAAR content, and its loss results in increased surface GABAAR expression, which is implicated in disorders such as childhood encephalopathic epilepsy and febrile seizures (Dunham2024Modulation).

In cancer, low levels of WWC2 are associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic, lung, and hepatocellular carcinoma, indicating its potential role in tumor progression (Saul2022Identification).

## Interactions
WWC2, a member of the WWC protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is known to interact with components of the Hippo signaling pathway, such as LATS1/2 kinases, which phosphorylate YAP, preventing its nuclear import and reducing its transcriptional activity (Zhang2017WWC2; Wennmann2014Evolutionary). This interaction is crucial for regulating cell proliferation and tissue growth.

WWC2 also forms heterodimeric complexes with other WWC family members, such as KIBRA/WWC1 and WWC3, as demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid systems and coimmunoprecipitation studies (Wennmann2014Evolutionary). These interactions suggest a shared role in modulating the Hippo pathway.

In the context of synaptic regulation, WWC2 interacts with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin, influencing GABAA receptor trafficking at inhibitory synapses (Dunham2024Modulation). It is involved in the recycling of GABAARs by interacting with proteins HAP1 and GRIP1, which are enriched in the membrane fraction of the hippocampus in WWC2 knockout models (Dunham2024Modulation). These interactions highlight WWC2's role in synaptic function and neuronal regulation.
