# TNS2

## Overview
TNS2 is a gene that encodes the protein tensin 2, a focal adhesion protein involved in cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. Tensin 2 is characterized by its multiple functional domains, including a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain, Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, and actin-binding domains, which facilitate its role as an integrin adaptor protein (Sasaki2020Deletion; Huang2023Tensins). The protein is predominantly expressed in the kidney, particularly in podocytes, where it is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier (Sasaki2022Tensin). Mutations in the TNS2 gene have been linked to kidney disorders such as nephrotic syndrome and chronic kidney disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Ashraf2018Mutations; Sasaki2022Tensin).

## Structure
Tensin 2 (TNS2) is a focal adhesion protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in cell adhesion and signaling. The protein includes a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain, a C2 domain, and tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains at the C-terminus (Sasaki2020Deletion; Huang2023Tensins). The SH2-PTB domains are crucial for binding phosphorylated tyrosines and the cytoplasmic tails of integrins, facilitating interactions with other focal adhesion proteins (Sasaki2022Tensin; MARUSUGI2016Functional).

TNS2 also contains actin-binding domains (ABDs) and focal-adhesion-binding (FAB) domains, with two independent FAB regions: FAB-N at the N-terminal region and FAB-C overlapping with the SH2 and PTB domains at the C-terminus (Huang2023Tensins). The protein kinase C conserved region 1 domain (C1 domain) is present, although its function remains uncertain (Huang2023Tensins).

The PTPase domain of TNS2 is similar to that of PTEN, a known tumor suppressor, and is involved in dephosphorylating phosphotyrosyl proteins, although TNS2 uniquely exhibits PTEN-like PTPase activity among tensins (Sasaki2020Deletion). TNS2's structure allows it to serve as a scaffold, anchoring focal adhesion proteins to β integrin and facilitating protein interactions (Sasaki2022Tensin).

## Function
Tensin 2 (TNS2) is a focal adhesion protein that plays a critical role in anchoring focal adhesion proteins to β integrin, acting as an integrin adaptor protein, and serving as a scaffold to facilitate interactions among these proteins. In healthy human cells, TNS2 is involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and gene expression. It is predominantly expressed in the glomerulus of the kidney, specifically in podocytes, where it localizes to the basolateral surface. TNS2's function is crucial in maintaining the structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and the proper functioning of podocytes (Sasaki2022Tensin).

TNS2 is essential for maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier, as it influences podocyte adhesion via integrin α3β1, a laminin receptor. It binds to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β1, and its loss results in defects in podocyte-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) adhesion (UchioYamada2020Tensin2). TNS2 is also involved in the transition of laminin isoforms during GBM maturation, which is important for podocyte differentiation and recruitment of endothelial and mesangial cells (UchioYamada2020Tensin2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNS2 gene are associated with various kidney disorders, particularly nephrotic syndrome (NS) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In humans, TNS2 mutations can lead to different severities of glomerular injury, including minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (Sasaki2022Tensin). A specific homozygous missense mutation, p.Arg292Gln, has been identified as a novel cause of NS, termed NPHS19, which is partially treatment-sensitive (Ashraf2018Mutations). These mutations affect the RhoA regulatory network, crucial for podocyte function, and are linked to a partially treatment-responsive form of NS (Ashraf2018Mutations).

In Tns2-null mutant mice, significant glomerular basement membrane lesions develop, leading to proteinuria and CKD, with progression to end-stage renal disease (Sasaki2022Tensin). The loss of TNS2 function impairs integrin signaling in podocytes, contributing to glomerular lesions (Sasaki2022Tensin). Overexpression of TNS2 in diabetic nephropathy models activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway, leading to podocyte dysfunction (Sasaki2022Tensin). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TNS2 mutations in nephrotic syndromes and CKD, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for managing these conditions.

## Interactions
Tensin 2 (TNS2) is a focal adhesion-localized protein that plays a significant role in cellular adhesion, migration, and signal transduction through its interactions with various proteins. TNS2 interacts with integrins, particularly integrin β1, serving as an adaptor protein that facilitates the anchoring of focal adhesion proteins to β integrin. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of podocytes in the kidney (UchioYamada2020Tensin2; Sasaki2022Tensin).

TNS2 contains C-terminal tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which enable it to bind to membrane lipids like phosphatidylinositol-triphosphate (PIP3) and other focal adhesion proteins such as p130Cas, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), integrin-linked kinase (ILK), and deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) (Sasaki2022Tensin). These interactions are essential for the regulation of integrin-mediated cellular processes, including adhesion, migration, and proliferation.

In the context of cancer, TNS2 negatively regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by suppressing the nuclear translocation of β-catenin through the reduction of ILK activity. This interaction is significant in colon cancer cell lines, where TNS2 modulates the Wnt pathway, affecting β-catenin's subcellular localization and activity (HIURA2020Suppression).
