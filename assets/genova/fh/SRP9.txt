# SRP9

## Overview
The SRP9 gene encodes the signal recognition particle 9 (SRP9) protein, a critical component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex involved in the targeting and translocation of nascent proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells. The SRP9 protein, categorized as an RNA-binding protein, forms a heterodimer with SRP14, which is essential for binding to the Alu domain of SRP RNA and facilitating the elongation arrest function during protein synthesis (Egea2005Targeting; Strub1990Assembly). Beyond its role in protein targeting, SRP9 is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of noncoding RNAs and has been associated with various cellular processes, including tumor cell viability and migration (Gussakovsky2023Nuclear). Alterations in SRP9 expression have been linked to cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Sato2024Significance; Rho2008Proteomic).

## Structure
The SRP9 protein is a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and forms a heterodimer with SRP14, which is essential for binding to the Alu domain of SRP RNA. This heterodimerization is crucial for the elongation arrest function of the SRP during protein synthesis (Egea2005Targeting; Strub1990Assembly). The SRP9 protein is highly conserved across species, sharing 95 to 99% sequence identity between canine and mouse proteins (Strub1990Assembly).

The SRP9 protein consists of 86 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 10,017 Da (Strub1990Assembly). It is highly charged, containing 19% basic and 15% acidic amino acids, and shares some sequence identity with SRP19, particularly in a region predicted to be a turn between two alpha-helices or beta-sheets, followed by alpha-helices (Strub1990Assembly). The SRP9/14 heterodimer does not contain the RNP-CS motif typical of many RNA-binding proteins, indicating it represents a different class of RNA-binding proteins (Strub1990Assembly).

The SRP9 protein's role is primarily structural, contributing to the overall architecture and function of the SRP complex, although specific details about its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the context (Egea2005Targeting).

## Function
The SRP9 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP), which plays a critical role in the targeting and translocation of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. SRP9, in conjunction with SRP14, forms a heterodimer that is essential for the function of the SRP complex. This heterodimer binds to the Alu domain of 7SL RNA, which is crucial for arresting translational elongation by directly interacting with the ribosome. This process is vital for the regulation of approximately 30% of the human proteome, particularly secretory and membrane proteins, by targeting them to the ER (Gussakovsky2023Nuclear; Strub1991Binding).

In the nucleus, the SRP9/SRP14 heterodimer is involved in the transcriptional regulation of 7SL and BC200 RNA. It associates with chromatin near these genetic loci, influencing RNA polymerase III activity and maintaining RNA steady-state levels. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional efficiency and stability of these RNAs, which are important for cellular functions such as tumor cell viability and migration (Gussakovsky2023Nuclear).

Additionally, SRP9 is involved in the regulation of translation initiation through its interaction with Alu RNA, which modulates the pool of active ribosomal subunits, thereby influencing protein synthesis (Ivanova2015Alu).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRP9 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly pancreatic and colorectal cancers. In pancreatic cancer, high SRP9 expression is associated with worse overall survival, suggesting its potential role in tumor progression (Sato2024Significance). The nuclear translocation of SRP9 in pancreatic cancer cells has been linked to better recurrence-free survival, indicating that its localization may influence cancer outcomes (Sato2024Significance). The study also suggests that SRP9 nuclear translocation might downregulate pathways involved in cancer progression and protein translation, potentially affecting cancer cell behavior (Sato2024Significance).

In colorectal cancer, SRP9 is up-regulated and has been identified as a potential biomarker due to its increased expression in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues (Rho2008Proteomic). The use of heparin affinity fractionation enrichment has highlighted SRP9 as a low-abundance protein that could play a significant role in colorectal cancer biology (Rho2008Proteomic). These findings suggest that SRP9 may contribute to the molecular changes associated with cancer, although specific clinical conditions directly linked to SRP9 mutations are not well-documented.

## Interactions
SRP9 forms a stable heterodimer with SRP14, which is a key component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex. This heterodimer interacts with the 7SL RNA, specifically recognizing the RNA UGUNR motif in the Alu domain, which is crucial for the elongation arrest function of the SRP (Faoro2021Noncanonical). The SRP9/14 heterodimer can also bind to various small cytoplasmic noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) related to the Alu motif of SRP RNA, forming Alu ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) that inhibit polysome formation by targeting the 40S ribosomal subunits (Faoro2021Noncanonical).

SRP9/14 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of 7SL and BC200 RNA. It binds to the first ~50 nucleotides of Alu and Alu-like RNA, which is essential for the transcription and stability of these RNAs. Knockdown of SRP9/14 results in a significant reduction in the steady-state levels of 7SL and BC200 RNA, indicating its role in stabilizing nascent transcripts (Gussakovsky2023Nuclear). SRP9 also interacts with the HIV-1 Rev protein, suggesting a potential role in virus-host interactions (Faoro2021Noncanonical). The SRP9/14 heterodimer is heavily localized in the nucleus and is found in close proximity to chromatin, independent of transcriptional activity, indicating a stable chromatin association (Gussakovsky2023Nuclear).
