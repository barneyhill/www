# SUPT20HL2

## Overview
SUPT20HL2 is a gene that encodes a protein known as SUPT20H like 2, which is thought to function as a putative transcription factor. This gene has been implicated in the regulation of transcriptional processes, although its precise biological role remains to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by SUPT20HL2 is involved in cellular processes that may influence neurodevelopmental pathways, as suggested by its potential association with childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), a rare form of autism spectrum disorder. Despite its potential significance, SUPT20HL2 has also been suggested to be a pseudogene, which complicates the understanding of its functional and clinical relevance (Gupta2017Neurogenetic). Further research is necessary to determine the exact role of SUPT20HL2 in human health and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SUPT20HL2 gene, which encodes a putative transcription factor, has been explored in the context of childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), a rare form of autism spectrum disorder. In a study analyzing the neurogenetic aspects of CDD, two hemizygous missense variants in the SUPT20HL2 gene were identified in CDD probands. Although these variants were rare and not previously associated with disease, the study considered them potentially pathogenic due to factors such as brain expression, conservation scores, and intolerance to variation (Gupta2017Neurogenetic). The study did not find any clearly deleterious variants in the CDD probands, but the presence of these variants in SUPT20HL2 suggests a possible link to the disorder. The gene's role in transcription regulation implies that mutations or alterations in its expression could impact cellular processes, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of CDD. However, the study also noted that SUPT20HL2 might be a pseudogene according to the UniProtKB database, which adds complexity to understanding its clinical significance (Gupta2017Neurogenetic). Further research is needed to clarify the role of SUPT20HL2 in CDD and other neurological disorders.
