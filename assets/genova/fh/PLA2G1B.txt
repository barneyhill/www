# PLA2G1B

## Overview
The PLA2G1B gene encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group IB, a secreted enzyme primarily involved in lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a phospholipase and is predominantly synthesized in the pancreas, where it plays a critical role in the digestion and absorption of dietary fats by hydrolyzing phospholipids to release free fatty acids and lysophospholipids (Hui2019Group). The PLA2G1B gene is located on chromosome 12 in humans and exhibits high sequence homology across mammalian species, indicating its evolutionary conservation (Hui2019Group). The enzyme is activated in the intestinal lumen through proteolytic cleavage and requires calcium for its activity (Murakami2016The). Beyond its digestive functions, PLA2G1B is implicated in immune modulation and metabolic disorders, with its activity influencing conditions such as obesity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis (Hollie2014Group; Murakami2015A). The gene's interactions with microbial proteins further suggest a role in immune response regulation (Pothlichet2022Microbial).

## Structure
The PLA2G1B protein is a secreted enzyme primarily synthesized in the pancreas and also expressed in the lung. It is encoded by a single-copy gene located on chromosome 12 in humans. The gene spans four exons interspersed by three introns, with high sequence homology across mammalian species (Hui2019Group).

The catalytic mechanism of PLA2G1B involves an active site network containing one histidine, two tyrosine residues, and one aspartic acid. This differs from other lipolytic enzymes that typically use a catalytic triad of serine-histidine-aspartic acid. The codon for the active site histidine is located in exon 3, similar to the codons for the two tyrosine residues, while the codon for the active site aspartic acid is in exon 4. Enzymatic activity also requires calcium binding to a Y-X-G-X-G motif encoded by the second exon (Hui2019Group).

PLA2G1B features a calcium-binding loop and a catalytic site, and it often functions as a monomer or forms complexes with other proteins. Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, which are typical for secreted enzymes (Hui2019Group). The enzyme is activated by trypsin cleavage in the intestinal lumen (Murakami2016The).

## Function
PLA2G1B encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group IB, which is primarily synthesized in the pancreas and secreted into the intestinal lumen. In healthy human cells, this enzyme plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of phospholipids, specifically removing the sn-2 fatty acyl moiety to produce free fatty acids and lysophospholipids (Cash2010Pancreatic; Hui2019Group). This process is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats and cholesterol, facilitating the uptake of lipid nutrients such as triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters in the digestive tract (Hui2019Group).

PLA2G1B is secreted in an inactive form and becomes active upon proteolytic cleavage in the intestinal lumen, a process dependent on calcium binding (Hui2019Group). The enzyme's activity is crucial for remodeling lipid particles before their absorption into the intestinal mucosa, ensuring efficient nutrient digestion and absorption (Hui2019Group). Although primarily active in the proximal intestine, its absence can be compensated by other phospholipases in the distal intestine (Hui2019Group). Additionally, PLA2G1B is involved in anti-helminth immunity by hydrolyzing phospholipids in tissue-embedded larvae, although it is not solely responsible for infection clearance (Hui2019Group).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PLA2G1B gene, which encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group IB, have been linked to several metabolic disorders. Inactivation of PLA2G1B in mice has been shown to protect against diet-induced obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. This protection is attributed to reduced gastrointestinal production and absorption of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a factor associated with insulin resistance (Hollie2014Group; Murakami2015A). 

PLA2G1B is also implicated in atherosclerosis. In LDL receptor-deficient mice, inactivation of this gene results in significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for reducing atherosclerosis risk (Hollie2014Group). Genome-wide association studies have identified PLA2G1B genetic polymorphisms as risk factors for central obesity in humans, indicating its role in obesity-related conditions (Hollie2011Group).

Pharmacological inhibition of PLA2G1B has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for treating metabolic diseases, as it can prevent diet-induced obesity and diabetes in mice (Murakami2016The; Murakami2015A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PLA2G1B in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
PLA2G1B interacts with various proteins, particularly in the context of immune modulation and microbial infections. One significant interaction is with the HIV gp41 protein, which enhances PLA2G1B's enzymatic activity on CD4 T-cell membranes. This interaction is facilitated by the gp41's conserved 3S motif binding to the gC1qR receptor on CD4 T cells, leading to increased PLA2G1B activity and subsequent T-cell anergy (Pothlichet2022Microbial). The binding of gp41 to PLA2G1B has been confirmed through solid-phase microplate binding assays and pull-down assays, demonstrating a direct interaction (Pothlichet2022Microbial).

PLA2G1B also interacts with other microbial proteins that bind to gC1qR, such as the HCV core protein and Staphylococcus aureus protein A. These proteins significantly increase PLA2G1B activity on CD4 T-cell membranes, suggesting a broader role for PLA2G1B in immune response modulation during infections (Pothlichet2022Microbial). The interaction with gC1qR is crucial, as demonstrated by experiments showing that the absence of gC1qR in Jurkat T cells prevents the increase in PLA2G1B activity induced by the gp41-derived 3S peptide (Pothlichet2022Microbial). These interactions highlight the role of PLA2G1B in immune regulation and its potential involvement in various infectious diseases.
