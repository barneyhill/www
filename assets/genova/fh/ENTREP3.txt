# ENTREP3

## Overview
ENTREP3 is a gene that encodes the protein endosomal transmembrane epsin interactor 3, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in the regulation of endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics. The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, indicating its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Mutations or dysregulation of ENTREP3 have been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Qiu2020aarFDC).
