# HAVCR1

## Overview
HAVCR1, also known as TIM-1, is a gene that encodes the hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein. This protein is a member of the T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) family and plays a pivotal role in immune regulation and pathogen recognition. The protein is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like variable (IgV) domain and a mucin-like domain, which are essential for its function as a receptor for the hepatitis A virus, facilitating viral entry and uncoating. The IgV domain is involved in binding phospholipids and viral particles, while the mucin-like domain is highly polymorphic and contributes to immune response modulation. HAVCR1 is expressed in various immune cells, including CD4+ T helper cells, and is involved in the regulation of Th2-cell activation, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Nakajima2005Evidence; Lee2011TIM).

## Structure
HAVCR1, also known as TIM-1, is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein characterized by an immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain and a mucin-like domain. The IgV domain is crucial for its function, containing six conserved cysteine residues that form a phospholipid-binding pocket essential for interactions with viral particles, such as hepatitis A and C viruses (Kachko2018Determinants; Kaplan2013Structure). The mucin-like domain is highly polymorphic and rich in threonine, serine, and proline, which likely extends the IgV domain above the cell surface (Nakajima2005Evidence; Silberstein2003Alteration).

The primary structure of HAVCR1 includes these domains, with the IgV domain featuring beta-sheets as part of its secondary structure. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are significant for its function, particularly in the mucin domain, which is often heavily glycosylated (Nakajima2005Evidence). Alternative splicing results in different isoforms of HAVCR1, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
The HAVCR1 gene encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the TIM family, specifically known as TIM-1. This protein is involved in several key molecular processes within healthy human cells. It features an N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain, a mucin-like domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, which are crucial for its function in immune regulation and cellular signaling (GarcíaLozano2010Identification; Lee2011TIM).

HAVCR1 is expressed in CD4+ T helper cells and plays a significant role in the regulation of Th2-cell activation and function. It is involved in the negative regulation of T cell-mediated immune responses, which is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis (Lee2011TIM). The protein acts as a receptor for the hepatitis A virus, facilitating viral binding and uncoating, which highlights its role in pathogen recognition and clearance (Nakajima2005Evidence; Lee2011TIM).

The mucin domain of HAVCR1 is particularly variable and has been subject to natural selection, suggesting its importance in immune response modulation and potential evolutionary significance (Nakajima2005Evidence). This domain may also function as an adhesion molecule due to its structural similarity to known adhesion proteins, contributing to its role in cellular interactions (Nakajima2005Evidence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HAVCR1 gene, also known as TIM-1, have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In the context of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection, a polymorphism in the TIM1 gene, specifically the 157insMTTTVP insertion, is associated with increased susceptibility to severe HAV-induced liver failure. This polymorphism enhances the binding efficiency of the TIM-1 receptor to HAV, leading to more severe liver damage due to heightened immune responses (Kim2011A).

HAVCR1 is also implicated in cancer, particularly in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In ccRCC, HAVCR1 expression and ectodomain shedding are linked to tumor progression and malignancy, serving as potential biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targets (Cuadros2013Hepatitis). In HCC, HAVCR1 is overexpressed and associated with high recurrence and mortality rates, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Liu2022A).

Additionally, HAVCR1 polymorphisms are linked to autoimmune diseases such as asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as influencing the severity of pneumonia in children (Karmakova2021Kidney). These associations highlight the gene's role in immune regulation and its impact on disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
HAVCR1, also known as TIM-1, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and molecules. It plays a crucial role in the entry of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) by interacting with the virus through its immunoglobulin-like (IgV) and mucin-like domains. These interactions are temperature-dependent, require calcium ions, and are optimal at a neutral pH, facilitating the uncoating of HAV, which is essential for viral entry into host cells (Silberstein2009The; Silberstein2003Alteration).

HAVCR1 also interacts with phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of exosomes containing HAV, mediating the delivery of RNA cargo into the cytoplasm. This process involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis and is facilitated by the interaction of HAVCR1 with the cholesterol transporter NPC1 in late endosomes. This interaction is crucial for the fusion of exosome and endosomal membranes, allowing the release of capsid-free HAV genomes into the cytoplasm (Costafreda2020Exosome).

Additionally, HAVCR1 interacts with immunoglobulin A (IgA), enhancing the virus-receptor interaction and potentially playing a role in the pathogenesis of HAV by facilitating infection of cells with IgA and IgA receptors (Tami2007Immunoglobulin).
