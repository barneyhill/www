# PET100

## Overview
PET100 is a gene that encodes the PET100 cytochrome c oxidase chaperone, a mitochondrial protein essential for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV of the electron transport chain. This chaperone protein is crucial for the proper folding and stabilization of COX subunits, facilitating the efficient assembly and function of the enzyme complex within the inner mitochondrial membrane (Oláhová2014A; Vidoni2017MR1S). PET100 interacts with other COX assembly factors, such as MR-1S and PET117, to ensure the correct formation of COX intermediates and the incorporation of structural subunits into the holocomplex (Vidoni2017MR1S). Mutations in the PET100 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its critical role in cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Oláhová2014A).

## Structure
The PET100 protein, encoded by the PET100 gene, is a molecular chaperone essential for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It consists of 111 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 13,298 daltons (Church1996Cloning; Forsha2001Structure). The primary structure includes a high content of hydrophilic amino acids, with more basic than acidic residues, and a predicted isoelectric point of 9.87 (Church1996Cloning).

The secondary structure of PET100p is predicted to be predominantly α-helical, with a hydrophobic domain between residues 20 and 38. This domain is composed of two β-strands interrupted by a reverse turn, forming a 'hairpin' structure (Church1996Cloning; Forsha2001Structure). The NH2-terminal domain features characteristics of a mitochondrial targeting sequence, including hydrophilicity and a high content of basic amino acids, with a predicted cleavage site between residues 13 and 14 (Church1996Cloning).

PET100p is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its hydrophobic N-terminal domain inserted into the membrane and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain exposed to the intermembrane space, which is crucial for its function in cytochrome c oxidase assembly (Forsha2001Structure).

## Function
PET100 is a crucial chaperone protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV, in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein plays a significant role in the proper folding and stabilization of COX subunits, facilitating the efficient assembly and function of the enzyme complex. PET100 interacts with other COX assembly factors, such as MR-1S and PET117, to ensure the correct formation of COX intermediates and the incorporation of structural subunits into the holocomplex (Vidoni2017MR1S).

In healthy human cells, PET100 is active in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it is essential for the biogenesis of COX. The presence of PET100 is necessary for the formation of subcomplexes involving COX7A, COX6C, and COX7C, and it is required for the interaction of MR-1S and PET117 with COX structural subunits (signes2019identification). PET100's function is critical for maintaining normal mitochondrial function, as it ensures the proper assembly and activity of COX, which is vital for cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Oláhová2014A). Deficiencies in PET100 can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in energy-dependent tissues and organs (Oláhová2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PET100 gene are associated with severe mitochondrial disorders, primarily due to its role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. A truncating variant in PET100 can lead to fatal infantile lactic acidosis and isolated cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, characterized by a severe deficiency of complex IV in muscle and fibroblasts. This condition results in impaired energy production, leading to metabolic disorders such as Leigh syndrome, a progressive neurological disorder with multiorgan involvement (Oláhová2014A).

Patients with homozygous truncating mutations in PET100 exhibit a complete loss of COX enzyme activity and assembly, which is consistent with the observed biochemical defects in the respiratory chain complex activities (Oláhová2014A). The absence of PET100 disrupts the stability and interaction of COX assembly intermediates, leading to severe, isolated COX deficiency and early-onset mitochondrial encephalopathy (Vidoni2017MR1S). These findings underscore the critical role of PET100 in maintaining COX assembly and function, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial disease pathology (Vidoni2017MR1S).

## Interactions
PET100 is a mitochondrial chaperone protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV of the electron transport chain. It interacts with several other proteins to facilitate the proper assembly and function of this enzyme complex. In human cells, PET100 has been shown to interact with COX7A2, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 cells (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial). PET100 is also associated with the COX assembly factors MR-1S and PET117, suggesting its role in assisting the late stages of COX biogenesis. This interaction likely involves promoting the association of submodules formed by nucleus-encoded subunits to COX2 or COX3 and/or the incorporation of these modules into COX1 within the holocomplex assembly line (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial; Vidoni2017MR1S).

In yeast, Pet100p, the ortholog of human PET100, interacts with a subcomplex containing cytochrome c oxidase subunits VII, VIIa, and VIII, which accumulates in pet100 mutants (Forsha2001Structure). This interaction is crucial for the assembly of the holoenzyme, highlighting the importance of PET100 in the assembly process across different species.
