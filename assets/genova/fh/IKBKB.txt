# IKBKB

## Overview
The IKBKB gene encodes the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKKβ), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. IKKβ is a component of the IKK complex, which also includes IKKα and NEMO (IKKγ), and is responsible for phosphorylating IκB proteins, leading to their degradation and the subsequent release of NF-κB dimers. These dimers translocate to the nucleus to activate genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (de2008Downregulation; Senegas2014IKKrelated). The IKBKB gene is essential for the canonical NF-κB activation pathway, responding to various stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial products (Senegas2014IKKrelated). Mutations in IKBKB can lead to immunodeficiencies, underscoring its importance in maintaining immune function (Cardinez2018Gainoffunction; Alsum2020Multiple).

## Structure
The IKBKB protein, also known as IKKβ, adopts a trimodular structure consisting of an N-terminal kinase domain (KD), a central ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), and a C-terminal scaffold/dimerization domain (SDD) (Allegra2021Evaluation). The KD is characterized by a narrow hydrophobic ATP binding pocket located between its N-lobe and C-lobe, linked by a flexible hinge region. This region includes residues such as Glu97, Tyr98, and Cys99, which are capable of forming hydrogen bonds with inhibitors (Allegra2021Evaluation). The activation loop of the KD contains a conserved triplet DLG (Asp166, Leu167, Gly168) crucial for catalytic activity (Allegra2021Evaluation).

The protein's quaternary structure is dimeric, consisting of two chains, A and B, each with 664 amino acids. Chain B features phosphorylated activation loops at sites S177 and S181, while chain A does not (Gurram2022Virtual). A druggable allosteric site is located between the KD and ULD, comprising three α helices from the KD and a loop between two β sheets from the ULD (Gurram2022Virtual). The IKBKB protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is essential for its function in the NF-kB signaling pathway (Qin2021A).

## Function
The IKBKB gene encodes the IKK-beta protein, a critical component of the IKK complex involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for regulating immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. IKK-beta functions as a serine/threonine kinase, primarily responsible for phosphorylating IκB inhibitors. This phosphorylation leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκB proteins, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and activate target genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (de2008Downregulation; Senegas2014IKKrelated).

In healthy human cells, IKK-beta is crucial for the canonical NF-κB activation pathway, which is triggered by stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, bacterial products, and stress. This pathway is dependent on NEMO for signal transmission to IKK-beta (Senegas2014IKKrelated). IKK-beta's activity is vital for the proper functioning of several signaling pathways, including those responding to TNF-α, LPS (TLR4), and flagellin (TLR5), which are important for immune responses and inflammation (Senegas2014IKKrelated).

IKK-beta is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a role in maintaining normal immune and inflammatory responses, highlighting its importance in cell biology and organismal health (de2008Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IKBKB gene are associated with various forms of immunodeficiency due to their impact on the NF-κB signaling pathway. A gain-of-function mutation, specifically a heterozygous missense mutation resulting in a valine to isoleucine substitution (V203I), has been linked to a novel syndrome of combined immune deficiency. This mutation leads to enhanced NF-κB pathway activation, resulting in recurrent respiratory infections, severe eczema, dental abnormalities, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and premature cataracts. It is characterized by reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and memory B cells, but increased or normal T regulatory cells (Cardinez2018Gainoffunction).

Conversely, a novel homozygous mutation in IKBKB, leading to the substitution of histidine with tyrosine at position 395 (Y395H), causes severe immunodeficiency by destabilizing the IKKβ protein. This mutation impairs NF-κB signaling, resulting in combined T and B cell functional defects, persistent infections, and growth retardation (Qin2021A).

IKBKB mutations can also lead to IKK2 deficiency, a type of combined immunodeficiency characterized by severe infections and hypogammaglobulinemia. This condition often requires early intervention with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Alsum2020Multiple). These mutations highlight the critical role of IKBKB in maintaining immune function.

## Interactions
IKBKB, also known as IKKβ, is a critical component of the IKK complex, which is essential for the activation of NF-κB. IKBKB interacts with IKKα and NEMO (IKKγ) to form the IKK signalosome, a multiprotein complex that phosphorylates IκB proteins, leading to their degradation and the release of NF-κB dimers for nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation (Schmid2008IκB). IKBKB can form both homodimers and heterodimers with IKKα, and these interactions are crucial for the kinase activity of the IKK complex (Mercurio1997IKK1; Zandi1997The).

IKBKB also interacts with TRAF1, a TNF receptor-associated factor, which can modulate NF-κB signaling. The interaction between IKBKB and TRAF1 is dose-dependent and can either inhibit or stimulate NF-κB activation, depending on the cellular context and relative protein levels (Schmid2010Interaction). TRAF1's interaction with IKBKB is weaker compared to its interaction with TRAF2, suggesting a competitive binding scenario (Schmid2010Interaction).

Additionally, IKBKB is involved in atypical NF-κB activation pathways, interacting with proteins such as ATM and ELKS in response to genotoxic stress (Schmid2008IκB). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of IKBKB in cellular signaling pathways.
