# LKAAEAR1

## Overview
The LKAAEAR1 gene encodes the LKAAEAR motif containing 1 protein, which is a member of a novel class of proteins characterized by the presence of the LKAAEAR motif. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are still under investigation. It is hypothesized to play a role in intracellular signaling pathways, potentially influencing cellular growth and differentiation. The LKAAEAR motif containing 1 protein is not currently categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but ongoing research aims to elucidate its specific molecular functions and interactions within the cell. Understanding the role of LKAAEAR1 and its encoded protein could provide insights into its involvement in health and disease, particularly in the context of the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC).
