# SLC25A34

## Overview
SLC25A34 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 34, which is part of the mitochondrial carrier family. This family is known for its role in transporting various molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The SLC25A34 protein is characterized by its tripartite structure, consisting of three homologous domains with six transmembrane α-helices, a common feature among solute carrier family 25 (SLC25) proteins (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). These structural elements facilitate the protein's function in mediating the exchange of metabolites between the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix, a process essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Palmieri2013The). While specific functional roles and clinical implications of SLC25A34 remain to be fully elucidated, its structural characteristics suggest a potential involvement in critical mitochondrial processes.

## Structure
The SLC25A34 protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, characterized by a unique structural organization. It typically features a tripartite structure with three homologous domains, each containing two hydrophobic regions separated by a hydrophilic sequence. This arrangement forms a funnel-shaped structure with six transmembrane α-helices, which is a hallmark of the solute carrier family 25 (SLC25) proteins (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). These helices are arranged in a counter-clockwise order, creating a cavity that is open towards the cytosol (Palmieri2013The).

The protein's function is facilitated by conformational changes between cytoplasmic and matrix states, which are mediated by salt bridges formed by conserved motifs (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). Although specific post-translational modifications for SLC25A34 are not detailed, proteins in this family often undergo such modifications, which can regulate their function (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational).

The quaternary structure of SLC25A34, like other SLC25 family members, may involve the formation of homodimers, contributing to its functional configuration (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). However, specific details about splice variant isoforms or unique domains of SLC25A34 are not provided in the available context.
