# CCR5

## Overview
The CCR5 gene encodes the C-C motif chemokine receptor 5, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is predominantly expressed on the surface of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells. This receptor plays a critical role in the immune system by mediating the migration of leukocytes in response to chemokines, thereby facilitating immune surveillance and inflammatory responses (Singer2001CCR5). Beyond its physiological functions, CCR5 is notably recognized for its involvement in HIV-1 pathogenesis, serving as a co-receptor that allows the virus to enter host cells (Singer2001CCR5). The receptor's structure, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain, is essential for its interaction with both chemokines and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 (Dragic2001An; Barmania2013CC). Genetic variations in CCR5, such as the Δ32 deletion, have been associated with resistance to HIV infection, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Barmania2013CC).

## Structure
The CCR5 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a seven-transmembrane domain structure, consisting of 352 amino acids and a molecular weight of 40.6 kDa (Barmania2013CC). Its primary structure includes an amino-terminal (N-terminal) region rich in tyrosine and acidic amino acids, which are crucial for HIV interaction and chemokine binding (Barmania2013CC). The secondary structure features seven transmembrane alpha helices connected by three extracellular loops (ECL1-3) and three intracellular loops (ICL1-3) (Tan2013Structure). The largest loop, ECL2, forms a beta-hairpin structure (Tan2013Structure).

The tertiary structure involves a ligand-binding pocket where maraviroc, an HIV entry inhibitor, binds, defined by interactions with specific residues such as Glu-283 and Tyr-251 (Tan2013Structure). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but the interactions between helices and the stabilization of the inactive conformation by maraviroc suggest a complex arrangement of the helices (Tan2013Structure).

Post-translational modifications include palmitoylation, which anchors the receptor to the cell membrane and affects its transport and signaling (Barmania2013CC). The receptor's N-terminal region is also subject to tyrosine sulfation, which plays a role in co-receptor function (Dragic2001An).

## Function
The CCR5 gene encodes a chemokine receptor that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily expressed on the surface of macrophages and T cells. In healthy human cells, CCR5 functions as a sensor for detecting concentration gradients of chemokines, which are signaling molecules that guide the migration of immune cells during normal homeostasis and inflammatory responses (Singer2001CCR5). This receptor is localized on the microvilli of these cells, forming homogeneous microclusters that enhance its ability to monitor the cellular environment and facilitate chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells in response to chemical stimuli (Singer2001CCR5).

CCR5 plays a significant role in the immune system by regulating leukocyte trafficking and participating in the ordered multistep mechanism that allows the binding and entry of HIV-1 into host cells (Singer2001CCR5). The receptor's interaction with the viral envelope protein gp120, following its initial binding to CD4, triggers conformational changes necessary for viral entry (Singer2001CCR5). Despite its role in HIV entry, genetic variations in CCR5, such as the Δ32 deletion, can confer resistance to HIV infection, highlighting its importance in viral pathogenesis (Singer2001CCR5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCR5 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. The CCR5-Δ32 mutation, a 32 base pair deletion, results in a non-functional receptor that provides resistance to HIV-1 infection in homozygous individuals by preventing the virus from using CCR5 for cell entry (Vangelista2018The; Barmania2013CC). However, this mutation is linked to increased severity of West Nile virus and tick-borne encephalitis infections, as CCR5 plays a crucial role in immune cell migration during these infections (Vangelista2018The).

In autoimmune diseases, the CCR5-Δ32 mutation may reduce the severity of rheumatoid arthritis by decreasing disease severity and inflammatory reactions (Barmania2013CC). In multiple sclerosis, while the mutation does not affect disease risk, it may influence disease progression (Vangelista2018The). Altered CCR5 expression is also implicated in cancer, where it can either promote or inhibit tumor growth depending on the context (Vangelista2018The).

CCR5 is involved in cardiovascular diseases, with the Δ32 allele linked to protection against coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction due to better lipid profiles (Barmania2013CC). Conversely, high CCR5 levels are associated with non-metastatic colorectal cancer, while low levels are linked to advanced disease (Barmania2013CC).

## Interactions
CCR5, a chemokine receptor, interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in immune response and HIV-1 infection. It serves as a co-receptor for HIV-1 entry by interacting with the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120. This interaction involves the binding of gp120 to the N-terminal region of CCR5, followed by conformational changes that facilitate viral entry into host cells (Dragic2001An; Qi2020Advances). CCR5 also forms complexes with CD4, another receptor involved in HIV-1 entry, and this interaction is crucial for the viral fusion process (Xiao1999Constitutive).

CCR5 interacts with several chemokines, including CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, which are involved in immune cell migration and inflammation. These interactions occur at specific chemokine recognition sites on CCR5, with distinct binding modes for different chemokines (Zhang2021Structural). The receptor can form homo- and hetero-dimers with other chemokine receptors, such as CCR2 and CXCR4, affecting its signaling pathways and physiological responses (Brelot2018CCR5). CCR5's interaction with CXCR4 is particularly relevant in the context of HIV-1, as it can alter chemotactic responses and influence viral entry (Brelot2018CCR5).
