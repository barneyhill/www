# ZMIZ1

## Overview
ZMIZ1 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger MIZ-type containing 1 protein, which functions as a transcriptional cofactor involved in various cellular processes. The protein is a member of the Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT (PIAS)-like family and plays a critical role in transcriptional activation and chromatin remodeling. It is characterized by distinct domains, including a tetratricopeptide repeat domain and a MIZ/SP-RING zinc finger domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its involvement in processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and development (Lu2022A; K2023Zmiz1). ZMIZ1 is essential for the maturation of β-cells in the pancreas and is implicated in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, with variations in the gene linked to type 2 diabetes risk (Alghamdi2022Zmiz1). Additionally, ZMIZ1 is crucial for angiogenesis in endothelial cells and plays a role in lymphatic vessel development (Patel2024Endothelial; K2023Zmiz1). Mutations in ZMIZ1 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in transcription regulation and neuronal development (Córdova-Fletes2015A; Latchman2019Autosomal).

## Structure
The ZMIZ1 protein is composed of 1067 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 123 kDa. It features several distinct domains that contribute to its structure and function. The protein includes a Zmiz1 N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR, aa8-100), which is crucial for interactions with Notch1 during T-cell development (Wang2018Stagespecific; Lu2022A). Another significant domain is the MIZ/SP-RING zinc finger domain (zf-MIZ, aa739-786), which is essential for protein-protein interactions and SUMOylation (Lu2022A). This domain is also where the G777E variant is located, potentially affecting the protein's tertiary structure (Lu2022A).

The protein contains intrinsically disordered regions with phosphorylation sites, which may influence its function (Lu2022A). It also has an alanine-rich region (aa280-305) and two proline-rich regions, which are important for phase separation and transcription mediator function (Lu2022A). The presence of a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS, aa697-711) facilitates its transport into the nucleus (Lu2022A). ZMIZ1 is known to have multiple splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their functional roles (Mathios2019Genome‐wide).

## Function
The ZMIZ1 gene encodes a transcription cofactor that plays a significant role in various cellular and molecular processes. In healthy human cells, ZMIZ1 is involved in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with transcription factors such as p53, Smad3, and Notch1, influencing transcription through chromatin remodeling and modulation of chromatin accessibility (Alghamdi2022Zmiz1; K2023Zmiz1). It is a member of the Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT (PIAS)-like family and functions as a transcriptional activator and chromatin remodeler, impacting processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, and development (K2023Zmiz1).

ZMIZ1 is crucial for the function and maturation of β-cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Variations in this gene can affect insulin secretion, leading to implications in type 2 diabetes risk (Alghamdi2022Zmiz1). In endothelial cells, ZMIZ1 is essential for angiogenesis, particularly during retinal development, by regulating tip-cell gene expression and endothelial cell migration (Patel2024Endothelial). It also plays a role in lymphatic endothelial cells by regulating genes involved in lymphatic vessel development, such as Prox1, through chromatin accessibility (K2023Zmiz1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZMIZ1 gene are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, dysmorphic facies, and distal skeletal anomalies. This condition, known as neurodevelopmental disorder with dysmorphic facies and distal skeletal anomalies (NEDDFSA), is typically caused by de novo mutations but can also follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Latchman2019Autosomal; Lu2022A). The disorder presents with a range of symptoms, including hypotonia, language delay, and various congenital malformations (Latchman2019Autosomal; Lu2022A).

ZMIZ1 mutations can lead to significant clinical manifestations due to their role in transcription regulation, particularly in the brain. The gene interacts with pathways such as NOTCH1 and is involved in chromatin remodeling, which are crucial for neuronal development (Córdova-Fletes2015A; Latchman2019Autosomal). Variants in ZMIZ1 have been linked to autism spectrum disorder and other neuropsychiatric conditions, suggesting its broad impact on neurodevelopmental processes (Córdova-Fletes2015A; Latchman2019Autosomal).

The clinical significance of ZMIZ1 mutations is underscored by their potential to disrupt normal development, leading to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders (Córdova-Fletes2015A; Lu2022A).

## Interactions
ZMIZ1 is a transcriptional co-activator that participates in various protein interactions, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. It is known to interact with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in breast cancer cells, forming part of the ER transcriptional complex. This interaction is crucial for modulating the expression of ER-regulated genes, particularly those involved in the cell cycle, such as E2F2. The proximity of ZMIZ1 and ERα within the same transcriptional complex has been confirmed using proximity ligation assays (PLA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative real-time PCR (ChIP-qPCR) (Zhao2024ZMIZ1).

ZMIZ1 also interacts with NOTCH1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), where it collaborates with activated NOTCH1 to induce leukemogenesis. This interaction promotes the transcription and activity of C-MYC, a critical downstream target, through a novel N-terminal domain of ZMIZ1, independent of the canonical NOTCH pathway (Rakowski2013Convergence).

In colon cancer, ZMIZ1 interacts with SIRT1, a protein involved in cellular metabolism and stress response. This interaction leads to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of SIRT1, affecting processes such as autophagy, proliferation, and apoptosis (Huang2024ZMIZ1).
