# OSBPL8

## Overview
OSBPL8 is a gene that encodes the oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 8 (ORP8), a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family. ORP8 is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and transport, functioning as a phospholipid transfer protein. It facilitates the exchange of phosphatidylserine for phosphoinositides at membrane contact sites, playing a crucial role in maintaining lipid balance and cellular signaling (Santos2020ORP5). Additionally, ORP8 acts as an oxysterol sensor, influencing cholesterol biosynthesis and serum lipid levels, and is implicated in the regulation of cholesterol efflux in macrophages, which may impact atherosclerosis development (Yan2008OSBPrelated). ORP8's interactions with various proteins, such as Nup62 and PTPIP51, further underscore its role in lipid signaling and cellular homeostasis (Zhou2011OSBPRelated; Galmes2016ORP5ORP8).

## Function
OSBPL8, also known as ORP8, is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family involved in lipid metabolism and transport. In healthy human cells, ORP8 functions primarily as a phospholipid transfer protein, facilitating the exchange of phosphatidylserine (PS) for phosphoinositides like phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) at membrane contact sites (MCS) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, lysosomes, and mitochondria (Santos2020ORP5). This activity is crucial for maintaining lipid balance and cellular signaling.

ORP8 also plays a role in cholesterol metabolism. It acts as an oxysterol sensor, binding to oxysterols like 25-hydroxycholesterol, and influences cholesterol biosynthesis and serum lipid levels. In macrophages, ORP8 negatively regulates the expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), thereby modulating cholesterol efflux and potentially impacting atherosclerosis development (Yan2008OSBPrelated).

Additionally, ORP8 interacts with the nucleoporin Nup62, which may influence the nuclear transport of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), affecting lipid biosynthesis and homeostasis (Zhou2011OSBPRelated). ORP8's involvement in these processes highlights its significant role in lipid signaling and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the OSBPL8 gene, which encodes the oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 8 (ORP8), have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and cardiovascular conditions. In cancer, ORP8 is considered a potential tumor suppressor. Its downregulation has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and gastric cancer tissues, where its overexpression can induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth. This effect is linked to the relocation of the Fas receptor to the plasma membrane and the upregulation of Fas ligand, mediated by an ER stress response and activation of NF-κB, dependent on the stress sensor p53 (Olkkonen2022The). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), reduced ORP8 expression is associated with increased miR-421, which suppresses ORP8, leading to enhanced tumor cell survival (Olkkonen2022The).

In cardiovascular diseases, ORP8 plays a role in cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis. It negatively regulates ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux from macrophages, processes crucial for atheroprotection. ORP8's suppression of ABCA1 involves liver X receptor (LXR) function, impacting cholesterol transport and macrophage function, which are key in atherosclerosis development (Yan2008OSBPrelated).

## Interactions
OSBPL8, also known as ORP8, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling. ORP8 interacts with the nuclear pore complex component Nup62, which is crucial for its role in modulating SREBP-dependent transcription and influencing transcription factor systems (Olkkonen2012Oxysterols; Olkkonen2013Oxysterolbinding). This interaction is necessary for the reduction of nuclear SREBPs, suggesting a regulatory role in nuclear transport processes (Olkkonen2012Oxysterols).

ORP8 also competes with Exo70 for binding to Nup62, which affects cell migration by down-regulating Exo70's pro-migratory activity (Olkkonen2013Oxysterolbinding). Additionally, ORP8 interacts with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) at the plasma membrane, regulating its levels and participating in lipid homeostasis (Ghai2017ORP5).

At the ER-mitochondria contact sites, ORP8 interacts with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein PTPIP51, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Galmes2016ORP5ORP8). This interaction is independent of VAP proteins, although ORP8 also interacts with VAPs (Galmes2016ORP5ORP8).
