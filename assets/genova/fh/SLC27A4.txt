# SLC27A4

## Overview
The SLC27A4 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 27 member 4, commonly referred to as fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4). This protein is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the uptake and metabolism of long-chain and very long-chain fatty acids. FATP4 is characterized by its ATP/AMP binding domain and very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLACS) motif, which are essential for its function in fatty acid activation and transport (Maekawa2015Investigation; Khnykin2011Role). Predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, FATP4 is integral to lipid metabolic processes, contributing to the synthesis of complex lipids necessary for maintaining cellular and skin barrier integrity (Jia2007Fatty; Khnykin2011Role). Mutations in the SLC27A4 gene have been linked to various skin disorders, underscoring its clinical significance in dermatological health (Yamamoto2020Skin; Klar2009Mutations).

## Structure
The SLC27A4 gene encodes the fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4), which is involved in the uptake and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. The protein consists of 643 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 71 kDa (Khnykin2011Role). FATP4 is characterized by several key structural features, including an N-terminal transmembrane region that likely anchors the protein to cellular membranes and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization signal, indicating its role in ER-associated processes (Khnykin2011Role).

FATP4 contains two functional domains: an ATP/AMP motif responsible for ATP binding and a FATP/VLACS motif, which exhibits very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity (Khnykin2011Role). The AMP-binding domain is crucial for the transport and activation of fatty acids, and mutations affecting this domain can impact the protein's function (Maekawa2015Investigation). 

Mutations in the SLC27A4 gene can lead to truncated versions of the protein, lacking essential domains such as the VLACS domain, which is critical for fatty acid binding (Tao2012A). These structural components are vital for FATP4's role in mediating fatty acid uptake and metabolism, particularly in the epidermis, where it contributes to skin barrier formation and maintenance (Khnykin2011Role).

## Function
The SLC27A4 gene encodes fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4), which plays a critical role in the uptake and metabolism of long-chain and very long-chain fatty acids in human cells. FATP4 functions as a very long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, facilitating the activation of these fatty acids to their CoA derivatives, which are essential for various lipid metabolic processes (Jia2007Fatty). This protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and peroxisomes, where it contributes to the synthesis of neutral lipids and phospholipids (Jia2007Fatty).

In skin fibroblasts, FATP4 is the principal enzyme responsible for the activation of very long chain fatty acids, which are crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis and proper skin barrier function (Jia2007Fatty; Khnykin2011Role). The absence of FATP4 leads to significant reductions in the activation and incorporation of these fatty acids into complex lipids, affecting lipid droplet morphology and fatty acid oxidation rates (Jia2007Fatty). FATP4's role in fatty acid transport and activation is vital for healthy cellular function and organismal outcomes, such as skin integrity and energy homeostasis (Khnykin2011Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC27A4 gene, also known as FATP4, are associated with several skin disorders, most notably Ichthyosis Prematurity Syndrome (IPS). IPS is an autosomal-recessive condition characterized by premature birth, neonatal asphyxia, and lifelong nonscaly ichthyosis with atopic manifestations. These mutations lead to reduced activity of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA)-CoA synthetase, impairing the incorporation of VLCFA into cellular lipids, which is crucial for skin barrier function (Yamamoto2020Skin; Klar2009Mutations).

In mice, mutations in the Fatp4 gene result in severe skin phenotypes, including defective skin barrier formation and hair follicle development, which serve as models for human congenital ichthyosis (Tao2012A). The "wrinkle-free" phenotype in mice, caused by a mutation in the Slc27a4 gene, results in tight, thick skin and is similar to human restrictive dermopathy (Moulson2003Cloning).

In Great Danes, a specific mutation in the SLC27A4 gene leads to ichthyosis, characterized by hyperkeratosis and dry, scaling skin. This mutation results in a loss of functional SLC27A4 protein, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining skin integrity (Metzger2015A).

## Interactions
SLC27A4, also known as fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4), is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes. In human lung cancer cells, SLC27A4 directly interacts with ATG4B, a cysteine protease essential for autophagy. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull down assays. The SLC27A4/ATG4B complex is significant in regulating autophagy, a process that cancer cells may exploit to resist chemotherapy. When autophagy is stimulated, the interaction between SLC27A4 and ATG4B is disrupted, indicating that SLC27A4 is important for maintaining ATG4B activity and the autophagic response (Wu2015SLC27A4).

In breast cancer, SLC27A4 is associated with cell growth, migration, and invasion, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed. The gene is linked to various metabolic pathways and cell size regulation, suggesting potential interactions with signaling pathways like TGF-β (Yen2018Solute). However, the exact nature of these interactions remains to be fully elucidated.
