# ATP1B3

## Overview
ATP1B3 is a gene that encodes the beta-3 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a transmembrane enzyme complex crucial for maintaining sodium and potassium ion gradients across the plasma membrane. This protein is part of the Na+/K+ and H+/K+ ATPase beta chain family and plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. The ATP1B3 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are essential for its maturation and proper localization at the plasma membrane. It interacts with other proteins, such as CASPR1, to ensure the correct assembly and function of the Na+/K+ ATPase complex, particularly in brain microvascular endothelial cells. The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and intervertebral disc disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lu2021Integrative; Zhang2019A; Nishitsuji2016ATP1B3).

## Structure
The ATP1B3 gene encodes the beta-3 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a membrane-bound enzyme essential for maintaining cellular ion gradients. The protein is part of the Na+/K+ and H+/K+ ATPase beta chain family and is involved in ATP hydrolysis and ion exchange across the plasma membrane (Nishitsuji2016ATP1B3). The ATP1B3 protein contains a cytoplasmic domain (residues 1-35), a helical domain (residues 36-56), and an extracellular domain (residues 57-279) (Nishitsuji2016ATP1B3). 

Post-translational modifications of ATP1B3 include glycosylation, which is crucial for its maturation and plasma membrane localization. The protein exists in fully and intermediately glycosylated forms, and mutations at specific glycosylation sites (N124E, N240E) affect its maturation (Zhang2019A). The interaction with Caspr1 in brain microvascular endothelial cells facilitates ATP1B3's glycosylation and maturation, necessary for the proper assembly and activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase complex (Zhang2019A). 

The quaternary structure involves the assembly of ATP1B3 with alpha subunits to form a functional Na+/K+ ATPase enzyme complex, which is crucial for its role in maintaining ion gradients across the cell membrane (Zhang2019A).

## Function
The ATP1B3 gene encodes the β3 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase, a critical enzyme for maintaining sodium and potassium ion gradients across the plasma membrane. This enzyme is essential for various cellular processes, including nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. In brain microvascular endothelial cells, ATP1B3 interacts with CASPR1, a transmembrane protein, to ensure the proper localization and function of Na+/K+-ATPase at the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase complex, which regulates the efflux of glutamate across the blood-brain barrier (Zhang2019A).

ATP1B3 is a glycosylated protein, and its glycosylation is necessary for its function. CASPR1 is required for the post-translational glycosylation of ATP1B3, affecting its localization at the plasma membrane. In the absence of CASPR1, ATP1B3 aggregates in the cytoplasm, impairing its role in maintaining ion balance across the plasma membrane (Zhang2019A). The β3 subunit is also involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic potassium concentration, highlighting its role in cellular ion homeostasis (Zhang2019A). ATP1B3's interaction with CASPR1 is essential for the proper trafficking and function of the Na+/K+-ATPase complex, which is vital for maintaining electrochemical gradients in cells (Zhang2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ATP1B3 gene, which encodes the β3 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase, have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ATP1B3 expression is elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with poor overall survival. High ATP1B3 levels correlate with tumor differentiation and a history of liver cirrhosis, and it is identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in HCC patients. The gene's expression is also linked to resistance to sorafenib therapy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lu2021Integrative).

In gastric cancer, ATP1B3 expression is increased in cancerous tissues and cell lines, correlating with worse clinical outcomes, including shorter survival times. Knockdown of ATP1B3 in gastric cancer cells inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis. This suggests that ATP1B3 may regulate cancer progression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, making it a potential target for therapy and a marker for diagnosis and prognosis (Li2017Expression).

In intervertebral disc disease, ATP1B3 expression is decreased in degenerative tissues, and its regulation is linked to the circSPG21/miR-1197 axis, indicating a role in disease progression (Huang2021circSPG21).

## Interactions
ATP1B3, a subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase enzyme, participates in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with BST-2, a protein involved in the restriction of HIV-1 production. This interaction occurs at the plasma membrane, where ATP1B3 binds to the extracellular domain of BST-2. The binding of ATP1B3 to BST-2 has been shown to modulate BST-2's antiviral activity, as ATP1B3 knockdown enhances BST-2-mediated restriction of HIV-1 production and increases NF-κB activation (Nishitsuji2016ATP1B3).

In brain microvascular endothelial cells, ATP1B3 interacts with Caspr1, a protein that facilitates its glycosylation and maturation. This interaction is essential for the proper trafficking and plasma membrane localization of the Na+/K+ ATPase complex. Caspr1 binds specifically to the core proteins of ATP1B3, but not its glycosylated forms, and this interaction is crucial for the assembly and activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase complex (Zhang2019A).

ATP1B3 also plays a role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) restriction by cooperating with BST-2 to activate the NF-κB pathway, which enhances the production of anti-HBV factors (Zheng2019ATP1B3). These interactions highlight ATP1B3's involvement in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
