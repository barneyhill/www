# WSCD2

## Overview
The WSCD2 gene encodes the WSC domain containing 2 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of a WSC domain, which is typically associated with cell wall integrity and stress response in other organisms, although its specific function in humans is not fully understood. WSCD2 has been implicated in several biological pathways and diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. Its expression levels and genetic variations have been linked to clinical outcomes in breast cancer and papillary thyroid carcinoma, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (UNAL2022Bioinformatics; Bushel2022Mitochondrialnuclear). Additionally, duplications involving WSCD2 have been associated with complex neurodevelopmental phenotypes, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Servetti2021Neurodevelopmental).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The WSCD2 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In breast cancer, WSCD2 is associated with nuclear size and patient survival. Low expression of WSCD2, combined with large nuclei, is linked to a 70% increased risk of mortality in breast cancer patients, suggesting its role in prognosis (Bushel2022Mitochondrialnuclear). A significant interaction between a nuclear SNP in WSCD2 and a mitochondrial SNP in MT-ND4 has been associated with increased nuclear size, potentially influencing breast cancer susceptibility (Bushel2022Mitochondrialnuclear).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), WSCD2 is part of a gene cluster with altered expression, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Its differential expression in PTC suggests a role in disease pathogenesis, although specific clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated (UNAL2022Bioinformatics).

WSCD2 is also involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, where duplications encompassing the gene have been linked to complex phenotypes. These genetic alterations may contribute to neurodevelopmental phenotypes, although the exact clinical significance requires further investigation (Servetti2021Neurodevelopmental).
