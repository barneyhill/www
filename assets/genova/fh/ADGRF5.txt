# ADGRF5

## Overview
ADGRF5, also known as GPR116, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F5, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a signal peptide, multiple immunoglobulin-like domains, a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, and a seven-transmembrane helices (7TM) domain. The protein plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, particularly in maintaining pulmonary surfactant homeostasis, regulating somatostatin secretion in pancreatic islets, and contributing to vascular integrity. ADGRF5's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular and tissue homeostasis across different organ systems (Morgan2019The; Knierim2019Genetic; Röthe2024The).

## Structure
The ADGRF5 protein, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F5, is characterized by a complex modular domain organization. It includes a signal peptide, a sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrin (SEA) domain, up to three immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain with a G protein-receptor proteolytic site (GPS), and a seven-transmembrane helices (7TM) domain (Knierim2019Genetic). The GAIN domain undergoes autoproteolysis, resulting in two subunits: the N-terminal fragment (NTF) and the C-terminal fragment (CTF) (Dates2024Heterogeneity). This cleavage is crucial for receptor function, as it regulates pulmonary surfactant levels and homeostasis (Morgan2019The).

The structural variability of ADGRF5 is primarily due to alternative splicing, which affects the N- and C-termini, leading to different splice variant isoforms (Knierim2019Genetic). These variants can result in premature truncation, potentially leading to soluble and secreted N-termini (Knierim2019Genetic). The protein's N-terminal region is particularly diverse, containing domains such as EGF, Ig, Pentraxin, or SEA, which can undergo autoproteolytic cleavage (Knierim2019Genetic). The 7TM domain is relatively stable, with less frequent splice variants (Knierim2019Genetic). The GPS domain is a hallmark of aGPCRs, and alternative splicing can result in variants lacking this domain (Knierim2019Genetic).

## Function
ADGRF5, also known as GPR116, is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor involved in several critical physiological processes. In the lungs, ADGRF5 is predominantly expressed in alveolar type II (AT2) cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining pulmonary surfactant homeostasis. It regulates the surfactant pool size by suppressing secretion and promoting uptake via the Gq/11 signaling pathway. Disruption of ADGRF5 leads to surfactant lipid and protein accumulation, airway inflammation, and increased expression of CCL2 in lung endothelial cells, indicating its role in immune regulation within the lung (Yang2013Essential; Kubo2019Loss).

In pancreatic islets, ADGRF5 is expressed in delta cells and regulates somatostatin secretion, which in turn modulates insulin and glucagon release from beta and alpha cells, respectively. This receptor is involved in islet development, affecting beta-cell mass and insulin expression, although glucose homeostasis is maintained through compensatory mechanisms (Röthe2024The).

ADGRF5 is also expressed in the vascular endothelium, where it contributes to maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity and modulating angiogenesis. Its deficiency can lead to vascular leakage and altered responses in pathological neovascularization (Niaudet2015Gpr116). These functions highlight ADGRF5's role in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis across different organ systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADGRF5 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In pulmonary health, ADGRF5 plays a crucial role in maintaining pulmonary alveolar homeostasis by regulating surfactant levels. Mutations affecting the cleavage of ADGRF5 can lead to increased surfactant levels and airspace enlargement, which are associated with pulmonary diseases (Morgan2019The). 

In cancer, increased expression of ADGRF5 has been observed in various types, including breast cancer. This overexpression is linked to enhanced RhoA-dependent cell migration and invasion, suggesting a role in cancer progression and metastasis (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion). 

The gene's expression is also noted in kidney physiology, where its absence in ADGRF5/ADGRL4 double knockout mice leads to kidney failure symptoms such as proteinuria and uremia, associated with glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ADGRF5 in various pathological conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its potential as a therapeutic target.
