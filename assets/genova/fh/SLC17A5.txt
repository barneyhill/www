# SLC17A5

## Overview
The SLC17A5 gene encodes the protein sialin, a member of the solute carrier family 17, which functions as a lysosomal transporter. Sialin is primarily involved in the transport of sialic acid across the lysosomal membrane, playing a critical role in cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of free sialic acids within lysosomes. This protein operates as a proton-coupled transporter, utilizing a H+/sialic acid symport mechanism, and is also implicated in nitrate transport in salivary gland cells. Mutations in SLC17A5 are associated with free sialic acid storage diseases, such as infantile sialic acid storage disease and Salla disease, which are characterized by the pathological accumulation of sialic acid due to defective transport (Morin2004Functional; Qin2012Sialin; Huizing2020Inherited).

## Function
The SLC17A5 gene encodes the protein sialin, which functions as a crucial transporter in human cells. Sialin is primarily located in the lysosomal membrane, where it facilitates the export of sialic acid from lysosomes to the cytoplasm. This transport is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of free sialic acids within lysosomes, which can lead to cellular dysfunction (Morin2004Functional).

Sialin operates as a proton-coupled transporter, utilizing a H+/sialic acid symport mechanism. Its activity is dependent on the pH gradient across the lysosomal membrane, with optimal transport occurring at acidic pH levels (Morin2004Functional). This process is vital for the recycling of sialic acids, which are important for cell adhesion, signaling, and immune responses (Morin2004Functional).

In addition to its role in lysosomal sialic acid transport, sialin also functions as a nitrate transporter in the plasma membrane of salivary gland cells. It mediates a 2NO3-/H+ cotransport mechanism, contributing to nitrate uptake and the systemic nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide balance, which is important for vascular health (Qin2012Sialin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC17A5 gene, which encodes the lysosomal transporter protein sialin, lead to a group of disorders known as free sialic acid storage diseases (FSASD). These include infantile sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) and Salla disease, both of which are characterized by the accumulation of free sialic acid in lysosomes due to defective transport (Morin2004Functional; Huizing2020Inherited). ISSD is the more severe form, often resulting in early childhood death, and is associated with symptoms such as severe developmental delays, coarse facial features, and organomegaly (Kleta2003Biochemical; Aula2000The). Salla disease, more prevalent in Finland, presents with milder symptoms including hypotonia, ataxia, and delayed motor development, with patients typically having a near-normal lifespan (Morin2004Functional; Strauss2005Genome‐wide).

The R39C mutation in SLC17A5 is commonly associated with Salla disease and is considered a founder mutation in Finnish populations (Huizing2021Free; Aula2000The). This mutation results in a milder phenotype due to partial retention of sialic acid transport function (Morin2004Functional). Other mutations, such as large deletions and frameshift mutations, are linked to the more severe ISSD (Kleta2003Biochemical; TarailoGraovac2017Identification). There is currently no approved therapy for FSASD, and management is primarily symptomatic and supportive (Huizing2020Inherited).

## Interactions
The SLC17A5 gene encodes the lysosomal transporter protein sialin, which is involved in various interactions that influence its function. Sialin has been shown to interact with a monoclonal antibody, 10B8, which specifically binds to the native form of the protein. This interaction was utilized to facilitate the structural determination of the Sialin-Fab 10B8 complex, providing insights into the protein's conformational states (Schmiege2024Structure).

Sialin also interacts with inhibitors such as Fmoc-Leu-OH, which binds to the cytosol-open cavity of the protein, locking it in this state and preventing substrate access. This interaction involves extensive hydrophobic contacts with residues like Tyr54, Phe179, and Tyr301 (Schmiege2024Structure). Additionally, sialin's interaction with the substrate NAAG involves hydrophilic interactions with residues such as Tyr54 and His414, which are crucial for its transport function (Schmiege2024Structure).

While the context does not provide specific details on multiprotein complexes or interactions with nucleic acids, these interactions highlight sialin's role in lysosomal transport processes and its potential as a target for pharmacological intervention in related diseases.
