# CLIC4

## Overview
CLIC4, or chloride intracellular channel 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family. The CLIC4 protein is characterized by its ability to exist in both soluble and membrane-bound forms, functioning as an ion channel involved in various cellular processes, including ion transport, cell adhesion, and intracellular membrane remodeling (Singh2007CLIC4; Argenzio2014CLIC4). Structurally, CLIC4 features a thioredoxin fold and a GST-like fold, which undergoes conformational changes upon oxidation, facilitating its diverse roles in cellular homeostasis (Littler2005Crystal). The protein is implicated in critical physiological processes such as keratinocyte differentiation, integrin trafficking, and wound healing, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular function and integrity (Suh2007CLIC4; Argenzio2014CLIC4). Additionally, CLIC4's involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic biomarker underscore its clinical significance (Suh2007Reciprocal; Huang2020Aberrant).

## Structure
The CLIC4 protein is a member of the chloride intracellular channels (CLICs) family and is encoded by the CLIC4 gene. It is a 253-residue protein that can exist in both soluble and membrane-bound forms. The primary structure of CLIC4 includes a sequence of amino acids that allows it to autoinsert into membranes, forming an integral membrane protein with ion channel activity (Singh2007CLIC4).

The secondary structure of CLIC4 features a thioredoxin fold in the N-terminal domain, resembling glutaredoxin, and an all α-helical C-terminal domain. The protein also contains a conserved cis proline in the loop between helix 2 and β-strand 3, which is a characteristic feature of thioredoxin fold proteins (Littler2005Crystal).

In terms of tertiary structure, CLIC4 has a GST (glutathione S-transferase) fold, similar to other CLIC proteins, and undergoes conformational changes upon oxidation, which involves the exposure of a hydrophobic surface (Littler2005Crystal).

The quaternary structure of CLIC4 can include a homotrimeric organization, as observed in its wild soluble form, which is stabilized through hydrogen-bond networks and hydrophobic contacts (Li2006Trimeric). CLIC4 also contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) at the C-terminus, which is involved in its translocation to the nucleus under stress conditions (Littler2005Crystal; Suh2004The).

## Function
CLIC4, a member of the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family, plays a multifaceted role in cellular processes. It is involved in ion transport, cell adhesion, integrin trafficking, and keratinocyte differentiation. CLIC4 exists in both soluble and membrane-associated forms, participating in ion channel formation and intracellular membrane remodeling (Argenzio2014CLIC4). In keratinocytes, CLIC4 is crucial for differentiation, particularly in response to calcium signaling, where it influences the expression of differentiation markers and is associated with cell cycle arrest (Suh2007CLIC4). 

CLIC4 is also implicated in cell adhesion and integrin trafficking, where it regulates the internalization and recycling of β1 integrins, crucial for cell-matrix adhesion and motility (Argenzio2014CLIC4). It is recruited to the plasma membrane by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and serum, affecting integrin signaling pathways (Argenzio2014CLIC4). In the context of wound healing and angiogenesis, CLIC4 is essential for processes like cell migration and tubulogenesis, with its absence leading to impaired angiogenesis and wound healing (Littler2010The; Argenzio2014CLIC4). These diverse roles underscore CLIC4's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
CLIC4 (chloride intracellular channel 4) is implicated in the progression of various cancers due to alterations in its expression and localization. In multiple human cancers, CLIC4 expression is reduced in tumor epithelium but increased in tumor stroma, correlating with malignant progression. This differential expression is associated with myofibroblast differentiation and tumor-stromal interactions, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment (Suh2007Reciprocal). In cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML), high CLIC4 expression is linked to adverse outcomes, including higher relapse rates and shorter overall survival. It is associated with fewer NPM1 mutations and more FLT3-ITD mutations, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Huang2020Aberrant).

In malignant pleural mesothelioma, CLIC4 is significantly overexpressed, and its interaction with signaling pathways like TGF-beta suggests a role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, contributing to aggressive tumor phenotypes (Tasiopoulou2015Transcriptional). CLIC4's involvement in TGF-β signaling and its impact on tumor growth have been noted in various cancers, including osteosarcoma, where its reduction inhibits growth and increases apoptosis (Peretti2015Chloride). These findings highlight CLIC4's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
CLIC4, also known as chloride intracellular channel protein 4, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its cellular functions. It directly binds to brain dynamin I, forming a complex that includes actin, tubulin, and 14-3-3 isoforms. This interaction is significant for processes like synaptic vesicle endocytosis and caveolar endocytosis in HEK-293 cells (SUGINTA2001Chloride). CLIC4 also interacts with 14-3-3ζ, with the binding being modulated by Raf peptides, particularly phosphorylated ones (SUGINTA2001Chloride).

In the context of cytokinesis, CLIC4 associates with proteins such as ezrin, anillin, and ALIX. These interactions suggest a role for CLIC4 in anchoring the plasma membrane to the cortical actin network, facilitating successful cell division (Uretmen2019CLIC4). CLIC4's interaction with ezrin is particularly important, as it aids in the translocation of CLIC4 to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (Uretmen2019CLIC4).

CLIC4 is also involved in the endocytotic pathway, interacting with proteins such as ADP Ribosylation Factor 6 (Arf6), GIT1, and clathrin heavy chain, which are key regulators of this pathway (AbdulSalam2019CLIC4Arf6). These interactions highlight CLIC4's role in various cellular processes, including endocytosis and cytokinesis.
