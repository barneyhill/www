# DMXL1

## Overview
DMXL1 is a gene that encodes the Dmx like 1 protein, a member of the WD repeat superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats. These repeats facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing the protein to function as a regulatory or scaffolding component in various cellular processes. The Dmx like 1 protein is particularly involved in the regulation of V-ATPase, a proton pump crucial for maintaining pH homeostasis, especially in specialized proton-secreting cells such as those in the kidney. It is also implicated in neuronal function and development, with expression in ocular tissues suggesting a role in eye health. Mutations in DMXL1 have been associated with several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Merkulova2015Mapping; Davis2011Copy; HerreraRivero2023Evidence).

## Structure
DMXL1 is a large protein characterized by a significant number of WD40 repeats, which are motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions by folding into β-propeller structures composed of several 'blades' of antiparallel β-sheets (Jaskolka2021RAVE). These β-propeller structures are crucial for the protein's regulatory or scaffolding functions. The molecular weight of DMXL1 is similar to that of DMXL2, which is approximately 339 kDa (Jaskolka2021RAVE).

The protein is involved in forming complexes with other proteins, such as the Rabconnectin-3 complex, which includes interactions with WDR7 and potentially affects lysosomal re-acidification through its association with the V-ATPase lysosomal proton pump (Cho2021OpenCell:). Although no direct interaction between DMXL1 and DMXL2 has been detected, they may form separate sub-complexes within the human RAVE-like complex, acting as a chaperone for V-ATPase assembly (Cho2021OpenCell:).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. Additionally, alternative splicing can result in different isoforms, potentially altering its structural and functional properties (Jaskolka2021RAVE). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of DMXL1, as well as its domains, folds, or post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
DMXL1 encodes a protein that is a member of the WD repeat superfamily, known for its regulatory functions in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, DMXL1 is involved in the regulation of V-ATPase function, particularly in kidney cells. It is highly expressed in specialized proton-secreting cells, such as intercalated cells in the kidney, where it plays a crucial role in V-ATPase-dependent vesicle acidification. This process is essential for maintaining pH homeostasis and cellular homeostasis (Merkulova2015Mapping).

DMXL1 contains WD40 protein-protein interaction domains, which are often found in scaffolding proteins. These domains may facilitate interactions with certain subunits of V-ATPase, potentially controlling its assembly or disassembly and regulating its exocytosis through scaffolding to RAB3, a subfamily of small GTPases involved in exocytosis regulation (Merkulova2015Mapping). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with vesicular structures, contributing to neuronal function and development. Its expression in various ocular tissues, including the retina and optic nerve, suggests a role in ocular health and potentially in conditions like glaucoma (Davis2011Copy).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DMXL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, DMXL1 is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the RB1 gene, which has been associated with hereditary retinoblastoma and secondary leiomyosarcoma. This translocation may contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting the normal function of the RB1 gene, although the precise role of the RB1-DMXL1 fusion gene in cancer development is not fully understood (Yagi2023Secondary).

In neurological contexts, DMXL1 has been linked to the regulation of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels, which are biomarkers for neurological conditions. Genetic variants in DMXL1 may influence neuronal repair processes and are associated with pathways related to inflammation, metabolism, and immune processes (HerreraRivero2023Evidence).

DMXL1 also plays a role in the regulation of V-ATPase, a proton pump involved in various physiological processes. Alterations in DMXL1 expression can affect V-ATPase function, which is linked to diseases such as cancer metastasis and other conditions involving proton pump dysfunction (Merkulova2015Mapping). These findings suggest that DMXL1 is a significant factor in both oncological and neurological disorders.
