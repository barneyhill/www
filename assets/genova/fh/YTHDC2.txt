# YTHDC2

## Overview
YTHDC2 is a gene that encodes the YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein C2, a crucial player in RNA metabolism. This protein is characterized by its YTH domain, which specifically recognizes and binds to N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on RNA, a key post-transcriptional modification influencing RNA stability and translation. YTHDC2 functions as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, facilitating the unwinding of RNA structures and promoting efficient translation and mRNA decay. It is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm but also operates within the nucleus, interacting with ribosomal components and mRNA. The protein is notably involved in spermatogenesis, regulating the transition from mitosis to meiosis and ensuring proper germ cell differentiation. Clinically, YTHDC2 is significant in reproductive health, with deficiencies leading to infertility, and in cancer, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis (Kretschmer2018The; Tanabe2016RNA; Wu2024The).

## Structure
The YTHDC2 protein contains a YTH domain located at its C-terminal region, responsible for recognizing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on RNA. This domain comprises residues 1287 to 1426 and features a conserved structural fold shared with other YTH domains. It consists of four alpha-helices and four beta-strands, forming a beta-barrel surrounded by helices, which creates a hydrophobic core. The m6A binding pocket is formed by alpha-helices and coils, including an aromatic cage composed of tryptophan and leucine residues, and involves specific amino acids like Ser 1311, Asn 1300, and Ser 1296 for m6A recognition (Ma2019Crystal).

The YTHDC2 protein also includes a helicase domain for unwinding RNA and an ankyrin repeat domain for protein-protein interactions, contributing to its complex tertiary structure. The YTH domain of YTHDC2 shares approximately 20% sequence identity with other human YTH domains but maintains a conserved 3D architecture (Ma2019Crystal). The structural data for the YTH domain have been determined using both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, providing insights into its role in RNA metabolism (He20201H). The protein's structure is evolutionarily conserved, with about 55% sequence similarity from yeast to humans (Ma2019Crystal).

## Function
YTHDC2 is a protein that plays a significant role in RNA metabolism by recognizing and binding to N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on RNA. It is involved in promoting translation efficiency and mRNA decay, acting as a crucial regulator of gene expression in healthy human cells. YTHDC2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but is also found in the nucleus, where it interacts with ribosomal components and mRNA to facilitate translation (Kretschmer2018The).

The protein exhibits ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity, which is essential for resolving mRNA secondary structures, particularly in coding sequences that are methylated. This activity is crucial for efficient translation, as demonstrated by the significant reduction in protein synthesis observed when YTHDC2 is knocked down in human cells (Mao2019m6A). YTHDC2 also interacts with the 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1, promoting mRNA turnover and coordinating translation and decay processes (Kretschmer2018The).

In addition to its role in translation, YTHDC2 is highly expressed in the testes and is critical for spermatogenesis, influencing the development and maturation of germ cells. It regulates the transition from mitosis to meiosis, maintaining the meiotic transcriptome and ensuring proper germ cell differentiation (Wu2024The; Bailey2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the YTHDC2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in reproductive health and cancer. In the context of reproductive health, YTHDC2 is crucial for germ cell development and meiosis. Deficiencies in YTHDC2 can lead to infertility in both males and females. In males, the absence of YTHDC2 results in impaired spermatogenesis, characterized by smaller testes and a lack of spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules, leading to infertility (Hsu2017Ythdc2; Wojtas2017Regulation). In females, YTHDC2 deficiency causes ovarian atrophy and failure to progress beyond immature follicle stages, resulting in infertility (Wu2024The; Wojtas2017Regulation).

In cancer, YTHDC2 has been implicated in metastasis and tumor progression. It enhances the translation efficiency of HIF-1α mRNA, a factor crucial for cancer cell motility and metastasis, particularly in colon cancer (Tanabe2016RNA). Alterations in YTHDC2 expression are associated with various cancers, including colon adenocarcinoma, where its knockdown reduces metastatic potential (Tanabe2016RNA). Additionally, YTHDC2 expression levels correlate with tumor stage and lymph node metastasis, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Tanabe2016RNA).

## Interactions
YTHDC2 is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism. It binds to m6A-modified RNAs through its YTH domain, which has a higher affinity for m6A-containing RNAs compared to unmodified RNAs (Kretschmer2018The). YTHDC2 also contains ankyrin repeat domains that mediate protein-protein interactions, notably with the 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1. This interaction is RNA-independent and persists even after RNase treatment, indicating a strong and specific association (Kretschmer2018The).

YTHDC2 is involved in translation and mRNA stability, interacting with proteins such as UPF1 and MOV10, which are part of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. This suggests that YTHDC2 may recruit decay machineries to accelerate mRNA degradation (Hsu2017Ythdc2). It also interacts with the meiosis-specific protein MEIOC, which stabilizes transcripts during meiosis prophase I (Hsu2017Ythdc2).

In the context of spermatogenesis, YTHDC2 binds to germ granule components MIWI and MSY2, which are involved in stabilizing and storing spermiogenic mRNAs (Bailey2017The). These interactions highlight YTHDC2's role in regulating translation and RNA processing, particularly in germ cell development.
