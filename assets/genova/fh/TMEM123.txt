# TMEM123

## Overview
TMEM123 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 123, a type I transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and apoptosis. This protein is primarily located in the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in modulating cell surface receptor activities, which are essential for cell communication and survival. TMEM123's involvement in these processes suggests its significant role in regulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein's function in apoptosis highlights its potential contribution to programmed cell death, a critical mechanism for eliminating damaged or unnecessary cells. TMEM123 is also known as Porimin and is implicated in immune surveillance, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer, where it influences T cell adhesion and migration. Its expression and interactions suggest its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in cancer treatment (Pesce2023TMEM123).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM123, or transmembrane protein 123, is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and apoptosis. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane, where it is involved in the modulation of cell surface receptor activities. This modulation is crucial for influencing cell communication and survival, suggesting that TMEM123 may have a role in regulating immune responses. By affecting receptor activities, TMEM123 contributes to the regulation of cellular interactions and signaling pathways that are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to external stimuli. The protein's involvement in apoptosis indicates its potential role in programmed cell death, a vital process for removing damaged or unnecessary cells, thereby contributing to tissue homeostasis and organismal health. The precise mechanisms by which TMEM123 influences these processes are still under investigation, but its presence in the plasma membrane and involvement in receptor modulation highlight its importance in cellular communication and immune regulation.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM123, also known as Porimin or KCT-3, plays a significant role in the immune surveillance of colorectal cancer (CRC). Alterations in its expression are linked to various clinical outcomes in CRC. TMEM123 is over-expressed in tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, contributing to their effector phenotype and is associated with improved overall and metastasis-free survival in CRC patients (Pesce2023TMEM123). Its expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes correlates with better survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in CRC (Pesce2023TMEM123).

TMEM123 is involved in T cell adhesion, migration, and cytoskeleton organization, which are crucial for effective immune responses against cancer cells. Silencing TMEM123 impairs T cell migration and adhesion, affecting their ability to interact with and destroy cancer cells (Pesce2023TMEM123). This impairment is linked to reduced actin filament formation and altered signaling pathways, which are essential for T cell motility and function (Pesce2023TMEM123).

The gene's role in enhancing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and its association with better clinical outcomes highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in CRC, aiming to boost immune surveillance and anti-tumor immunity (Pesce2023TMEM123).

## Interactions
TMEM123, also known as Porimin, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its role in immune surveillance, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer. TMEM123 interacts with proteins involved in cell motility, such as Ezrin and LFA-1, which are important for T cell adhesion and migration. These interactions influence the phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), a key regulator of cell morphology and motility (Pesce2023TMEM123). TMEM123 is also associated with the actin cytoskeleton, and its silencing affects the Rac1/Cdc42 signaling pathway, impacting the WAVE2 and Arp2/3 complex, which are crucial for lamellipodia formation during cell migration (Pesce2023TMEM123).

In addition to its role in cell motility, TMEM123 is co-expressed with several proteins involved in T cell adhesion and migration, such as ICAM-1, CD62L, CD11a, and CD44. This co-expression correlates with the production of effector cytokines like IFNg and TNFa in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Pesce2023TMEM123). TMEM123's interactions and expression patterns suggest its involvement in the immune response and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer.
