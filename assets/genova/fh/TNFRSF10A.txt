# TNFRSF10A

## Overview
TNFRSF10A is a gene that encodes the protein TNF receptor superfamily member 10a, also known as TRAIL receptor 1 or DR4. This protein is a transmembrane receptor that plays a crucial role in mediating apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammatory pathways. It is characterized by an extracellular domain rich in cysteine motifs, a single transmembrane helix, and an intracellular death domain, which are essential for its function in binding the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and initiating apoptotic signaling cascades (Minchenko2016The; Passarelli2020Tumor). TNFRSF10A is involved in the regulation of immune responses and cellular homeostasis, with significant expression in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues, where it helps balance cell proliferation and death (Passarelli2020Tumor). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions, and its potential as a biomarker for disease susceptibility and treatment response (Wolf2005Ala228; Farkas2022Dysregulation).

## Structure
The TNFRSF10A gene encodes a protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, also known as TRAIL receptor 1 or DR4. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane structure, which includes an extracellular domain rich in cysteine motifs, a single transmembrane helix, and an intracellular death domain. The cysteine-rich extracellular domain is crucial for binding to the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), facilitating the receptor's role in apoptosis (Minchenko2016The; Passarelli2020Tumor).

The extracellular domain of TNFRSF10A is involved in ligand binding and is essential for the receptor's function in mediating downstream signaling pathways. This domain's structure is important for ligand-receptor interactions, which are critical for apoptosis-related functions and potentially affect cell regeneration (Passarelli2020Tumor). The intracellular death domain is responsible for recruiting adaptor proteins like FADD, which are necessary for the activation of caspases, leading to apoptosis (Farkas2022Dysregulation).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may influence the receptor's function, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. Alternative splicing of TNFRSF10A can result in different isoforms, potentially altering the composition of the extracellular domain (Wiens2011Origin).

## Function
The TNFRSF10A gene encodes a cell surface receptor protein that is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, commonly referred to as TRAIL receptor 1 or DR4. This receptor is primarily involved in apoptotic, necroptotic, and inflammatory pathways. It functions as a receptor for the cytokine TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in death receptor signaling pathways. Upon binding with TRAIL, TNFRSF10A activates its cytoplasmic death domain, which recruits the adapter molecule FADD. This recruitment is essential for the activation of caspase 8 (CASP8) and caspase 10 (CASP10), leading to apoptosis through direct cleavage of caspase 3 (CASP3) or via the cleavage of the BID protein, which stimulates cytochrome C release from the mitochondria (Farkas2022Dysregulation).

TNFRSF10A also plays a role in the activation of NFκβ inflammatory signaling pathways, contributing to the regulation of immune responses and cellular homeostasis (Farkas2022Dysregulation). In healthy cells, TNFRSF10A modulates apoptosis and inflammation, processes critical for maintaining cellular balance. It is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it helps balance cell proliferation and death, suppressing inflammation and metastasis (Passarelli2020Tumor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNFRSF10A gene, also known as TRAIL receptor 1, have been implicated in various diseases. Dysregulation of TNFRSF10A is associated with increased susceptibility to apoptosis, contributing to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and cancer (Farkas2022Dysregulation). In cancer, allelic loss of chromosome 8p21-22, where TNFRSF10A is located, is common in several types, including mantle cell lymphoma, prostate cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Wolf2005Ala228). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFRSF10A, such as A683C, have been linked to a higher prevalence in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other cancers (Wolf2005Ala228).

In the context of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), TNFRSF10A SNPs have been associated with variable responses to corticosteroid therapy, suggesting a role in modulating treatment outcomes (Passarelli2020Tumor). Additionally, the C allele of the TNFRSF10A rs20575 polymorphism has been identified as a risk factor for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection, indicating its influence on the persistence of the infection (Hassan2022Genetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TNFRSF10A in various diseases and its potential as a biomarker for disease susceptibility and treatment response.

## Interactions
TNFRSF10A, also known as TRAIL-R1, is a death receptor that interacts with the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) to initiate apoptosis. This interaction leads to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which includes adaptor proteins such as Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and pro-caspase-8, ultimately activating caspase-8 and triggering apoptotic pathways (Dai2015Targeting; Minchenko2016The).

TNFRSF10A is involved in protein-protein interactions within the apoptosis signaling pathway. It interacts with FADD and TNF, with high interaction confidence scores, as part of a network of apoptosis-regulated genes (ADINEW2023The). The protein-protein interaction network constructed using Cystoscope and STRING revealed that TNFRSF10A is a significant node, interacting with other apoptosis-related genes (ADINEW2023The).

In the context of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), TNFRSF10A interacts with corticosteroids (CS) through a cross-talk between TNF and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling. This interaction is thought to modulate the balance between cell degeneration and regeneration, influencing the response to CS therapy (Passarelli2020Tumor). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFRSF10A may alter its interaction with TRAIL, affecting its apoptotic signaling capabilities (Passarelli2020Tumor).
