# ENTREP1

## Overview
ENTREP1 is a gene that encodes the protein endosomal transmembrane epsin interactor 1, which is integral to cellular processes such as endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily active in endosomal membranes, where it plays a pivotal role in the sorting and transport of cellular cargo. By interacting with epsin, endosomal transmembrane epsin interactor 1 facilitates the internalization and desensitization of receptors, such as the chemokine receptor CXCR4, thereby influencing signal transduction pathways and cellular homeostasis. The proper functioning of ENTREP1 is essential for immune cell trafficking and response to external stimuli, and its dysregulation may have significant implications in various disease mechanisms (Zhang2023A; Palma2024Unveiling).

## Function
ENTREP1, also known as endosomal transmembrane epsin interactor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. This protein is active in endosomal membranes, where it interacts with epsin to facilitate the sorting and transport of cargo within cells. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating signal transduction pathways. ENTREP1 plays a significant role in the regulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by triggering its endocytosis, which is a key mechanism in the desensitization and internalization of this receptor (Zhang2023A; Palma2024Unveiling). The regulation of CXCR4 is important for various cellular processes, including immune cell trafficking and response to external signals. ENTREP1's involvement in these pathways highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in disease mechanisms when dysregulated.
