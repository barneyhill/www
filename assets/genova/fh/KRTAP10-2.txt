# KRTAP10-2

## Overview
KRTAP10-2 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 10-2, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and wool fiber structure, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the hair shaft. The KAP family is characterized by their high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers. The keratin-associated protein 10-2, specifically, is involved in the complex network of interactions with keratin intermediate filaments, which are essential for the structural integrity of hair (Qiu2020aarFDC).
