# NCAPH

## Overview
NCAPH is a gene that encodes the non-SMC condensin I complex subunit H, a crucial component of the condensin I complex involved in chromosome condensation during mitosis. This protein is categorized as a structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein, playing a pivotal role in ensuring proper chromosomal architecture and segregation. The NCAPH protein contains coiled-coil domains that facilitate interactions with other subunits of the condensin I complex, such as SMC2 and SMC4, which are essential for its function in chromosomal dynamics. Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, regulate its activity during the cell cycle, particularly in mitosis. The gene also produces splice variant isoforms, adding a layer of regulatory complexity to its function. NCAPH's involvement extends beyond mitosis, as it is implicated in chromatin organization during interphase and has been associated with various cancers and genetic conditions, such as microcephaly, due to its role in maintaining genomic stability (Wang2020HPV; Cui2019Overexpression; Martin2016Mutations).

## Structure
NCAPH, a component of the condensin I complex, plays a critical role in chromosome condensation during mitosis. The protein structure of NCAPH includes coiled-coil domains, which are essential for facilitating protein-protein interactions within the complex. These domains contribute to the stability and function of the condensin I complex by enabling the necessary interactions between its subunits.

NCAPH may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function in chromosomal dynamics. These modifications are crucial for regulating the activity of NCAPH during the cell cycle, particularly in mitosis, where precise control of chromosome condensation is required.

The gene encoding NCAPH also produces splice variant isoforms. These isoforms can lead to variations in the protein's role in chromosomal dynamics, potentially affecting its interaction with other proteins and its overall function within the condensin I complex. The presence of these isoforms suggests a level of regulatory complexity, allowing the cell to fine-tune the activity of NCAPH in response to different cellular conditions.

## Function
The NCAPH gene encodes a subunit of the condensin I complex, which is essential for chromosome condensation and stabilization during mitosis. In healthy human cells, NCAPH plays a critical role in the lateral compaction of metaphase chromosomes following the breakdown of the nuclear envelope. This process is vital for the proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division, as it assists topoisomerase II in resolving entangled sister chromatids, thereby preventing errors that could lead to conditions such as microcephaly (Martin2016Mutations).

NCAPH is involved in maintaining chromosome structural integrity during mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome condensation and segregation. This function is crucial for preventing chromosome segregation errors and maintaining genomic stability, which is essential for normal cell proliferation and brain development (Martin2016Mutations). The protein is active in the nucleus, particularly during the mitotic phase, where it contributes to the structural maintenance of chromosomes (Cui2019Overexpression).

In addition to its role in mitosis, NCAPH is also associated with chromatin organization during interphase, suggesting potential roles beyond mitotic chromosome condensation. It localizes to the nucleoli, indicating involvement in nucleolar functions and possibly in chromatin remodeling (Cabello2001Cell).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NCAPH gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, particularly various types of cancer. In endometrial cancer, NCAPH is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced clinicopathologic features such as advanced FIGO stage and significant myometrial invasion (Qiu2020NCAPH). In prostate cancer, NCAPH overexpression is linked to poor prognosis, with higher expression levels associated with lower overall survival rates (Cui2019Overexpression).

NCAPH is also implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its expression is associated with better overall survival rates. However, it shows a negative association with Mcl-1, a protein linked to poorer outcomes, suggesting distinct prognostic roles (Xiong2020NCAPH). In NSCLC, the miR-133b/NCAPH axis plays a significant role in cancer progression by affecting cancer stem cell maintenance and Wnt signaling pathway activity (Xiong2021miR133b).

Beyond cancer, mutations in NCAPH are linked to microcephaly, a condition characterized by reduced brain size. These mutations disrupt chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to chromatin bridges and aneuploidy, which impair cell proliferation and survival during neurogenesis (Martin2016Mutations).

## Interactions
NCAPH, a component of the condensin I complex, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in chromosome condensation and stabilization during mitosis. It interacts with other subunits of the condensin I complex, such as SMC2 and SMC4, facilitating chromosomal architecture and segregation (Cui2019Overexpression). 

In cervical cancer, NCAPH interacts with the HPV E7 protein, enhancing E7 expression by promoting the binding of E2F1 to the NCAPH gene promoter. This interaction suggests a feedback loop where E7 upregulates NCAPH, which in turn modulates E7 transcription (Wang2020HPV). NCAPH also interacts with the AP-1 transcription factor, converting it from a c-Fos/c-Jun to a Fra-1/c-Jun dimer, affecting E7 transcription (Wang2020HPV).

NCAPH is ubiquitinated by TRIM21, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. This interaction is significant in regulating autophagy and cell proliferation in cervical cancer cells (Wang2024NCAPH). The ubiquitination occurs at the K11 lysine residue, and TRIM21 binds to NCAPH through its PRY/SPRY and CC domains (Wang2024NCAPH). These interactions highlight NCAPH's role in cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression.
