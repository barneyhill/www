# MERTK

## Overview
The MERTK gene encodes the MER proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the TAM family, which also includes AXL and TYRO3. This protein is characterized by its single-pass transmembrane structure and plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including efferocytosis, the clearance of apoptotic cells, and the maintenance of retinal health. MERTK is crucial for the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments in retinal pigment epithelial cells, a process essential for visual function. Mutations in the MERTK gene are linked to retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease, highlighting its clinical significance. The protein's interactions with ligands such as GAS6 and Protein S, as well as its involvement in signaling pathways, underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and immune regulation (Seitz2007Macrophages; Audo2018MERTK; Nishi2019MERTK).

## Structure
The MERTK gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of the TAM family, characterized by a single-pass transmembrane structure. The primary structure of MERTK consists of 999 amino acids (Strick2010Focus). The protein's extracellular region includes two immunoglobulin-like-C2 (IgG-C2) domains and two fibronectin type III (FN-III) domains, which are crucial for ligand binding, such as Gas6 and Protein S (ProS) (Strick2010Focus). The intracellular region contains a highly conserved tyrosine kinase domain, essential for its catalytic activity (Strick2010Focus).

The secondary structure of MERTK features a canonical protein kinase fold, with beta-stranded amino-terminal and alpha-helical carboxy-terminal lobes (Huang2009Structural). The tertiary structure includes a DFG-Asp motif in the 'in' position, indicating a catalytically competent state, and a magnesium ion coordinated with phosphoryl oxygens and water molecules (Huang2009Structural). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is common among receptor tyrosine kinases.

Post-translational modifications of MERTK include phosphorylation, which is critical for its activation and function (Huang2009Structural). Mutations in MERTK, such as the R844C variant, can lead to structural destabilization and are associated with diseases like retinitis pigmentosa (Huang2009Structural).

## Function
The MERTK gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of the TAM family, which also includes AXL and TYRO3. In healthy human cells, MERTK plays a crucial role in efferocytosis, the process by which apoptotic cells are engulfed and cleared by phagocytes such as macrophages. This process is essential for preventing secondary necrosis and subsequent immune activation (Nishi2019MERTK). MERTK is involved in the phosphorylation of several signaling molecules, including ERK, AKT, FAK, and STAT6, which are crucial for efferocytosis (Nishi2019MERTK).

In retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, MERTK regulates the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, a process vital for maintaining a normal visual cycle. MERTK is activated by ITGAV receptors, which are necessary for the clearance of these segments (Albert2015Triamcinolone). In the context of bone homeostasis, MERTK negatively regulates bone remodeling by inhibiting osteoblastic bone formation, affecting osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization through the PROS1-MERTK axis (Engelmann2022Regulation).

MERTK is also involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells in various tissues, maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing autoimmune phenotypes (Seitz2007Macrophages). Its activity is crucial in macrophages and retinal cells, contributing to processes like efferocytosis and retinal health (Seitz2007Macrophages).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MERTK gene are associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative retinal disease characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors, leading to night blindness, visual field constriction, and central vision loss. MERTK-related RP is autosomal recessive and accounts for approximately 2% of RP cases (Audo2018MERTK; Jespersgaard2020BiAllelic). Pathogenic variants in MERTK often result in a severe RP phenotype with early onset, frequently leading to blindness (Jespersgaard2020BiAllelic). More than 90 disease-causing variants in MERTK have been reported, including deletions, missense, nonsense, and splicing variants (Jespersgaard2020BiAllelic). 

Alterations in MERTK expression levels have also been implicated in other conditions. For instance, increased expression of MERTK is associated with a unique form of canine retinopathy, suggesting that regulatory mutations outside the coding region may lead to overexpression and subsequent retinal degeneration (Ahonen2014Increased). In humans, MERTK mutations lead to impaired phagocytosis in retinal pigment epithelial cells, contributing to the pathology of retinitis pigmentosa by reducing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Tagawa2021Deterioration). These findings underscore the critical role of MERTK in maintaining retinal health and its involvement in retinal degenerative diseases.

## Interactions
MERTK, a receptor tyrosine kinase, participates in several interactions crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with ligands such as GAS6 and Protein S, which are essential for its activation and function in phagocytosis and cell survival (Seitz2007Macrophages; Thorp2011Shedding). MERTK also binds to Tubby and tubby-like protein 1 (Tulp1), which act as bridging molecules facilitating phagocytosis by binding to apoptotic cells and MERTK (Caberoy2010Tubby). 

MERTK interacts with integrins, particularly αvβ5 integrin, to enhance the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. This interaction involves the cooperation of MERTK with αvβ5 integrin in signaling pathways that include the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and p130 CAS, which are crucial for cytoskeletal reorganization and engulfment (Wu2005A). 

Additionally, MERTK is involved in intracellular signaling pathways, associating with proteins such as Vav1 and PI3K, which are important for the activation of downstream signaling cascades like MAPK, Erk, and NF-kB, influencing cell survival and proliferation (Seitz2007Macrophages).
