# RAP1B

## Overview
RAP1B is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. The RAP1B protein plays a crucial role in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those involved in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. As a GTPase, RAP1B functions by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, thereby regulating various cellular processes. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it influences cell polarity and tissue organization. The protein is also involved in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation (Zhang2019Function; YANG2015Expression). Through its interactions with other proteins, such as talin and SmgGDS-607, RAP1B plays a significant role in integrin activation and platelet function, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis (Ntantie2013An; Zhu2017Structure).

## Structure
RAP1B is a small GTPase that is part of the RAS oncogene family, playing a significant role in intracellular signaling. The primary structure of RAP1B consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes a GTP-binding domain crucial for its function (Zemojtel2010Retrotransposition). The secondary structure of RAP1B features alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of the Ras family GTPase fold (Zhu2017Structure). 

The tertiary structure of RAP1B is a compact, globular form that facilitates its interactions with other proteins, such as talin, which is essential for integrin activation (Zhu2017Structure). This interaction is characterized by a unique hydrophobic core and charge-charge interactions at the interface, which are critical for its function (Zhu2017Structure). 

RAP1B undergoes post-translational modifications, including prenylation, which is vital for its membrane localization and function (Wilson2016Differences). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its interaction with other proteins and its role in signaling pathways (Araya2024Differential). These structural features and modifications enable RAP1B to participate effectively in cellular signaling processes.

## Function
RAP1B, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, plays a significant role in various cellular processes by cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. In healthy human cells, RAP1B is involved in endothelial cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and capillary tube formation, which are crucial for maintaining vascular integrity and function (YANG2015Expression). It also acts as a key suppressor of neutrophil migration and lung inflammation, highlighting its role in immune response regulation (YANG2015Expression).

RAP1B is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it influences cell adhesion and cell junction formation, contributing to cell polarity and tissue organization. Its activity is essential for maintaining cell-cell contacts, and its signaling at the plasma membrane is crucial for these processes (Zhang2019Function). The protein is also involved in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and differentiation (Zhang2019Function).

Overall, RAP1B's functions in healthy cells are integral to maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, which are vital for normal physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RAP1B gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, RAP1B expression is associated with tumor progression and prognosis. High RAP1B expression correlates with poor overall survival and disease-specific survival in several cancers, including adrenocortical carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and mesothelioma. It is also linked to immune cell infiltration and resistance to certain anticancer drugs, suggesting a role in chemotherapy resistance and the tumor microenvironment (Cui2021Prognostic).

In syndromic thrombocytopenia, novel de novo heterozygous variants in RAP1B, such as c.35G>T p.(Gly12Val) and c.178G>C p.(Gly60Arg), have been identified. These variants are associated with congenital malformations, learning difficulties, and dysmorphic features, potentially through a gain of function mechanism (Niemann2020De).

RAP1B retrogenes, such as hRap1B-retro, have mutations that resemble those found in oncogenic Ras proteins, potentially contributing to diseases like myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemia. These retrogenes exhibit increased integrin-mediated cell adhesion, which may influence disease development (Zemojtel2010Retrotransposition).

## Interactions
RAP1B, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the protein talin, which is essential for integrin activation. RAP1B binds to the F0 domain of talin in a GTP-dependent manner, facilitating the recruitment of talin to the plasma membrane, a critical step for integrin activation and cell adhesion (Zhu2017Structure). This interaction is weak under conventional conditions but is significantly enhanced when RAP1B is membrane-anchored, highlighting the importance of specific microenvironments in protein-protein interactions (Zhu2017Structure).

RAP1B also interacts with SmgGDS-607, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which is involved in its prenylation process. Phosphorylation of RAP1B by protein kinase A (PKA) reduces its interaction with SmgGDS-607, affecting its localization and function (Ntantie2013An). Additionally, RAP1B is involved in the regulation of platelet function through its interaction with vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and the adapter protein Crkl, which are important for the activation of integrin αIIbβ3 in platelets (Benz2016VasodilatorStimulated). These interactions underscore RAP1B's role in integrin signaling and cell adhesion.
