# LCN10

## Overview
LCN10 is a gene that encodes the protein lipocalin 10, which is part of the lipocalin family, a group of small secreted proteins known for their ability to bind and transport small hydrophobic molecules. Lipocalin 10 is implicated in various biological processes, particularly in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses. It interacts with the nuclear receptor Nr4a1, playing a crucial role in modulating the anti-inflammatory state of macrophages. This interaction is significant in the context of diseases such as diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy, where the loss of LCN10 exacerbates inflammatory responses (Li2022Loss). Additionally, alterations in LCN10 expression have been associated with cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wang2024Decoding; Li2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCN10 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy, the loss of LCN10 exacerbates the condition by disrupting the Nr4a1-mediated anti-inflammatory response in macrophages. This disruption leads to increased inflammation and cardiac dysfunction, as LCN10 deficiency promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype, contributing to worsened cardiac outcomes in diabetic conditions (Li2022Loss).

LCN10 expression is also notably downregulated in right ventricular tissues of patients with heart failure and in cardiac tissue from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting its potential role in cardiovascular diseases (Li2022Loss). In cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), LCN10 is significantly underexpressed compared to normal samples, and its expression positively correlates with overall survival in CESC patients, indicating its involvement in immune responses and potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Wang2024Decoding).

Additionally, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with SF3B1 mutations, the promoter region of LCN10 is affected by hypomethylation, which may influence its expression and contribute to disease progression (Pacholewska2021Altered). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LCN10 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
LCN10, or lipocalin 10, is implicated in interactions with the nuclear receptor Nr4a1, particularly in the context of macrophage function and inflammation regulation. The loss of LCN10 disrupts the Nr4a1-mediated anti-inflammatory response in macrophages, suggesting a functional interaction between these proteins. LCN10 may act as a chaperone protein, facilitating the nuclear translocation of Nr4a1 in macrophages. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the anti-inflammatory state of macrophages, and its disruption can exacerbate conditions such as diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy (Li2022Loss).

To explore the physical interaction between LCN10 and Nr4a1, researchers propose using Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. These assays involve transfecting HEK 293T cells with plasmids encoding Flag-conjugated LCN10 and GFP-conjugated Nr4a1, followed by Co-IP and SDS-PAGE analysis to detect interactions. Immunofluorescence staining is also planned to assess the colocalization of LCN10 and Nr4a1 in macrophages, which would further support the hypothesis that LCN10 enhances the nuclear translocation of Nr4a1 (Li2022Loss).

While specific protein-protein interactions involving LCN10 are not extensively detailed, its role in modulating inflammatory pathways through interaction with Nr4a1 highlights its significance in cellular processes related to inflammation and immune response (Li2022Loss).
