# ADCK5

## Overview
ADCK5, or aarF domain containing kinase 5, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the kinase family, specifically characterized by the presence of an aarF domain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation. As a kinase, ADCK5 plays a crucial role in phosphorylating target proteins, thereby modulating their activity and function. The protein's involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway highlights its significance in cellular regulation and potential implications in disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
