# ZC3H3

## Overview
ZC3H3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type containing 3 protein, which is integral to RNA processing and nuclear RNA decay. The protein is characterized by its CCCH-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate RNA binding and interaction with various components of the mRNA nuclear export and polyadenylation machineries (Liang2008GenomeWide; Hurt2009A). As a component of the PAXT (Poly(A) Tail eXosome Targeting) complex, ZC3H3 plays a crucial role in the turnover of nuclear polyadenylated RNA, thereby maintaining RNA homeostasis in human cells (Silla2020The). The protein's interactions with MTR4 and ZFC3H1, among others, underscore its function as a nuclear exosome co-factor, essential for the degradation of nuclear polyadenylated RNA (Silla2020The). Dysregulation of ZC3H3 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in mRNA processing and export (Kurokawa2024Identification; Chen2020Molecular).

## Structure
The ZC3H3 protein is characterized by the presence of CCCH-type zinc finger motifs, which are involved in RNA binding (Liang2008GenomeWide). These motifs typically consist of three cysteines and one histidine, forming a conserved structure across species (Liang2008GenomeWide). The protein's C-terminal region is crucial for its function in mRNA nuclear export, as it interacts with various factors involved in RNA metabolism (Hurt2009A). 

ZC3H3 interacts with components of the mRNA nuclear export and polyadenylation machineries, suggesting it acts as an interface between these processes (Hurt2009A). The protein is also associated with the PAXT complex, interacting with components such as MTR4 and ZFC3H1, which are involved in nuclear RNA decay (Silla2020The). These interactions are partly RNA-dependent, indicating a role in RNA binding and processing (Silla2020The).

The protein's structure may include post-translational modifications, although specific details are not provided in the context. The presence of splice variants or isoforms is not mentioned, suggesting that further research may be needed to fully elucidate these aspects. Overall, ZC3H3 plays a significant role in RNA processing and export, facilitated by its structural features and interactions.

## Function
The ZC3H3 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in nuclear RNA decay, particularly through its involvement in the PAXT (Poly(A) Tail eXosome Targeting) complex. This complex is essential for the recruitment of the RNA exosome to nuclear polyadenylated RNA, facilitating RNA turnover and maintaining RNA homeostasis in human cells (Silla2020The). ZC3H3 interacts directly with the MTR4-ZFC3H1 dimer, a core component of the PAXT connection, and is crucial for the degradation of nuclear polyadenylated RNA, a key step in gene expression regulation (Silla2020The).

In the context of RNA decay, ZC3H3 is involved in the turnover of polyadenylated (pA+) RNA in the nucleus, targeting longer and more processed RNAs for exosomal decay (Silla2020The). The protein's interaction with ZFC3H1 is RNA-independent, placing it in close proximity to RNA decay processes (Silla2020The). Depletion of ZC3H3 leads to the accumulation of PAXT substrates and the formation of nuclear pA+ RNA foci, indicating its critical role in RNA metabolism (Silla2020The).

ZC3H3, along with RBM26 and RBM27, impacts the levels of certain PAXT targets, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and other transcripts, highlighting its role as a nuclear exosome co-factor (Silla2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and methylation of the ZC3H3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZC3H3 is found to be hypermethylated and its expression levels are significantly increased, suggesting a role in the progression of liver fibrosis to HCC (Kurokawa2024Identification). This gene's dysregulation is also associated with cervical cancer, where it is involved in m6A RNA methylation regulation. ZC3H3 shows higher mutation frequencies and extensive deep deletions in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, which are linked to lower expression levels and may contribute to tumor progression (Chen2020Molecular).

ZC3H3 is crucial for mRNA processing, specifically in nuclear adenylation and export. Depletion of ZC3H3 disrupts mRNA export, leading to the retention of polyadenylated RNA in the nucleus, which can affect cellular function and contribute to disease states (Hurt2009A). While specific diseases directly caused by ZC3H3 mutations are not detailed, its role in mRNA processing and export suggests that its dysregulation could have widespread implications for cellular homeostasis and disease development (Hurt2009A).

## Interactions
ZC3H3 is a human protein that plays a significant role in nuclear RNA decay and mRNA processing through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is a critical component of the PAXT (Poly(A) Tail eXosome Targeting) complex, where it interacts with core components such as MTR4 and ZFC3H1. These interactions are crucial for the turnover of polyadenylated (pA+) RNA in mammalian nuclei, with ZC3H3 forming part of a complex that facilitates RNA decay (Silla2020The).

ZC3H3 also interacts with PABPN1 in an RNA-dependent manner, as this interaction is disrupted by RNase treatment. In contrast, its interactions with MTR4 and ZFC3H1 are less affected by such treatments, indicating a more stable association (Silla2020The). The protein is involved in the formation of nuclear pA+ RNA foci, which are enriched for ZFC3H1 and PABPN1, suggesting a role in RNA aggregation and processing (Silla2020The).

In the context of mRNA export, ZC3H3 interacts with export factors such as NXF1 and PABP2, indicating its involvement in mRNA biogenesis and export processes. These interactions suggest that ZC3H3 may function in releasing adenylated transcripts from processing centers for export (Hurt2009A).
