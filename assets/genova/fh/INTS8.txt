# INTS8

## Overview
The INTS8 gene encodes the protein integrator complex subunit 8, which is a critical component of the Integrator complex. This complex is associated with RNA polymerase II and plays a pivotal role in the processing and regulation of RNA, particularly in the co-transcriptional 3'-end processing of U-rich small nuclear RNAs (UsnRNAs) (Oegema2017Human). The integrator complex subunit 8 is essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the Integrator complex, thereby ensuring proper RNA processing and gene expression regulation. It is involved in various cellular processes, including promoter-proximal pausing and enhancer RNA processing, which are crucial for gene expression regulation (Oegema2017Human). The protein's interactions with other subunits and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) highlight its role in transcriptional repression and RNA polymerase II activity regulation (Huang2020Integrator). Dysregulation of INTS8 has been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular and developmental homeostasis (Oegema2017Human; Zhou2021INTS8).

## Function
The INTS8 gene encodes a crucial component of the Integrator complex, which is associated with RNA polymerase II and plays a significant role in RNA processing and transcription regulation in healthy human cells. This complex is involved in the co-transcriptional 3'-end processing of U-rich small nuclear RNAs (UsnRNAs), which are essential components of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for splicing pre-mRNA into mature mRNA (Oegema2017Human). INTS8 is vital for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the Integrator complex, ensuring proper processing of snRNA and regulation of genes critical for neuronal differentiation and brain development (Oegema2017Human).

INTS8 also plays a role in promoter-proximal pausing and the processing of enhancer RNAs, which are important for gene expression regulation. Mutations in INTS8 can lead to increased misprocessing of UsnRNA, altered splicing patterns, and disruptions in gene expression, highlighting its importance in maintaining transcriptome integrity (Oegema2017Human). The gene's expression peaks in the developing fetal brain, indicating its specific role in brain development (Oegema2017Human). Overall, INTS8 is essential for the stability and function of the Integrator complex, impacting RNA processing and gene expression regulation in healthy human cells (Oegema2017Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the INTS8 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), a rare and aggressive liver cancer, INTS8 is overexpressed and associated with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival and disease-free intervals. This suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in CHOL (Zhou2021INTS8). INTS8 is also overexpressed in various other cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via the TGF-Î² signaling pathway, contributing to cancer metastasis (INTS8; Tong2019&lt; p&gt).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, biallelic mutations in INTS8 are linked to severe syndromes characterized by intellectual disability, motor impairment, and brain malformations like periventricular nodular heterotopia and cerebellar hypoplasia. These mutations disrupt the stability of the Integrator complex, leading to widespread transcriptional and splicing alterations, which are crucial for brain development (Oegema2017Human). The INTS8 gene's role in maintaining transcriptome integrity highlights its importance in both cancer progression and neurodevelopmental health (Oegema2017Human).

## Interactions
INTS8, a subunit of the Integrator complex, is involved in several critical protein interactions. It associates with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) through a conserved motif, specifically interacting with PP2A subunits PR65 and PP2Ac. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of PP2A to the Integrator complex, facilitating transcriptional repression and regulation of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) activity (Huang2020Integrator). The N-terminal region of INTS8, containing a conserved WFEF motif, is crucial for its interaction with PR65. Mutations in this motif disrupt the association with PR65 but do not affect interactions with other Integrator subunits like IntS5, indicating a specific role in PP2A recruitment (Huang2020Integrator).

INTS8 is also part of the shoulder module of the INTAC complex, where it interacts with INTS5 and other subunits, forming a structural scaffold that stabilizes the complex. This structural arrangement is vital for the dephosphorylation of RNA Pol II at specific serine residues, a process crucial for transcription regulation (Zheng2020Identification). The interaction between INTS8 and PP2A is necessary for the dephosphorylation of RNA Pol II CTD and Spt5, which regulates the transition of RNA Pol II from a paused state to productive elongation (Huang2020Integrator).
