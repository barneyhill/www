# ABCG8

## Overview
ABCG8 is a gene that encodes the ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8 (ABCG8) protein, which is a crucial component of the body's cholesterol and plant sterol transport system. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and functions as a half-transporter that forms an obligate heterodimer with ABCG5. Together, these proteins facilitate the excretion of sterols into bile and the intestinal lumen, playing a vital role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. The ABCG8 protein is primarily expressed in the liver and intestines, where it contributes to the regulation of cholesterol levels, preventing disorders such as sitosterolemia. Mutations in the ABCG8 gene have been associated with various health conditions, including gallstone disease and hypercholesterolemia, highlighting its significance in lipid metabolism and overall metabolic health (Hazard2006Sterolins; Wang2020Recent; Graf2002Coexpression).

## Structure
ABCG8 is a protein that forms an obligate heterodimer with ABCG5, essential for its function in cholesterol and plant sterol transport. The primary structure of ABCG8 includes an ATP-binding cassette near the N-terminus, a transmembrane domain (TMD) with six helices, and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) containing conserved motifs such as Walker A and B and a signature motif (Yu2014ABCG5ABCG8; Graf2003ABCG5). 

The secondary structure features alpha helices within the transmembrane domain, which are crucial for forming the dimer interface and facilitating sterol translocation (Farhat2022Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a functional transporter, with a connecting helix linking the TMD to the NBD, forming an amphipathic interface (Farhat2022Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, ABCG8 must heterodimerize with ABCG5 to be functional, as neither protein is active alone. This heterodimerization occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is necessary for proper trafficking to the plasma membrane (Graf2002Coexpression; Graf2003ABCG5). Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation, which is essential for the efficient trafficking of the heterodimer (Yu2014ABCG5ABCG8).

## Function
The ABCG8 gene encodes a protein that functions as a half-transporter, forming a heterodimer with ABCG5 to facilitate the transport of sterols across cellular membranes. This protein complex is primarily active in the liver and intestines, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis by regulating the excretion of cholesterol and plant sterols into bile and the intestinal lumen (Wang2020Recent; Graf2002Coexpression).

In healthy human cells, ABCG8, in conjunction with ABCG5, is involved in the hepatic secretion of biliary cholesterol and the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and plant sterols. This process is essential for the regulation of cholesterol levels in the body, preventing the accumulation of sterols that could lead to disorders such as sitosterolemia (Wang2020Recent; Hazard2006Sterolins). The ABCG5/G8 complex is expressed on the apical surface of hepatocytes and enterocytes, where it facilitates the efflux of sterols from cells into bile and the gut lumen, respectively (Klett2004Localization; Rezaei2022Snapshots).

The proper functioning of ABCG8 is critical for the body's ability to manage dietary sterols and maintain lipid balance, highlighting its importance in overall metabolic health (Hazard2006Sterolins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCG8 gene are clinically significant due to their association with several health conditions. The D19H polymorphism in ABCG8 is strongly linked to an increased risk of gallstone disease across various populations. This variant is associated with a higher odds ratio for developing gallstones, particularly in overweight individuals, indicating a significant genetic predisposition (Jiang2014Association; Renner2013Role). The D19H polymorphism is also associated with reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption, although it does not significantly affect cholesterol synthesis (Renner2013Role).

In addition to gallstone disease, the D19H variant has been linked to hypercholesterolemia and insulin resistance. Individuals carrying this polymorphism exhibit higher serum total cholesterol and LDL-C levels, suggesting a potential role in cardiovascular disease risk (Chen2008Significant). The ABCG8 gene variants, including D19H, are not typically considered defective genes for familial hypercholesterolemia but can contribute to LDL cholesterol levels as part of a genetic risk score (Teng2023Differential).

Overall, the ABCG8 gene plays a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis, and its mutations can significantly impact lipid metabolism and related diseases.

## Interactions
ABCG8 forms a heterodimer with ABCG5, which is essential for their transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the apical surface of cells. This interaction is crucial for the proteins' function in exporting neutral sterols. The coexpression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 is necessary for their proper trafficking, as they chaperone each other from the ER to the plasma membrane (Graf2002Coexpression). 

The heterodimerization of ABCG5 and ABCG8 is facilitated by N-linked glycosylation, particularly of ABCG8, which is important for efficient trafficking to the Golgi complex. While glycosylation is not strictly necessary for dimer formation, it enhances the interaction with the ER chaperone calnexin, aiding in the proper folding and transport of the heterodimer (Graf2004Missense).

ABCG8 also interacts functionally with other proteins involved in lipid transport, such as Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) and MDR3 (ABCB4), although these interactions are more related to its role in sterol transport rather than direct physical interactions (Rezaei2022Snapshots). The presence of ABCG8 affects the trafficking of ABCG5, as evidenced by the formation of higher-molecular weight forms of ABCG5 in cells coexpressing both proteins (Graf2002Coexpression).
