# HHIPL1

## Overview
HHIPL1 (Hedgehog Interacting Protein-Like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a critical pathway for embryonic development and cell differentiation. The protein encoded by HHIPL1 is categorized as a modulator of this pathway, interacting specifically with the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein. This interaction is significant in regulating the behavior of aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs), influencing their proliferation and migration, which are essential for maintaining vascular integrity and function. The expression of HHIPL1 is predominantly observed in AoSMCs, where it plays a crucial role in tissue patterning and organogenesis, contributing to the proper development and function of various tissues and organs (Aravani2016A).

## Function
HHIPL1 (HHIP-like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including embryonic development and cell differentiation. The protein encoded by HHIPL1 interacts with the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein, playing a role in modulating this signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating the behavior of aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs), particularly their proliferation and migration, which are vital processes in maintaining vascular integrity and function (Aravani2016A).

In healthy human cells, HHIPL1 is primarily expressed in AoSMCs, where it influences cellular responses by interacting with other signaling molecules within the cell membrane and cytoplasm. This modulation of the Hedgehog pathway by HHIPL1 is thought to contribute to tissue patterning and organogenesis, ensuring proper development and function of various tissues and organs. The protein's activity in these cellular locations underscores its role in maintaining normal cellular and organismal outcomes, particularly in the context of vascular biology (Aravani2016A).
