# PHC3

## Overview
PHC3 (polyhomeotic homolog 3) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which are essential for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. The PHC3 protein is a component of the canonical Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (cPRC1) and plays a critical role in maintaining gene silencing, which is vital for proper cellular differentiation and development. It contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and polymerization, contributing to the formation of repressive chromatin structures. The protein's ability to form various polymer architectures is crucial for its function in gene silencing and growth suppression. PHC3 is involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Polito2020Epithelial; Isono2005Mammalian; Nanyes2014Multiple).

## Structure
The PHC3 protein is a component of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins and is involved in transcriptional repression. It contains several domains, including the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is crucial for its function. The SAM domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, allowing PHC3 to self-associate and bind with other SAM domains, as well as form heterotypic interactions with non-SAM domain-containing proteins (Isono2005Mammalian). This domain is located at the C-terminal end of the protein and plays a significant role in mediating PcG-dependent regulatory mechanisms through higher-order chromatin structures (Isono2005Mammalian).

PHC3 also features an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which is an 84-residue linker that influences the polymerization of the SAM domain. This IDR has a fractional charge ratio (FCR) of 0.38 and a net charge per residue (NCPR) of 0.07, promoting open-ended polymerization, which is linked to transcriptional repression activities (Das2015Relating).

The protein is part of the canonical Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (cPRC1), which includes other core components like PCGF and RING proteins, and is involved in suppressing cellular motility and invasion phenotypes (Polito2020Epithelial). The SAM domain is essential for the localization of PHC3 in nuclear foci and its suppressive function (Ly2018Proteome-wide).

## Function
PHC3 (polyhomeotic homolog 3) is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which are crucial for chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. In healthy human cells, PHC3 is involved in maintaining transcriptional repression of genes, a process essential for proper development and cellular differentiation. The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (Robinson2012Human).

The PHC3 protein contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is known for its ability to self-associate and form polymer structures. These polymers are integral to the function of PcG proteins, as they help establish and maintain repressive chromatin states. The SAM domain of PHC3 can form both fivefold and sixfold repeat structures, allowing it to adapt to different conformations and potentially influence gene silencing and growth suppression (Nanyes2014Multiple).

PHC3's ability to form various polymer architectures is influenced by its interactions with other proteins, such as SCMH1, which may alter the SAM conformation and favor specific polymer forms. This flexibility in polymerization is crucial for the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression (Nanyes2014Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
PHC3 (polyhomeotic homolog 3) has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in gene silencing and chromatin remodeling. Amplification of the PHC3 gene is a significant genetic alteration observed in several solid tumors, including lung, ovarian, and uterine adenocarcinomas. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), PHC3 amplification is associated with mRNA upregulation and correlates with a shorter 3-year survival rate, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Crea2013Mutational). In uterine carcinoma, PHC3 amplification is linked to shorter disease-free survival and is predominantly found in grade 3 neoplasms, suggesting it as an independent prognostic factor (Crea2013Mutational). However, in ovarian cancer, PHC3 amplification does not significantly impact prognosis (Crea2013Mutational).

In ovarian cancer, a circular RNA derived from PHC3, known as circ-PHC3, is upregulated and contributes to cancer progression by interacting with the miR-497-5p/SOX9 pathway. This interaction promotes cell proliferation and invasion, highlighting circ-PHC3 as a potential therapeutic target (Wang2023Expression). In lung cancer, PHC3 is involved in the self-renewal of cancer stem cells through the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, and its expression can be inhibited by sulforaphane, suggesting a therapeutic approach for targeting cancer stem cells (Wang2021Sulforaphane).

## Interactions
PHC3, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), interacts with various proteins within this complex to maintain gene silencing. It associates with human Psc orthologs such as BMI1, PCGF1, PCGF2, PCGF3, PCGF5, and PCGF6, as well as Ph orthologs including PHC1 and PHC2, and Sce orthologs like RING1 and RNF2. These interactions are crucial for the formation and function of PRC1 complexes in mammalian cells (Vandamme2011Interaction).

PHC3 is consistently co-eluted with RNF2 and PHC2, indicating a strong affinity within the PRC1 complex. The efficiency of recovering PRC1 components varies among different CBX proteins, with CBX4, CBX7, and CBX8 showing higher recovery rates of PRC1 components, including PHC3, compared to CBX2 and CBX6 (Vandamme2011Interaction).

PHC3 also plays a role in suppressing cellular motility and invasion phenotypes, which are enhanced in transformed cells. Its SAM domain is crucial for its suppressive function and localization in nuclear foci. The downregulation of PHC3, influenced by Src kinase activity and CAF1 depletion, is associated with increased cell motility and invasiveness (Ly2018Proteome-wide).
