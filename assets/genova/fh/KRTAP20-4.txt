# KRTAP20-4

## Overview
KRTAP20-4 is a gene that encodes the keratin associated protein 20-4, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the keratin matrix. The KAP family is characterized by their high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the rigidity and resilience of keratinized tissues. The KRTAP20-4 gene is specifically expressed in hair follicles, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to provide structural support and mechanical strength (Smith2021KAP). Understanding the function and regulation of KRTAP20-4 is essential for insights into hair biology and potential implications in hair disorders.
