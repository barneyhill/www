# MAPKAPK5

## Overview
MAPKAPK5 is a gene that encodes the protein MAPK activated protein kinase 5, a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including stress response and signal transduction pathways. This kinase is structurally related to MK2 and MK3, sharing significant identity in the kinase domain, and is characterized by a unique C-terminal extension. MAPK activated protein kinase 5 is activated by atypical MAP kinases such as ERK3 and ERK4, as well as p38 MAPK, and plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein's activity is significant in pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, where it can either suppress or promote tumor growth depending on the context (Namour2012Pharmacokinetics; Seternes2004Activation; Moens2013Structure).

## Structure
The MAPKAPK5 gene encodes a protein kinase that is structurally related to MK2 and MK3, sharing approximately 50% identity in the kinase domain (Moens2013Structure). The primary structure of MAPKAPK5 includes a unique C-terminal extension of about 75 amino acids and lacks the N-terminal proline-rich motif found in MK2 and MK3 (Moens2013Structure). The secondary structure features a typical protein kinase fold with an N-terminal lobe composed of β sheets and a conserved α helix, and a C-terminal lobe that is largely helical (Lindin2014Comparative; Moens2013Structure).

The tertiary structure of MAPKAPK5 has been modeled through homology modeling, as its exact 3D structure has not been resolved by X-ray crystallography. This model suggests a conserved protein kinase fold with an active site crucial for ATP binding and catalysis, located between the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes (Lindin2014Comparative). The protein includes conserved motifs such as the GxGxxG domain and the K/D/D motif, which are important for its catalytic function (Lindin2014Comparative).

MAPKAPK5 undergoes post-translational modifications, with phosphorylation at Thr-182 being critical for its activation (Moens2013Structure). The protein is also a substrate for SUMO1, which can influence its subcellular localization and stability (Moens2013Structure). The human MAPKAPK5 gene encodes two main splice variants, resulting in proteins of 471 and 473 residues, with a third variant of 467 residues also described (Moens2013Structure).

## Function
MAPKAPK5, also known as MAPK activated protein kinase 5, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cellular stress response and signal transduction pathways. It is activated by p38 MAPK and ERK3/4, playing a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. MAPKAPK5 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing gene expression and cytoskeletal dynamics. In the context of rheumatoid arthritis, MAPKAPK5 is part of a transduction pathway that leads to the secretion of catabolic enzymes like MMP1, which cause damage to bone and cartilage. Inhibition of MAPKAPK5 can reduce the release of inflammatory mediators and bone degradation enzymes such as MMP1, MMP13, TNF, and IL6 (Namour2012Pharmacokinetics). 

The protein's activity is crucial in regulating inflammatory responses, as demonstrated by its involvement in various cellular processes. Although the specific function of MAPKAPK5 in healthy human cells is not detailed in the provided context, its role in pathological conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer suggests its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress signals. The kinase's influence on gene expression and cytoskeletal dynamics highlights its potential impact on cellular structure and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAPKAPK5 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. Homozygous loss-of-function variants in MAPKAPK5 are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder known as 'neurocardiofaciodigital' syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, distinct facial morphology, brachycephaly, digital anomalies, hair and nail defects, cerebellar hypoplasia, hypomyelination, and variable vision and hearing impairments. Additional features include failure to thrive, hypotonia, microcephaly, and genitourinary anomalies, but notably, congenital heart disease is absent (Maroofian2022Consolidating).

In cancer, MAPKAPK5 plays a dual role. It can act as a tumor suppressor by mediating oncogene-induced senescence and inhibiting cell proliferation through pathways involving p53 and JNK. Conversely, it can promote tumor growth by stimulating angiogenesis and supporting tumor progression once established (Kostenko2012Tumour). In colorectal cancer, MAPKAPK5 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Yang2020Long). The long noncoding RNA MAPKAPK5-AS1, which regulates MAPKAPK5, is implicated in both colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma progression, influencing tumor growth and metastasis (Yang2020Long; Wang2021Long).

## Interactions
MAPKAPK5, also known as MAPK activated protein kinase 5, interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is specifically activated by the atypical MAP kinases ERK3 and ERK4, which are the only known genuine upstream activators of MK5. This interaction leads to the nuclear exclusion of both ERK3 and MK5, with ERK3-dependent phosphorylation and activation of MK5 occurring both in vitro and in vivo (Seternes2004Activation).

MK5 also interacts with p38 MAPK, where the p38 MAPK docking motif overlaps with the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of MK5. This interaction influences the subcellular localization of MK5, causing it to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The binding of p38 MAPK to MK5 can mask the NLS, facilitating nuclear export and affecting MK5's localization in response to cellular stress (Seternes2002Both).

In the context of neuronal signaling, MK5 interacts with Sept7, facilitated by ERK3, which acts as a docking platform. This interaction is crucial for the reorganization of Sept7 filaments and is significant for dendrite morphology and spine formation (Brand2012The). Additionally, MK5 phosphorylates Kal7, a GDP exchange factor involved in spine formation and maturation, indicating a potential role in neuronal signaling (Brand2012The).
