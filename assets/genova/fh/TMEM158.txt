# TMEM158

## Overview
TMEM158 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 158, a crucial component involved in various cellular processes, particularly in signal transduction and cell growth regulation. As a transmembrane protein, it is primarily localized in the plasma membrane, where it plays a significant role in the Ras signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Fu2019TMEM158). TMEM158's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular communication and homeostasis, ensuring that cells respond appropriately to external stimuli. The protein's function is context-dependent, acting as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene in different cancer types, highlighting its complex role in cancer biology (Li2022TMEM158; Huang2022TMEM158).

## Function
TMEM158, or transmembrane protein 158, is involved in critical cellular processes such as signal transduction and the regulation of cell growth. It is a membrane protein that plays a significant role in the Ras signaling pathway, which is crucial for influencing cell proliferation and differentiation. TMEM158 is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it contributes to cellular communication and homeostasis. By participating in these pathways, TMEM158 helps maintain the balance of cell growth and differentiation, which is essential for normal cellular function and organismal development. Its activity in the plasma membrane underscores its importance in mediating signals that regulate various cellular responses, ensuring that cells respond appropriately to external stimuli and maintain their functional integrity.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM158 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and interactions play significant roles in disease progression. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), TMEM158 is upregulated and associated with poor clinical outcomes. It promotes invasive and migratory properties by facilitating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is crucial for tumor cell migration and invasion (Tong2022TMEM158). Similarly, in ovarian cancer, TMEM158 is overexpressed in cancer tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues, suggesting its role as an oncogene. Its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation and invasiveness, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Cheng2015Overexpression).

In gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, TMEM158 is significantly overexpressed and correlates with poor overall survival. It promotes glioma cell proliferation and migration through the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway (Li2022TMEM158). In pancreatic cancer, TMEM158 is associated with increased aggressiveness, promoting cell viability and invasion through the activation of the TGFβ1 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (Fu2019TMEM158).

Conversely, in prostate cancer, TMEM158 expression is reduced in malignant tissues and is associated with better survival outcomes, suggesting a complex role that may vary across different cancer types (Huang2022TMEM158).

## Interactions
TMEM158, also known as RIS1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and signaling pathways that influence cancer progression. In gliomas, TMEM158 interacts with the STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Overexpression of TMEM158 leads to increased levels of phosphorylated STAT3, while its knockdown reduces these effects, which can be reversed by STAT3 overexpression (Li2022TMEM158). 

In pancreatic cancer, TMEM158 is associated with the TGFβ1 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. It facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is positively correlated with matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2, MMP7, MMP9), which are crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion (Fu2019TMEM158). 

In prostate cancer, TMEM158 expression is correlated with R-Ras and M-Ras gene expression, suggesting an interaction with the Ras signaling pathway. This interaction is linked to anti-tumor immune infiltration, particularly involving NK and mast cells (Huang2022TMEM158). 

These interactions highlight TMEM158's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes, contributing to its dual role as a tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the cancer type.
