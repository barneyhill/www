# OR2B11

## Overview
OR2B11 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily B member 11, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and discrimination of odor molecules. It is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odorants, contributing to the sense of smell (Achebouche2022Application). The OR2B11 receptor is particularly noted for its ability to detect specific odor notes, such as those associated with 'coffee', and its activity can be influenced by genetic variations, which may affect olfactory perception and dietary preferences (Matiashova2023The). While the detailed molecular mechanisms of OR2B11 are not fully elucidated, it is part of a larger family of olfactory receptors implicated in various physiological and pathological processes beyond olfaction, including metabolism and disease regulation (Tong2021Ectopic).

## Function
OR2B11 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR2B11 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the sense of smell (Achebouche2022Application).

The OR2B11 receptor is associated with detecting specific odor notes, such as 'coffee', indicating its role in distinguishing between different odorant molecules (Achebouche2022Application). The receptor's activity is influenced by genetic variations, which can affect olfactory sensing and food preferences, potentially impacting metabolic health and obesity (Matiashova2023The).

Although the specific molecular processes and cellular roles of OR2B11 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, it is part of a broader family of olfactory receptors that are known to be involved in various physiological and pathological processes beyond olfaction, including metabolism and disease regulation (Tong2021Ectopic). The receptor's function in odor detection is crucial for olfactory acuity, allowing for the discrimination of closely related odorants (Alonso2008Overdominance).
