# CLASP1

## Overview
CLASP1 (cytoplasmic linker associated protein 1) is a gene that encodes a microtubule-associated protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics within human cells. The protein encoded by CLASP1 is characterized by its ability to stabilize microtubules, particularly at the cell cortex, by promoting pauses and modulating growth and shortening episodes. This stabilization is crucial for maintaining cell shape, function, and proper cell division. CLASP1 is active at the plus ends of microtubules and interacts with other proteins, such as EB1, to regulate microtubule dynamics and stability (MimoriKiyosue2005CLASP1; Lawrence2020CLASPs). During mitosis, CLASP1 plays a vital role in ensuring mitotic fidelity by localizing to kinetochores, centrosomes, and the mitotic spindle, thereby facilitating accurate chromosome alignment and segregation (Pereira2006Mammalian). Additionally, CLASP1 is implicated in cytokinesis and acts as a crosslinker between microtubules and actin filaments, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and division (Tsvetkov2007Microtubule‐binding).

## Structure
The human CLASP1 protein is characterized by its distinct domain architecture, which includes multiple TOG (tumor overexpressed gene) domains crucial for microtubule binding and regulation. The TOG1 domain of CLASP1 is an α-solenoid structure approximately 65 Å in length, composed of six HEAT repeats (HRs) arranged into two triads. The first triad (HRs A-C) has a right-handed twist, while the second triad (HRs D-F) introduces a jog, resulting in a flat, paddle-like architecture (Leano2019Structures). The TOG2 domain, in contrast, exhibits a unique bent architecture, which is distinct from the straight architecture observed in other TOG domains like those in the XMAP215 family (Leano2013A).

CLASP1 also contains a C-terminal coiled-coil domain that facilitates dimerization, contributing to its quaternary structure (Patel2012Multiple). The protein's surface is positively charged, complementing the negatively charged microtubule surface, and contains conserved residues that mediate tubulin binding (Leano2013A). CLASP1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which influence its interaction with microtubules. Multiple splice variants of CLASP1 exist, contributing to its functional diversity (Patel2012Multiple).

## Function
CLASP1 (cytoplasmic linker associated protein 1) is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a critical role in regulating microtubule dynamics in human cells. It is involved in stabilizing microtubules by promoting pauses and restricting growth and shortening episodes, particularly at the cell cortex, which is essential for maintaining cell shape and function (MimoriKiyosue2005CLASP1). CLASP1 is active at the plus ends of microtubules, where it associates with proteins like EB1 to regulate microtubule dynamics and stability (Lawrence2020CLASPs).

During mitosis, CLASP1 is crucial for ensuring mitotic fidelity by regulating spindle and kinetochore functions. It localizes to kinetochores, centrosomes, and the mitotic spindle, where it helps maintain proper chromosome alignment and segregation, preventing chromosomal instability and aneuploidy (Pereira2006Mammalian). CLASP1 interacts with CENP-E, a motor protein, to promote microtubule turnover and poleward flux, which are vital for accurate chromosome movement and spindle architecture (Maffini2009MotorIndependent).

CLASP1 also plays a role in cytokinesis, as its depletion can lead to cytokinesis failure, highlighting its importance in cell division and genomic integrity (Pereira2006Mammalian). Overall, CLASP1 is essential for maintaining microtubule dynamics and ensuring proper cell division and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CLASP1 gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. CLASP1 is involved in regulating microtubule dynamics, which is crucial for proper cell division and migration. Disruptions in these processes can lead to chromosomal instability, a hallmark of cancer cells, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis (Pereira2006Mammalian; Lawrence2020CLASPs). 

In cancer, CLASP1 has been implicated in the regulation of cell motility and invasiveness. Knockdown of CLASP1 in cancer cells has been shown to prevent protrusion formation and reduce 3D motility, indicating its role in cancer cell migration and metastasis (Lawrence2020CLASPs). 

In the nervous system, CLASP1 plays a role in neuronal development by promoting neurite extension. Alterations in CLASP1 expression can affect neuronal differentiation and are potentially linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (Sayas2019Distinct). The balance between CLASP1 and CLASP2 activities is crucial for proper neuronal function, and disruptions in this balance could contribute to neurological conditions (Sayas2019Distinct).

## Interactions
CLASP1 (cytoplasmic linker associated protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that regulate microtubule dynamics and stabilization. It directly interacts with LL5b and ELKS, forming a complex that stabilizes microtubules at the cell cortex. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal domain of CLASP1, which binds to the coiled coil M2 region of LL5b, while ELKS binds to a different domain of LL5b (Lansbergen2006CLASPs). The presence of LL5b is crucial for the cortical accumulation of both CLASP1 and ELKS, as LL5b depletion reduces their cortical presence and redistributes ELKS into the cytoplasm (Lansbergen2006CLASPs).

CLASP1 also interacts with microtubule plus-end tracking proteins such as EB1 and EB3. The middle region of CLASP1, rich in serines, arginines, and lysines, is sufficient for targeting to microtubule tips and binds to the COOH-terminal half of EB1 (MimoriKiyosue2005CLASP1). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of microtubule plus-end dynamics at the cell cortex (MimoriKiyosue2005CLASP1).

Additionally, CLASP1 associates with actin filaments, functioning as an actin/microtubule crosslinker. This interaction involves the N-terminal dis1/TOG domain and the middle portion of CLASP1, which bind to actin (Tsvetkov2007Microtubule‐binding). These interactions highlight CLASP1's role in coordinating microtubule and actin dynamics within the cell.
