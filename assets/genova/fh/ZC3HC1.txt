# ZC3HC1

## Overview
ZC3HC1 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger C3HC-type containing 1, also known as nuclear-interacting partner of ALK (NIPA). This protein is a critical component of the nuclear basket (NB) of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in vertebrate cells, playing a significant role in maintaining nuclear architecture and regulating cell cycle dynamics. ZC3HC1 is characterized by its bimodular structure, which includes zinc ion coordination motifs essential for its interaction with the scaffold protein TPR (translocated promoter region). This interaction is vital for the stability and localization of TPR at the nuclear envelope, influencing nuclear transport processes. The gene has been implicated in cardiovascular diseases, with specific polymorphisms associated with coronary artery disease and large artery ischemic stroke, highlighting its clinical significance in vascular health (Gunkel2021ZC3HC1; Aherrahrou2021Deficiency; Linseman2017Functional).

## Structure
The ZC3HC1 protein, also known as NIPA, is characterized by its evolutionarily conserved bimodular construction, essential for binding to nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored homologs of the scaffold protein TPR. This structure includes two Bimodular Ligand Domains (BLDs), BLD1 and BLD2, which are crucial for its function. BLD1 contains an extended α-helix and is defined by amino acids K75 to F167, while BLD2 starts at A176 and extends to S471, featuring specific α-helices not found in BLD1 (Gunkel2022Nuclear). The BLDs are characterized by zinc ion coordination spheres, with a conserved signature motif C-X(2)-C-X(>14)-H-X(3)-C, forming a compact polypeptide structure (Gunkel2022Nuclear).

The protein's structure includes a Nuclear Basket Interaction Domain (NuBaID), which is similar to the Pfam zf-C3HC motif, although it lacks a fourth cysteine found in some homologs (Gunkel2022Nuclear). ZC3HC1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, particularly in the BLD2-embedded loop, which could affect its function (Gunkel2022Nuclear). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Gunkel2021ZC3HC1).

## Function
The ZC3HC1 gene encodes a protein known as nuclear-interacting partner of ALK (NIPA), which is a novel component of the nuclear basket (NB) in vertebrate cells. ZC3HC1 is crucial for the structural configuration of the NB, particularly through its interaction with the coiled-coil protein TPR (translocated promoter region). This interaction is essential for maintaining normal levels of TPR at the nuclear envelope (NE), highlighting a reciprocal dependency between ZC3HC1 and TPR (Gunkel2021ZC3HC1).

ZC3HC1 is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly in modulating cyclin B1 dynamics. It functions as part of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which prevents the accumulation of cyclin B1 in the nucleus, thereby regulating the timing of mitosis. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the contractile and quiescent state of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (Aherrahrou2021Deficiency).

In the context of nuclear architecture, ZC3HC1 is necessary for the stability of TPR subpopulations at the NB, which may enhance NB stability and influence nuclear transport processes (Gunkel2021ZC3HC1). The presence of ZC3HC1 is consistent across different cell types, indicating its fundamental role in nuclear structure integrity (Gunkel2021ZC3HC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZC3HC1 gene, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11556924, have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and large artery ischemic stroke (LA IS). This SNP results in an amino acid change from arginine to histidine at position 363 in the NIPA protein, which is encoded by ZC3HC1 (Linseman2017Functional; Jafaripour2019ADAMTS7). The Arg-363 variant is linked to a 9% increased risk of CAD per allele, potentially due to its impact on the phosphorylation of NIPA, affecting cell cycle regulation and Cyclin-B1 stability (Jones2016The).

The His-363 variant, on the other hand, is associated with protection against CAD. It shows increased phosphorylation and higher protein expression, which may reduce cell proliferation, suggesting a protective role against atherosclerosis (Linseman2017Functional). Despite these associations, the exact mechanisms by which ZC3HC1 variants influence CAD risk remain unclear, as studies have shown no significant differences in ZC3HC1 mRNA expression across different genotypes (Linseman2017Functional). The gene's involvement in cell cycle control and its interaction with Cyclin-B1 highlight its potential clinical significance in cardiovascular diseases (McPherson2013From).

## Interactions
ZC3HC1, a component of the nuclear basket (NB) of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), interacts primarily with the scaffold protein TPR (translocated promoter region). This interaction is crucial for the localization and stability of TPR at the nuclear envelope (NE). ZC3HC1 and TPR exhibit a reciprocal dependency, where the absence of ZC3HC1 significantly reduces the amount of TPR associated with the NE, indicating that ZC3HC1 is essential for maintaining TPR levels at the NE (Gunkel2021ZC3HC1).

The interaction between ZC3HC1 and TPR is robust, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which show that these proteins can specifically co-isolate, indicating a strong physical interaction (Gunkel2021ZC3HC1). ZC3HC1's binding to TPR is facilitated by its bimodular structure, which includes zinc ion coordination modules essential for forming a functional TPR binding interface (Gunkel2022Nuclear).

ZC3HC1 does not co-isolate with other previously reported binding partners in significant amounts, suggesting a specific interaction with TPR rather than with other nuclear basket proteins (Gunkel2021ZC3HC1). This specificity is further supported by the absence of co-immunoprecipitation with other nucleoporins like NUP62 (Gunkel2021ZC3HC1).
