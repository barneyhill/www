This gene is also a translocation partner in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor cases, where a t(2;17)(p23;q25) translocation has been identified with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene on chromosome 2, and a t(8;17)(q24;q25) translocation has been identified with the MYC gene on chromosome 8.
