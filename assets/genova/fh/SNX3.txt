# SNX3

## Overview
SNX3 is a gene that encodes the protein sorting nexin 3, which is a member of the sorting nexin family involved in intracellular trafficking. The protein is characterized by its Phox homology (PX) domain, which facilitates binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on endosomal membranes, playing a critical role in endosomal sorting and trafficking (Lenoir2018Phosphorylation; Teasdale2011Insights). Sorting nexin 3 is integral to the endocytic pathway, particularly in the formation of intralumenal vesicles within multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the recruitment of the retromer complex, which is essential for the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval pathway (Seaman2012The; Teasdale2011Insights). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as Rab5a and galectin-9, underscore its role in phagosomal maturation and membrane recycling (Klose2019SNX3). Clinically, SNX3 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, due to its involvement in critical cellular processes and signaling pathways (Vardarajan2012Identification; Yang2020Sorting).

## Structure
The human SNX3 protein is characterized by its Phox homology (PX) domain, which is crucial for its function in membrane trafficking. The PX domain is a globular fold approximately 110 residues in length, consisting of three β-strands followed by three α-helices. It features a proline-rich loop and an electropositive basic pocket that binds to negatively charged phosphate groups of phosphoinositides, specifically phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) (Teasdale2011Insights). The structure of SNX3 includes a classical PX fold with a structured C-terminus that interfaces with specific helices, and a polyproline type II helix and a membrane insertion loop positioned to contact the lipid bilayer (Lenoir2018Phosphorylation).

SNX3 is monomeric in physiological solutions, as confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, and does not form oligomers like SNX-BAR proteins (Lenoir2018Phosphorylation). The protein's structure is well-converged, with a backbone root mean squared deviation of 0.37 Å (Lenoir2018Phosphorylation). A key regulatory feature of SNX3 is the phosphorylation of a conserved serine residue near the PI3P binding site, which acts as a switch to regulate its membrane association (Lenoir2018Phosphorylation).

## Function
SNX3 (sorting nexin 3) is a protein involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking within cells. It plays a crucial role in the endocytic pathway by binding to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) on endosomal membranes through its PX domain, which facilitates its association with early endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Seaman2012The; Teasdale2011Insights). SNX3 is essential for the formation of intralumenal vesicles within MVBs and is involved in the recruitment of the cargo-selective retromer complex to the endosomal membrane, which is crucial for the sorting of cargo proteins in the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval pathway (Seaman2012The; Teasdale2011Insights).

SNX3 also plays a role in the recycling of the Wnt receptor Wntless, indicating its involvement in retromer-mediated membrane trafficking, which is evolutionarily conserved across various organisms (Teasdale2011Insights). In C. elegans, SNX3 is involved in the retrieval of the Wntless/MIG-14 protein, crucial for Wnt morphogen signaling, suggesting a role in developmental processes (Seaman2012The). Additionally, SNX3 has been linked to neurite outgrowth and its expression is induced by lithium treatment, highlighting its potential role in neural development (Teasdale2011Insights).

## Clinical Significance
SNX3 (sorting nexin 3) is implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein trafficking and sorting. Alterations in SNX3 expression have been linked to cancer, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and osteosarcoma (OS). In CRC, SNX3 can reverse metastasis by mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and downregulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, inhibiting cancer development (Yang2020Sorting). In OS, SNX3 expression is regulated by the LINC01614/miR-520a-3p axis, promoting tumor progression by enhancing cell proliferation and invasion (Cai2021LINC01614).

SNX3 is also associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Variants in SNX3 have been identified in genetic studies as potentially contributing to AD by affecting retromer function, which is crucial for the trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This dysfunction may lead to increased production of amyloid β-peptide, a key factor in AD pathogenesis (Vardarajan2012Identification).

While SNX3 mutations have been investigated in relation to the MMEP phenotype, no coding mutations were found, suggesting that SNX3 may not be a common cause of these conditions (Kumar2007Absence). However, its role in intracellular protein trafficking remains significant in understanding its clinical implications.

## Interactions
SNX3 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in endosomal sorting and phagosome maturation. It binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) through its PX domain, which is essential for its localization to phagosomes and endosomal membranes (Klose2019SNX3; Pons2008Hrs). SNX3 forms a complex with Rab5a, a small GTPase, facilitating the recruitment of Rab5a to borreliae phagosomes, which is important for phagosomal compaction and maturation (Klose2019SNX3).

SNX3 also interacts with galectin-9, a lectin involved in protein and membrane recycling. This interaction occurs through the C-terminal region of SNX3 and is crucial for the recruitment of galectin-9 to borreliae phagosomes, contributing to their compaction (Klose2019SNX3). The interaction between SNX3 and galectin-9 suggests they function in the same pathway for phagosomal maturation (Klose2019SNX3).

In the context of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), SNX3 colocalizes with Hrs, ubiquitinated proteins, and clathrin, indicating its involvement in sorting and membrane invagination within MVBs (Pons2008Hrs). These interactions highlight SNX3's role as a central hub in various cellular processes.
