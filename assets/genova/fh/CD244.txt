# CD244

## Overview
CD244, also known as 2B4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein involved in the regulation of immune responses. The CD244 protein is primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of CD8+ T cells, where it plays a crucial role in modulating cytotoxic activity and cytokine production. As a member of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family, CD244 interacts with its ligand CD48 to mediate both activating and inhibitory signals, depending on the presence of specific adaptor proteins such as the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) and Ewing sarcoma-activated transcript 2 (EAT2). These interactions are essential for the receptor's function in immune surveillance and homeostasis. CD244's dual role in immune modulation is context-dependent, influencing its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including antiviral immunity, cancer, and autoimmune diseases (Buller2020Roles; Agresta2018The; Sun2021Advances).

## Structure
The CD244 protein, also known as 2B4, is a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of CD8+ T cells. Its molecular structure includes a ligand-binding domain (D1) that resembles an immunoglobulin variable (V) domain fold, similar to domain 1 of CD2 and CD4. This domain is composed of nine β-strands organized into two β-sheets labeled DEB and AGFCC'C". A noncanonical disulfide bridge between Cys2 and Cys99 stabilizes a long parallel β-structure between strand A and strand G (Ames2005NMR).

The FG-loop, which is implicated in ligand recognition, is dynamically disordered in the absence of a ligand, suggesting that ligand binding might stabilize this loop. The cytoplasmic tail of CD244 binds the SH2 domain-containing protein SAP, which is crucial for delivering activating signals to NK cells. In the absence of SAP, CD244 transduces inhibitory signals mediated by the SHP-1 phosphatase (Ames2005NMR).

The structure of CD244 is similar to domain 1 of CD2 and CD4, with differences in the β-sheet arrangements compared to conventional V domains. The N-terminal region of strand A forms a long parallel β-structure with strand G, stabilized by a disulfide bridge (Ames2005NMR).

## Function
CD244, also known as 2B4, is a receptor that plays a significant role in immune regulation by modulating the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells. In healthy human cells, CD244 is primarily expressed on NK cells, CD8+ T cells, γδ-T cells, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils (Buller2020Roles; Vaidya2006Of). The receptor interacts with its ligand CD48, which is expressed on all hematopoietic cells, to influence immune responses (Buller2020Roles).

CD244 can mediate both activating and inhibitory signals depending on the presence of specific adaptor molecules. The interaction with the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) is crucial for its activating role, enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity and interferon gamma production (Agresta2018The; Vaidya2006Of). In the absence of SAP, CD244 can recruit inhibitory phosphatases like SHP-1 and SHP-2, leading to an inhibitory function (Agresta2018The; Vaidya2006Of).

CD244 is involved in regulating immune responses, such as cytotoxicity and cytokine production, and plays a role in maintaining immune balance. It is essential for the normal function of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and NK cells, particularly in antiviral immunity (Sun2021Advances). The receptor's dual role in immune modulation is context-dependent, influenced by factors such as expression levels and the presence of adaptor proteins (Agresta2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the CD244 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and autoimmune diseases. In the context of cancer, CD244 is identified as an immune checkpoint receptor that contributes to immune cell exhaustion and tumor immune evasion. Its expression is upregulated in various immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, including CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), where it is associated with increased immunosuppressive functions. In melanoma, CD244 expression on monocytes and macrophages correlates with an immunosuppressive phenotype, contributing to immune exhaustion and reduced patient survival. Targeting CD244 in these cells has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immunity and improve the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapies (Agresta2020CD244; Kim2024Targeted).

In autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CD244 plays a complex role in immune regulation. Reduced expression of CD244 in monocytes and NK cells is observed in SLE patients, and genetic studies have linked a single nucleotide polymorphism in CD244 to increased susceptibility to the disease. These findings suggest that CD244 may help regulate immune responses and its dysregulation could contribute to autoimmune pathogenesis (Sun2021Advances).

## Interactions
CD244, also known as 2B4, is a receptor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in immune regulation. It primarily interacts with the ligand CD48, a member of the SLAM family, through trans interactions on adjacent cells. This interaction is crucial for the activation and expansion of NK cells, influencing their cytotoxicity and IFN-γ secretion (Buller2020Roles; Sun2021Advances). CD244 also binds to other proteins through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs), including the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) and Ewing sarcoma-activated transcript 2 (EAT2). SAP is associated with activating signaling, while EAT2 can transmit both activating and inhibitory signals (Buller2020Roles; Agresta2018The).

CD244 interacts with phosphatases such as SHP1, SHP2, and SHIP-1, which are linked to inhibitory signaling. The presence and availability of these adaptor molecules, as well as their competitive binding, determine whether CD244 propagates an activating or inhibitory signal (Agresta2018The). In the context of tuberculosis, CD244 inhibits cytokine expression by up-regulating intracellular lncRNA-CD244 and recruiting the promoter of EZH2 to the genes for IFN-γ and TNF-α, indicating a physical interaction with nucleic acids (Sun2021Advances).
