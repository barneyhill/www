# HAUS4

## Overview
HAUS4 is a gene that encodes the protein HAUS augmin-like complex subunit 4, which is a critical component of the augmin complex involved in microtubule organization during mitosis. The protein plays a pivotal role in facilitating the recruitment of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to spindle microtubules, thereby promoting the nucleation of branched microtubules essential for proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation (Ustinova2023Microtubule; Zupa2022The). HAUS4 is part of a stable hetero-tetrameric subcomplex within the augmin complex, interacting with other subunits such as HAUS1, HAUS3, and HAUS5 to maintain the structural integrity and function of the complex (Zupa2022The). The protein's activity is regulated by importins and Ran-GTP, which modulate its binding to microtubules, highlighting its role in ensuring accurate cell division and genomic stability (Ustinova2023Microtubule). HAUS4's expression and function have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where its dysregulation is associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (Frankel2014Genome‐wide; Wang2023A).

## Function
HAUS4 is a subunit of the augmin complex, which is essential for microtubule organization during mitosis. The augmin complex facilitates the recruitment of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to spindle microtubules, promoting the nucleation of branched microtubules. This process is crucial for proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation during cell division (Ustinova2023Microtubule; Zupa2022The). The augmin complex, including HAUS4, is composed of two stable hetero-tetrameric subcomplexes, with HAUS4 being part of the TIII tetramer. This tetramer binds to the γ-TuRC via the adaptor protein NEDD1, serving as a scaffold for positioning the γ-TuRC on pre-existing microtubules (Zupa2022The).

In healthy human cells, HAUS4 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly during mitosis, ensuring accurate cell division and genomic stability. The HAUS complex's microtubule binding is regulated by importins and Ran-GTP, which modulate its activity by inhibiting or relieving inhibition of microtubule binding, respectively (Ustinova2023Microtubule). The HAUS complex is evolutionarily conserved across various species, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular processes (Ustinova2023Microtubule).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HAUS4 gene have been associated with various clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In low-grade gliomas (LGG), HAUS4 expression is significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal brain tissues. Low expression of HAUS4 in LGG is linked to poor prognosis, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker. The gene is part of a prognostic model that includes HAUS2 and HAUS8, which predicts patient outcomes based on expression levels, with high-risk patients showing poorer survival times (Wang2023A).

HAUS4 is also implicated in the immune microenvironment of gliomas, where its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, although it shows an adverse link with CD8+ T cell and neutrophil infiltration (Wang2023A). In esophageal adenocarcinoma, HAUS4 is located in a chromosomal region identified as having significant copy number aberrations, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (Frankel2014Genome‐wide).

While specific diseases directly caused by HAUS4 mutations are not detailed, its role in cell cycle regulation and immune response suggests that dysregulation could contribute to cancer development and progression (Wang2023Weighted).

## Interactions
HAUS4 is a component of the augmin complex, which plays a crucial role in microtubule organization during cell division. Within the augmin complex, HAUS4 forms a stable dimer with HAUS1, as indicated by high-confidence intermolecular crosslinks. This interaction is part of the TIII tetramer, which also includes HAUS3 and HAUS5, and is essential for the structural integrity of the complex (Zupa2022The). The TIII tetramer is involved in binding to the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) via the adaptor protein NEDD1, facilitating microtubule nucleation (Zupa2022The).

The HAUS complex, including HAUS4, interacts with microtubules, and this interaction is regulated by importins and Ran-GTP. Importins inhibit the binding of the HAUS complex to microtubules, a process that can be reversed by Ran-GTP, indicating a regulatory mechanism for microtubule binding (Ustinova2023Microtubule). Although specific interactions of HAUS4 with nucleic acids are not detailed, its role within the HAUS complex suggests it participates in the broader regulatory functions of the complex in microtubule dynamics (Ustinova2023Microtubule).
