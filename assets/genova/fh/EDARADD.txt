# EDARADD

## Overview
The EDARADD gene encodes the EDAR-associated death domain protein, a pivotal adaptor protein in the ectodysplasin (EDA) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for the development of ectodermal tissues, including hair, teeth, nails, and certain glands, during embryogenesis. The EDARADD protein interacts with the ectodysplasin receptor (EDAR) and facilitates the recruitment of other signaling molecules, leading to the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This activation is essential for the proper formation and function of ectodermal appendages. The gene produces two isoforms, A and B, which have distinct roles in the regulation and expression of the EDA pathway. Mutations in EDARADD are linked to ectodermal dysplasia conditions, such as hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and isolated oligodontia, underscoring its significance in human development and disease (Sadier2015Tinkering; Cluzeau2010Only; Ahmed2021Gene).

## Function
The EDARADD gene encodes the EDAR-associated death domain protein, which is a critical component of the ectodysplasin (EDA) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for the development of ectodermal tissues, including hair, teeth, nails, and certain glands, during embryogenesis. In healthy human cells, the EDA protein ligand binds to the ectodysplasin receptor (EDAR), which is linked to EDARADD. EDARADD functions as an adaptor molecule, recruiting additional cytoplasmic adaptor proteins such as TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1. This recruitment leads to the activation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase complex (IKK), which phosphorylates the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (I-NFκB), resulting in its degradation and the release of NFκB. NFκB then translocates to the nucleus to activate target genes involved in ectodermal organogenesis (Cai2021Ectodysplasin; Ahmed2021Gene).

EDARADD is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates signal transduction necessary for normal ectodermal development. The gene produces two isoforms, A and B, which differ in their regulatory roles and tissue-specific expression. Isoform B is more conserved and plays a fundamental role in maintaining core functions of the EDA pathway, while isoform A may contribute to phenotypic diversification (Sadier2015Tinkering).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EDARADD gene are associated with several ectodermal dysplasia conditions, primarily hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED). This disorder affects ectodermal structures such as hair, teeth, nails, and sweat glands. Mutations in EDARADD can impair the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for the development of these structures, leading to symptoms like thin hair, reduced sweating, and missing teeth (Cluzeau2010Only; Wohlfart2015A). 

In some cases, EDARADD mutations are linked to isolated oligodontia, characterized by the congenital absence of six or more permanent teeth. This condition can occur without other ectodermal symptoms, suggesting a specific role for EDARADD in dental development (Bergendal2011Isolated). 

The gene's mutations can be inherited in both autosomal recessive and dominant forms, contributing to the phenotypic variability observed in affected individuals (Cluzeau2010Only). Some variants, such as p.Ser103Phe, have been associated with non-syndromic tooth agenesis but exhibit low penetrance, indicating that additional genetic factors may influence the clinical presentation (MartínezRomero2019EDA). 

Overall, EDARADD mutations play a significant role in the development of ectodermal dysplasias, highlighting the gene's clinical importance in these conditions.

## Interactions
The EDARADD protein is a crucial component of the ectodysplasin signaling pathway, primarily interacting with the EDAR receptor. This interaction is essential for the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is vital for the development of ectodermal appendages such as hair, teeth, and sweat glands (Sadier2015Tinkering; Cluzeau2010Only). EDARADD acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the recruitment of other proteins like TRAF6, which are involved in transducing downstream signals (Sadier2015Tinkering).

The EDARADD protein has two isoforms, A and B, which share functional domains such as the death domain and TRAF binding sites. These domains are crucial for its interaction with EDAR and other proteins in the signaling pathway (Sadier2015Tinkering). The A isoform is more active in activating the NF-κB pathway compared to the B isoform, although it is downregulated upon pathway activation (Sadier2015Tinkering). The B isoform, however, is more conserved and stable, suggesting it plays a fundamental role in maintaining essential functions of the pathway (Sadier2015Tinkering).

Mutations in EDARADD can affect its interaction with EDAR, potentially altering the multimerization of EDARADD and impacting the signaling pathway (Cluzeau2010Only).
