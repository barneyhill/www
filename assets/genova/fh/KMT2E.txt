# KMT2E

## Overview
KMT2E is a gene that encodes the protein lysine methyltransferase 2E, also known as MLL5, which is a member of the lysine N-methyltransferase 2 family. Despite its classification, the KMT2E protein is characterized by its lack of intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity, distinguishing it from other family members. It contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger and a Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, and Trithorax (SET) domain, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Ali2014Diverse; Lemak2013Solution). The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including differentiation and development, through its interactions with other proteins and complexes, despite its inactive methyltransferase function (Poreba2020Aberrant). KMT2E is associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, such as O'Donnell-Luria-Rodan syndrome, and has potential implications in cancer biology and other non-communicable diseases (Cao2022Case; Velmans2021O’DonnellLuriaRodan).

## Structure
The KMT2E protein, also known as MLL5, is a member of the lysine N-methyltransferase 2 family, characterized by its distinct molecular structure. It contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger and a Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, and Trithorax (SET) domain. The PHD finger is involved in binding to histone H3, specifically recognizing the H3K4me3 mark through a non-canonical mechanism involving a single aromatic residue, W141, and an aspartate residue, D128 (Ali2014Diverse; Lemak2013Solution). This domain is stabilized by two zinc-binding clusters and includes two small antiparallel beta-strands, one alpha-helix, and three long loops (Lemak2013Solution).

The SET domain of KMT2E is atypical compared to other MLL family members, lacking the conserved motifs necessary for intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity. It features a large loop that obstructs substrate docking, preventing interaction with the methyl-donor SAM or histone peptides (Zhang2017MLL5). Despite its lack of intrinsic activity, KMT2E can generate mono- and dimethylated H3K4 marks when post-translationally modified (Ali2014Diverse).

KMT2E also exists in alternative splice variants, such as HsMLL5α, which is implicated in cancer and interacts with proteins like OGT and USP7 (Zhang2017MLL5).

## Function
KMT2E, also known as lysine methyltransferase 2E, is a member of the KMT2 family, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. Despite being classified within the KMT2 family, KMT2E does not exhibit intrinsic methyltransferase activity toward histone substrates, distinguishing it from other family members (Poreba2020Aberrant). KMT2E is more homologous to yeast SET3 and SET4, which suggests a unique evolutionary path and functional role compared to other KMT2 proteins (Poreba2020Aberrant).

The specific function of KMT2E in healthy human cells remains unclear, as no methyltransferase activity has been reported for this protein (Kudithipudi2014Role). However, it is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, potentially influencing transcriptional activation by interacting with other proteins and complexes. This interaction may impact cellular processes such as differentiation and development. The lack of intrinsic methyltransferase activity suggests that KMT2E might play a regulatory role through non-enzymatic functions, possibly by modulating the activity of other proteins or complexes involved in chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation (Poreba2020Aberrant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KMT2E gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, collectively known as O'Donnell-Luria-Rodan syndrome (ODLURO). This syndrome is characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and macrocephaly (Benvenuto2024Phenotypic; Velmans2021O’DonnellLuriaRodan). The severity of these conditions can vary depending on the type of genetic variant present. Missense variants are linked to more severe phenotypes, such as microcephaly and profound intellectual disability, compared to null variants or whole gene deletions (Velmans2021O’DonnellLuriaRodan).

Individuals with heterozygous variants in KMT2E often present with mild intellectual disability, autism, macrocephaly, hypotonia, and epilepsy. Epilepsy is more common in females, while autism is more prevalent in males (O’DonnellLuria2019Heterozygous). The gene is constrained for protein-truncating variation, indicating its potential role as a haploinsufficient gene (O’DonnellLuria2019Heterozygous).

Mouse models with Kmt2e deficiency exhibit growth restriction and increased mortality, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for humans, such as using antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (O’DonnellLuria2019Heterozygous). The KMT2E gene's dysfunction is also associated with non-communicable diseases like cancer and coronary artery disease (Cao2022Case).

## Interactions
KMT2E, also known as MLL5, is involved in various protein interactions that influence chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. Although KMT2E lacks intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity, it can indirectly affect histone methylation by regulating the expression of other histone-modifying enzymes (Zhang2017MLL5). KMT2E interacts with proteins such as p53 and Borealin, which are involved in cell cycle checkpoints and chromosomal stability (Zhang2017MLL5). It also associates with PLK1, a key player in spindle assembly, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Zhang2017MLL5).

KMT2E's PHD finger domain specifically binds to histone H3K4me3, facilitating its recruitment to chromatin and suggesting a role in transcription regulation (Zhang2017MLL5). This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of transcription factors and nucleosome-associated complexes to chromatin. KMT2E is also implicated in histone deacetylation, potentially recruiting the NcoR-HDAC3 complex to transcribed chromatin (Zhang2017MLL5).

In the context of cervical cancer, the HsMLL5β isoform interacts with the transcription factor AP-1, which is essential for the transcriptional activation of the E6/E7 oncogene (Zhang2017MLL5). These interactions underscore KMT2E's involvement in chromatin regulation and its potential implications in cancer biology.
