# TAF11

## Overview
TAF11 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11, a crucial component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a significant role in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. TAF11 forms a histone fold pair with TAF13, facilitating its interaction within the TFIID complex and with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), thereby regulating TBP's DNA-binding activity (Kolesnikova2018Molecular; Gupta2017Architecture). The TAF11/TAF13 complex is involved in the displacement of TATA-box DNA from the TBP/DNA complex, highlighting its regulatory function in transcription initiation (Gupta2017Architecture). Additionally, TAF11 is implicated in the hierarchical co-translational assembly of the TFIID complex, which is essential for efficient transcription initiation (Bernardini2023Hierarchical). The gene's expression and interactions are critical for maintaining cellular functions, and its dysregulation has been associated with various diseases, including cancer.

## Structure
TAF11 is a component of the TFIID complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. TAF11 forms a heterodimer with TAF13, and both contain histone fold domains (HFDs) that facilitate their interaction within the TFIID complex (Kolesnikova2018Molecular; Gupta2017Architecture). This heterodimer is part of a larger hexameric structure within the TFIID complex, which shows structural homology to the archaeal histone hexamer (Kolesnikova2018Molecular).

The TAF11/TAF13 complex interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), competing with TATA-box DNA for binding to TBP. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of transcription initiation, as it can displace TATA-box DNA from the TBP/DNA complex (Gupta2017Architecture). The TAF11/TAF13 complex spans the concave DNA-binding surface of TBP, similar to TATA-box DNA, suggesting a regulatory mechanism in transcription initiation (Gupta2017Architecture).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of TAF11 alone are not provided, its role in forming a histone fold pair with TAF13 is a key structural motif common in DNA-binding proteins (Gupta2017Architecture).

## Function
TAF11 is a component of the TFIID complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. It forms a histone fold pair with TAF13, and together they interact with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a central component of TFIID. This interaction is crucial for regulating TBP's DNA-binding activity, as the TAF11/TAF13 complex can displace TATA-box DNA from a TBP/DNA complex, suggesting a regulatory role in transcription initiation (Gupta2017Architecture).

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), TAF11 is part of a novel TBP-containing TAF complex that includes TAFs 2, 6, and 7. This complex is recruited to active class II genes and is crucial for maintaining the undifferentiated state and self-renewal of hESCs. Altering the composition of TAFs, including TAF11, affects pluripotency and differentiation, indicating its role in the transcriptional regulation necessary for hESC function (Maston2012Noncanonical).

TAF11 is involved in the hierarchical co-translational assembly of the TFIID complex, interacting with TAF13 and potentially forming a ternary complex with TAF1 and TBP. This assembly process is crucial for efficient transcription initiation in cells (Bernardini2023Hierarchical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TAF11 gene can have significant clinical implications. TAF11 is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Disruptions in TAF11 expression or its interactions within the TFIID complex can lead to aberrant gene regulation. Such dysregulation has been implicated in the development of various diseases, including cancer. The precise mechanisms by which TAF11 contributes to oncogenesis are not fully understood, but it is believed that changes in its expression or function can alter the transcriptional landscape of cells, promoting uncontrolled cell growth and division. Additionally, mutations in TAF11 may disrupt normal cellular processes, potentially leading to pathological conditions. Understanding the role of TAF11 in these diseases could provide insights into novel therapeutic targets for conditions associated with its dysregulation.

## Interactions
TAF11 is a component of the TFIID complex, which plays a crucial role in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. It forms a stable dimer with TAF13 through their histone fold domains, and this dimer interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form a ternary complex (Gupta2017Architecture). The TAF11/TAF13 dimer engages the concave DNA-binding surface of TBP, which affects TBP's ability to bind DNA, suggesting a regulatory role in transcription initiation (Gupta2017Architecture).

TAF11 also interacts with other TAFs, such as TAF6, TAF10, and TAF12, as part of the TFIID complex (Yatherajam2003Proteinprotein). These interactions are not solely mediated by the histone fold domains, indicating a complex network of protein-protein interactions within the TFIID complex (Yatherajam2003Proteinprotein).

In the cytoplasm, TAF11 is associated with TAF7, suggesting potential novel interactions and the formation of a TAF7/TAF11/TAF13 complex, which may serve as an assembly intermediate for larger TFIID modules (Gupta2017Architecture). This dynamic assembly process highlights TAF11's role in the regulation and assembly of the TFIID complex.
