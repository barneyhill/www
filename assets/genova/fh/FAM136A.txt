# FAM136A

## Overview
FAM136A is a gene that encodes a protein known as family with sequence similarity 136 member A, which is integral to mitochondrial function and maintenance. This protein is localized within the mitochondria and plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, including the balance between fission and fusion processes essential for cellular energy production and homeostasis. Disruptions in FAM136A function can lead to impaired energy production and have been implicated in various mitochondrial disorders. Clinically, mutations in FAM136A have been associated with familial Meniere's disease, a disorder affecting the inner ear, and may also have implications in other conditions such as myasthenia gravis (Nel2019Profiling; Oh2020Rare; MartinezGomez2020Clinical). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the gene's role in these diseases and its broader clinical significance.

## Function
FAM136A encodes a protein that is integral to mitochondrial function and maintenance. This protein is localized within the mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and integrity. It is involved in cellular processes that are essential for energy production and homeostasis. By contributing to the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, FAM136A helps maintain the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion, processes that are vital for mitochondrial health and function. This balance is necessary for the proper distribution of mitochondria during cell division and for the removal of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy, a specialized form of autophagy. The protein's role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity ensures that cells have a reliable supply of energy, which is critical for various cellular functions and overall organismal health. Disruptions in the function of FAM136A can lead to impaired energy production and have been implicated in various mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM136A gene have been associated with familial Meniere's disease (MD), a disorder of the inner ear characterized by vertigo, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss. Research has identified rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in FAM136A that segregate with the MD phenotype in affected family members, suggesting a genetic link to the disease (MartinezGomez2020Clinical). A specific missense variant, c.238G > T, p.Ala80Ser, has been identified in patients with sporadic MD, indicating that FAM136A may contribute to the genetic predisposition to this condition (Oh2020Rare).

The FAM136A gene encodes a mitochondrial protein expressed in the utricle and cochlea during prenatal development, which is suspected to play a crucial role in early inner ear development (MartinezGomez2020Clinical). Alterations in FAM136A expression have also been observed in the ophthalmoplegic subphenotype of myasthenia gravis (OP-MG), where it is considered one of the susceptibility genes. This suggests that FAM136A may have broader implications in other conditions involving altered gene expression (Nel2019Profiling). However, the association of FAM136A with MD and other diseases is not yet widely established, and further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance (MartinezGomez2020Clinical).
