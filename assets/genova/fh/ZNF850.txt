# ZNF850

## Overview
ZNF850 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 850, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of DNA methylation, particularly in human male germ cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the methylation levels of the LTR12C family of retroelements. By binding to specific DNA motifs, zinc finger protein 850 helps prevent the demethylation of these elements, thereby contributing to genomic stability during spermatogenesis (Fukuda2022Potential). Additionally, ZNF850 is recognized as a highly connected gene within coexpression networks in human oocytes, suggesting its broader significance in gene regulatory networks, although its functions outside germ cell development remain less understood (Biase2017Oocyte).

## Function
ZNF850 is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which plays a significant role in the regulation of DNA methylation in human male germ cells. Specifically, ZNF850 is involved in maintaining the DNA methylation levels of the LTR12C family of retroelements, contributing to their resistance to demethylation. This function is crucial during spermatogenesis, as it helps suppress the inappropriate activation of transposon-embedded enhancer functions, which could otherwise lead to genomic instability (Fukuda2022Potential).

The protein achieves this by binding to specific motifs located at the 5′ portion of LTR12C consensus sequences, which correlates with higher methylation levels. This binding suggests a mechanism by which ZNF850 helps maintain the methylation status of these elements, thereby playing a protective role in the development of human primordial germ cells (Fukuda2022Potential).

ZNF850 is also identified as a highly connected gene within coexpression networks in human oocytes, indicating its potential importance in gene regulatory networks, although its specific function in healthy human cells outside of germ cell development is not fully detailed (Biase2017Oocyte).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF850 is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is known for its role in DNA methylation resistance, particularly in human male germ cells. ZNF850 is specifically associated with the DNA demethylation resistance of the LTR12C family of retroelements. This resistance is crucial for maintaining appropriate methylation states during spermatogenesis. ZNF850 binds to specific motifs in the 5′ portion of LTR12C consensus sequences, which are more frequently present in highly methylated LTR12C copies. This binding suggests that ZNF850 plays a role in maintaining DNA methylation levels, thereby preventing demethylation during germ cell development (Fukuda2022Potential).

The interaction of ZNF850 with nucleic acids is crucial for its function in DNA methylation resistance. Lowly methylated LTR12C copies often have mismatches at specific positions in the predicted binding sites, which may affect ZNF850 binding. This indicates that ZNF850's interaction with DNA at certain motifs is essential for its role in DNA methylation resistance (Fukuda2022Potential). However, specific interactions of ZNF850 with other proteins or its involvement in multiprotein complexes are not detailed in the available context.
