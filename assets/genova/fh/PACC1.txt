# PACC1

## Overview
The PACC1 gene encodes the proton-activated chloride channel 1 (PAC), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in chloride ion transport and pH sensing within cells. This channel is primarily located in the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments, where it contributes to maintaining ion homeostasis and regulating endosomal acidification. Structurally, PAC is a homotrimer, with each subunit comprising a transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain, which undergoes conformational changes in response to pH variations. The channel is activated under acidic conditions, facilitating chloride ion movement to prevent hyper-acidification of endosomes, thereby supporting various physiological processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis. Due to its critical functions, alterations in PACC1 expression or activity have been linked to several pathological conditions, including ischemic stroke, schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases (Sobue2023Neuroinflammation; Ruan2020Structures; OseiOwusu2021Protonactivated).

## Structure
The PACC1 gene encodes the proton-activated chloride channel (PAC), a trimeric protein involved in chloride ion transport. Each subunit of PAC consists of a transmembrane domain (TMD) and an extracellular domain (ECD). The TMD is composed of two helices, TM1 and TM2, which form the ion-conducting pore. TM2, in particular, is lined with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, contributing to its function as a pore-lining helix (Zhao2022A; Ruan2020Structures).

The ECD is heavily glycosylated and undergoes significant conformational changes in response to pH variations, moving vertically towards the TMD and contracting towards the pore axis under acidic conditions (Ruan2020Structures). The ECD shares structural similarities with the ECD of ASIC channels but lacks the large exterior helical structures, indicating a distinct pH-sensing mechanism (Ruan2020Structures).

Key residues such as histidine 98 at the ECD-TMD interface play a crucial role in pH sensing, while lysine 319 on TM2 is critical for anion selectivity (Ruan2020Structures). The PAC channel's quaternary structure is a homotrimer, with each subunit contributing to the overall assembly and function of the channel (OseiOwusu2021Structures).

## Function
The PACC1 gene encodes the proton-activated chloride channel (PAC), which plays a crucial role in maintaining ion homeostasis and pH balance within cells. This channel is primarily active in the plasma membrane and traffics to early and recycling endosomes, where it regulates endosomal acidification and transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis (OseiOwusu2021Protonactivated). PAC functions as a pH sensor, activated by acidic conditions, with a threshold of pH 5.5 at room temperature and pH 6.0 at 37°C, making it well-suited for the acidic environment of endosomes (OseiOwusu2021Protonactivated).

In healthy human cells, PAC mediates an acid-sensitive chloride current, which is essential for maintaining endosomal pH and chloride levels. This balance is crucial for the trafficking and recycling of membrane receptors, impacting various physiological processes (OseiOwusu2021Protonactivated). The channel prevents hyper-acidification by releasing chloride ions from the endosomal lumen, thus maintaining optimal endosomal pH and facilitating efficient receptor-mediated endocytosis (OseiOwusu2021Protonactivated). PAC's role in these processes suggests its importance in normal cellular physiology and its potential involvement in broader organismal functions, such as iron uptake and hypoxia-induced erythropoiesis (OseiOwusu2021Protonactivated).

## Clinical Significance
The PACC1 gene, encoding the proton-activated chloride channel 1, has been implicated in several pathological conditions due to its role in mediating chloride ion transport in response to extracellular acidic environments. Alterations in PACC1 expression or function can contribute to acid-induced neuronal cell death, particularly in the context of ischemic stroke. The channel's activation under acidic conditions leads to chloride influx, resulting in cell swelling and death, which exacerbates brain injury during ischemic events (OseiOwusu2020PAC).

In schizophrenia, genetic variants in PACC1 have been associated with differential responses to risperidone treatment. Although the clinical significance of these variants is not fully understood, they suggest a potential role for PACC1 in modulating treatment outcomes (Zhao2022Different).

PACC1 is also involved in neurodegenerative processes. In Alzheimer's disease, dysfunctions in microglial and oligodendrocyte cells, which include alterations in PACC1 expression, may contribute to early brain pathology (Sobue2023Neuroinflammation). Additionally, in Parkinson's disease, interactions involving PACC1 are linked to mitochondrial damage and mitophagy, processes that are crucial in the disease's progression (Grassi2018Identification).
