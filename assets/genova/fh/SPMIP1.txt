# SPMIP1

## Overview
SPMIP1, or sperm microtubule inner protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a critical role in the structural integrity and function of sperm cells. The protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, primarily involved in the formation and stabilization of microtubules within the sperm tail. It is active in the axoneme, the core structure of the sperm flagellum, which is essential for motility and proper sperm movement, thereby contributing significantly to male fertility. The protein contains the SNYG module, a conserved motif with microtubule-binding properties, suggesting its evolutionary adaptation to bind tubulin heterodimers. This module is linked to a short α-helix, indicating a specialized function in stabilizing microtubule structures. Beyond its role in sperm cells, SPMIP1 is implicated in cilia biology, as gene co-expression analysis shows its co-regulation with ciliary genes, suggesting its involvement in cilia-related processes (Andersen2024Uncovering).

## Function
SPMIP1, or sperm microtubule inner protein 1, is involved in the structural integrity and function of sperm cells, particularly in the formation and stabilization of microtubules within the sperm tail. This protein is active in the axoneme, the core structure of the sperm flagellum, which is essential for motility and proper sperm movement, thereby playing a crucial role in fertility (Andersen2024Uncovering).

SPMIP1 is associated with the SNYG module, a conserved motif with microtubule-binding properties, suggesting its evolution to bind tubulin heterodimers. This module is linked to a short α-helix, indicating a specialized function in stabilizing microtubule structures (Andersen2024Uncovering). The presence of the SNYG module in proteins like SPMIP1 suggests potential ciliary functions, as these proteins are shown to occupy the lumen of cilia outer doublets in airway epithelial cells (Andersen2024Uncovering).

The protein's role in cilia biology is supported by gene co-expression analysis, which indicates that SPMIP1 is co-regulated with ciliary genes, highlighting its involvement in cilia-related processes (Andersen2024Uncovering). This suggests that SPMIP1 may contribute to the structural and functional integrity of cilia, similar to its role in sperm cells.
