# DNAAF4

## Overview
The DNAAF4 gene encodes the dynein axonemal assembly factor 4 protein, which is integral to the assembly and function of motile cilia. This protein is categorized as a co-chaperone, playing a pivotal role in the preassembly of axonemal dynein arms, essential for ciliary and flagellar motility. DNAAF4 contains structural domains such as the CS domain and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions necessary for the recruitment of chaperone proteins like HSP90. These interactions are crucial for the proper folding and stabilization of dynein heavy chains, ensuring the correct assembly of outer and inner dynein arms (Fabczak2019Role; Lennon2022Strongly). Mutations in DNAAF4 are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, leading to respiratory issues and infertility (Guo2022Case; Aprea2021Defects).

## Structure
The DNAAF4 gene encodes a protein involved in the preassembly of axonemal dynein arms, essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. The human DNAAF4 protein consists of 420 amino acids and includes specific structural domains such as a CS domain and three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains (Guo2022Case). These TPR domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for the assembly and stabilization of dynein arms. The presence of these domains suggests a role in recruiting chaperone proteins like HSP90, which is important for protein folding and stability (Lennon2022Strongly).

The DNAAF4 protein's tertiary structure is not detailed in the available context, but the presence of TPR domains indicates a likely involvement in forming a scaffold for protein complexes. The quaternary structure involves its integration into a co-chaperone complex with other proteins, such as DNAAF6, which is necessary for dynein assembly (Lennon2022Strongly). The pathogenic variants identified in DNAAF4, such as p.Arg330Trp and p.Arg245Ter, highlight the importance of its structural integrity for proper ciliary function (Guo2022Case). The absence of detailed information on post-translational modifications or splice variants limits further structural insights.

## Function
DNAAF4, also known as dynein axonemal assembly factor 4, plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of motile cilia by facilitating the proper assembly of dynein arms, which are essential for ciliary motility. In healthy human cells, DNAAF4 is involved in the cytoplasmic preassembly of axonemal dynein arms, acting as a co-chaperone that forms complexes with other proteins such as DNAAF2 and Hsp90. This interaction is critical for linking dynein arm assembly to Hsp90, ensuring the correct folding and stabilization of dynein heavy chains (Fabczak2019Role; Lennon2022Strongly).

DNAAF4 contains TPR and CS domains, which are important for recruiting HSP90 and facilitating the assembly of dynein motors before they are transported to the cilium. This process is essential for the proper organization of outer dynein arms (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs) in cilia, which are critical for their motility (Lennon2022Strongly; Aprea2021Defects). Mutations in DNAAF4 can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), characterized by defects in motile cilia, resulting in symptoms such as chronic respiratory issues and male infertility (Fabczak2019Role; Aprea2021Defects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAAF4 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by defects in the structure or function of cilia. These defects lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including chronic respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus, a condition where internal organs are mirrored from their normal positions (Demir2022Novel; Guo2022Case). PCD is also linked to infertility, particularly in males, due to a condition known as asthenoteratozoospermia, which is characterized by reduced sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology (Guo2022Case).

The DNAAF4 gene plays a crucial role in the assembly of dynein arms, which are essential for ciliary motility. Mutations in DNAAF4 can lead to defects in the assembly of outer dynein arms (ODAs) and a subset of inner dynein arms (IDAs), resulting in impaired ciliary function (Lennon2022Strongly). Additionally, scoliosis, a spinal malformation, has been observed in some patients with DNAAF4 mutations, suggesting a potential link between these mutations and skeletal abnormalities (Guo2022Case). The gene's involvement in ciliary dynein assembly is conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in ciliary function (Lennon2022Strongly).

## Interactions
DNAAF4, also known as DYX1C1, is involved in the assembly of axonemal dynein motors, crucial for ciliary movement. It forms part of an R2TP-like co-chaperone complex with DNAAF6 (PIH1D3) in Drosophila, facilitating the assembly of outer dynein arms (ODAs) and a subset of inner dynein arms (IDAs) (Lennon2022Strongly). In humans, DNAAF4 interacts with Hsp90 through its TPR domains, forming a co-chaperone complex with DNAAF2 and Hsp90, which is essential for linking the assembly of axonemal dynein to Hsp90 (Fabczak2019Role). This interaction is crucial for the stability of dynein arm heavy chains (Fabczak2019Role).

In Drosophila, DNAAF4, despite lacking the TPR domain, can still form complexes with DNAAF6, Pontin, and Reptin, although the interaction with DNAAF6 is weaker compared to the mouse proteins (Lennon2022Strongly). The truncated version of mouse DNAAF4 (mDnaaf4ΔTPR) shows poor binding to mouse DNAAF6, highlighting the importance of the TPR domain for this interaction (Lennon2022Strongly). DNAAF4 also interacts with other proteins involved in dynein arm assembly, such as DNAAF1/LRRC50/ODA7, and is part of a complex with DNAAF7, FKBP8, and Hsp90, which is involved in the maturation of dynein heavy chains (Fabczak2019Role).
