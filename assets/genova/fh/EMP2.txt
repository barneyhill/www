# EMP2

## Overview
Epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) is a gene that encodes a tetraspan transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. The EMP2 protein is a member of the epithelial membrane protein family, characterized by its four transmembrane domains and its role in modulating the composition of lipid rafts and protein trafficking to the cell surface (Wadehra2008Steroid; Ahmat2019The). EMP2 is expressed in several tissues, including the lung and endometrium, where it plays critical roles in processes such as alveolar epithelial cell differentiation and blastocyst implantation (Wadehra2008Steroid; Zhang2022Unraveling). The protein's interactions with integrins and other cell signaling molecules are essential for its function in cellular adhesion and signal transduction (Zhang2022Unraveling). Clinically, EMP2 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and prognosis, acting as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the cancer type (Wang2019EMP2; Gordon2013EMP2).

## Structure
The EMP2 protein is a member of the epithelial membrane protein family, characterized by four transmembrane domains and approximately 160 amino acid residues (Zhang2022Unraveling; Ahmat2019The). It shares about 40% of its amino acid sequence with PMP22 and EMP1, indicating a degree of structural conservation within this protein family (Zhang2022Unraveling). EMP2 contains two extracellular domains and small intracellular regions, which are typical features of this protein family (Ahmat2019The).

The protein has several post-translational modifications, including three N-linked glycosylation sites on its first extracellular loop at positions 44, 47, and 52, and phosphorylation sites at positions 116, 141, and 142 (Zhang2022Unraveling). These modifications are crucial for its function and interactions, affecting protein stability and cellular processes (Zhang2022Unraveling).

EMP2 lacks an N-myristoylation region but includes a casein kinase two phosphorylation region and a protein kinase C phosphorylation site, which are important for its role in cell signaling (Zhang2022Unraveling). The protein is involved in forming protein signaling complexes, interacting with integrins and caveolin, and regulating cellular processes (Zhang2022Unraveling).

## Function
Epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) is a tetraspan protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. It is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it influences the composition of lipid rafts and the trafficking of proteins to the cell surface (Wadehra2008Steroid). EMP2 interacts with integrins and other cell signaling pathways, playing a crucial role in cellular adhesion and signal transduction (Zhang2022Unraveling).

In the lung, EMP2 is highly expressed in type 1 alveolar epithelial cells and is involved in the differentiation of type 2 alveolar epithelial cells to type 1 cells, a process regulated by Wnt signaling. This differentiation is essential for maintaining lung function and is facilitated by EMP2's interaction with integrins, affecting cell adhesion and surfactant production (Zhang2022Unraveling). EMP2 also plays a role in neutrophil migration to the alveolar cavity, which is crucial for lung immunity (Zhang2022Unraveling).

In the endometrium, EMP2 is necessary for blastocyst implantation, as it regulates the trafficking of integrins and other molecules to lipid rafts, forming receptor-protein complexes essential for cell adhesion and invasion (Wadehra2008Steroid). EMP2 expression is modulated by steroid hormones, particularly progesterone, which increases its expression and surface translocation during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (Wadehra2008Steroid).

## Clinical Significance
Epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions influencing disease progression and prognosis. In endometrial cancer, EMP2 is upregulated and serves as an early predictor of cancer development. Its expression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, higher clinical stages, and poor survival outcomes. EMP2 promotes angiogenesis through the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), contributing to tumor vascularization and growth (Gordon2013EMP2; Habeeb2010Epithelial).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), EMP2 is highly expressed and linked to poor survival. It enhances tumor growth and invasion by activating the integrin-FAK-Src signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell motility and invasion (Qin2014Epithelial). Conversely, in melanoma, EMP2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with lower expression levels observed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Overexpression of EMP2 in melanoma cell lines leads to decreased cell proliferation, suggesting its potential role in inhibiting tumor growth (Wang2019EMP2).

EMP2's role varies across different cancers, acting as an oncogene in some and a tumor suppressor in others, highlighting its complex involvement in cancer biology (Zhang2022Unraveling).

## Interactions
Epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) is involved in various interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. EMP2 is known to interact with adhesion molecules such as CD47, ICAM-1, and β3 integrin, which are crucial for the transepithelial migration of neutrophils into the alveolar space. These interactions are essential for the proper display of these molecules on the cell surface, facilitating neutrophil migration (Lin2019Epithelial).

EMP2 is associated with lipid rafts, where it plays a role in organizing membrane microdomains. It interacts with cholesterol through CRAC and CARC motifs, which are important for its raft-scaffolding functions. These interactions help stabilize cholesterol in membranes, supporting raft assembly (Lin2019Epithelial).

EMP2 also interacts with caveolin proteins, particularly caveolin-2, which is necessary for its function in supporting adhesion molecule display and neutrophil migration. In EMP2-deficient cells, there is an upregulation of caveolins, indicating that EMP2 may regulate their expression and function (Lin2019Epithelial).

In the endometrium, EMP2 is regulated by steroid hormones, which influence its expression and localization. Progesterone induces EMP2 protein expression and its translocation to the plasma membrane, affecting its interactions with other membrane proteins (Wadehra2008Steroid).
