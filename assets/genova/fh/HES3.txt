# HES3

## Overview
HES3 is a gene that encodes the hes family bHLH transcription factor 3, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating developmental processes and maintaining the undifferentiated state of progenitor and stem cells. It is involved in various signaling pathways, including the Notch and STAT3-Ser pathways, influencing cell fate determination, survival, and differentiation (Katoh2007Integrative; Masjkur2014Hes3). HES3 is expressed in several tissues, including pancreatic islets and neural stem cells, where it regulates gene expression and cellular functions such as insulin release and neural differentiation (Poser2013The; Masjkur2014Hes3). The gene's expression and activity are implicated in various clinical conditions, including non-small cell lung cancer and diabetes, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Fang2019Hes3; Masjkur2014Hes3).

## Structure
The HES3 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of HES3 includes a bHLH domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization, and a WRPW motif at the C-terminus that recruits corepressors (Katoh2007Integrative; Hirata2000Generation). The secondary structure likely involves alpha helices within the bHLH domain, typical of proteins in this family, although specific details are not provided in the context.

HES3 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing and promoter usage. In humans, variant 2 of HES3 is longer than variant 1 by 22 amino acids in the N-terminal region, and a nucleotide substitution results in an 8-amino-acid elongation at the C-terminus (Katoh2007Integrative). These isoforms may have distinct functional roles, as seen in other species where different variants show varied DNA-binding capabilities (Katoh2007Integrative).

The quaternary structure of HES3 involves dimerization, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor. HES3 can form heterodimers, which may influence its regulatory activities (Masjkur2014Hes3). Specific post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are not detailed in the context provided.

## Function
The HES3 gene encodes a transcription factor that is part of the Hes/Hey family, which plays a significant role in regulating developmental processes in progenitor cells across various tissues. In healthy human cells, HES3 is expressed in pancreatic islets, where it regulates gene expression, cell growth, and insulin release. It influences the expression of key genes such as insulin and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), which are crucial for pancreatic development and function (Masjkur2014Hes3). HES3 is involved in the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/STAT3-serine pathway, activated by insulin, promoting cell growth (Masjkur2014Hes3).

HES3 is also expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells, where it maintains the undifferentiated state and regulates pluripotency and differentiation. This is achieved through an embryonic stem cell-specific network of transcription factors, including NANOG, SOX2, and POU5F1 (Katoh2007Integrative). In neural stem cells, HES3 is involved in the STAT3-Ser signaling axis, distinct from the JAK-STAT pathway, and is crucial for cell fate determination and survival (Poser2013The). HES3's expression is regulated by various signaling pathways, highlighting its role in maintaining stem cell populations and influencing cell differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
The HES3 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cell proliferation and differentiation. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), HES3 expression is significantly elevated in cancerous tissues compared to normal lung tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor differentiation, advanced TNM stages, lymph node metastasis, and shorter survival times for patients. In vitro studies have shown that HES3 overexpression in lung cancer cell lines enhances cell proliferation and invasion, while its downregulation inhibits these processes. HES3 regulates the expression of Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3, and MMP7, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and cancer cell invasion, suggesting its contribution to the malignant phenotype of NSCLC (Fang2019Hes3).

HES3 also plays a role in pancreatic islet function, where it regulates gene expression, cell growth, and insulin release. Mice lacking HES3 show increased sensitivity to streptozotocin-induced damage, leading to earlier onset of diabetic symptoms, indicating its protective role against pancreatic damage. This suggests that alterations in HES3 expression could be associated with diabetes and related metabolic disorders (Masjkur2014Hes3).

## Interactions
HES3, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It can form heterodimers with other bHLH transcription factors, although specific partners are not detailed in the provided context (Torres-Machorro2021Homodimeric). HES3 is also implicated in the Notch signaling pathway, where it acts as an indirect target of a non-canonical branch of this pathway. In rodent neural stem cell cultures, activation of the Notch receptor by ligands such as Delta4 and Jagged1 leads to the transcription of HES3 through a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway (Masjkur2014Hes3).

HES3 has two isoforms, Hes3a and Hes3b. Hes3a cannot bind DNA but can form heterodimers, while Hes3b can bind DNA and form heterodimers, suggesting a role in direct DNA interaction and transcriptional regulation (Masjkur2014Hes3). In pancreatic islet cells, HES3 is involved in regulating gene expression, cell growth, and insulin release, potentially through interactions with transcription factors like Pdx1, which binds to the HES3 promoter (Masjkur2014Hes3). These interactions highlight HES3's role in modulating gene expression and cellular functions in specific tissues.
