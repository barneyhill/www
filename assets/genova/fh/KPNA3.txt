# KPNA3

## Overview
KPNA3, or karyopherin subunit alpha 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the nuclear import machinery of human cells. The protein, karyopherin subunit alpha 3, functions as an adaptor in the nucleocytoplasmic transport system, recognizing nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins and facilitating their transport into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. This process is crucial for regulating gene expression, cell cycle progression, and signal transduction, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sowa2018Karyopherin). KPNA3 is implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, where its altered expression or interactions can influence disease progression and treatment resistance (Hu2019KPNA3; Sowa2018Karyopherin).

## Structure
KPNA3, or karyopherin subunit alpha 3, is a protein involved in nuclear transport. It typically consists of an N-terminal importin beta-binding (IBB) domain and multiple armadillo (ARM) repeats, which form a superhelical structure. These ARM repeats facilitate binding to nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins. Post-translational modifications may include phosphorylation, influencing its transport activity. KPNA3 can exist in different splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions.

## Function
KPNA3, also known as karyopherin subunit alpha 3, is a crucial component of the nuclear import machinery in human cells. It functions as an adaptor protein that recognizes nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins, facilitating their transport into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. This process is essential for regulating gene expression, cell cycle progression, and signal transduction, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Sowa2018Karyopherin).

KPNA3 operates by binding to importin beta, forming a complex that translocates NLS-containing proteins from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. This transport is vital for the proper localization and activity of various proteins, ensuring that they reach their nuclear targets to perform their biological functions (Sowa2018Karyopherin). In healthy cells, KPNA3 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, playing a significant role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport system (Sowa2018Karyopherin).

The activity of KPNA3 is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions, as it regulates the intracellular localization of proteins, which is necessary for the proper execution of cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Sowa2018Karyopherin).

## Clinical Significance
KPNA3 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KPNA3 overexpression is associated with resistance to sorafenib, a common treatment for advanced HCC. This resistance is mediated through the activation of the AKT-ERK signaling axis and the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances tumor growth and invasiveness (Hu2019KPNA3). High KPNA3 expression correlates with lower overall survival rates in HCC patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting treatment response (Hu2019KPNA3).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), KPNA3 expression is upregulated by the long non-coding RNA DLEU1, which recruits SMARCA1 to the KPNA3 promoter. This interaction promotes CRC progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating that the DLEU1-SMARCA1-KPNA3 axis could be a target for therapeutic intervention (Liu2018LncRNA).

KPNA3 also plays a role in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) by controlling the nuclear localization of the ataxin-3 protein. Altering KPNA3 expression can mitigate disease progression by reducing ataxin-3 aggregation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders (Sowa2018Karyopherin).

## Interactions
KPNA3, also known as karyopherin subunit alpha 3, is involved in the nuclear import of proteins by forming a complex with importin beta (KPNB1) to transport proteins with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) into the nucleus. In the context of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), KPNA3 interacts with ataxin-3, facilitating its nuclear import and aggregation. This interaction is proposed to occur through the formation of a trimeric complex with KPNB1 and ataxin-3, enhancing the nuclear translocation of ataxin-3 (Sowa2018Karyopherin).

KPNA3 also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases by influencing the nuclear localization of proteins such as TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ataxin-3 in SCA3. In Drosophila models, knockdown of KPNA3 reduced nuclear aggregation of ataxin-3 and improved neurodegeneration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sowa2018Karyopherin).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KPNA3 is implicated in promoting tumor growth and drug resistance. It interacts with TWIST, a key mediator in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and enhances the activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, contributing to sorafenib resistance (Hu2019KPNA3).
