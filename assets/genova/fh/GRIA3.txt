# GRIA3

## Overview
The GRIA3 gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 3 (GluA3), a critical component of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, which are integral to fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. As a transmembrane receptor, GluA3 plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory by facilitating the flow of ions such as sodium and potassium across neuronal membranes upon activation by the neurotransmitter glutamate (Gécz1999Characterization; Traynelis2010Glutamate). The GRIA3 gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential function in brain activity and cognitive processes (Gécz1999Characterization). Mutations in GRIA3 have been linked to various neurological disorders, including intellectual disability and epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Philips2014Xexome; Piard2020The). The protein's interactions with auxiliary proteins and its post-translational modifications further modulate its synaptic localization and function, contributing to the receptor's diverse roles in the nervous system (Sun2021Xlinked; Traynelis2010Glutamate).

## Structure
The GRIA3 gene encodes the GluA3 subunit of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, which are crucial for fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The primary structure of the GluA3 subunit consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of the receptor's ligand-binding and transmembrane domains (Piard2020The).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, allowing the formation of specific domains such as the extracellular amino-terminal domain, the agonist-binding domain, and the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (Piard2020The). The quaternary structure of the AMPA receptor is a tetrameric assembly composed of combinations of four subunits: GluA1 to GluA4, including GluA3 (Ripka2010Glutamate).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the receptor's function. The GRIA3 gene also expresses different isoforms through alternative splicing, known as flip/flop isoforms, which provide distinct kinetic behaviors and contribute to the functional diversity of AMPA receptors (Rinaldi2021Myoclonic). These structural features are essential for the receptor's role in synaptic plasticity and neurological processes.

## Function
The GRIA3 gene encodes a subunit of the AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor, which plays a critical role in mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. These receptors are essential for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, as they facilitate the flow of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane upon activation by glutamate, a major neurotransmitter (Gécz1999Characterization; Traynelis2010Glutamate).

In healthy human cells, GRIA3 is predominantly active in the postsynaptic membrane of neurons, where it contributes to the regulation of synaptic strength and plasticity. This regulation is crucial for processes such as long-term potentiation, a cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory (Traynelis2010Glutamate). The GRIA3 gene is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in brain function (Gécz1999Characterization).

The GRIA3 protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its trafficking, synaptic localization, and channel function. These modifications are vital for the receptor's role in synaptic plasticity and receptor function, although the specific contributions of these modifications are not fully understood (Traynelis2010Glutamate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRIA3 gene, which encodes a subunit of the AMPA receptor, have been linked to a variety of neurological disorders. The c.2477G > A variant, resulting in a G826D amino acid substitution, is associated with neurological symptoms such as an exaggerated startle reflex, chorea, and multifocal myoclonus. This variant leads to a significant reduction in receptor expression on the cell surface and decreased current responses, indicating a loss-of-function mutation (Piard2020The). 

GRIA3 mutations are also implicated in intellectual disability (ID). A missense mutation, c.1888G > C (p. Gly630Arg), has been associated with severe ID, autistic features, and epilepsy. This mutation affects the protein's function by altering ionic interactions within the receptor (Philips2014Xexome). Other mutations, such as partial duplications and frameshift mutations, have been linked to X-linked mental retardation, often resulting in reduced GRIA3 transcript levels and altered receptor function (Bonnet2009Aberrant; Chiyonobu2007Partial).

Additionally, GRIA3 has been associated with migraine susceptibility. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in GRIA3, rs3761555, has been linked to migraine with aura, suggesting a role for glutamate dysfunction in migraine pathophysiology (Maher2013Association).

## Interactions
The GRIA3 gene encodes the GLUA3 subunit of AMPA receptors, which are integral to fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. GLUA3 interacts with other AMPA receptor subunits, such as GLUA2, to form heteromeric receptor complexes. These interactions are crucial for the functional properties of the receptors, including their gating kinetics and synaptic transmission capabilities (Sun2021Xlinked).

The GLUA3 subunit also interacts with auxiliary proteins like Transmembrane AMPA Receptor Regulatory Proteins (TARPs) and Cornichon Homologs (CNIHs). These auxiliary proteins modulate the receptor's gating kinetics and trafficking. For instance, TARP γ-2 and CNIH2 have been shown to influence the kinetics of GLUA3-containing receptors, particularly in the presence of the GLUA3_R660T variant, which is associated with altered synaptic transmission and epileptic phenotypes (Sun2021Xlinked).

In the brain, the interactions of GLUA3 with these auxiliary proteins are region-specific, affecting receptor composition and function. For example, TARP γ-8 is more abundant in the hippocampus, influencing the interaction dynamics of AMPA receptors in this region (Chen2014Interaction). These interactions are essential for the proper localization, stability, and function of AMPA receptors, impacting synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions.
