# DEFB109B

## Overview
DEFB109B is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 109B, which is part of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides play a crucial role in the innate immune system by providing a first line of defense against a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Defensin beta 109B is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide and is involved in disrupting the membrane integrity of microbial cells, leading to their destruction. The expression of DEFB109B and its protein product is regulated by various factors, including inflammatory cytokines and microbial components, which can modulate its activity in response to infection (Qiu2020aarFDC).
