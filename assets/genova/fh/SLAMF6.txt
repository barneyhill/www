# SLAMF6

## Overview
SLAMF6, or Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 6, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein involved in the regulation of immune responses. The SLAMF6 protein, also known as CD352, is predominantly expressed on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, where it functions as a co-receptor that modulates immune cell activation and signaling pathways. This receptor is part of the SLAM family, which plays a critical role in immune cell interactions and signaling, particularly through its involvement in the formation of the immunological synapse and integrin activation (Hajaj2020SLAMF6​; Dragovich2019SLAMF6). SLAMF6 is implicated in various immune processes, including T cell activation, proliferation, and restimulation-induced cell death (RICD), and has been associated with several clinical conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Dragovich2019SLAMF6; Yigit2019SLAMF6).

## Structure


## Function
SLAMF6, also known as CD352, is a receptor involved in the regulation of immune cell functions, particularly in T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. It functions as an activating co-receptor on T cells, enhancing T cell receptor (TCR) activity when clustered, which is essential for its role in augmenting the TCR pathway (Dragovich2019SLAMF6). SLAMF6 is constitutively expressed on both resting and activated T cells, indicating it is not a marker of exhaustion (Hajaj2020SLAMF6​). It is involved in the polarization to the immunological synapse during T cell-antigen-presenting cell (APC) conjugation, which is crucial for T cell activation and adhesion (Dragovich2019SLAMF6).

SLAMF6 also plays a role in integrin activation, which is important for leukocyte extravasation and potentially T cell tumor infiltration (Dragovich2019SLAMF6). It is involved in the activation and proliferation of T cells, particularly in the absence of CD28, by recruiting SLAM-associated protein (SAP) to its phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail, leading to downstream signaling events (Yigit2019SLAMF6). SLAMF6's role in immune regulation is further highlighted by its involvement in restimulation-induced cell death (RICD), a mechanism that constrains T cell expansion by inducing apoptosis of effector T cells (Yigit2019SLAMF6).

## Clinical Significance
SLAMF6 has significant clinical implications in various diseases due to its role in immune regulation. In X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) disease, blocking SLAMF6 with antibodies can restore T cell function against B cell targets, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Dragovich2019SLAMF6). In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polymorphisms in SLAMF6 are linked to enhanced receptor signaling, leading to altered B and T cell functions and contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Dragovich2019SLAMF6; Yigit2019SLAMF6).

SLAMF6 is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In a Chinese population, increased SLAMF6 expression was observed in RA patients, with specific genetic variants like rs148363003 linked to higher expression levels and disease severity (Xia2022SLAMF6). In cancer, SLAMF6 expression is correlated with favorable outcomes in certain types, such as cervical and head and neck cancers, and its engagement enhances T cell activation, suggesting a role in cancer prognosis and therapy (Dragovich2019SLAMF6). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), targeting SLAMF6 with monoclonal antibodies has shown promise in reducing leukemic burden, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in B cell malignancies (Yigit2019SLAMF6).

## Interactions
SLAMF6, also known as CD352, is a member of the SLAM family of receptors that participates in various protein interactions crucial for immune cell signaling. It interacts with the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) and EAT-2, which are adaptor proteins that modulate immune responses. These interactions are facilitated by the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) in the cytoplasmic domain of SLAMF6, leading to the recruitment of SAP and EAT-2, which are essential for activating signaling pathways in natural killer (NK) cells (Claus2019SLAM; Yigit2019SLAMF6).

SLAMF6 also interacts with SHP1 and SHP2, which are tyrosine phosphatases that can negatively regulate signaling. In the absence of SAP, SLAMF6 preferentially binds to these phosphatases, leading to inhibitory signaling (Wang2015Negative; Yigit2019SLAMF6). In T cells, SLAMF6 acts as a co-stimulatory molecule, promoting T cell activation by clustering with the CD3 complex at the immunological synapse. This clustering enhances T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and cytokine production, such as IL-2 and IFN-γ, through interactions with proteins like Lck and Fyn (Dragovich2019SLAMF6; Gartshteyn2022SLAMF6). These interactions highlight the dual role of SLAMF6 in both activating and inhibitory pathways, depending on the cellular context and presence of specific adaptor proteins.
