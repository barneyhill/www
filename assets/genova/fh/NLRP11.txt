# NLRP11

## Overview
NLRP11 is a gene that encodes the protein NLR family pyrin domain containing 11, a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, which is primarily involved in the regulation of immune responses. The protein is characterized by a tripartite domain structure, including a pyrin domain (PYD), a nucleotide-binding NACHT domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and its role in immune signaling pathways (Ellwanger2018The; Wu2017NLRP11). NLRP11 is predominantly expressed in human immune cells and reproductive organs, where it functions as a negative regulator of NF-κB activation and modulates inflammasome activity, particularly the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Wu2017NLRP11; Gangopadhyay2022NLRP3). The gene is primate-specific and has been implicated in various inflammatory conditions and certain cancers, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Ellwanger2018The).

## Structure
NLRP11 is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family and exhibits a tripartite domain architecture. It consists of an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD), a central nucleotide-binding NACHT domain, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (Ellwanger2018The; Wu2017NLRP11). The PYD domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly in inflammasome assembly, although NLRP11 does not interact with the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC in the typical manner (Ellwanger2018The). The NACHT domain is responsible for nucleotide binding and oligomerization, facilitating interactions with other NACHT domains such as those in NLRP3 and NLRP12 (Gangopadhyay2022NLRP3). The LRR domain is crucial for binding to TRAF6 and inhibiting NF-κB activity, as well as interacting with DDX3X, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase (Wu2017NLRP11; Kienes2021DDX3X).

NLRP11 is a primate-specific gene, with expression noted in various human tissues, including immune cells and reproductive organs (Wu2017NLRP11). It undergoes post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which targets TRAF6 for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Wu2017NLRP11). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and does not shuttle to the nucleus (Wu2017NLRP11).

## Function
NLRP11 is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, primarily active in the cytoplasm of human cells. It plays a crucial role in regulating inflammatory responses by acting as a negative regulator of NF-κB activation. NLRP11 achieves this by targeting TRAF6, a key adaptor protein in toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, for degradation. This process involves the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF19A, which catalyzes K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6, leading to its proteasomal degradation. This degradation attenuates NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and maintaining immune homeostasis (Wu2017NLRP11).

NLRP11 is also involved in the regulation of inflammasome activity. It is necessary for the oligomerization of NLRP3, a critical step in inflammasome activation, and acts as an essential adaptor for NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in human macrophages. This function is crucial for the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 in response to inflammasome activation signals (Gangopadhyay2022NLRP3). Overall, NLRP11's regulatory functions are vital for modulating immune responses and preventing excessive inflammation in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
NLRP11 has been implicated in several inflammatory conditions due to its role in regulating immune responses. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the NLRP11 gene is associated with increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting a potential genetic link to this condition (Ellwanger2018The). Additionally, a duplication involving the NLRP11 gene has been identified in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, a rare inflammatory disease in children, indicating that alterations in NLRP11 may contribute to its pathogenesis (Ellwanger2018The).

NLRP11 expression is altered in certain cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, glioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, although a direct causal relationship has not been established (Ellwanger2018The). The gene's expression in these cancers suggests a potential role in malignant transformation, particularly in the context of inflammatory signaling pathways (Ellwanger2018The).

NLRP11 is also involved in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is crucial for the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β. In Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), NLRP11 enhances the oligomerization of the constitutively active NLRP3 R260W mutation, indicating its critical role in these syndromes (Gangopadhyay2022NLRP3).

## Interactions
NLRP11 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in modulating immune responses. One of its key interactions is with TRAF6, an adaptor protein involved in toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. NLRP11 promotes the degradation of TRAF6 by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF19A, leading to K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TRAF6. This interaction specifically inhibits NF-κB activation and attenuates TLR signaling, thereby reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Wu2017NLRP11).

NLRP11 also interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X. This interaction is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP11 and affects the phosphorylation of DDX3X by IKKϵ, which is necessary for DDX3X's role in type I interferon responses. NLRP11 inhibits this phosphorylation, thereby repressing type I interferon induction during viral infections (Kienes2021DDX3X).

Additionally, NLRP11 interacts with DDX3X in the context of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. It sequesters DDX3X, reducing caspase-1 activation and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, highlighting its role as a negative regulator of inflammasome activation (Kienes2021DDX3X).
