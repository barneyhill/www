# SYT3

## Overview
The SYT3 gene encodes synaptotagmin 3, a calcium-sensing protein that plays a pivotal role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Synaptotagmin 3 is categorized as a synaptic vesicle protein and is integral to the fast resupply of synaptic vesicles, which is crucial for sustaining neurotransmitter release during high-frequency neuronal activity. The protein's ability to bind calcium is essential for its function, as it facilitates the transition of synaptic vesicles from a loosely docked to a tightly docked state, thereby enhancing synaptic efficiency (Weingarten2022Fast). Additionally, synaptotagmin 3 is involved in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors, influencing synaptic strength and memory processes through its interactions with the GluA2 subunit and endocytic proteins (Awasthi2019Synaptotagmin3). The gene is expressed widely in the brain, underscoring its significant roles in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments, where it contributes to the regulation of synaptic strength and the balance of excitation and inhibition in neural circuits (Weingarten2022Fast).

## Structure


## Function
Synaptotagmin-3 (SYT3) is a calcium-sensing protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. It is involved in the fast resupply of synaptic vesicles, which is essential for maintaining neurotransmitter release during high-frequency stimulation. SYT3 enhances the transition rate of vesicles from a loosely docked state to a tightly docked state, increasing the number of vesicles available for release. This function is dependent on its ability to bind calcium, as a calcium-binding deficient mutant of SYT3 fails to restore normal synaptic function in knockout animals (Weingarten2022Fast).

SYT3 is also implicated in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors, a process that affects synaptic strength and memory processes. It interacts with the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors and endocytic proteins, facilitating receptor internalization. This activity is crucial for long-term depression (LTD) and the decay of long-term potentiation (LTP), processes associated with synaptic plasticity and memory decay (Awasthi2019Synaptotagmin3).

SYT3 is expressed broadly in the brain, with significant roles in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments, contributing to the regulation of synaptic strength and the balance of excitation and inhibition in neural circuits (Weingarten2022Fast).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SYT3 gene have been linked to several neuropsychiatric conditions, including epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder. These associations are likely due to SYT3's critical role in synaptic function, particularly in vesicle resupply and synaptic transmission. The gene's high affinity for calcium allows it to rapidly respond to changes in calcium levels, which is essential for maintaining synaptic transmission demands. Disruptions in these processes can lead to imbalances in neural circuits, potentially contributing to the development of epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders (Weingarten2022Fast; Weingarten2021Fast).

In addition to its role in synaptic function, SYT3 is involved in memory processes, particularly in the regulation of synaptic strength and forgetting. Alterations in SYT3 expression can impact synaptic plasticity, as evidenced by studies showing that SYT3 knockout mice exhibit impaired forgetting and deficits in tasks requiring memory extinction. This suggests that SYT3 is crucial for the internalization of AMPA receptors, a process necessary for synaptic weakening and memory dynamics. Such disruptions in synaptic plasticity could have clinical implications in conditions where memory processes are affected, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (Awasthi2019Synaptotagmin3).

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 3 (SYT3) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release. SYT3 interacts with the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors, a process that is calcium-dependent and essential for AMPA receptor endocytosis. This interaction is significant for synaptic strength modulation and memory processes, as it facilitates the internalization of AMPA receptors, contributing to long-term depression (LTD) and the decay of long-term potentiation (LTP) (Awasthi2019Synaptotagmin3).

SYT3 also binds to endocytic proteins such as AP-2 and BRAG2, which are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These interactions occur in the absence of calcium, suggesting a role for SYT3 in receptor internalization independent of its calcium-sensing capabilities (Awasthi2019Synaptotagmin3). Additionally, SYT3 is known to interact with SNARE proteins, which are critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. This interaction is thought to stimulate SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, thereby influencing neurotransmitter release (Weingarten2022Fast).

These interactions highlight SYT3's role in both postsynaptic and presynaptic compartments, where it modulates synaptic transmission and plasticity through its involvement in receptor endocytosis and vesicle trafficking (Weingarten2022Fast; Awasthi2019Synaptotagmin3).
