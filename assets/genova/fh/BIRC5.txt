# BIRC5

## Overview
BIRC5, also known as baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5, is a gene that encodes the protein survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family. Survivin is characterized by its single baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain, which plays a crucial role in inhibiting apoptosis and regulating cell division. As a multifunctional protein, survivin is involved in the mitotic spindle checkpoint and cytokinesis, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division. It is predominantly expressed during development and in proliferating cells, with its expression being tightly regulated in normal adult tissues. The overexpression of BIRC5 is frequently observed in various cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Obexer2009Repression; Frazzi2021BIRC3; Adinew2022The).

## Structure
The BIRC5 gene encodes the protein survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, characterized by a single baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain in its N-terminal half. This domain consists of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by four small α-helices, resembling the BIR2 domain of XIAP. A Zn2+ ion is coordinated by specific cysteine and histidine residues, bridging the core β-sheet with α4 and α5 (Noel2000Structureofthehumanantiapoptoticproteinsurvivinrevealsadimericarrangement).

Survivin forms a dimeric arrangement in solution, with two distinct dimerization interfaces. One involves the C-terminal half of α6, and another more extensive interface involves residues in the N-terminal BIR domain and a region just after it. The C-terminal helix, α6, forms a 110° angle with its counterpart in the dimer, contributing to the protein's quaternary structure (Noel2000Structureofthehumanantiapoptoticproteinsurvivinrevealsadimericarrangement).

The protein's structure includes three distinct surfaces: an acidic patch on the BIR domain, a basic patch formed by the BIR domain and the segment linking it to α6, and a hydrophobic surface on α6. These features are crucial for survivin's localization to spindle centrosomes during mitosis (Noel2000Structureofthehumanantiapoptoticproteinsurvivinrevealsadimericarrangement). Survivin is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may potentiate protein-protein interactions through a basic patch and a hydrophobic cluster (Noel2000Structureofthehumanantiapoptoticproteinsurvivinrevealsadimericarrangement).

## Function
BIRC5, also known as survivin, is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family and plays a crucial role in regulating cell division and inhibiting apoptosis. In healthy human cells, survivin is primarily expressed during development and is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. It ensures proper cell cycle progression by participating in the mitotic spindle checkpoint and cytokinesis, which are essential for accurate chromosome segregation and cell division (Frazzi2021BIRC3).

Survivin is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and nucleus of proliferating cells, where it interacts with various proteins to execute its functions. It inhibits apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting effector caspases, which are crucial for the execution phase of cell apoptosis (Obexer2009Repression). Survivin's role in cell division is further supported by its involvement in the stabilization of microtubules during mitosis, contributing to the proper alignment and segregation of chromosomes (Li2019Cancer).

In normal physiology, survivin's expression is tightly regulated and becomes undetectable in most adult tissues, except for specific cell types, indicating its critical role during development and in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Frazzi2021BIRC3).

## Clinical Significance
The BIRC5 gene, also known as survivin, is significantly overexpressed in various cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high BIRC5 expression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics, such as larger tumor size, higher histologic grade, and increased lymph node metastasis. This overexpression is linked to poorer survival outcomes and resistance to chemotherapy, making BIRC5 a potential therapeutic target in TNBC (Oparina2021Prognostic; Adinew2022The).

In other cancers, such as kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, high BIRC5 expression is associated with poor overall survival and disease progression (Xu2021BIRC5). Conversely, in lung squamous cell carcinoma and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, higher BIRC5 expression has been linked to better overall survival (Fäldt2022Pan-cancer).

BIRC5 is also involved in tumor immunity, as its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and DNA methylation regulation, suggesting its role as an immune prognostic marker and potential target for immunotherapies (Xu2021BIRC5).

## Interactions
BIRC5, also known as survivin, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cell division and apoptosis. Survivin forms a complex with the small GTPase Ran, which is essential for spindle formation during mitosis in tumor cells. This interaction is nucleotide-dependent, with survivin binding more efficiently to GTP-loaded Ran than GDP-loaded Ran. The interaction involves the amino-terminal region of Ran, specifically residues 45 to 74, and is crucial for the delivery of the Ran effector molecule TPX2 to microtubules, stabilizing them and enhancing spindle formation (Xia2008A).

Survivin is also a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), interacting with Borealin and INCENP to form a core complex that is essential for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. The BIR domain of survivin is involved in these interactions, and mutations in this domain can impair centromere localization (Jeyaprakash2007Structure).

Additionally, survivin interacts with Smac/Diablo, a protein that influences its anti-apoptotic function. This interaction occurs at the BIR domain, with specific residues such as L64 playing a critical role in binding (Sun2004Solution). These interactions highlight survivin's multifaceted role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis inhibition.
