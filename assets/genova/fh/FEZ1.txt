# FEZ1

## Overview
FEZ1, or fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neural development and intracellular transport. The FEZ1 protein functions as a kinesin-1 adaptor, facilitating the transport of protein assemblies and organelles along neuronal processes, which is crucial for axonal and dendritic outgrowth (Alhesain2023Expression). Structurally, FEZ1 is characterized by coiled-coil regions and forms an anti-parallel dimer, which is essential for its stability and function (Alborghetti2013Structural). It interacts with several proteins, including SCOCO, CLASP2, and NEK1, and is involved in stabilizing microtubule structures necessary for cell division (Lanza2009FEZ1; Ishii2001FEZ1LZTS1). Clinically, FEZ1 is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene, with reduced expression linked to various cancers, and it also plays a role in neurological disorders such as schizophrenia (Nonaka2005Reduced; Kang2011Interaction).

## Structure
The FEZ1 protein, also known as fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1, is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes several distinct features. The primary structure of FEZ1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form coiled-coil regions, crucial for its interactions with other proteins such as SCOCO, CLASP2, and NEK1 (Alborghetti2013Structural; Lanza2009FEZ1). The secondary structure of FEZ1 is predicted to contain alpha-helices, particularly in the C-terminal region, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Alborghetti2013Structural; Lanza2009FEZ1).

The tertiary structure of FEZ1 involves the formation of an anti-parallel dimer, stabilized by a disulfide bond between cysteine residues at position 133 of each monomer (Alborghetti2013Structural). This dimerization is essential for the protein's stability and function in transport processes. The quaternary structure of FEZ1 is characterized by its ability to form a heterotetrameric complex with SCOCO, with a 2:2 stoichiometry, as demonstrated by SAXS experiments (Alborghetti2013Structural).

FEZ1's structural flexibility, due to its intrinsically disordered regions, allows it to adopt various conformations, facilitating its role as a bivalent adaptor in kinesin-mediated transport (Alborghetti2013Structural).

## Function
The FEZ1 gene encodes the fasciculation and elongation protein zeta-1, which plays a significant role in axonal and dendritic outgrowth, crucial for neural development. FEZ1 functions as a Kinesin-1 adaptor protein, facilitating the transport of protein assemblies or organelles along neuronal processes, thereby regulating intracellular transport processes. It modulates specific cargoes, including SNARE complex-associated proteins and axon growth-associated proteins, and interacts with the Netrin-1 receptor and Semaphorin-3A receptor complex, potentially influencing axon and dendrite outgrowth (Alhesain2023Expression).

FEZ1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with microtubules, playing a role in stabilizing microtubule structures essential for cell division and structure. This interaction is crucial for proper cell cycle progression and mitosis, as FEZ1 stabilizes the active p34 cdc2-cyclin B1 complex, which is vital for the G2/M transition in the cell cycle (Ishii2001FEZ1LZTS1).

In neurons, FEZ1 is involved in neurite outgrowth by interacting with DISC1 and the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to the transport of synaptic vesicle precursors. It is also implicated in regulating transcriptional programs in neurons and their progenitors, influencing the expression of neural transcription factors like SOX2 and HOXB4 (Naghavi2005Overexpression; Alhesain2023Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The FEZ1 gene, located on chromosome 8p22, is frequently altered in various human cancers, including lung, breast, prostate, gastric, esophageal, and bladder cancers. Its role as a tumor suppressor gene is supported by evidence showing that reduced or absent FEZ1 expression is associated with higher tumor grades and increased tumorigenicity (Vecchione2007Fez1Lzts1; Nonaka2005Reduced). In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancers, a significant reduction in FEZ1 expression correlates with a higher tumor grade, suggesting its potential as a prognostic indicator (Nonaka2005Reduced). 

Mutations in the FEZ1 gene, such as missense and nonsense mutations, have been identified in several cancer types, contributing to its inactivation and the progression of malignancies (Ishii2001FEZ1LZTS1). The loss of FEZ1 expression is often due to genomic deletions, promoter methylation, and point mutations, which are common mechanisms in cancer development (Ishii2001FEZ1LZTS1). 

In addition to its role in cancer, FEZ1 interacts with DISC1 in neuronal development, and alterations in this interaction have been linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia (Kang2011Interaction). This suggests that FEZ1 plays a role in both oncological and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
FEZ1 (fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in neuronal development and intracellular transport. FEZ1 forms a homodimer that interacts with the SCOCO protein, creating a heterotetrameric complex. This interaction involves coiled-coil regions and is supported by structural studies such as SAXS and NMR, which show anti-parallel dimerization of FEZ1 (Alborghetti2013Structural).

FEZ1 also interacts with the HIV-1 capsid protein, binding through multiple negatively charged regions, particularly the poly-glutamate stretch in FEZ1 178-188. This interaction is essential for the trafficking of HIV-1 within host cells, and mutations in these regions can reduce HIV-1 infectivity (Huang2019FEZ1).

In addition, FEZ1 interacts with CLASP2 and NEK1 through coiled-coil regions, suggesting a role in centrosomal functions. These interactions are regulated by protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates FEZ1, inhibiting its interaction with CLASP2 (Lanza2009FEZ1).

FEZ1 also binds to EF1γ, a member of the EF1 protein family, specifically interacting with its N-terminal region. This interaction is confirmed through in vitro binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Ishii2001FEZ1LZTS1).
