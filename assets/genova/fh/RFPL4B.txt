# RFPL4B

## Overview
The RFPL4B gene encodes the ret finger protein-like 4B, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, B-box type 1 and 2 domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are involved in various cellular processes, including regulation of transcription, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The RFPL4B protein is implicated in the modulation of gene expression and may play a role in the development and differentiation of specific tissues. Although the precise biological functions of RFPL4B remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in critical cellular pathways suggests potential significance in health and disease contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC).
