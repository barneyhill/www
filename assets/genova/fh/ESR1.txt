# ESR1

## Overview
The ESR1 gene encodes the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a pivotal role in mediating the effects of estrogen in various tissues. As a receptor, ERα is involved in both genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways, influencing gene expression and cellular responses. Genomically, ERα functions as a transcription factor that regulates genes critical for reproductive tissue development, bone density, and cardiovascular health. Non-genomically, it participates in rapid signaling at the plasma membrane, affecting pathways such as ERK and PI3K. The receptor's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with co-regulatory proteins, which are essential for its diverse physiological roles (Yi2015Structure; Gardini2020Differential; Pedram2007A). ERα's significance extends to clinical contexts, particularly in breast cancer, where mutations in the ESR1 gene can lead to therapy resistance, underscoring the importance of this receptor in both health and disease (Brett2021ESR1; Reinert2017Clinical).

## Structure
The ESR1 gene encodes the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a nuclear hormone receptor involved in gene regulation. The primary structure of ERα consists of several domains: the N-terminal domain, a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hinge region, a ligand-binding domain (LBD), and a C-terminal domain. The DBD and LBD are crucial for the receptor's function, with the DBD facilitating binding to estrogen response elements (ERE) on DNA, and the LBD involved in ligand binding and receptor dimerization (Yi2015Structure).

The secondary structure of ERα includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the receptor's ability to bind DNA and interact with coactivators. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing for the formation of a functional receptor capable of binding to DNA and interacting with coactivators like SRC-3 and p300 (Yi2015Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, ERα functions as a dimer, which is essential for its DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. The receptor recruits coactivators such as SRC-3 and p300 to form a transcriptionally active complex, which is crucial for chromatin remodeling and gene activation (Yi2015Structure). Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, play roles in modulating ERα activity and stability (Yi2015Structure).

## Function
The ESR1 gene encodes the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, ERα is primarily involved in genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways. Genomically, upon binding with its ligand, 17β-estradiol (E2), ERα translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor, regulating the expression of genes involved in reproductive tissue development, bone density maintenance, and cardiovascular health (Lung2020Intrinsic; Gardini2020Differential).

ERα also participates in non-genomic signaling at the plasma membrane, where it can rapidly activate signaling pathways such as ERK and PI3K, which are important for cell cycle progression and other cellular responses (Levin2016Nuclear; Pedram2007A). This membrane localization is facilitated by post-translational modifications like palmitoylation, which is essential for ERα's interaction with proteins such as caveolin-1, enabling its role in rapid signal transduction (Mauvais-Jarvis2021Membrane-Initiated; Pedram2007A).

ERα's regulatory functions extend to the liver, where it acts as a master regulator of cytochrome P450 enzymes, influencing drug metabolism and liver function even in the absence of its ligand (Wang2019LigandFree).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ESR1 gene, which encodes the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), are significant in the context of breast cancer, particularly in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. These mutations often occur in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and lead to constitutive, ligand-independent activation of the receptor, contributing to resistance against endocrine therapies such as aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant (Brett2021ESR1; De2019The). The most common mutations, Y537S and D538G, are associated with acquired resistance to these therapies and are prevalent in patients who have undergone extensive hormone therapy (Reinert2017Clinical; Niu2015Incidence).

ESR1 mutations are rarely found in primary breast tumors but are more common in metastatic cases, suggesting they may evolve during tumor progression due to treatment pressures (Pejerrey2018The). These mutations are linked to poorer progression-free survival and overall survival, indicating a more aggressive disease biology (Reinert2017Clinical). The presence of ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be detected using liquid biopsies, offering a non-invasive method to guide treatment decisions (Schiavon2015Analysis). Understanding these mutations is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients.

## Interactions
The estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) is involved in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. ESR1 interacts with co-regulatory proteins, such as the p160 family of coactivators, including SRC-1 and SRC-3, which are recruited in a ligand-specific manner. For instance, bisphenol-A (BPA) recruits SRC-1 peptides, while genistein (GEN) recruits both SRC-1 and SRC-3 peptides (Smith2016Differential). 

ESR1 also interacts with the Sin3A repressor complex, which includes HDAC2, to mediate transcriptional repression. This interaction is crucial for the repression of the ESR1 gene itself in response to estradiol (E2), where Sin3A is recruited to the proximal promoter, leading to histone deacetylation and reduced transcription (EllisonZelski2009Repression).

In the context of hepatocarcinogenesis, ESR1 interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It has been shown to modulate the expression of β-catenin target genes, such as CCND1 and MYC, through its interaction with β-catenin (Bhat2021Estrogen). These interactions highlight ESR1's role in both activating and repressing gene expression, depending on the cellular context and the presence of specific ligands.
