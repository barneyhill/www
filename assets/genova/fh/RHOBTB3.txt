# RHOBTB3

## Overview
RHOBTB3 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho-related BTB domain containing 3, which is a member of the RhoBTB subfamily of atypical Rho GTPases. Unlike typical Rho GTPases, the RHOBTB3 protein is characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP instead of GTP, due to specific modifications in its GTPase domain (Espinosa2009RhoBTB3:; Ji2016Atypical). The protein features a unique domain architecture, including a GTPase domain, proline-rich region, two BTB domains, and a conserved C-terminal region, which facilitate its diverse roles in cellular processes (BERTHOLD2008Rho). RHOBTB3 functions as a scaffold protein involved in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFα) degradation, cell cycle progression, and vesicular trafficking, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Zhang2015RHOBTB3; Cai2018RHOBTB3). Additionally, RHOBTB3 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and psychotic disorders, where its altered expression is associated with disease pathogenesis (Ji2016Atypical; Cai2018RHOBTB3).

## Structure
RHOBTB3 is a member of the RhoBTB subfamily of atypical Rho GTPases, characterized by a unique domain architecture. The protein consists of a GTPase domain, a proline-rich region, two BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domains, and a conserved C-terminal region (BERTHOLD2008Rho). Unlike typical Rho GTPases, RHOBTB3 binds and hydrolyzes ATP instead of GTP, due to specific amino acid replacements in its GTPase domain (Espinosa2009RhoBTB3:; Ji2016Atypical). The GTPase domain is highly divergent, with modifications that allow ATP binding and hydrolysis, such as a unique P loop insert and altered G1, G2, G3, and G4 regions (Espinosa2009RhoBTB3:).

The BTB domains in RHOBTB3 are involved in protein-protein interactions and form part of cullin3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are crucial for targeting proteins for degradation (BERTHOLD2008Rho). RHOBTB3 also contains a C-terminal CAAX motif, which is involved in isoprenylation, a post-translational modification that targets the protein to membranes, particularly the Golgi apparatus (Espinosa2009RhoBTB3:; BERTHOLD2008Rho). The protein can form dimers through its BTB domains, allowing interactions with other RhoBTB proteins (Ji2016Atypical).

## Function
RHOBTB3 is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It acts as a scaffold protein that facilitates the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFα) by promoting its hydroxylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This process is crucial for maintaining low levels of HIFα, thereby regulating cellular responses to oxygen levels and suppressing the Warburg effect, a metabolic shift associated with cancer (Zhang2015RHOBTB3; Cai2018RHOBTB3). RHOBTB3 forms heterodimers with LIMD1, enhancing the interaction between prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, which are essential for HIFα degradation (Zhang2015RHOBTB3).

In addition to its role in HIFα regulation, RHOBTB3 is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin E, facilitating cell cycle progression into the G2 phase (Cai2018RHOBTB3). It also plays a role in vesicular trafficking, particularly in the retrograde transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from endosomes to the Golgi complex, interacting with Rab9 GTPase and TIP47 to maintain normal Golgi morphology and function (Espinosa2009RhoBTB3:). RHOBTB3's diverse functions highlight its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RHOBTB3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. Decreased expression of RHOBTB3 has been observed in the blood of patients experiencing high hallucination states and in the frontal cortex of schizophrenic patients who have completed suicide, suggesting a potential role in psychotic disorders (Ji2016Atypical). RHOBTB3 is also considered a candidate vulnerability gene for Alzheimer's disease, with differential expression observed in specific regions of the hippocampus (Ji2016Atypical).

In cancer, RHOBTB3 is proposed as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is significantly reduced in various tumors, including those of the breast, kidney, uterus, lung, and ovary (BERTHOLD2008Rho; Cai2018RHOBTB3). The gene is involved in the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFα), and its loss leads to increased HIFα levels, contributing to tumorigenesis and the Warburg effect, a metabolic shift common in cancer cells (Zhang2015RHOBTB3). In renal carcinomas, reduced RHOBTB3 expression is associated with accelerated tumor growth (Zhang2015RHOBTB3).

A single case study reported a male with a chromosomal inversion disrupting RHOBTB3, resulting in asymmetric leg growth and behavioral issues, although a direct causal link was not established (Cai2018RHOBTB3).

## Interactions
RHOBTB3 interacts with several key proteins and complexes, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It forms heterodimers with LIMD1, which are crucial for regulating the levels of HIF1α, a transcription factor involved in cellular response to hypoxia. This interaction promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of HIF1α by enhancing the interaction between PHD2 and VHL, components of the degradation complex (Zhang2015RHOBTB3; Ji2016Atypical).

RHOBTB3 also acts as an adaptor for cullin 3-dependent ubiquitin ligases, targeting proteins such as cyclin E for degradation, which is important for cell cycle regulation (Cai2018RHOBTB3). It interacts with the N-terminal region of CUL3, forming part of a cullin 3-based ubiquitin ligase complex (Cai2018RHOBTB3).

In vesicle trafficking, RHOBTB3 interacts specifically with activated Rab9, a protein present on late endosomes and transport vesicles, facilitating the recycling of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (Espinosa2009RhoBTB3:; Ji2016Atypical). It also binds to the ubiquitin-interacting motif of Hrs, suggesting a role in sorting membrane cargo proteins for degradation in lysosomes (Ji2016Atypical).
