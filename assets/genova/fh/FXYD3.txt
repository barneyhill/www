# FXYD3

## Overview
FXYD3 is a gene that encodes the protein FXYD domain containing ion transport regulator 3, also known as Mat-8. This protein is a member of the FXYD family, which is characterized by a conserved FXYD motif and is involved in the regulation of ion transport across cell membranes. FXYD3 is a transmembrane protein that modulates the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, playing a critical role in maintaining ion homeostasis and membrane potential in epithelial cells (Yamamoto2012FXYD3; Geering2005Function). The protein exists in two splicing variants, FXYD3a and FXYD3b, which differentially influence the pump's affinity for sodium and potassium ions. FXYD3 is expressed in various tissues, including the mammary gland, lung, stomach, pancreas, and intestine, and is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, such as glucose signaling in pancreatic beta-cells and cancer progression (Okudela2009DownRegulation; Vallois2014GlucoIncretins).

## Structure
FXYD3, also known as Mat-8, is a member of the FXYD protein family, characterized by the signature FXYD motif located in the ectodomain near the transmembrane segment (Yamamoto2012FXYD3). The human FXYD3 protein contains a hydrophobic domain at the N-terminus, which encodes a cleavable signal peptide, and it adopts a type I membrane topology (Yamamoto2012FXYD3). However, studies suggest that the signal peptide of FXYD3 is not cleaved, and it likely possesses two transmembrane segments, which is atypical compared to other FXYD proteins that usually have a type I orientation (Geering2005Function).

FXYD3 has two splicing variants, FXYD3a and FXYD3b, which are short and long isoforms, respectively. The FXYD3a mRNA features an in-frame deletion of 78 nucleotides compared to FXYD3b mRNA (Yamamoto2012FXYD3). Post-translational modifications of FXYD3 include glutathionylation of two cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic domain under oxidative stress, which prevents glutathionylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase beta1 subunit, thereby maintaining pump activity (Yamamoto2012FXYD3). The protein's role in modulating Na+,K+-ATPase activity and ion channels is crucial for fine-tuning ion transport (Yamamoto2012FXYD3).

## Function
FXYD3, a member of the FXYD protein family, plays a crucial role in regulating ion transport across cell membranes, primarily by modulating the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. This regulation is essential for maintaining ion homeostasis and membrane potential in epithelial cells (Yamamoto2012FXYD3; Herrmann2015Estrogen). FXYD3 is expressed in various tissues, including the mammary gland, lung, stomach, pancreas, and intestine, and is localized to both the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane compartments (Yamamoto2012FXYD3).

The protein has two splicing variants, FXYD3a and FXYD3b, which differentially affect the Na+,K+-ATPase's affinity for Na+ and K+. FXYD3a decreases the affinity for intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+, while FXYD3b increases the affinity for intracellular Na+ and decreases it for extracellular K+ (Yamamoto2012FXYD3). Both isoforms can induce a hyperpolarization-activated chloride current in Xenopus oocytes, indicating their role in fine-tuning ion transport and modulating ion channels (Yamamoto2012FXYD3).

In the context of pancreatic beta-cells, FXYD3 is involved in regulating glucose competence. Its expression is epigenetically regulated, with increased expression linked to impaired insulin secretion, suggesting a role in glucose signaling pathways (Vallois2014GlucoIncretins).

## Clinical Significance
FXYD3 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In lung cancer, FXYD3 expression is significantly down-regulated, particularly in highly malignant subtypes such as large cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma, where it is completely absent. This down-regulation is associated with the progression of lung cancer and may suggest a role for FXYD3 as a potential tumor suppressor (Okudela2009DownRegulation). The discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels in different cancer types indicates possible posttranscriptional regulation (Okudela2009DownRegulation).

In colorectal cancer, FXYD3 is down-regulated in oxaliplatin-resistant cells, and its expression is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and drug resistance. Targeting FXYD3 with miR-143 has been suggested to increase sensitivity to oxaliplatin, highlighting its potential role in overcoming drug resistance (Cheraghishavi2023TGM2).

In renal cell carcinoma, high FXYD3 expression is associated with poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. It correlates with increased infiltration of immune cells and higher tumor purity, suggesting its involvement in the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (Yonekura2022FXYD3). These findings indicate that FXYD3 expression levels could serve as a prognostic marker in various cancers.

## Interactions
FXYD3, also known as Mat-8, is a member of the FXYD protein family that interacts with Na,K-ATPase, a crucial ion transporter. FXYD3 is known to associate with both Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase, although its interaction with H,K-ATPase is less specific and physiologically significant due to their non-overlapping expression in certain tissues like the stomach (Geering2005Function; Pirkmajer2019Hormonal). In the stomach, FXYD3 specifically associates with Na,K-ATPase, as it is expressed in mucus cells that lack H,K-ATPase (Geering2005Function).

FXYD3 affects the glycosylation processing of the β subunit of Na,K-ATPase, suggesting it may interfere with the enzyme's exit from the endoplasmic reticulum or its sorting to the plasma membrane (Geering2005Function). This protein also modifies the transport properties of Na,K-ATPase by increasing the K 1/2 value for extracellular K+ and intracellular Na+, indicating a regulatory role in ion transport (Geering2005Function).

While specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, FXYD3's role in modulating Na,K-ATPase activity and its involvement in cellular processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and drug resistance pathways suggest it participates in complex regulatory networks (Cheraghishavi2023TGM2).
