# RNF170

## Overview
RNF170 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 170, a transmembrane protein characterized by its RING-finger motif, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination and degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors, which are crucial for calcium signaling in mammalian cells. The protein's interaction with the erlin1/2 complex facilitates its recruitment to activated IP3 receptors, promoting their degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a component of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control. Mutations in RNF170 have been implicated in various neurological disorders, including hereditary spastic paraplegia and autosomal dominant sensory ataxia, underscoring its significance in cellular signaling and neurodegenerative disease (Wagner2019Biallelic; Lu2011RNF170; Veronese2024ERLIN12).

## Structure
RNF170 is a transmembrane ring finger protein characterized by a RING-finger motif, which is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This motif consists of 40-80 amino acids with conserved cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate zinc ions, forming a 'cross-brace' structure that facilitates ubiquitin transfer (Nakamura2011The). The protein has a topology that includes a luminal domain, three transmembrane domains, and a cytosolic domain (Veronese2024ERLIN12). The N-terminal luminal domain contains a conserved motif that interacts with the ERLIN complex, specifically binding to the stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflKC (SPFH) domain of ERLIN subunits (Veronese2024ERLIN12).

RNF170 is involved in the ubiquitination and turnover of the IP3-receptor from the ER membrane, in association with cofactors Erlin1/Erlin2 (Fenech2020Interaction). The protein is part of the C3HC4 motif group and has three transmembrane spans, with a total length of 258 amino acids (Kaneko2016Genomewide). Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination are integral to its function, particularly in targeting proteins for degradation via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Nakamura2011The). Specific structural details about primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
RNF170 is a RING domain-containing protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mammalian cells. It plays a critical role in the ubiquitination and degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors, which are involved in calcium signaling. RNF170 associates with activated IP3 receptors and facilitates their ubiquitination, leading to their degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP), a process that is part of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This pathway is essential for the regulation of IP3 receptor levels and, consequently, calcium signaling in cells (Lu2011RNF170).

RNF170 interacts constitutively with the erlin1/2 complex, which recruits it to activated IP3 receptors, highlighting its role in the early stages of IP3 receptor ubiquitination and degradation (Lu2011RNF170; Veronese2024ERLIN12). The protein is also involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the degradation of misfolded proteins within the ER, a process crucial for protein quality control (de2020RNF170‐Related). Mutations in RNF170 have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, indicating its broader implications in cellular signaling and organismal health (Lu2011RNF170).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNF170 gene are associated with several neurological disorders. A heterozygous mutation, p.Arg199Cys, is linked to autosomal dominant sensory ataxia, characterized by progressive sensory loss and ataxia due to degeneration of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. This mutation has been identified in families from eastern Canada and Ecuador, where affected individuals exhibit symptoms such as poor balance, sensory loss, and ataxic gait (Cortese2020Mutation; Van2021RNF170). The mutation affects the protein's stability by altering ionic interactions in the transmembrane domains (Van2021RNF170).

Biallelic mutations in RNF170 are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), an autosomal recessive condition. These mutations lead to a loss of function, resulting in reduced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), which can cause increased IP3-dependent signaling and prolonged calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This disruption is linked to neurodevelopmental defects and motor neuron issues (Wagner2019Biallelic). The RNF170 frameshift deletion in Miniature American Shepherd dogs, associated with neuroaxonal dystrophy, provides a model for understanding similar conditions in humans (Cook2024RNF170).

## Interactions
RNF170 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane ubiquitin ligase that interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination and degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3 receptors). It associates with the erlin1/2 complex, which recruits RNF170 to activated IP3 receptors, facilitating their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Lu2011RNF170). The interaction with the erlin1/2 complex is essential, as depletion of erlin2 inhibits RNF170's association with activated IP3 receptors (Lu2011RNF170).

RNF170 also interacts with TMUB1-L, a protein containing a ubiquitin-like domain, through the ERLIN1/2 scaffolds. This interaction is crucial for the stability of the proteins involved and is mediated by specific hydrogen bonds between residues of ERLIN1/2 and RNF170/TMUB1 (Veronese2024ERLIN12). The ERLIN1/2 complex serves as a platform for RNF170, facilitating its role in various cellular processes, including cholesterol metabolism and the secretory pathway (Veronese2024ERLIN12).

Mutations in RNF170 can disrupt these interactions, leading to pathogenic consequences, such as hereditary spastic paraplegia, by affecting the degradation and abundance of IP3 receptors (Wagner2019Biallelic).
