# WDR6

## Overview
WDR6, or WD repeat domain 6, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of WD-repeat motifs, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. The protein encoded by WDR6 is involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and cell cycle regulation. Structurally, the WDR6 protein consists of 1121 amino acids and features 11 WD-repeat units, which form a beta-propeller structure, a common feature among proteins that mediate complex formation and signaling pathways (Li2001Human). Functionally, WDR6 interacts with several key proteins, such as PPP1CB and LKB1, influencing processes like hepatic de novo lipogenesis and cell growth inhibition (Xie2007Association; Yao2023Upregulation). Clinically, the gene has been implicated in metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and liver diseases, and may play a role in cancer biology through its interaction with tumor suppressor proteins (Xie2007Association; Yao2023Upregulation).

## Structure
The WDR6 gene encodes a novel human WD-repeat protein consisting of 1121 amino acids and contains 11 WD-repeat units. These repeats are organized into two distinct groups, separated by a probable transmembrane domain, suggesting a unique primary structure (Li2001Human). The WD-repeat motifs typically form a beta-propeller structure, which is a common feature of WD-repeat proteins, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Li2001Human). 

The secondary structure of WDR6 is characterized by these WD-repeats, which are approximately 40 amino acids long and end with a tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) dipeptide. These repeats form a circularized beta-propeller structure, which is highly symmetrical and stabilized by sharing strands between blades (Li2001Human). 

In terms of tertiary structure, WDR6 is predicted to have three domains with a highly conserved β-barrel topology. The protein's structure was further analyzed using the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, which predicted the molecular structure and identified the largest binding pocket in domain b (amino acids 330-687) (Yao2023Upregulation). 

The quaternary structure of WDR6 involves its interaction with other proteins, such as PPP1CB, facilitated by a specific motif 'FKSRSR' located in the b domain (Yao2023Upregulation). This interaction is crucial for WDR6's role in hepatic de novo lipogenesis and insulin resistance (Yao2023Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
The WDR6 gene has been implicated in several metabolic disorders, particularly in the context of insulin resistance and liver diseases. Upregulation of WDR6 is associated with increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, a process that contributes to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in insulin-resistant conditions. This upregulation leads to enhanced fatty acid synthesis and liver triglyceride accumulation, exacerbating metabolic disorders (Yao2023Upregulation).

In mouse models, liver-specific knockdown of WDR6 has been shown to protect against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, suggesting that WDR6 plays a critical role in these conditions. The gene's interaction with PPP1CB, a protein involved in lipid metabolism, further underscores its significance in regulating liver fat deposition and insulin sensitivity (Yao2023Upregulation).

Additionally, WDR6 has been identified as a protein that interacts with the tumor suppressor LKB1, enhancing its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and contributing to cell growth arrest. This interaction suggests a potential role for WDR6 in cancer biology, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Xie2007Association).

## Interactions
WDR6 (WD repeat domain 6) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with PPP1CB, a catalytic subunit of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), through a specific motif, FKSRSR, which is crucial for the dephosphorylation of PPP1CB at Thr316. This interaction plays a significant role in regulating hepatic de novo lipogenesis and lipid metabolism (Yao2023Upregulation). WDR6 also interacts with LKB1, a serine/threonine kinase known for its tumor suppressor functions. This interaction enhances LKB1's growth inhibitory effect, leading to G1 cell cycle arrest and the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1 (Xie2007Association).

In the brain, WDR6 interacts with insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS-4), suggesting a role in insulin/IGF-I signaling pathways. This interaction is significant in the hypothalamus, where WDR6 expression is enriched (Chiba2009Identification). Additionally, WDR6 is part of the Cullin 4-DDB1-WDR3/WDR6 complex, which binds to SPAK and OSR1 kinases in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, indicating its involvement in ion homeostasis (Dhiani2019The).
