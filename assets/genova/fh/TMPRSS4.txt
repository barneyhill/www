# TMPRSS4

## Overview
TMPRSS4 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane serine protease 4, a type II transmembrane serine protease. This protein is characterized by its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including epithelial cell differentiation, migration, and invasion. Structurally, transmembrane serine protease 4 features a short cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane helix, and an extracellular region containing a serine protease domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Esram2023Comprehensive; Muley2021SARSCoV2). TMPRSS4 is expressed in several tissues, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, and plays a significant role in tissue remodeling and homeostasis (Kerslake2022Protein). The protein is also implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer and viral infections, including its role in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells (Zang2020TMPRSS2; Larzabal2014TMPRSS4). Due to its involvement in these critical processes, TMPRSS4 is considered a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and infectious diseases (Exposito2019Targeting).

## Structure
TMPRSS4 is a type II transmembrane serine protease composed of 437 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 48 kDa (Esram2023Comprehensive; de2014TMPRSS4:). The protein structure includes a short cytoplasmic domain, a single-pass transmembrane helix located between residues 33 and 53, and an extracellular region (Muley2021SARSCoV2). The extracellular region contains several distinct domains: a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLRA) domain, a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain, and a serine protease domain (Esram2023Comprehensive; Muley2021SARSCoV2).

The serine protease domain adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold characterized by Greek-key β-barrels and contains a conserved catalytic triad of histidine, aspartate, and serine, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (de2014TMPRSS4:; Muley2021SARSCoV2). TMPRSS4 is synthesized as a zymogen and requires activation by proteolytic cleavage, which can occur through autocatalysis or by other proteases such as enterokinase (de2014TMPRSS4:).

Post-translational modifications of TMPRSS4 include glycosylation at two N-linked glycosylation sites located at residues 130 and 178 (Wu2003Type). The protein can generate multiple transcripts, with five isoforms having complete coding sequences (de2014TMPRSS4:). The structural similarity of TMPRSS4 to proteins involved in blood coagulation and complement pathways suggests potential roles in these processes (Muley2021SARSCoV2).

## Function
TMPRSS4 (transmembrane serine protease 4) is a type II transmembrane serine protease involved in various cellular processes. It is synthesized as a zymogen and requires activation by proteolytic cleavage, which can occur through autocatalysis or by other proteases such as enterokinase (de2014TMPRSS4:). TMPRSS4 is active on the cell surface and plays a role in epithelial cell differentiation, migration, and invasion, contributing to processes like tissue remodeling and homeostasis (NGUYEN2012Expression).

In healthy human cells, TMPRSS4 is involved in regulating cellular activities such as cell-cell interaction, adherence to matrix components, and motility (NGUYEN2012Expression). It is abundantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, including the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, jejunum, ileum, colon, liver, and pancreas, where it is found in various cell types such as epithelial cells and hepatocytes (Kerslake2022Protein). TMPRSS4 also shares several domains with other members of the type II transmembrane serine protease family, including proteolytic, stem, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (de2014TMPRSS4:). Despite its known roles, the specific functions of TMPRSS4 in healthy human cells remain underexplored (de2014TMPRSS4:).

## Clinical Significance
TMPRSS4 is implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its overexpression and role in promoting tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMPRSS4 expression is associated with larger tumor size, increased vascular invasion, and higher postoperative recurrence, leading to a poor prognosis (Wang2015TMPRSS4). It facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC, enhancing cancer cell invasion and migration through the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway (Wang2015TMPRSS4).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), TMPRSS4 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, correlating with poor overall survival (Gu2021TMPRSS4). Its overexpression is linked to larger tumor size and higher differentiation in PDAC (Gu2021TMPRSS4).

TMPRSS4 is also overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it is associated with reduced survival rates and increased tumor growth and metastasis (Exposito2019Targeting). In thyroid cancer, TMPRSS4 overexpression correlates with advanced tumor stages and aggressive histological types (Guan2015Transmembrane).

The gene's expression is regulated by epigenetic changes, such as hypomethylation, which serves as a prognostic predictor in cancers like non-small cell lung cancer (Kim2023TMPRSS4). TMPRSS4's role in cancer progression makes it a potential therapeutic target, with its inhibition shown to increase sensitivity to chemotherapy (Exposito2019Targeting).

## Interactions
TMPRSS4, a transmembrane serine protease, is involved in various protein interactions that influence both viral infections and cancer progression. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, TMPRSS4 enhances the cleavage of the viral spike (S) protein, facilitating viral entry into host cells. This interaction is crucial for the virus's infectivity, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, where TMPRSS4 is abundantly expressed (Zang2020TMPRSS2; Kerslake2022Protein). TMPRSS4, along with TMPRSS2, shows an additive effect in increasing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by promoting S protein cleavage and cell-cell fusion (Zang2020TMPRSS2).

In cancer, TMPRSS4 interacts with integrin α5 through the regulation of miR-205, a microRNA that inhibits tumor cell migration and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TMPRSS4 downregulation leads to increased miR-205 levels, which in turn reduces integrin α5 expression, thereby inhibiting cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Larzabal2014TMPRSS4).

In pancreatic cancer, TMPRSS4 interacts with tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), a natural inhibitor of TMPRSS4. The downregulation of TFPI2 may enhance TMPRSS4 activity, promoting tissue invasion and metastasis (Dawelbait2007Structural). These interactions highlight TMPRSS4's role in both viral pathogenesis and cancer progression.
