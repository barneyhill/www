# ZYG11B

## Overview
ZYG11B is a gene that encodes the protein zyg-11 family member B, a cell cycle regulator that plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein functions as a substrate receptor within the Cullin 2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL2) complex, facilitating the targeted degradation of specific proteins, such as cyclin B1, which is crucial for cell cycle progression and mitotic regulation (Yan2021Molecular; Balachandran2016The). ZYG11B is characterized by its complex molecular structure, including leucine-rich repeats and armadillo repeats, which are essential for its interaction with protein degradation signals known as Gly/N-degrons (Yan2021Molecular). The protein's activity is vital for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and preventing aberrant cell cycle events that could lead to conditions such as aneuploidy and cancer (Balachandran2016The). Additionally, ZYG11B has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Tingaud‐Sequeira2020Functional; Ma2022Silencing).

## Structure
The ZYG11B protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains an N-terminal VHL motif, three leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), and eight armadillo (ARM) repeats at the C-terminus (Yan2021Molecular). The ARM domains, particularly ARM2-ARM8, are crucial for binding Gly/N-degrons, forming an arch-shaped conformation that positions the Gly/N-degron centrally (Yan2021Molecular). The ARM repeats are composed of three alpha helices, with ARM6 and ARM7 forming an elongated loop that creates a deep cavity for degron recognition (Yan2021Molecular).

The tertiary structure of ZYG11B includes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and two armadillo repeat domains (AD1 and AD2), which facilitate assembly with the CRL2 complex and recognition of substrates (Liu2024Structure). The LRR domain forms a semicircular shape with α/β horseshoe repeats, while the ARM domain is divided into two subdomains due to a long linker that disrupts the typical ARM superhelix structure (Liu2024Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, ZYG11B interacts with Elongin B and Elongin C in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry, forming a substrate receptor module within the CRL2 complex (Liu2024Structure). This interaction is stabilized by unique contacts, such as Elongin-B contacting ZYG11B, which may stabilize the interaction with the EloBC heterodimer (Liu2024Structure).

## Function
The ZYG11B gene encodes a protein that functions as a substrate receptor for the Cullin 2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL2) complex, playing a crucial role in protein degradation pathways. In healthy human cells, ZYG11B is involved in the regulation of cyclin B1 levels, a key protein in cell cycle progression. The CRL2 ZYG11B complex targets cyclin B1 for degradation, working redundantly with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to facilitate the metaphase-to-anaphase transition during mitosis. This degradation pathway is essential for preventing mitotic slippage, which can lead to tetraploidy and increase the risk of aneuploidy and cancer (Balachandran2016The).

ZYG11B also recognizes Gly/N-degrons, specific protein degradation signals, and accelerates the degradation of proteins like DBNDD2 and SNX11. This activity is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis in cells (Yan2021Molecular). The protein is predominantly cytoplasmic during interphase and mitosis, where it binds cyclin B1 independently of its interaction with Cdk1, suggesting a role independent of the APC/C complex (Balachandran2016The). Through these mechanisms, ZYG11B contributes to the regulation of protein stability and cell cycle integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZYG11B gene have been implicated in several developmental and pathological conditions. A heterozygous nonsense de novo variant in ZYG11B has been associated with the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS), a rare developmental disorder characterized by craniofacial malformations. This variant results in a truncated protein, suggesting a potential loss of function that may contribute to the pathophysiology of OAVS, particularly affecting craniofacial structures (Tingaud‐Sequeira2020Functional).

In the context of retinal neurodegeneration, increased expression of circZYG11B, a circular RNA derived from the ZYG11B gene, has been observed in ischemic retinal diseases. Silencing circZYG11B has shown neuroprotective effects against retinal ganglion cell injury, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for retinal ischemic conditions (Ma2022Silencing).

ZYG11B is also involved in protein degradation pathways, and its dysfunction can affect protein stability and degradation, potentially impacting conditions related to protein homeostasis, such as neurodegeneration and cancer (Yan2021Molecular; Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZYG11B in various diseases.

## Interactions
ZYG11B is involved in several protein interactions, primarily through its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It functions as a substrate recognition subunit in a CUL-2-based ubiquitin ligase complex, interacting with CUL-2 and the complex adaptor protein Elongin C via a VHL-box motif (Vasudevan2007TheCaenorhabditis). This interaction is crucial for targeting specific proteins for degradation, such as cyclin B1, which ZYG11B binds independently of Cdk1. This binding facilitates the degradation of cyclin B1, even when APC/C activity is inhibited, contributing to mitotic slippage (Balachandran2016The).

ZYG11B also interacts with other proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and ubiquitination, including RBX1, COMMD1, ASB4, and LRR1, as revealed by protein-protein interaction analysis in colorectal cancer studies (Zhou2024ZYG11B). These interactions suggest a role in modulating cell cycle progression and immune cell infiltration in cancer. Additionally, ZYG11B's interaction with cyclin B1 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a direct physical association that is proteasome-dependent (Balachandran2016The). These interactions highlight ZYG11B's significant role in regulating protein degradation and cell cycle dynamics.
