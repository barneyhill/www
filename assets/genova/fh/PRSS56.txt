# PRSS56

## Overview
PRSS56 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 56, a member of the serine protease family characterized by a serine residue in its active site. This protein plays a significant role in ocular development, particularly in the regulation of eye size and shape, through its involvement in the processing and degradation of the extracellular matrix. PRSS56 is expressed in various tissues, including the retina, where it is crucial for normal ocular growth and refractive development. Mutations in the PRSS56 gene are associated with ocular conditions such as nanophthalmos and posterior microphthalmia, which affect eye size and can lead to high hyperopia and structural retinal abnormalities (Bacci2020Novel; Nair2011Alteration; Prasov2020Novel). Additionally, PRSS56 has been implicated in cancer progression through its interaction with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, highlighting its diverse biological roles (Li2023Serine).

## Structure
The PRSS56 gene encodes a 603-amino acid protein that is part of the serine protease family, characterized by a serine residue in the active site. The protein includes an N-terminal signal peptide, a central chymotrypsin-like serine protease domain, and a C-terminal domain (Bacci2020Novel). The primary structure of PRSS56 consists of a sequence of amino acids, while the secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of serine proteases. The tertiary structure refers to the overall 3D shape of the protein, although specific details are not provided in the context. The quaternary structure, involving the assembly of multiple subunits, is not detailed in the available information.

PRSS56 is expressed in various tissues, including the retina, where it plays a role in ocular development (Bacci2020Novel). Mutations in PRSS56 can lead to conditions such as nanophthalmos and posterior microphthalmia, affecting ocular size and development (Nair2011Alteration; Prasov2020Novel). The protein's function and structure may be influenced by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are common in serine proteases. However, specific modifications for PRSS56 are not detailed in the context.

## Function
PRSS56 is a serine protease involved in ocular development, particularly influencing eye size and shape. In healthy human cells, PRSS56 is expressed in the retina, specifically in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer, where it plays a crucial role in the postnatal determination of axial dimensions in response to visual experience, a process known as emmetropization (Nair2011Alteration). This gene is essential for maintaining normal ocular growth and refractive development, with its activity required both prenatally and postnatally (Paylakhi2018Müller).

PRSS56 is a secreted trypsin-like serine protease that functions in both extracellular and intracellular environments. It is involved in processing and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is important for ocular development and maintaining normal intraocular pressure (IOP) (Nair2011Alteration). The protein is initially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is secreted, but retains significant intracellular presence, suggesting a dual role in cellular processes (Nair2011Alteration). PRSS56's activity is crucial for sustaining ocular axial growth and preventing refractive errors such as hyperopia, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal eye structure and function during development (Paylakhi2018Müller).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRSS56 gene are associated with several ocular conditions, primarily affecting eye size and structure. Autosomal recessive nanophthalmos and posterior microphthalmia are two conditions linked to PRSS56 mutations. Nanophthalmos is characterized by small eyes with high hyperopia and a risk of angle-closure glaucoma, while posterior microphthalmia involves a reduced size of the ocular posterior segment, leading to high hyperopia and structural retinal abnormalities such as macular folds (Bacci2020Novel; Almoallem2020The).

Specific mutations in PRSS56, such as frameshift and missense variants, have been identified in various populations, including a novel homozygous variant c.1509G>C; p.(Met503Ile) in a Roma family, which supports the pathogenicity of PRSS56 in causing nanophthalmos (Dudakova2020Pseudodominant). In mice, PRSS56 mutations lead to angle-closure glaucoma due to reduced ocular axial length and altered iridocorneal angle configuration, which can result in high intraocular pressure (Nair2011Alteration; LabelleDumais2020Loss).

The clinical heterogeneity within PRSS56-related conditions is notable, with no clear genotype-phenotype correlations established, indicating that PRSS56 mutations may contribute to a spectrum of ocular phenotypes (Almoallem2020The).

## Interactions
PRSS56 is involved in several interactions that influence its role in biological processes. In the context of cancer, PRSS56 overexpression is linked to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression. This interaction is facilitated by DNA hypomethylation at specific CpG sites in the PRSS56 promoter, leading to its overexpression and subsequent activation of the PI3K/AKT axis, promoting proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric and colorectal cancer cells (Li2023Serine).

In ocular development, PRSS56 interacts with other proteins to regulate eye growth. It is part of a molecular network involving the transmembrane glycoprotein MFRP and the secreted serine protease ADAMTS19. These interactions are crucial for maintaining normal ocular size and preventing conditions like nanophthalmos and myopia. PRSS56 and MFRP mutations are associated with reduced ocular axial length, while their inactivation can prevent excessive elongation in models of myopia (Koli2021Identification).

PRSS56 also interacts with EGR1, where its inactivation can rescue ocular size reduction in PRSS56 mutant mice, indicating distinct roles in ocular development (LabelleDumais2020Loss). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of PRSS56 in both cancer progression and ocular development.
