# PEBP4

## Overview
Phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 4 (PEBP4) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and apoptosis regulation. The PEBP4 protein is a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein family, characterized by its ability to interact with key signaling molecules such as Raf-1 and MEK1, thereby modulating pathways like ERK/JNK and Akt (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine). Unlike other PEBP family members, PEBP4 is a secreted protein, with its secretion facilitated by specific N-terminal and C-terminal sequences (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine). The protein's role extends to maintaining membrane integrity and potentially influencing extracellular functions, which are crucial for cell survival and growth (Wang2004A). PEBP4's involvement in cancer progression and other diseases highlights its clinical significance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Yu2012PEBP4; Wang2023Comprehensive).

## Structure
Phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 4 (PEBP4) is a member of the PEBP family, characterized by its ability to be secreted due to the presence of a signal peptide and potential glycosylation sites. The primary structure of PEBP4 includes a signal sequence at the N-terminus, which is crucial for its secretion, and a conserved domain at the C-terminus that also plays a role in this process (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine). PEBP4 undergoes N-glycosylation, with mass spectrometry confirming the presence of N-glycans, which are important for its secretion and function (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine).

The secondary structure of PEBP4 is not explicitly detailed in the context, but it is part of a superfamily that includes proteins with distinct structural features such as α helices and β sheets, as seen in other PEBP family members (Banfield1998Function). PEBP4's tertiary structure is implied to be important for its interaction with other proteins, such as Raf-1 and MEK1, affecting cellular signaling pathways (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine).

PEBP4 is known to have splice variant isoforms, which may result in different functional forms of the protein, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The protein's role in cancer progression and sperm motility suggests it has both extracellular and intracellular functions (An2012Purification; He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine).

## Function
Phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 4 (PEBP4) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and apoptosis regulation. In healthy human cells, PEBP4 is predominantly expressed in tissues such as skeletal muscle, heart, and thyroid (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine). It is a secreted protein, unlike other members of the PEBP family, and its secretion is dependent on both N-terminal and C-terminal sequences (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine).

PEBP4 plays a role in modulating key signaling pathways, such as the ERK/JNK and Akt pathways. It interacts with components of the MAPK pathway, including Raf-1 and MEK1, to inhibit MEK1 activation, which can prevent apoptosis induced by factors like TNFα (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine). This protein is also involved in maintaining membrane integrity by preventing phosphatidylethanolamine externalization, a process crucial for cell survival (Wang2004A).

The protein's activity is not limited to intracellular functions; it may also have extracellular roles, similar to other proteins like thioredoxin and HMGB1 (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine). The exact role of PEBP4 in healthy cells is not fully understood, but its involvement in these pathways suggests it contributes to cell growth, survival, and possibly other cellular functions (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine).

## Clinical Significance
PEBP4 (phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 4) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cell signaling and apoptosis. Alterations in PEBP4 expression are associated with cancer progression, particularly in breast and prostate cancers, where it may promote tumor growth and metastasis. In breast cancer, overexpression of PEBP4 is linked to increased malignancy by affecting pathways such as PI3K/AKT (Wang2023Comprehensive). In prostate cancer, PEBP4 expression is significantly increased, especially under hypoxic conditions, promoting migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (Li2016PEBP4).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PEBP4 enhances cell proliferation and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis and as a potential therapeutic target (Yu2012PEBP4). PEBP4 is also involved in liver diseases, where its deficiency exacerbates liver fibrosis and acute liver injury by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, indicating its protective role in liver function (Qu2022HepatocyteConditional; Luo2022Phosphatidylethanolaminebinding). In IgA nephropathy, PEBP4 is upregulated and associated with IgA-positive B-cells, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for the disease (Taylor2019Phosphatidylethanolamine).

## Interactions
Phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 4 (PEBP4) is involved in several protein interactions that influence key signaling pathways. PEBP4 interacts with Raf-1 and MEK1, forming a scaffold that augments their interaction and influences the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. This interaction can modulate ERK activation, with PEBP4 expression levels determining whether ERK activation is enhanced or suppressed (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine). PEBP4 also acts as a scaffold for Src, Akt, and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), enhancing the activation of Akt and ERα. Silencing PEBP4 has been shown to inhibit Akt phosphorylation at serine 473, indicating its role in Akt pathway regulation (He2016Phosphatidylethanolamine).

In the context of cancer, PEBP4 is implicated in the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, contributing to cancer cell resistance to therapies. It enhances Akt phosphorylation, particularly at serine 473, which is linked to reactive oxygen species accumulation (The; p&gt; Luo2019&lt). PEBP4 also interacts with the NF-κB signaling pathway, where its deficiency leads to increased activation of NF-κB, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and IκB-α, and nuclear NF-κB p65 expression (Luo2022Phosphatidylethanolaminebinding). These interactions highlight PEBP4's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in cell survival, proliferation, and inflammation.
