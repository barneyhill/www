# GAS2L2

## Overview
GAS2L2 is a gene that encodes the protein growth arrest specific 2 like 2, which is a member of the GAS2 protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and stability, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as cell polarization, motility, and ciliary function. GAS2L2 interacts with microtubule plus-end tracking proteins and end-binding (EB) proteins, facilitating communication between microtubules and actin filaments. This interaction is essential for maintaining the orientation and performance of cilia, particularly in airway epithelial cells, which is vital for effective mucociliary clearance (Stroud2014GAS2like; BizakiVallaskangas2024Genomewide). The protein's activity is significant in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell shape, stability, and division (Zhang2020Growth).

## Function
GAS2L2 is a protein-coding gene involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and stability, primarily through its interactions with microtubule plus-end tracking proteins such as MAPRE1. This gene plays a crucial role in maintaining the orientation and performance of cilia, particularly in airway epithelial cells, which is essential for effective mucociliary clearance (BizakiVallaskangas2024Genomewide). GAS2L2 is part of the GAS2 protein family, which includes proteins that interact with both actin filaments and microtubules, contributing to cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology (Zhang2020Growth).

The protein encoded by GAS2L2 is involved in mediating communication between microtubules and actin filaments through interactions with end-binding (EB) proteins. This interaction is significant for microtubule guidance along actin stress fibers, impacting cellular processes such as cell polarization and motility (Stroud2014GAS2like). GAS2L2's role in these processes is facilitated by its C-terminal region, which contains microtubule localization sequences crucial for its function (Stroud2014GAS2like). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm is vital for maintaining cell shape and stability, influencing cell division and motility (Zhang2020Growth).

## Clinical Significance
The GAS2L2 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Mutations or alterations in GAS2L2 expression have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition characterized by impaired cilia orientation and mucociliary clearance, which can lead to respiratory issues (BizakiVallaskangas2024Genomewide). The gene is also linked to chronic rhinosinusitis and other sinonasal and pharyngeal diseases, with the variant rs3744374 being specifically associated with these conditions. Although this variant is predicted to be benign, it has been noted for its protective effect against chronic rhinosinusitis (BizakiVallaskangas2024Genomewide).

GAS2L2 is also associated with otitis media, particularly the mucous subtype, where it may influence ciliary function and mucosal health. The gene's involvement in otitis media is highlighted by its greater effect on chronic mucous otitis media compared to chronic secretory otitis media (BizakiVallaskangas2024Genomewide). Additionally, alterations in GAS2L2 expression have been linked to diseases of the middle ear and mastoid, as well as other upper respiratory tract diseases (BizakiVallaskangas2024Genomewide). These associations suggest that GAS2L2 may play a significant role in the pathobiology of these conditions.

## Interactions
GAS2L2 interacts with end-binding (EB) proteins, such as EB1 and EB3, which are crucial for microtubule (MT) plus-end localization. The C-termini of GAS2L2 contain putative binding sites for these EB proteins, facilitating their interaction and colocalization at MT plus-ends (Stroud2014GAS2like). This interaction is significant for the regulation of MT dynamics, as GAS2L2 can recruit EB proteins to actin stress fibers, influencing MT growth rates and orientation (Stroud2014GAS2like). 

Mutations in the microtubule localization sequences (MtLSs) of GAS2L2 disrupt its ability to localize to MT ends and track with EB proteins, highlighting the importance of these sites for its function (Stroud2014GAS2like). GAS2L2 also plays a role in stabilizing MTs, making them resistant to depolymerizing agents, an effect attributed to its interaction with EB proteins (Stroud2014GAS2like). 

In addition to its interactions with EB proteins, GAS2L2 is involved in the regulation of ciliary orientation and mucociliary clearance, which is linked to its role in microtubule dynamics and stability (BizakiVallaskangas2024Genomewide). These interactions suggest that GAS2L2 is integral to the communication between microtubules and actin filaments, influencing cellular processes such as MT guidance and stability (Stroud2014GAS2like).
