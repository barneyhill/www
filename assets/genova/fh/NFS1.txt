# NFS1

## Overview
NFS1 is a gene that encodes the NFS1 cysteine desulfurase, an enzyme crucial for the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in eukaryotic cells. These clusters are vital cofactors involved in numerous cellular processes, including electron transport, enzyme catalysis, and DNA repair. The NFS1 protein is categorized as a cysteine desulfurase and is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it forms a complex with ISD11 and ISCU to facilitate the maturation of Fe-S proteins across various cellular compartments (Biederbick2006Role; Marelja2013The). Structurally, NFS1 shares similarities with its bacterial counterpart, IscS, but exhibits unique oligomeric architecture in eukaryotes, forming a complex with ISD11 and ACP that is essential for its function (Cory2017Structure). Mutations in the NFS1 gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and mitochondrial function (Hershkovitz2021A; Kispal1999The).

## Structure
The NFS1 protein is a cysteine desulfurase involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. Its primary structure is encoded by the NFS1 gene. The secondary structure of NFS1 includes both alpha-helical and beta-stranded elements, similar to its bacterial counterpart, IscS, with which it shares a 60% sequence identity (Cory2017Structure). The tertiary structure of NFS1 forms a unique oligomeric architecture, distinct from the canonical E. coli IscS dimer, and includes a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) cofactor binding domain (Cory2017Structure). This cofactor is anchored by invariant residues such as T128, S255, and H257, which play a role in stabilizing the PLP (Cory2017Structure).

In its quaternary structure, NFS1 forms a complex with ISD11 and ACP, which is crucial for its function in eukaryotic Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. This complex exhibits a unique α2β2γ2 assembly, with ISD11 forming the dimeric core, unlike in prokaryotic systems (Cory2017Structure). The interaction with ISD11 and ACP is essential for the stability and function of the NFS1 complex, highlighting the structural differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems (Cory2017Structure).

## Function
NFS1 is a cysteine desulfurase enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in human cells. These clusters are essential cofactors for various cellular processes, including electron transport, enzyme catalysis, DNA repair, and iron regulation. NFS1 is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it forms a complex with ISD11 and ISCU, contributing to the maturation of mitochondrial, cytosolic, and nuclear Fe-S proteins (Biederbick2006Role; Marelja2013The). 

The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of cysteine into a persulfide form, which is then transferred to the scaffold protein ISCU to form Fe-S cluster intermediates. This process is facilitated by the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate and is enhanced by the accessory protein Isd11 and frataxin, which stimulates NFS1 activity by exposing substrate-binding sites (Maio2020Outlining; Pandey2013Frataxin). 

NFS1 also provides sulfur for the thiomodification of tRNAs and interacts with MOCS3 in the cytosol to supply sulfur for molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis, essential for the activity of enzymes like xanthine dehydrogenase and sulfite oxidase (Marelja2013The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and supporting cell growth (Biederbick2006Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NFS1 gene are associated with mitochondrial disorders characterized by acute metabolic crises, infantile progressive hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and abnormal urinary organic acid profiles. These conditions are linked to deficiencies in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, particularly complexes I, II, and III. A specific pathogenic variant, c.215G>A; p.Arg72Gln, has been identified in affected individuals, disrupting the NFS1 protein's interaction with ISD11, a protein necessary for its function. This disruption affects the formation of iron-sulfur clusters (FeSCs), crucial for mitochondrial function, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Hershkovitz2021A).

The NFS1 gene's role in Fe/S cluster biosynthesis is critical, and its dysfunction can lead to cellular iron homeostasis issues and oxidative stress. In yeast models, depletion of Nfs1p, the yeast orthologue of NFS1, results in impaired Fe/S protein function, highlighting the potential for similar impacts in humans (Kispal1999The). The clinical significance of NFS1 mutations underscores the importance of genetic resolution for prenatal diagnosis and potential treatment options, such as mitochondrial co-factor therapy or cysteine supplementation, for affected individuals (Hershkovitz2021A).

## Interactions
NFS1, a cysteine desulfurase, is a key component of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly machinery. It forms a stable complex with ISD11, a protein essential for its stability and function. This interaction is crucial for preventing NFS1 aggregation and maintaining its membrane association, although ISD11 is not essential for the desulfurase activity itself (Adam2005The). The NFS1-ISD11 complex is part of a larger assembly that includes the acyl carrier protein (ACP), which stabilizes the complex by interacting with ISD11. The acyl-group of ACP occupies the hydrophobic core of ISD11, contributing to the stability of the complex (Cory2017Structure).

NFS1 also interacts with the iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein ISCU, binding preferentially to its disordered state. This interaction is critical for Fe-S cluster assembly, as it facilitates the transfer of sulfur to ISCU (Cai2013Human). The mitochondrial chaperone mtHSP70 and co-chaperone HSC20 also interact with ISCU, with mtHSP70 binding to the disordered state and HSC20 to the structured state, further influencing the assembly process (Cai2013Human). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions necessary for the proper function of NFS1 in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biosynthesis.
