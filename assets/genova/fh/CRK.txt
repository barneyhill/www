# CRK

## Overview
CRK is a gene that encodes the CRK proto-oncogene, an adaptor protein involved in various intracellular signaling pathways. The CRK protein is characterized by its Src homology 2 (SH2) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction. As an adaptor protein, CRK is integral in linking receptor-type tyrosine kinases to downstream signaling molecules, influencing cellular processes such as morphology, differentiation, and movement (Hasegawa1996DOCK180; Nishihara2002Molecular). The protein is particularly significant in integrin signaling and the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, where it forms complexes that activate small GTPases like Rac1, leading to actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Albert2000αvβ5). CRK's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular functions and its potential role in oncogenesis, as alterations in CRK expression and function are linked to various cancers (Park2021Crk; Sriram2010Emerging).

## Structure
The CRK proto-oncogene adaptor protein is composed of a single SH2 domain, an N-terminal SH3 domain (SH3 N), and a C-terminal SH3 domain (SH3 C), connected by a 50-residue linker containing a phosphorylatable tyrosine residue (Tyr222) (Sarkar2007Proline; Sarkar2010Structural). The SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues, while the SH3 domains interact with proline-rich sequences (Nishihara2002Molecular). The SH3 C domain is unique in that it does not bind conventional polyproline II (PPII)-type sequences due to the absence of aromatic residues on its binding surface (Sarkar2007Proline).

Proline cis-trans isomerization at Pro238 acts as a molecular switch, toggling the protein between an autoinhibitory conformation in the cis form and an uninhibited conformation in the trans form (Sarkar2010Structural). This isomerization is catalyzed by peptidyl-prolyl isomerases like Cyclophilin A (Sarkar2007Proline; Sarkar2010Structural). Phosphorylation of Tyr222 by Abl kinase modulates the autoinhibitory conformation, affecting the protein's activity (Sarkar2007Proline).

CRK exists in different splice variants, including c-Crk-I and c-Crk-II, with c-Crk-II containing an additional SH3 domain compared to c-Crk-I (Nishihara2002Molecular). These structural features and modifications play crucial roles in CRK's function in intracellular signaling.

## Function
The CRK proto-oncogene adaptor protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular signaling pathways, primarily through its SH2 and SH3 domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. CRK acts as a bridge between receptor-type tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling molecules, such as the Ras family proteins, influencing cell morphology and differentiation (Hasegawa1996DOCK180). It is involved in integrin signaling and cell movement by forming complexes with proteins like p130 Cas and DOCK180, which are components of focal adhesions. These complexes activate Rac1, a small GTPase involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization, leading to cell spreading and morphological changes (Kiyokawa1998Activation).

CRK is also crucial in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, where it is recruited by the αvβ5 integrin to form a complex with Dock180 and Rac1, facilitating phagosome formation and actin reorganization (Albert2000αvβ5). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it influences processes like cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular responses to external stimuli (Nishihara2002Molecular). Through these interactions, CRK contributes to cell migration, proliferation, and survival, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular functions in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CRK gene, including overexpression and mutations, are implicated in various cancers. In lung cancer, elevated levels of CRK mRNA and protein are associated with advanced and poorly differentiated tumors, correlating with poor survival outcomes (Sriram2010Emerging). CRK and its family member CRKL are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to cancer cell invasiveness and chemoresistance, particularly in colorectal cancer (Franke2020Novel). Overexpression of CRK and CRKL is linked to poor prognosis in cancers such as lung, breast, gastric, ovarian, and colorectal cancers, with their knockdown reducing tumor cell migration and invasion (Park2021Crk).

In breast cancer, CRK expression correlates with cancer staging, and its knockdown reduces invasion and migration of cancer cells (Sriram2010Emerging). In glioblastoma, elevated CRK expression is associated with increased cell motility and tumor growth (Sriram2010Emerging). CRK is also involved in synovial sarcoma and ovarian cancer, where its knockdown suppresses tumor growth and motility (Sriram2010Emerging). The CRK/DOCK180/Rac1 pathway is implicated in promoting malignant behavior in ovarian cancer cells (Sriram2010Emerging). These findings suggest that CRK and CRKL are critical for tumor growth and metastasis, making them potential therapeutic targets in cancer treatment (Park2021Crk).

## Interactions
The CRK proto-oncogene encodes an adaptor protein that participates in numerous protein interactions through its Src homology 2 (SH2) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. The SH2 domain of CRK binds to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, particularly those with the Y-x-x-P motif, interacting with proteins such as p130Cas, paxillin, Dab1, p120c-Cbl, Gab1, and CasL/Efs. These interactions are crucial for signal transduction and are often initiated by growth factors and cytokines (sarkar2010strutural).

The SH3 domains of CRK, particularly the SH3 N domain, bind to proline-rich sequences, with a preference for the P-x-x-P-x-K motif. Notable binding partners include C3G, DOCK180, c-Abl, Bcr-Abl, and Tel-Abl. The interaction with C3G is significant for activating the MAPK pathway, which is important for neuroblast differentiation (sarkar2010strutural). The SH3 N domain also interacts with guanine nucleotide exchange factors like SOS1 and DOCK180, which are essential for CRK-induced cellular transformation and migration (Zheng2010Proteins).

CRK's interactions with Abl family kinases are complex, involving bidirectional regulation where Crk transactivates Abl and Abl transinhibits CrkII and CrkL. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation events, particularly at Crk Y222, affecting cell adhesion and migration (sarkar2010strutural). The SH3 C domain of CRK, although less characterized, is involved in regulating these interactions and enhancing the ability to activate c-Abl (sarkar2010strutural).
