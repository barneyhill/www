# HSPB3

## Overview
HSPB3 is a gene that encodes the heat shock protein family B (small) member 3, a small heat shock protein (sHsp) involved in cellular stress responses and muscle differentiation. The HSPB3 protein is characterized by its small size and acidic nature, with a conserved α-crystallin domain that is essential for its function as a holdase chaperone, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Benndorf2022Human; Boelens1998HspB3). Predominantly expressed in skeletal muscles, HSPB3 plays a critical role in myogenesis by interacting with the lamin B receptor (LBR) to regulate chromatin remodeling and nuclear architecture, thereby influencing gene expression during muscle cell differentiation (Tiago2021Small). Mutations in the HSPB3 gene have been linked to neuromuscular disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 2C, highlighting its clinical significance (Sarparanta2020Neuromuscular; Nam2018Small). Additionally, alterations in HSPB3 expression have been associated with colorectal adenocarcinoma, suggesting a broader role in disease pathology (Kalioraki2019Heat).

## Structure
The HSPB3 protein is a small heat shock protein characterized by a unique molecular structure. It consists of 150 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 16,968 Da and an isoelectric point of 5.95, making it relatively small and acidic compared to other human small heat shock proteins (sHsps) (Boelens1998HspB3). The primary structure of HSPB3 includes a conserved α-crystallin domain, which is a common feature among sHsps, spanning from approximately positions 83 to 168 (Boelens1998HspB3). This domain is crucial for the protein's function as a holdase chaperone, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Benndorf2022Human).

HSPB3's secondary structure includes a β sandwich of two antiparallel β sheets within the α-crystallin domain, which forms the dimeric building blocks of sHsp oligomers (Kappé2003The). The N-terminal region of HSPB3 is disordered, suggesting its potential to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which is important for its role in myogenesis (Tiago2021Small). HSPB3 is intronless, but a predicted splice variant, HspB3-alt, could result from the splicing of a 117-bp pseudointron, leading to a protein missing 39 residues (Kappé2003The). The protein may have recognition sites for casein kinase II, although it lacks sites for other kinases like MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (Boelens1998HspB3).

## Function
HSPB3, a small heat-shock protein, plays a crucial role in muscle cell differentiation and function. It is primarily expressed in skeletal muscles and is upregulated during myoblast differentiation, particularly after MYOD overexpression (Tiago2021Small). HSPB3 interacts with the lamin B receptor (LBR) in the nucleoplasm, maintaining it in a dynamic state that promotes the transcription of myogenic genes, which are essential for muscle differentiation and extracellular matrix remodeling (Tiago2021Small). This interaction is vital for the transition from LBR-tethered to LMNA-tethered chromatin, facilitating cell cycle exit and commitment to differentiation (Tiago2021Small).

HSPB3 is involved in chromatin remodeling and nuclear architecture regulation, influencing gene expression during myogenic differentiation (Tiago2021Small). It forms nuclear condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation, affecting LBR distribution and promoting myogenesis by regulating myogenic gene expression (Tiago2021Small). HSPB3 also plays a role in maintaining the quality control of nuclear envelope-embedded proteins, which are important for gene expression regulation during differentiation (Tiago2021Small). Its function is crucial for muscle development and repair, as it promotes the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix remodeling and connective tissue development (Tiago2021Small).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSPB3 gene are associated with several neuromuscular disorders, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 2C (dHMN2C). A notable mutation, c.352T>C (p.Tyr118His), has been identified in families with CMT2, characterized by axonal neuropathy, muscle weakness, and atrophy (Lim2022Genetic; Nam2018Small). This mutation is located in a conserved region of the HSPB3 gene and is predicted to be pathogenic, affecting the interaction between HSPB3 and HSPB2, leading to protein aggregation and disruption of normal cellular functions (Sarparanta2020Neuromuscular).

Another mutation, p.R7S, is associated with dHMN2C and involves a missense change that affects the protein's function by eliminating a crucial arginine residue (Benndorf2014Neuropathy). These mutations often exhibit a dominant inheritance pattern and can lead to a range of clinical phenotypes, from motor-predominant symptoms to sensorimotor involvement (Sarparanta2020Neuromuscular).

Alterations in HSPB3 expression levels have also been implicated in colorectal adenocarcinoma, where downregulation of HSPB3 mRNA is associated with poorer prognosis and increased risk of recurrence and death (Kalioraki2019Heat).

## Interactions
HSPB3, a small heat shock protein, primarily interacts with HSPB2 to form a well-defined heterooligomeric complex with a unique 3:1 subunit ratio of HSPB2 to HSPB3. This complex is stable and does not interact with other small heat shock proteins such as HSP20, HSP27, or αB-crystallin, although HSPB2 alone can interact with HSP20 (den2009The). The HSPB2/B3 complex exhibits poor chaperone and thermoprotective activities compared to other sHSPs like αB-crystallin (den2009The).

HSPB3 also interacts with the lamin B receptor (LBR) in the nucleoplasm, playing a crucial role in muscle cell differentiation by maintaining LBR in a dynamic state to promote the transcription of myogenic genes. The R116P mutation in HSPB3 disrupts this interaction, leading to nuclear aggregates that immobilize LBR and prevent myoblast differentiation (Tiago2021Small). This mutation also disrupts the interaction with HSPB2, preventing the formation of the HSPB2-HSPB3 complex, which is linked to myopathy (Boelens2020Structural). These interactions highlight the importance of HSPB3 in maintaining cellular functions and its role in neuromuscular diseases.
