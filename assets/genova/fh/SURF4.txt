# SURF4

## Overview
The SURF4 gene encodes the surfeit 4 protein, a polytopic transmembrane protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein functions as a cargo receptor, playing a pivotal role in the trafficking of proteins between the ER and the Golgi apparatus. SURF4 is involved in the ER export of various cargos, including erythropoietin, proinsulin, and PCSK9, which are essential for processes such as erythropoiesis, insulin secretion, and cholesterol metabolism (Emmer2018The; Saegusa2022Cargo; Lin2020The). The protein's structure, characterized by eight transmembrane α-helices, facilitates its interaction with specific amino-terminal tripeptide motifs on soluble cargo proteins, enabling their preferential export from the ER (Shen2022Surf4; Yin2018Surf4). SURF4's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing diseases associated with protein misfolding and aggregation, influencing various physiological processes and organismal health. Additionally, mutations and altered expression of the SURF4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2021Atherosclerosisassociated; Saegusa2022Cargo).

## Structure
The SURF4 protein is a polytopic transmembrane protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It consists of 269 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa (Shen2022Surf4). The protein is characterized by eight putative transmembrane α-helices, with cytosolic N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain begins with a 21 amino acid α-helix, followed by a short loop connecting to the first transmembrane α-helix. The C-terminal domain includes a short α-helix of eight amino acid residues connected to the last transmembrane α-helix by a 6-amino acid loop (Shen2022Surf4).

SURF4 contains a di-lysine ER localization motif near the end of the C-terminal domain, which is crucial for its ER retrieval function (Yin2018Surf4). This motif is involved in the protein's cycling between the ER and Golgi apparatus, as mutations in this region can lead to Golgi accumulation (Shen2022Surf4). The protein's structure allows it to bind amino-terminal tripeptide motifs of soluble cargo proteins, facilitating their exit from the ER (Yin2018Surf4). The specific domains and motifs of SURF4 are essential for its role in cargo trafficking and ER-Golgi transport.

## Function
The SURF4 gene encodes a protein that functions as a cargo receptor, playing a crucial role in the trafficking of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. SURF4 is primarily localized within the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and cycles between the ER and Golgi, facilitating the incorporation of secretory proteins into COPII vesicles for ER export (Shen2022Surf4). It recognizes and binds to specific amino-terminal tripeptide motifs, known as ER-ESCAPE motifs, on soluble cargo proteins, enabling their preferential export from the ER and preventing aggregation (Yin2018Surf4).

SURF4 is involved in the ER export of various cargos, including erythropoietin (EPO), proinsulin, and PCSK9, which are essential for processes such as erythropoiesis, insulin secretion, and cholesterol metabolism, respectively (Emmer2018The; Saegusa2022Cargo; Lin2020The). The protein also plays a role in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER, interacting with the COPI complex, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing diseases associated with protein misfolding and aggregation (Shen2022Surf4). In healthy human cells, SURF4's activity is essential for proper protein trafficking and secretion, influencing various physiological processes and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SURF4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. SURF4 is associated with lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, as it plays a crucial role in the secretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) from the liver. Variants in the SURF4 gene, such as rs3758348, have been linked to reduced plasma levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis (Wang2021Atherosclerosisassociated). In mouse models, hepatic SURF4 knockout significantly reduced plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, indicating its role in lipid regulation and atherosclerosis prevention (Wang2021Atherosclerosisassociated).

SURF4 also influences insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. Loss-of-function mutations in SURF4 can impair glucose tolerance, a symptom associated with diabetes mellitus. This suggests that SURF4 may be a limiting factor for insulin secretion, and enhancing its expression could improve insulin secretion and glucose levels (Saegusa2022Cargo).

In B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), high expression levels of SURF4 are associated with poorer overall survival, indicating its potential as a biomarker for prognosis in B-ALL patients (RuizCiancio2023The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SURF4 in various metabolic and oncological conditions.

## Interactions
SURF4, a human gene encoding the surfeit locus protein 4, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. SURF4 acts as a cargo receptor, binding to amino-terminal tripeptide motifs known as ER-ESCAPE motifs on soluble cargo proteins. This interaction is essential for prioritizing the exit of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (Yin2018Surf4). SURF4 interacts with proteins such as dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), amelogenin (AMELX), and growth hormone (GH), facilitating their trafficking through the secretory pathway (Yin2018Surf4).

SURF4 also plays a role in the secretion of erythropoietin (EPO), where it physically interacts with EPO to mediate its ER-to-Golgi transport. This interaction is specific, as similar proteins like thrombopoietin do not depend on SURF4 for secretion (Lin2020The). Additionally, SURF4 is involved in the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) by interacting with the viral protein NS4B. This interaction is crucial for HCV RNA replication, highlighting SURF4's role in viral processes (Kong2020Surfeit). These interactions underscore SURF4's significance in protein trafficking and viral replication.
