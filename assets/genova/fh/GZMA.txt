# GZMA

## Overview
The GZMA gene encodes granzyme A, a serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Granzyme A is involved in modulating inflammatory responses and mediating apoptosis through its proteolytic activity. It is characterized by a trypsin-like fold and a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic function (Vahedi2014Human; Bell2003The). Unlike other granzymes, granzyme A forms a unique disulfide-linked homodimer, which influences its substrate specificity and stability (HinkSchauer2003Crystal). The protein is internalized by target cells and, upon activation, cleaves various intracellular substrates, contributing to immune surveillance and pathogen clearance (lieberman2010granzyme). Alterations in GZMA expression have been linked to diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in both inflammatory and immune responses (MorenoMartinez2022Hemizygous; Mareboina2024Comprehensive).

## Structure
Granzyme A (GZMA) is a serine protease with a trypsin-like fold, characterized by a catalytic triad composed of Ser195, His57, and Asp102, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Vahedi2014Human; Bell2003The). The primary structure of GZMA includes a sequence of amino acids that form a polypeptide chain, which undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Vahedi2014Human).

The secondary structure of GZMA consists of two β-barrel domains connected by a flexible loop between residues 109-134 (Bell2003The). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these domains, contributing to the enzyme's active site and substrate specificity. GZMA forms a stable disulfide-linked homodimer, a unique feature among human granzymes, which influences its substrate specificity and stability (Bell2003The; HinkSchauer2003Crystal).

The quaternary structure of GZMA is characterized by its dimeric form, stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys93 residues, and involves hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds at the dimer interface (HinkSchauer2003Crystal; Bell2003The). This dimerization is conserved in mammalian species and is thought to provide a selective advantage for substrate recognition (HinkSchauer2003Crystal).

## Function
Granzyme A (GZMA) is a serine protease primarily expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, playing a significant role in immune responses. In healthy human cells, GZMA is involved in modulating inflammatory reactions rather than directly inducing cytotoxicity. It can stimulate monocytic cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), TNF-α, and IL-6, a process that is dependent on caspase-1 activation (Metkar2008Human). This cytokine induction suggests that GZMA acts as a mediator linking cytotoxic activity with proinflammatory responses, highlighting its role in immune regulation (Metkar2008Human).

GZMA is internalized by target cells and requires release into the cytosol to signal proinflammatory cytokine gene expression (Metkar2008Human). It is stored in an inactive form within cytotoxic granules and becomes active upon release into the immune synapse, where it enters target cells with the help of perforin (lieberman2010granzyme). GZMA's activity in the cytoplasm involves cleaving specific substrates, which contributes to its role in immune surveillance and pathogen clearance (lieberman2010granzyme).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the GZMA gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), elevated levels of granzyme A (GZMA) are associated with increased inflammation, a key feature of the disease. Studies have shown that hemizygous mice with reduced GZMA levels exhibit a slightly extended lifespan, suggesting that partial downregulation of GZMA may slow ALS progression by modulating inflammation and oxidative stress (MorenoMartinez2022Hemizygous).

In cancer, GZMA plays a complex role. It is involved in anti-tumor immunity, with its expression levels influencing clinical outcomes. For instance, high GZMA expression is linked to better survival in breast cancer, while deletions in GZMA are observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma (Mareboina2024Comprehensive). Additionally, GZMA mutations have been associated with varying survival outcomes across different cancer types, such as breast cancer and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (Mareboina2024Comprehensive).

GZMA is also involved in proinflammatory cytokine induction, which can contribute to immunopathological conditions like the Hemophagocytic Syndrome, characterized by cytokine hypersecretion (Metkar2008Human). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in both inflammatory and immune responses, with potential implications for therapeutic targeting.

## Interactions
Granzyme A (GZMA) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in inducing apoptosis. GZMA cleaves various intracellular substrates, including the nucleosome assembly protein SET, PHAP II, TAF-Iβ, and histones, which are crucial for maintaining nuclear integrity and function (Zhang2001Granzymes; Beresford1997Recombinant). It also interacts with poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), cleaving it at a specific site after Lys 498. This cleavage disrupts PARP-1's function in DNA repair, contributing to GZMA-induced cell death (Zhu2009The).

GZMA forms a stable complex with PHAP II, a putative HLA-associated protein, and cleaves it, suggesting a role in the granzyme A pathway of cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Beresford1997Recombinant). The enzyme also targets lamins, cleaving laminB and lamins A and C, which are essential components of the nuclear lamina, thereby disrupting the nuclear envelope during apoptosis (Zhang2001Granzymes).

These interactions highlight GZMA's role in modulating cellular processes through its proteolytic activity, contributing to its function in immune responses and apoptosis.
