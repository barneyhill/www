# IGFBPL1

## Overview
IGFBPL1 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a co-factor in insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a binding protein and plays a crucial role in mediating axon growth and maintaining neuronal connectivity, particularly in the central nervous system. IGFBPL1 facilitates the binding of IGF-1 to its receptors, thereby activating signaling pathways essential for axonal elongation and growth, such as the PI3K/mTOR pathway. It is secreted by neural precursor cells and is involved in maintaining cognitive functions and synaptic transmission in the adult brain. Additionally, IGFBPL1 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its role as a tumor suppressor in esophageal cancer and its potential protective effects against atherosclerosis (Butti2022Neural; Hou2023IGFBPL1; Guo2018IGFBPL1).

## Function
IGFBPL1 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-like 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in mediating axon growth and maintaining neuronal connectivity. It functions as a co-factor for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), facilitating its binding to receptors and activating signaling pathways crucial for axonal elongation and growth. This interaction is particularly important in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), where IGFBPL1 enables IGF-1 to activate intracellular calcium signaling and the PI3K/mTOR pathways, essential for axon growth (Guo2018IGFBPL1).

In the adult brain, IGFBPL1 is secreted by neural precursor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and is involved in maintaining striatal connectivity and cognitive functions. It stabilizes IGF-1, supporting GABAergic transmission and synaptic functionality in striatal medium spiny neurons, which are crucial for decision-making and other cognitive processes (Butti2022Neural). The absence of IGFBPL1 leads to impairments in neuronal morphology and synaptic transmission, highlighting its role in neuroprotection and homeostatic regulation within the brain (Butti2022Neural).

## Clinical Significance
IGFBPL1 has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In esophageal cancer, IGFBPL1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is often silenced through promoter region methylation, which is associated with the activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, promoting cancer growth. The methylation of IGFBPL1 is significantly associated with larger tumor sizes and advanced tumor stages in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (Liu2020Epigenetic). Restoring IGFBPL1 expression in esophageal cancer cells has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and cause cell cycle arrest, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2020Epigenetic).

In the context of atherosclerosis, IGFBPL1 expression is decreased in lipid-laden macrophages and unstable atherosclerotic plaques. Overexpression of IGFBPL1 in macrophages reduces lipid accumulation by enhancing cholesterol efflux through the ABCG1 pathway, suggesting a protective role against atherosclerosis. This indicates that IGFBPL1 could serve as a therapeutic target to reduce lipid accumulation in macrophages, potentially mitigating the progression of atherosclerosis (Hou2023IGFBPL1).

IGFBPL1 also plays a role in neural development, particularly in axon growth. It acts as a co-factor for IGF-1, crucial for regulating axon growth through IGF-1-mediated signaling pathways. Alterations in IGFBPL1 expression or its interaction with IGF-1 can impact neuronal development and regeneration, which may have implications for neurodegenerative diseases or injury recovery (Guo2018IGFBPL1).

## Interactions
IGFBPL1 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-like 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of the primary interactions of IGFBPL1 is with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). This interaction is crucial for promoting axon growth, as IGFBPL1 binds directly to IGF-1, facilitating the activation of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling pathways. This binding is essential for the axon growth-promoting effects of IGFBPL1, as demonstrated by the disruption of IGF-1 binding to its receptor, which abolishes IGFBPL1's growth-promoting activity (Guo2018IGFBPL1).

IGFBPL1 also interacts with the netrin-1 receptor DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma), as identified through protein-protein interaction studies. This interaction was confirmed using surface plasmon resonance, which validated the binding of DCC to IGFBPL1 (Wojtowicz2020A).

These interactions highlight IGFBPL1's role as a co-factor in IGF-1-mediated signaling pathways, particularly in the context of axon growth and development. The protein's ability to bind with IGF-1 and DCC suggests its involvement in complex signaling networks that regulate cellular growth and differentiation.
