# ZNF454

## Overview
ZNF454 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 454, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by zinc finger motifs that enable it to bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression. Zinc finger protein 454 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA transcription, replication, and repair. These functions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper cell growth and differentiation. The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cell biology, particularly in maintaining the balance and integrity of cellular functions. Alterations in the methylation status of ZNF454 have been implicated in cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for early detection and diagnosis in malignancies such as endometrial cancer (Severson2013Coordinate; Wang2022Hypermethylated).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF454 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its methylation status. In toxicant-induced malignant transformation, ZNF454 is subject to epigenetic silencing through DNA hypermethylation and histone modification, specifically the replacement of H3K4me3 with H3K9me3 at its promoter. This leads to its downregulation, which is associated with increased MAPK signaling and cellular proliferation, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Severson2013Coordinate).

In endometrial cancer, ZNF454 has been identified as a potential biomarker due to its hypermethylation. Studies have shown that ZNF454, along with CDO1, exhibits high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between malignant and benign endometrial tissues, making it a promising candidate for non-invasive cancer screening (Wang2022Hypermethylated). The methylation of ZNF454 is significantly different in various types of endometrial carcinoma, further supporting its diagnostic potential (Wang2022Hypermethylated).

Overall, the hypermethylation and subsequent downregulation of ZNF454 are significant in the context of cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for early detection and diagnosis in malignancies such as endometrial cancer.
