# PPP4R3B

## Overview
PPP4R3B is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 3B, a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex. This protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit and plays a significant role in DNA damage repair, particularly through homologous recombination-mediated processes. The PP4 complex, which includes a catalytic subunit (PP4c), a scaffolding subunit (PPP4R2), and regulatory subunits such as PPP4R3B, is essential for maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the dephosphorylation of key proteins involved in DNA repair. PPP4R3B is involved in the subcellular localization and substrate recognition of the PP4 complex, interacting with proteins like centrobin (CNTRB) to regulate their phosphorylation status, which is critical for effective DNA repair (RéthiNagy2023Protein). Additionally, PPP4R3B has been implicated in broader protein interaction networks and is associated with clinical conditions such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (Amrom2019Duplication; Knapp2019Affinity; Lu2024Multiomics).

## Structure


## Function
PPP4R3B encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), which plays a crucial role in DNA damage repair, particularly in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair processes. PP4 is a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic subunit (PP4c), a scaffolding subunit (PPP4R2), and a regulatory subunit, which includes PPP4R3B. The R3 subunit, including its isoforms R3A and R3B, is responsible for the subcellular localization and substrate recognition of PP4, facilitating its role in DNA repair (RéthiNagy2023Protein).

PPP4R3B interacts with the centrosomal protein centrobin (CNTRB), which is involved in DNA repair through HR. This interaction is mediated by a specific PP4-binding motif (FRVP) in CNTRB, which is essential for the recruitment of PPP4R3B. The integrity of this motif is crucial for CNTRB's binding to PPP4R3B, both in vitro and in vivo (RéthiNagy2023Protein). The interaction between CNTRB and PP4, including PPP4R3B, is vital for regulating the phospho-status of CNTRB, which is necessary for effective DNA repair (RéthiNagy2023Protein).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, PPP4R3B is involved in the dephosphorylation of γH2AX, a histone variant phosphorylated at serine 139, which is crucial for DNA repair machinery accumulation and signaling DNA damage (RéthiNagy2023Protein). This dephosphorylation is necessary for cell cycle progression following DNA repair, highlighting the importance of PPP4R3B in maintaining genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
The PPP4R3B gene, encoding the protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 3B, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes such as DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Alterations in the expression or function of PPP4R3B have been associated with cancer development, as these changes can impact genomic stability and cell proliferation. In the context of papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), PPP4R3B is included in a Glycolysis-Immune Related Prognostic Index (GIRPI), which has been shown to predict clinical outcomes. Patients with high GIRPI scores, which include alterations in PPP4R3B, tend to have poorer prognoses (Lu2024Multiomics).

Additionally, PPP4R3B is located within a duplicated region on chromosome 2p16, which is associated with perisylvian polymicrogyria (PMG), a brain malformation. This duplication includes 34 genes, with PPP4R3B being one of the genes expressed in the human fetal brain, suggesting a potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Amrom2019Duplication). However, specific diseases directly linked to PPP4R3B mutations or expression alterations are not detailed in the available studies.

## Interactions
PPP4R3B, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), plays a significant role in DNA damage repair processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is part of the PP4 holoenzyme complex, which includes the catalytic subunit PP4c and the scaffolding subunit PPP4R2. PPP4R3B, along with its isoform R3A, is crucial for the subcellular localization and substrate recognition of PP4, binding to conserved motifs in target proteins (RéthiNagy2023Protein).

PPP4R3B specifically interacts with Centrobin (CNTRB), a protein involved in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair. This interaction is mediated by a genuine PP4-binding motif (771-FRVP-774) within CNTRB, which is essential for the recruitment of PPP4R3B. Mutations in this motif disrupt the interaction, highlighting its necessity for CNTRB's function in DNA repair (RéthiNagy2023Protein). The interaction between PPP4R3B and CNTRB is crucial for the regulation of DNA repair processes, as it influences the phosphorylation state of CNTRB, which is vital for its role in DNA repair (RéthiNagy2023Protein).

PPP4R3B is also identified in tandem affinity purification datasets of adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (ADGRs), suggesting its involvement in broader protein interaction networks (Knapp2019Affinity).
