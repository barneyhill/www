# TUBA1B

## Overview
TUBA1B is a gene that encodes the tubulin alpha-1b chain, a protein that is a fundamental component of microtubules, which are part of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. The tubulin alpha-1b protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and enabling cell division. As a structural protein, it is involved in the dynamic assembly and disassembly of microtubules, processes essential for mitosis and cellular trafficking (Snelleksz2021Lower; Wang2024Tubulin). TUBA1B is expressed in various tissues and is implicated in several cellular interactions and pathways, including those related to cancer progression and immune response modulation (Wang2024Tubulin; Hu2022Tubulin). The gene's expression and mutations have been associated with cancer prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2024Tubulin).

## Function
The TUBA1B gene encodes the tubulin alpha-1b chain, a critical component of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport and cell division. In healthy human cells, TUBA1B plays a significant role in the assembly of the cytoskeleton, contributing to processes such as mitosis and intracellular trafficking. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the formation of microtubules, which are integral to the maintenance of cell shape, polarity, and the organization of cellular components (Snelleksz2021Lower).

TUBA1B is involved in several molecular functions, including tubulin binding, ATPase activity, GTP binding, and ubiquitin-like protein ligase binding. These activities are crucial for the dynamic instability of microtubules, allowing them to rapidly assemble and disassemble, which is vital for cellular processes such as mitotic spindle formation during cell division (Wang2024Tubulin). The protein's interaction with microtubule-binding proteins, facilitated by its C-terminal tail containing glutamic acid residues, is essential for regulating cellular structure and molecular transport (Snelleksz2021Lower). Through these functions, TUBA1B contributes to the proper functioning of cells and the organism as a whole.

## Clinical Significance
TUBA1B, a gene encoding the tubulin alpha-1b chain, plays a significant role in cancer progression and prognosis. Alterations in TUBA1B expression are linked to various cancers, where it is often upregulated, correlating with poor outcomes. High TUBA1B expression is associated with decreased overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer (BRCA), lower-grade glioma (LGG), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and mesothelioma (MESO) (Wang2024Tubulin). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TUBA1B overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic factor (Hu2022Tubulin).

TUBA1B mutations, particularly missense mutations, occur in a small percentage of cancer cases, with the highest frequencies in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) (Wang2024Tubulin). These mutations, along with copy number variations, are associated with increased TUBA1B expression and may serve as risk factors affecting cancer prognosis (Wang2024Tubulin).

TUBA1B expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, suggesting its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and affecting responses to immunotherapy (Wang2024Tubulin; Hu2022Tubulin).

## Interactions
TUBA1B, or tubulin alpha 1b, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with several tubulin isoforms, including TUBA1A, TUBB, TUBB3, TUBB2A, and TUBB2B, forming part of the microtubule structure essential for cell division and intracellular transport (Ramesh2023Prediction; Hu2022Tubulin). TUBA1B also interacts with non-tubulin proteins such as HTT, DPYSL2, SKI, UNC5C, NINL, and DDX41, which are involved in microtubule dynamics and cellular processes (Ramesh2023Prediction).

In cancer, TUBA1B is associated with proteins like CKAP5, KIF11, PRC1, STMN1, and TPX2, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and mitotic spindle formation (Wang2024Tubulin). These interactions suggest a role in cancer progression and response to therapy. TUBA1B's interaction with immune-related pathways is also significant, as it correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint modulation, impacting cancer immunity and response to immunotherapy (Wang2024Tubulin; Hu2022Tubulin).

These interactions highlight TUBA1B's multifaceted role in cellular and cancer biology, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.
