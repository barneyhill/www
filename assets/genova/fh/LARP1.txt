# LARP1

## Overview
LARP1 (La-related protein 1) is a gene that encodes the La ribonucleoprotein 1, a translational regulator protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation and stability. This protein is categorized as a ribonucleoprotein and plays a crucial role in the regulation of 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs, which are essential for the synthesis of ribosomal proteins and translation factors. LARP1 is characterized by its RNA-binding domains, including the La motif (LaM) and the DM15 domain, which facilitate its interaction with RNA molecules. The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with polysomes and interacts with components of the translation initiation machinery, such as eIF4F and eIF4A, as well as the poly(A)-binding protein. LARP1 is also involved in mTOR signaling pathways, influencing cell growth and proliferation. Its expression and activity are implicated in various cancers, where it is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis (Deragon2015The; Tcherkezian2014Proteomic; Maraia2017The).

## Structure
LARP1 (La ribonucleoprotein 1) is a human protein involved in mRNA regulation and translation. It contains several key domains, including the La motif (LaM) and the DM15 domain, which facilitate RNA binding. The LaM domain is a stand-alone RNA-binding domain with high affinity for poly(A) RNA, specifically recognizing the 3'-end of RNA with a preference for adenine-rich sequences (Kozlov2022Structural; Kozlov2023Structural). The LaM domain does not contain an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which is common in other La-related proteins, but it is sufficient for RNA binding (Kozlov2022Structural; Kozlov2023Structural).

The DM15 domain, located at the C-terminus, binds the mRNA 5'-cap and TOP sequences, playing a role in mRNA circularization and translation regulation (Kozlov2022Structural; Lahr2015The). The DM15 region is composed of three helix-turn-helix HEAT-like repeats, forming a unique structure that is evolutionarily conserved and involved in RNA interactions (Lahr2015The). This domain's structure includes a positively charged patch crucial for RNA binding (Lahr2015The).

LARP1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. Multiple splice variant isoforms of LARP1 exist, potentially differing in their functional roles.

## Function
LARP1 (La ribonucleoprotein 1) is a key regulator of mRNA translation and stability in human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs, which are crucial for the synthesis of ribosomal proteins and translation factors. LARP1 binds to the 5' TOP motif and the m7GpppC cap of these mRNAs, influencing their translation and stability (Tcherkezian2014Proteomic; Maraia2017The). This binding can sequester the 5' TOP motif away from eIF4E, thereby inhibiting the formation of eIF4F complexes and translation initiation (Maraia2017The).

LARP1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with polysomes and interacts with components of the translation initiation machinery, such as eIF4F and eIF4A, as well as the poly(A)-binding protein (Deragon2015The; Tcherkezian2014Proteomic). It is also involved in mTOR signaling pathways, where it interacts with Raptor, a component of mTORC1, to regulate cell growth and proliferation (Tcherkezian2014Proteomic). LARP1's role in translation is modulated by mTOR signaling, with its activity increasing under mTOR inhibition, which enhances its association with 5' TOP mRNAs (Philippe2020Larelated; Maraia2017The).

## Clinical Significance
LARP1 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in mRNA stability and translation regulation. In epithelial cancers, such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and non-small cell lung cancer, LARP1 expression is significantly elevated, correlating with disease progression and poor prognosis (Mura2014LARP1). In cervical cancer, LARP1 expression increases from pre-malignant stages to invasive cancer, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Mura2014LARP1).

In ovarian cancer, LARP1 is highly expressed and associated with poor survival outcomes. It stabilizes anti-apoptotic BCL2 mRNAs and destabilizes pro-apoptotic BIK mRNAs, promoting cell survival and chemotherapy resistance (Hopkins2015The). Knockdown of LARP1 in ovarian cancer cells increases apoptosis and reduces tumorigenicity, highlighting its role in maintaining cancer stem cell-like populations and resistance to chemotherapy (Hopkins2015The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), genetic variants in the LARP1 gene, such as rs12055336 and rs6580113, are associated with overall survival in hepatitis B virus-related HCC patients. These variants influence LARP1 mRNA expression levels, affecting patient prognosis (Lu2024Potentially).

## Interactions
LARP1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mRNA translation regulation. It associates with the mTORC1 complex through its interaction with RAPTOR, a component of mTORC1, but not with mTORC2 components like RICTOR. This interaction is mediated by the WD40 C-terminal domain and the RNC domains of RAPTOR (Fonseca2015La-related). LARP1 also binds to the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) via a PAM2-like motif, and this interaction is independent of mTORC1 regulation (Fonseca2015La-related).

LARP1 is involved in the repression of terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNA translation by binding directly to the 5'TOP motif, which is crucial for its function in translation repression (Fonseca2015La-related). It competes with eIF4E for binding to the mRNA cap, preventing the assembly of the eIF4F complex, which is essential for TOP mRNA translation (Lahr2017Larelated). LARP1's interaction with eIF4A1, a component of the eIF4F complex, is maintained even after RNase treatment, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction (Shichino2021A). These interactions highlight LARP1's role as a key regulator of mRNA translation and its involvement in mTORC1-mediated signaling pathways.
