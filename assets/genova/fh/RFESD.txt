# RFESD

## Overview
The RFESD gene encodes the Rieske Fe-S domain-containing protein, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is categorized as an oxidoreductase due to its role in facilitating electron transfer and redox reactions, essential for cellular respiration and ATP production. The RFESD protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and regulating oxidative stress, thereby protecting cells from damage by reactive oxygen species. Dysregulation of RFESD expression has been linked to various health conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and its significance in cellular metabolism and disease (Zhu2020Expressiona; Zhu2020Expression).

## Function
The RFESD gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in electron transport and redox reactions within healthy human cells. This protein contains a Rieske iron-sulfur (Fe-S) domain, which is essential for its function in cellular respiration and energy production. RFESD is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it participates in the electron transport chain, a series of complexes that facilitate the transfer of electrons and contribute to the synthesis of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (Zhu2020Expressiona).

The oxidoreductase activity of the RFESD protein is vital for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. By facilitating electron transfer processes, RFESD supports various metabolic functions that are critical for cell survival and function. The protein's role in redox reactions also helps regulate oxidative stress, which is important for protecting cells from damage caused by reactive oxygen species (Zhu2020Expression).

In addition to its fundamental role in energy metabolism, RFESD's activity in the mitochondria is linked to broader cellular processes, including the regulation of oxidative stress responses. This function is particularly significant in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, where dysregulation of RFESD expression has been associated with adverse outcomes (Zhu2020Expressiona).

## Clinical Significance
The RFESD gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RFESD is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with a shorter overall survival time in patients. The gene's expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, particularly neutrophils, and key immune checkpoint blockade genes, suggesting its role in tumor growth and potential as a target for HCC immunotherapy (Wang2022Novel).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, RFESD has been identified as differentially expressed in mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or non-typical development. The gene is located in a chromosomal region known for copy number variants associated with intellectual and developmental disabilities, indicating its potential involvement in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Zhu2020Expressiona; Zhu2020Expression).

While RFESD has been associated with these conditions, the specific clinical significance of its mutations remains under investigation. The gene's role in oxidative stress responses and its interactions with other genetic and environmental factors are areas of ongoing research (Zhu2020Expressiona).
