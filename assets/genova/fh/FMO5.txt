# FMO5

## Overview
The FMO5 gene encodes the enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase 5, which is a member of the flavin-containing monooxygenase family. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract and plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes, including oxidative stress response, lipid and glucose metabolism, and one-carbon metabolism (Phillips2019Endogenous; Phillips2023Metabolomic). FMO5 functions as a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase, catalyzing the oxidation of carbonyl compounds, and is also implicated in host-microbiome interactions as a potential sensor of gut bacteria (Phillips2019Endogenous; Phillips2023Metabolomic). The gene's activity is linked to metabolic aging and energy regulation, with its absence in knockout models resulting in a lean phenotype and improved metabolic parameters (Phillips2023Metabolomic). These characteristics underscore the gene's importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and its potential implications in metabolic disorders.

## Function
FMO5 (flavin-containing monooxygenase 5) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in various metabolic processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach and intestines, and is also present in the pancreas (Phillips2019Endogenous). FMO5 is involved in the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, unfolded protein response, lipid homeostasis, glucose uptake and metabolism, and one-carbon metabolism (Phillips2023Metabolomic). 

FMO5 functions as a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase, catalyzing the oxidation of carbonyl compounds to form esters by inserting an oxygen atom into a carbon-carbon bond adjacent to the carbonyl group (Phillips2019Endogenous). It also acts as a potential sensor of gut bacteria, influencing host-microbiome interactions (Phillips2023Metabolomic). 

In terms of organismal outcomes, FMO5 is linked to metabolic aging and glucose homeostasis. Its absence in knockout mouse models leads to a lean phenotype with decreased fat deposition, lower plasma glucose, insulin, and cholesterol levels, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (Phillips2023Metabolomic). These findings suggest that FMO5 is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance and energy regulation in mammals.

## Clinical Significance
The FMO5 gene plays a significant role in various metabolic processes, and alterations in its expression or function can have clinical implications. In Fmo5 knockout (Fmo5 -/-) mice, the absence of FMO5 leads to a lean phenotype characterized by reduced weight gain, decreased fat deposition, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. These mice also show resistance to diet-induced obesity, suggesting that FMO5 may influence metabolic conditions related to obesity and insulin resistance (Phillips2023Metabolomic).

Disruption of FMO5 affects lipid metabolism, leading to lower plasma cholesterol levels and decreased white adipose tissue fat stores. This is associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid uptake, transport, and oxidation, which may contribute to metabolic disorders (Phillips2023Metabolomic). The increased hepatic concentration of plasmalogens, which are antioxidants, in Fmo5 -/- mice may protect against oxidative stress and hepatic steatosis, indicating a potential role for FMO5 in managing oxidative stress-related conditions (Phillips2023Metabolomic).

Alterations in FMO5 expression also impact one-carbon metabolism, potentially affecting DNA methylation and metabolic aging, which could have implications for age-related diseases (Phillips2023Metabolomic). The gene's involvement in the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and unfolded protein response further suggests its significance in conditions related to oxidative and metabolic stress (Phillips2023Metabolomic).
