# KLF10

## Overview
KLF10, or Krüppel-like factor 10, is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The protein, also known as TGFβ inducible early gene-1 (TIEG), is characterized by its three C2H2 zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to GC-rich DNA sequences, thereby influencing gene expression. KLF10 plays a pivotal role in the TGFβ-Smad signaling pathway, enhancing TGFβ action and regulating the expression of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. It is expressed in multiple tissues, including epithelial cells, muscle cells, and the heart, and is implicated in bone formation, immune regulation, and cardiovascular health. Alterations in KLF10 expression have been linked to various diseases, such as pancreatic cancer, endometriosis, and cardiovascular disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Subramaniam2010Functional; Delaney2016KLF10; Yaseen2024New).

## Structure
KLF10, a member of the Krüppel-like factor family, is characterized by its three C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding. These zinc fingers are highly conserved and consist of a specific sequence that facilitates interaction with DNA, particularly at GC Boxes and GT/CACCC boxes (Chen2010Porcine). The zinc finger domains are located within the amino acid sequence 361-459, with a significant binding pocket identified in the second zinc finger domain (amino acids 385-425) (Khedkar2015Discovery).

The primary structure of KLF10 includes a sequence of amino acids that form these zinc finger domains, while the secondary structure likely involves the formation of alpha helices and beta sheets typical of zinc finger proteins. The tertiary structure of KLF10 is defined by the overall 3D conformation of these domains, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor. The protein's structure was modeled using homology modeling techniques, focusing on the zinc finger regions to identify potential druggable pockets (Khedkar2015Discovery).

KLF10 also contains transcriptional activation or repression domains outside the zinc finger region, which are variable and allow the protein to function as either an activator or repressor depending on its interactions with other proteins (Chen2010Porcine).

## Function
KLF10, also known as TGFβ inducible early gene-1 (TIEG), is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the TGFβ-Smad signaling pathway. It enhances TGFβ action by increasing Smad2 expression and phosphorylation while repressing the inhibitory Smad7 gene, thus promoting TGFβ/Smad signal transduction (Subramaniam2010Functional). KLF10 is involved in regulating gene expression, inhibiting cell proliferation, and inducing apoptosis, particularly in epithelial cells through mitochondrial apoptosis pathways (Subramaniam2010Functional).

KLF10 is expressed in various tissues, including epithelial cells of the placenta, breast, and pancreas, as well as in skeletal and smooth muscle cells, heart cells, and glial cells (Subramaniam2010Functional). It binds to Sp-1-GC rich DNA sequences to regulate the transcription of various genes (Subramaniam2010Functional). The protein is localized in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional activity (Subramaniam2010Functional).

KLF10 also plays a role in bone formation, heart hypertrophy, and immune system regulation. It is involved in osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and bone turnover, and its deficiency can lead to osteopenic phenotypes (Subramaniam2010Functional). In the immune system, KLF10 regulates T cell activity and T regulatory cell function (Subramaniam2010Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KLF10 gene have been implicated in various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a loss of KLF10 is associated with enhanced migratory ability, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes, and distant metastasis. Low expression of KLF10 correlates with shorter distant metastasis-free survival in patients, suggesting its role in PDAC progression (Tsai2021Upregulating).

In endometriosis, KLF10 expression is selectively decreased in extra-uterine lesions, leading to increased inflammation and CD154 expression. This suggests that KLF10 modulates inflammatory responses, and its deficiency may contribute to disease progression (Delaney2016KLF10).

KLF10 also plays a role in colitis, where its deficiency in macrophages leads to worsened inflammation due to altered cytokine profiles and impaired TGF-β signaling, which are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis (Papadakis2015Krüppellike).

In cardiovascular diseases, KLF10 acts as a hypertrophy suppressor. Its deficiency in mice leads to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, indicating a protective role against cardiovascular damage (Yaseen2024New).

Furthermore, KLF10 is involved in regulating fetal hemoglobin levels and response to hydroxyurea treatment in β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, with specific SNPs in KLF10 affecting treatment outcomes (Borg2012KLF10).

## Interactions
KLF10, a transcription factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It contains a C-terminal DNA-binding domain with three C2H2 zinc finger motifs, allowing it to bind to GC-rich promoter elements (Spittau2011Klf10). KLF10 interacts with Smad proteins, particularly Smad2/3, as part of the TGF-β signaling pathway, influencing the expression of Smad7 and forming a feedback loop that regulates this pathway (Memon2018KLF10). 

KLF10 also interacts with Jumonji AT-rich domain 1B/lysine-specific demethylase 5B (JARID1B/KDM5B), which inhibits transcriptional initiation by demethylating histone H3, enhancing the tumor suppressive effects of TGF-β (Spittau2011Klf10; Yaseen2024New). The protein interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Seven in Absentia homologue-1 (SIAH1), which regulates KLF10 protein stability through ubiquitination, affecting TGF-β signaling (Spittau2011Klf10; Yaseen2024New). 

Additionally, KLF10 is involved in the recruitment of epigenetic co-repressors like Histone Deacetylases -1 and -2 (HDAC1 and -2) to target gene promoters, facilitating transcriptional repression (Mishra2017Krüppellike). These interactions highlight KLF10's role in modulating transcriptional activity and its involvement in complex regulatory networks.
