# ARVCF

## Overview
The ARVCF gene encodes the ARVCF delta catenin family member protein, which is a part of the p120-catenin family. This protein is characterized by its armadillo repeat-containing structure, which facilitates its role in cell adhesion and nuclear functions. ARVCF is involved in the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions, crucial for cell-cell adhesion and tissue integrity. It also plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing within the nucleus, interacting with various RNA-binding proteins to influence pre-mRNA processing. The protein's interactions with PDZ-domain proteins are essential for its localization to the plasma membrane and nucleus, linking it to cell-cell adhesion processes (Rappe2014Nuclear; Kausalya2004Association). ARVCF is expressed in a variety of tissues and is implicated in several clinical conditions, including velo-cardio-facial syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, schizophrenia, and non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its broad functional significance (Zhang2015ARVCF; Sirotkin1997Identification; Mas2010A).

## Structure
The ARVCF protein is a member of the catenin gene family, characterized by its armadillo repeat-containing structure. It consists of 962 amino acids and includes a coiled coil domain near the N-terminus and 10 tandem armadillo repeats, which are central to its structure and function (Sirotkin1997Identification). These armadillo repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions, similar to those found in other catenins like p120 CAS and β-catenin (Sirotkin1997Identification). The protein also contains a Robbins and Dingwald nuclear-targeting domain, suggesting a role in nuclear localization (Sirotkin1997Identification).

ARVCF is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at sites for protein kinase C, casein kinase 2, cAMP, and tyrosine kinase, which may regulate its activity or interactions (Sirotkin1997Identification). The protein is expressed in various fetal and adult tissues, indicating a broad functional role (Sirotkin1997Identification). ARVCF also has splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Paulson2000Xarvcf). The protein's interaction with the Erbin PDZ domain highlights its role in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Laura2002The).

## Function
The ARVCF protein, a member of the p120-catenin family, plays a significant role in both cell adhesion and nuclear functions. It is a component of adherens junctions, which are crucial for cell-cell adhesion and tissue stability, and is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing in the nucleus. ARVCF interacts with RNA-binding proteins such as SRSF1, p68, and hnRNP H2, forming ribonucleoprotein complexes that influence pre-mRNA splicing. These interactions are RNA-independent and mediated through the ARVCF C terminus, suggesting a role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (Rappe2014Nuclear).

In the context of cell adhesion, ARVCF is essential for maintaining the stability of adherens junctions by binding to the juxtamembrane domain of cadherins, thereby stabilizing cadherin complexes. This function is particularly important in lens fiber cells, where ARVCF ensures proper localization of adherens junction proteins like N-cadherin and β-catenin, preventing age-related cortical cataracts (Martin2022Arvcf). ARVCF's interactions with PDZ-domain proteins are crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane and nucleus, linking it to cell-cell adhesion processes (Kausalya2004Association).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ARVCF gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. ARVCF is located in the 22q11.2 region, which is frequently deleted in patients with velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) and DiGeorge syndrome (DGS). These syndromes are characterized by a range of phenotypic features, including heart defects, cleft palate, and facial dysmorphology. The hemizygosity of ARVCF in this region suggests that its reduced expression may contribute to some of these phenotypes (Sirotkin1997Identification).

ARVCF has also been associated with schizophrenia. Studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ARVCF gene that are linked to an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. These findings suggest that genetic variations in ARVCF may contribute to the neurodevelopmental aspects of the disorder (Mas2010A).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ARVCF expression is correlated with a malignant phenotype. High levels of ARVCF expression are associated with poor prognosis, advanced disease stages, and increased metastasis, indicating its role in cancer progression (Zhang2015ARVCF).

## Interactions
The ARVCF protein, a member of the p120-catenin family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play a significant role in cell adhesion and mRNA processing. In the nucleus, ARVCF interacts with RNA-binding proteins such as SRSF1, p68/DDX5, and hnRNP H2, forming ribonucleoprotein complexes that are resistant to RNase treatment, indicating protein-protein interactions rather than RNA-mediated ones (Rappe2014Nuclear). These interactions suggest ARVCF's involvement in pre-mRNA splicing and regulation of alternative splicing (Rappe2014Nuclear).

ARVCF also interacts with kazrin, forming complexes in the nucleoplasm, and is part of high molecular weight complexes that include RNA (Rappe2014Nuclear). In terms of cell adhesion, ARVCF binds to the PDZ domains of ZO-1 and ZO-2 proteins through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which is crucial for its localization at the plasma membrane and in the nucleus (Kausalya2004Association). ARVCF can also associate with E-cadherin through its armadillo repeats, contributing to its role in cell-cell adhesion (Kausalya2004Association).
