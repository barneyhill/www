# PHACTR2

## Overview
PHACTR2 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase and actin regulator 2, which plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal dynamics by interacting with actin and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The protein is characterized by the presence of RPEL repeat domains, which are essential for binding unpolymerized actin, thereby maintaining the balance between globular (G) and filamentous (F) actin. This interaction is vital for cellular processes such as proliferation and movement. Additionally, PHACTR2's interaction with PP1, a major serine/threonine protein phosphatase, implicates it in the regulation of muscle contractions and actin cytoskeleton organization. Variations in the PHACTR2 gene, such as the missense mutation c.1532G>A (p.Arg511His), have been associated with cardiac conditions like dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular non-compaction, highlighting its potential involvement in human genetic diseases related to cytoskeletal dysfunction (Majdalani2023A).

## Structure
The PHACTR2 protein is characterized by the presence of RPEL repeat domains, which are crucial for its interaction with actin. Specifically, the protein contains four RPEL domains, with the second domain being particularly significant due to a missense variation at position 511, where arginine (Arg) is replaced by histidine (His). This variation is located in a region that is evolutionarily conserved across the PHACTR family, indicating its functional importance (Majdalani2023A).

The RPEL domains in PHACTR2 mediate the binding of unpolymerized actin, which is essential for maintaining the balance between globular (G) and filamentous (F) actin. The Arg 511 residue in the RPEL2 domain forms hydrogen bonds and charged interactions that stabilize the domain's structure. The substitution with His is predicted to disrupt these interactions, potentially destabilizing the RPEL2 domain and affecting the actin complex (Majdalani2023A).

The C-terminal tail of PHACTR2 is highly conserved and mediates interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), suggesting a role in phosphatase regulation. Despite the structural changes predicted by the Arg511His variation, the subcellular localization of PHACTR2 remains primarily in the cytoplasm, not co-localizing with filamentous actin (Majdalani2023A).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PHACTR2 gene have been associated with significant cardiac conditions, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC). A specific missense variation, c.1532G>A, resulting in the amino acid change p.Arg511His, has been identified in a consanguineous child presenting with these conditions. This mutation is suggested to impair the binding of PHACTR2 to actin, disrupting actin dynamics crucial for heart function (Majdalani2023A). The mutation is located in the RPEL repeat domains, essential for actin interaction, and is predicted to destabilize the RPEL2 domain, although it does not affect the subcellular localization of PHACTR2 (Majdalani2023A).

The clinical significance of this mutation is highlighted by its potential to disrupt actin dynamics, leading to impaired cellular processes such as proliferation and movement, which are vital for cardiac function (Majdalani2023A). Despite its high damaging prediction scores, the variant is classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) according to ACMG guidelines, due to the lack of clinical evidence and its rarity in population databases (Majdalani2023A). Further research is needed to fully understand the role of PHACTR2 mutations in cardiac diseases.

## Interactions
PHACTR2 (phosphatase and actin regulator 2) is involved in interactions with actin and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), playing a significant role in cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein contains RPEL repeat domains that mediate binding with unpolymerized actin, which is crucial for maintaining the balance between globular (G) and filamentous (F) actin. A missense variation in PHACTR2, where arginine at position 511 is replaced by histidine, disrupts these interactions by destabilizing the RPEL2 domain, leading to impaired actin dynamics (Majdalani2023A).

The interaction with PP1 is also significant, as PP1 is a major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase involved in muscle contractions and actin cytoskeleton organization. The Arg511His variation in PHACTR2 may affect its interaction with PP1, contributing to specific cardiac phenotypes observed in patients (Majdalani2023A). Despite these disruptions, the subcellular localization of PHACTR2 remains primarily in the cytoplasm, and the variant does not affect its localization (Majdalani2023A). These interactions highlight the role of PHACTR2 in regulating actin dynamics and its potential involvement in human genetic diseases related to cytoskeletal dysfunction.
