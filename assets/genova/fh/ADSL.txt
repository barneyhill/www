# ADSL

## Overview
The ADSL gene encodes the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase, which plays a pivotal role in purine metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a lyase and is involved in the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and the purine nucleotide cycle. Adenylosuccinate lyase catalyzes the conversion of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) to aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and adenylosuccinate (S-AMP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and fumarate, processes essential for the synthesis of inosine monophosphate (IMP) and AMP (Ray2012Structural; Kmoch2000Human). The ADSL gene is located on chromosome 22q13.1-13.2 and consists of 13 exons, encoding a protein that forms a homotetrameric structure (Kmoch2000Human). Mutations in the ADSL gene can lead to adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency, a disorder characterized by neurological symptoms due to disrupted purine metabolism (Ray2012Structural).

## Structure
The human adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) protein is composed of 484 amino acids, forming a homotetrameric structure with a relative molecular mass of approximately 52 kDa per subunit (Kmoch2000Human). The primary structure of ADSL includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the ADSL gene, which is located on chromosome 22q13.1-13.2 and consists of 13 exons (Kmoch2000Human). The secondary structure of ADSL is characterized by 16 α-helices and 3 small β-sheets, organized into three domains: domain 1 (residues 5-112), domain 2 (residues 113-364), and domain 3 (residues 364-476) (Ray2012Structural).

The quaternary structure of ADSL is a tetramer, with active sites formed by contributions from three different subunits, which is essential for its enzymatic function (Ray2012Structural). The enzyme exhibits positive cooperativity, with substrate binding involving interactions with multiple monomers (Ray2012Structural). A flexible loop near the active site, the β3-α10 loop (residues 286-291), is noted for its high flexibility and lack of electron density (Ray2012Structural). Alternative splicing of ADSL mRNA results in two isoforms, with the full-length form being more abundant and active, while the spliced isoform is inactive (Kmoch2000Human).

## Function
Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) is a crucial enzyme in purine nucleotide metabolism, specifically involved in the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and the purine nucleotide cycle. In healthy human cells, ADSL catalyzes two key reactions: the conversion of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) to aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and the conversion of adenylosuccinate (S-AMP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and fumarate (Ray2012Structural; Kmoch2000Human). These reactions are essential for the synthesis of inosine monophosphate (IMP) and AMP, which are vital for DNA and RNA synthesis, energy metabolism, and cellular signaling (Ray2012Structural).

ADSL functions as a homotetramer, with each subunit contributing to the enzyme's active sites, and is primarily active in the cytoplasm (Zikanova2010Biochemical). The enzyme's activity is characterized by positive cooperativity, which is crucial for its function in purine metabolism (Ray2012Structural). Mutations in the ADSL gene can lead to ADSL deficiency, a disorder that affects purine metabolism and results in neurological and physiological symptoms (Ray2012Structural). The enzyme's role in maintaining proper purine levels is critical for various cellular processes, highlighting its importance in cell biology and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADSL gene lead to adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting purine metabolism. This condition is characterized by a range of neurological symptoms, including developmental delay, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders (PérezDueñas2012Novel; Mastrogiorgio2021Clinical). The disorder results from the accumulation of succinylpurines, specifically succinyladenosine (S-Ado) and succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr), in body fluids, which disrupts normal brain function (Jurecka2014Adenylosuccinate; Kmoch2000Human).

Clinical manifestations of ADSL deficiency vary widely, with some patients experiencing severe psychomotor retardation and intractable seizures, while others have milder symptoms such as hypotonia and growth retardation (Race2000Clinical; Mastrogiorgio2021Clinical). The severity of the condition often correlates with the residual enzymatic activity of the ADSL enzyme and the stability of its mutant forms (Race2000Clinical; Zikanova2010Biochemical).

Genetic testing, including whole-exome sequencing, is crucial for diagnosing ADSL deficiency, especially in cases with non-specific symptoms (Mastrogiorgio2021Clinical). Despite attempts at specific therapies, such as ketogenic diets and D-ribose administration, treatment outcomes have been inconsistent, highlighting the need for further research into effective interventions (Mao2017Novel).
