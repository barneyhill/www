# KLHL6

## Overview
KLHL6 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 6, which is a substrate-specific adapter in the Cullin-3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of protein degradation, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. KLHL6 is predominantly expressed in germinal center B cells and is integral to B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and germinal center formation, processes essential for B-cell maturation and immune response (Kroll2005The; Shi2019Kelchlike). The protein's structure includes a BTB domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch repeats, which facilitate its interactions and functions within the cell (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike). Mutations in KLHL6 have been linked to various B-cell lymphomas, highlighting its significance in oncogenic processes and its potential as a therapeutic target (Shi2019Kelchlike; Choi2019KLHL6).

## Structure
KLHL6 is a protein that belongs to the Kelch-like family, characterized by the presence of specific structural domains, including a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch repeats. The BTB domain is involved in protein binding and dimerization, playing a crucial role in forming the Cullin-3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is essential for targeting proteins for ubiquitination and degradation (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike). The Kelch repeats form a β-propeller structure, which is significant for substrate recruitment and interaction with other proteins (Shi2019Kelchlike).

Mutations in the BTB domain, such as L65P and L90F, can disrupt KLHL6's ability to heterodimerize with other BTB-Kelch family proteins, although they still allow homodimerization with endogenous KLHL6, suggesting that mutant KLHL6 can still form CRL complexes (Meriranta2024Disruption). The Kelch domain mutations, such as E568K, show stronger interactions with CRL components, indicating alterations in substrate binding (Meriranta2024Disruption).

KLHL6 undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination at multiple residues, which may influence its function and interactions (Meriranta2024Disruption). The protein's structure and modifications are crucial for its role in B-cell receptor signaling and its implications in B-cell lymphoma.

## Function
The KLHL6 gene encodes a protein that functions as a substrate-specific adapter in the Cullin-3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein levels within cells (Meriranta2024Disruption; Choi2019KLHL6). KLHL6 is primarily expressed in germinal center B cells and plays a significant role in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and germinal center formation, which are essential for B-cell maturation and immune response (Kroll2005The; Shi2019Kelchlike).

In healthy human cells, KLHL6 is involved in the regulation of BCR signaling by promoting the degradation of BCR components such as CD79A and CD79B, thereby maintaining surface BCR homeostasis and preventing excessive signaling that could lead to oncogenic outcomes (Meriranta2024Disruption). The protein is also implicated in the degradation of roquin2, an RNA-binding protein that influences the NF-κB pathway, thus playing a role in controlling immune responses and preventing the development of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Shi2019Kelchlike; Choi2019KLHL6). KLHL6's activity is localized to perinuclear vesicles near the Golgi apparatus, indicating its involvement in intracellular trafficking and protein processing (Meriranta2024Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KLHL6 gene are implicated in several B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and marginal zone lymphoma. In DLBCL, KLHL6 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, with mutations often occurring in the BTB domain, leading to a loss of E3 ligase activity. This loss provides a proliferative advantage to cancer cells and is associated with poorer survival rates, particularly in the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of DLBCL (Shi2019Kelchlike; Choi2019KLHL6). 

KLHL6 mutations disrupt the regulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling components, such as CD79A and CD79B, leading to increased BCR levels and signaling, which is crucial for the survival and proliferation of B-cell lymphomas. This disruption is particularly noted in the MCD/C5-like ABC DLBCLs, where loss of KLHL6 expression correlates with higher CD79B levels and poor outcomes (Meriranta2024Disruption). 

In addition to its role in lymphomas, KLHL6 mutations have been observed in other hematopoietic neoplasms, such as Hodgkin lymphoma and plasmablastic lymphomas, suggesting its broader significance in B-cell neoplasia (Kunder2017KLHL6).

## Interactions
KLHL6 is involved in various protein interactions, primarily as a substrate adapter in Cullin-3-Ring-Ligase (CRL) complexes. It facilitates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins, including components of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway such as CD79A and CD79B (Meriranta2024Disruption). KLHL6 interacts with Cullin-3 and the Cop9-signalosome complex, which are crucial for its role in protein degradation (Meriranta2024Disruption).

Mutations in KLHL6, particularly in the BTB domain, can disrupt its ability to form heterodimers with other BTB-Kelch family proteins like KLHL7 and KLHL26, although it can still form homodimer CRLs with endogenous KLHL6 (Meriranta2024Disruption). These mutations also affect interactions with proteins such as CD79A and BANK1, impacting BCR signaling (Meriranta2024Disruption).

KLHL6 also interacts with the mRNA decay factor Roquin2, targeting it for degradation. This interaction influences the NF-κB pathway, which is significant in tumor suppression (Choi2019KLHL6). Additionally, KLHL6 has been shown to interact with novel proteins like USP25 and UBR4, further expanding its interactome (Meriranta2024Disruption). These interactions highlight KLHL6's role in modulating BCR signaling and its potential implications in B-cell lymphoma.
