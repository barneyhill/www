# SNCG

## Overview
Synuclein gamma (SNCG) is a gene that encodes the protein synuclein gamma, a member of the synuclein family, which is characterized by its intrinsically disordered structure. This protein is predominantly expressed in the peripheral nervous system and various tissues, where it plays a role in modulating neuronal plasticity and neurotransmitter release. Synuclein gamma exhibits chaperone-like activity, which can suppress protein aggregation, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis (Shao2018Gamma; Hua2008Up‐regulation). While its physiological functions are not fully elucidated, SNCG is implicated in several cellular processes, including signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization. Notably, aberrant expression of SNCG is associated with the progression of various cancers, where it influences tumor growth, metastasis, and patient prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Guo2007Neuronal; Liu2018Extracellular).

## Structure
Synuclein gamma (SNCG) is a protein characterized by its natively unfolded structure, which is common among synucleins. The primary structure of SNCG consists of 127 amino acids, with a high degree of sequence identity to rodent synucleins (Jain2018Comparative). The secondary structure includes two slightly curved alpha-helices, N (V3-V37) and C (D45-S92), arranged in an antiparallel orientation, separated by a small linker region (M38-T44) with an unstructured coil-like topology (Manivel2010Insight). The C-terminal region of SNCG is more disordered than the N-terminal region, contributing to its flexible nature and chaperone-like activity (Jain2018Comparative; Manivel2010Insight).

SNCG lacks a defined tertiary structure, often described as intrinsically disordered, but it can undergo conformational changes under certain conditions, such as changes in pH or temperature (Jain2018Comparative). The protein has a central hydrophobic region and is highly negatively charged, which influences its interactions and structural dynamics (Jain2018Comparative). SNCG can form aggregates, indicating potential quaternary structures, although it has a lower propensity to form fibrils compared to α-synuclein (Jain2018Comparative). Post-translational modifications like phosphorylation may occur, affecting its function and interactions.

## Function
Gamma-synuclein (SNCG) is a member of the synuclein family, which is primarily expressed in the peripheral nervous system and various tissues, including peripheral neurons, ocular tissue, and adipose tissue (Shao2018Gamma). In healthy human cells, SNCG is involved in modulating neuronal plasticity and neurotransmitter release, playing a role in the nervous system (Shao2018Gamma). It has chaperone-like activity, which can suppress protein aggregation, potentially providing a protective role in normal cellular processes (Hua2008Up‐regulation).

SNCG is also involved in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization, influencing cell proliferation and survival. It has antagonistic effects on the aggregation of α-synuclein (SNCA), which is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a regulatory role in maintaining protein homeostasis (Shao2018Gamma). SNCG's expression in healthy cells is associated with its function in the peripheral nervous system, although detailed information on its specific molecular activities in these cells is limited (Shao2018Gamma). The protein's activity in healthy cells is not as extensively studied as its role in pathological conditions, such as cancer.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SNCG gene have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers. In breast cancer, SNCG is highly expressed in carcinomas but not in normal epithelium. Its expression correlates with advanced cancer stages, lymph node involvement, metastasis, and larger tumor size. Patients with SNCG-positive tumors have shorter disease-free and overall survival, making SNCG a strong independent prognostic marker (Guo2007Neuronal). In prostate cancer, SNCG acts as a coactivator of the androgen receptor, promoting cancer cell growth and proliferation. High SNCG expression is associated with metastasis and could serve as a marker for aggressive prostate cancer (Chen2012Neural).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, SNCG is abnormally activated due to epigenetic alterations, such as demethylation of its CpG island. This activation is linked to advanced cancer stages and metastasis (Zhao2006Abnormal). In colorectal cancer, SNCG enhances tumor cell motility and invasion through the β1 integrin-focal adhesion kinase signaling pathway, correlating with poor prognosis (Liu2018Extracellular). SNCG is also overexpressed in colon adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with tumor recurrence and poor clinical outcomes (Liu2010Synuclein). These findings suggest that SNCG could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions across various cancers.

## Interactions
Synuclein gamma (SNCG) is known to participate in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. SNCG interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in mammary epithelial cells. In the absence of estrogen, SNCG forms a heterocomplex with ERα and Hsp90, binding to the unliganded ERα in a manner similar to Hsp90. However, upon estrogen treatment, SNCG dissociates from ERα (Liu2006Chaperoning).

SNCG also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells, acting as a co-activator that enhances AR transcriptional activity. This interaction is strengthened by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment, although silencing SNCG does not significantly affect AR expression (Chen2012Neural).

In breast cancer, SNCG acts as a molecular chaperone for the estrogen receptor variant ER-α36, preventing its degradation and maintaining estrogen signaling. SNCG can replace Hsp90's function in chaperoning ER-α36, which is crucial for membrane-initiated estrogen signaling and contributes to tamoxifen resistance (Shi2010Synuclein).

SNCG also interacts with β1 integrin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in colorectal cancer cells, enhancing cell motility and invasion. This interaction activates the β1 integrin-FAK signaling pathway, which is essential for SNCG-promoted tumor cell migration (Liu2018Extracellular).
