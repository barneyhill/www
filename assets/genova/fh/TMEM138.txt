# TMEM138

## Overview
TMEM138 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 138, which is a crucial component of the photoreceptor connecting cilium (CC). This protein plays a significant role in the transport of rhodopsin, a light-sensitive receptor protein, across the cilium and is essential for the biogenesis of the outer segment (OS) in photoreceptors. As a transmembrane protein, TMEM138 is integral to maintaining photoreceptor health and function, with its disruption leading to early-onset photoreceptor degeneration and associated retinal dystrophies (Guo2021Tmem138). Mutations in the TMEM138 gene are linked to Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy characterized by neurological and physical symptoms, underscoring the gene's importance in normal cellular function and its involvement in various ciliopathy-related phenotypes (BenSalem2014Mutation; Szymanska2015Unraveling).

## Function
TMEM138 is a transmembrane protein localized to the photoreceptor connecting cilium (CC) and plays a critical role in the transport of rhodopsin across the cilium and the biogenesis of the outer segment (OS) in photoreceptors. It is essential for maintaining photoreceptor health, as its disruption leads to early-onset photoreceptor degeneration, characterized by significant thinning of the outer retina and loss of photoreceptor cells, particularly rods (Guo2021Tmem138). TMEM138 interacts with rhodopsin, Ahi1, and Tmem231, facilitating rhodopsin transport and indicating its role in protein trafficking across the CC rather than in ciliogenesis (Guo2021Tmem138).

TMEM138 is localized to the proximal region of the connecting cilium, supporting its function as a CC membrane protein (Guo2021Tmem138). It is involved in the proper localization of rhodopsin during photoreceptor development, and its absence results in misrouting of rhodopsin, leading to degeneration of the OS (Guo2021Tmem138). TMEM138 is also implicated in Joubert syndrome spectrum disorder (JBTS), affecting multiple organs, including the brain, testis, kidney, and retina, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function (Guo2021Tmem138).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM138 gene are associated with Joubert syndrome (JS), specifically the JBTS16 phenotype, which is characterized by neurological symptoms such as the molar tooth sign (MTS), oculomotor apraxia, and variable coloboma, with occasional kidney involvement (BenSalem2014Mutation; Szymanska2015Unraveling). TMEM138 mutations lead to defects in ciliary function, contributing to the syndrome's characteristic neurological and physical symptoms (BenSalem2014Mutation). 

In the context of retinal health, TMEM138 is crucial for rhodopsin transport and outer segment biogenesis in photoreceptors. Mutations in TMEM138 result in rapid photoreceptor degeneration and retinal dystrophies, which are associated with ciliopathies (Guo2021Tmem138). These mutations lead to the failure of outer segment morphogenesis and mislocalization of phototransduction proteins, causing severe retinal degeneration (Guo2021Tmem138).

TMEM138 mutations are also linked to other ciliopathy-like phenotypes, including the failure of photoreceptors to develop outer segments and early-onset degeneration, highlighting its critical role in maintaining photoreceptor structure and function (Guo2021Tmem138). The gene's disruption can lead to conditions related to photoreceptor degeneration, such as retinitis pigmentosa (Guo2021Tmem138).

## Interactions
TMEM138 is a photoreceptor connecting cilium (CC) protein that plays a crucial role in rhodopsin transport and outer segment (OS) biogenesis. It interacts with several proteins, including rhodopsin, Ahi1, and Tmem231, which are involved in the transport machinery across the cilium. These interactions are transient and dynamic, facilitating the rapid transport of rhodopsin through the CC to the OS. The interaction with Tmem231 is particularly significant, as the localization of Tmem231 is altered in Tmem138 mutant photoreceptors, suggesting that TMEM138 may recruit Joubert syndrome (JBTS) proteins involved in rhodopsin transport (Guo2021Tmem138).

TMEM138 does not interact with other proteins such as Arl13b, Tmem67/Meckelin, or Rab8a, indicating a specific interaction network within the ciliary transport system (Guo2021Tmem138). The study of these interactions utilized protein pulldown assays and co-immunoprecipitation techniques to demonstrate the physical associations between TMEM138 and its interacting partners (Guo2021Tmem138). These findings underscore the importance of TMEM138 in maintaining photoreceptor homeostasis and function, particularly in the context of ciliopathies and retinal degenerations (Guo2021Tmem138).
