# SPINT1

## Overview
SPINT1 is a gene that encodes the serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type 1, also known as HAI-1, which is a type I transmembrane protein. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating serine protease activity, particularly in epithelial tissues, where it maintains epithelial integrity and prevents inflammation by inhibiting proteases such as matriptase (Cheng2009Hepatocyte; Kataoka2018Hepatocyte). HAI-1 is crucial for the proper functioning of epithelial barriers and acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating processes like epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA) and matriptase, are essential for regulating the activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Xiang2021MET; Kataoka2018Hepatocyte). Alterations in SPINT1 expression have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and placental insufficiency, highlighting its clinical significance (GómezAbenza2019SPINT1; Kaitu’uLino2020Circulating).

## Structure


## Function
The SPINT1 gene encodes the protein HAI-1, a serine protease inhibitor that plays a critical role in maintaining epithelial integrity. HAI-1 is primarily involved in regulating the activity of serine proteases such as matriptase, which is essential for proper epithelial barrier function. This regulation prevents unregulated proteolytic activation of proHGF/SF and other bioactive molecules, thereby maintaining epithelial cohesion and preventing inflammation (Cheng2009Hepatocyte; Kataoka2018Hepatocyte).

HAI-1 is expressed in most epithelial cells throughout the body, except in normal hepatocytes, and is localized on the basolateral surface of polarized columnar epithelial cells. It ensures the proper localization and function of matriptase on the cell surface, which is crucial for epithelial integrity (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte). In the intestinal epithelium, HAI-1 is highly expressed and its absence increases susceptibility to colitis and tumor formation, highlighting its role in preventing inflammation and tumorigenesis (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte).

HAI-1 also acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting dysregulated activities of proHGF/SF-activating serine proteases, which are implicated in neoplastic transformation and malignant progression (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte). Its function as a suppressor of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is supported by evidence showing that its expression can revert mesenchymal to epithelial transition, restoring E-cadherin expression (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SPINT1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In pregnancies, decreased circulating levels of SPINT1 are associated with placental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction, particularly in cases where infants are born small for gestational age (SGA). This reduction in SPINT1 levels has been validated across multiple cohorts, indicating its potential as a biomarker for predicting low birthweight and placental insufficiency (Kaitu’uLino2020Circulating).

In the context of cancer, SPINT1 expression is significantly altered in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and breast carcinoma. In SKCM, genetic alterations in SPINT1, such as increased mRNA levels and mutations, occur in about 10% of patients and are linked to poor prognosis. These alterations affect pathways related to immune system regulation and cell cycle, contributing to the aggressiveness of the melanoma (GómezAbenza2019SPINT1). In breast cancer, higher SPINT1 expression is associated with poorer prognosis, particularly in HER2-positive and node-positive patients, and is linked to decreased overall survival and increased metastasis (Wu2021Comprehensive).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), both SPINT1 mRNA and its associated long non-coding RNA, SPINT1-AS1, are significantly downregulated. This downregulation correlates with poorer overall survival, suggesting that low levels of these transcripts may serve as unfavorable prognostic indicators (Decreased; p&gt; Shen2019&lt).

## Interactions
SPINT1, also known as serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type 1, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, primarily acting as an inhibitor of serine proteases. It interacts with hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA) and matriptase, playing a significant role in regulating the activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). SPINT1 inhibits the conversion of inactive pro-HGF to its active form, thereby modulating the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway, which is crucial for processes such as cell growth, migration, and tissue remodeling (Xiang2021MET; Kataoka2018Hepatocyte).

SPINT1 is a type I transmembrane protein that can trap and inhibit activated HGFA on the cell surface. This interaction is mediated by its Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitor domains, which allow SPINT1 to act as both an inhibitor and a reservoir of active HGFA, ensuring sustained activation of proHGF/SF in the pericellular microenvironment (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte). The shedding of SPINT1 from the cell surface by metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding allows free active HGFA to reappear and activate pericellular HGF/SF (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte).

SPINT1 also interacts with matriptase, a type II transmembrane serine protease, regulating its localization and activity on the cell surface. This regulation is essential for maintaining epithelial integrity and preventing excessive protease activity, which can lead to epithelial barrier dysfunction and contribute to carcinogenesis (Kataoka2018Hepatocyte).
