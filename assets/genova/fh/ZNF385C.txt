# ZNF385C

## Overview
ZNF385C is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 385C, which is a transcriptional regulator involved in the modulation of the p53 signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein due to its structural motif that facilitates binding to DNA. ZNF385C plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis by influencing p53-mediated transactivation of downstream targets, such as p21 cip1/waf1, which is crucial for cell cycle arrest (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C). The protein is particularly significant in the development of craniofacial structures, where it regulates the timing of cartilage maturation and ossification, ensuring proper skeletal development (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C). In zebrafish models, ZNF385C is expressed in maturing chondrocytes and is essential for the correct timing of ossification in the jaw, with its absence leading to craniofacial defects (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C). The interaction of ZNF385C with p53, including its shuttling to nucleoli during cell cycle arrest, underscores its role in tumor suppression and skeletal development (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C).

## Function
ZNF385C is a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily active in the nucleus. It plays a crucial role in modulating the p53 signaling pathway, which is essential for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. ZNF385C functions as a molecular switch that influences p53-mediated transactivation of downstream targets, such as p21 cip1/waf1, which is involved in cell cycle arrest (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C). This regulation is particularly important during the development of facial bones, where ZNF385C controls the timing of cartilage maturation and ossification, ensuring proper craniofacial development (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C).

In zebrafish models, ZNF385C is expressed in the nuclei of maturing chondrocytes and is necessary for the proper timing of ossification in the jaw. Its absence leads to premature ossification and craniofacial defects, highlighting its role in skeletal development (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C). ZNF385C's interaction with p53 involves mechanisms such as shuttling to nucleoli during cell cycle arrest, which is important for p53's tumor suppression function (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C). These findings suggest that ZNF385C is integral to the temporal control of cartilage to bone transition in the craniofacial skeleton, beyond p53's known functions in response to stress (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF385C is a zinc finger protein that plays a role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the context of the p53 pathway. It has been shown to interact with the p53 protein, modulating its activity during cartilage development. Specifically, ZNF385C splice variants differentially interact with p53, with the short splice variant V2 interacting with p53 in the cytoplasm and nucleoli, while the V1 variant does not show this interaction. This interaction is significant as it involves the regulation of p53 activity through its shuttling to different cellular compartments (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C).

ZNF385C also binds to the promoter region of the p21 cip1/waf1 gene, a key player in cell cycle arrest, indicating a direct role in transcriptional regulation. This binding is distinct from p53's interaction with the mdm2 promoter, suggesting that ZNF385C may interfere with p53's ability to activate p21 cip1/waf1 (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C). The protein's interaction with p53 and its binding to specific DNA regions highlight its role as a molecular switch in the p53 pathway, influencing the timing of facial bone formation and cartilage maturation (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C).
