# ALDH6A1

## Overview
The ALDH6A1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family member A1, also known as methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH), which is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily. This enzyme plays a critical role in the catabolic pathways of valine and thymine, facilitating the conversion of specific intermediates into propionyl-CoA, a key metabolite in energy production and detoxification processes. ALDH6A1 is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Mutations in the ALDH6A1 gene can lead to MMSDH deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by metabolic abnormalities and a range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delays and dysmyelination (Vasiliou2005Analysis; Marcadier2013Mutations).

## Structure
The ALDH6A1 protein is a member of the human aldehyde dehydrogenase (hALDH) superfamily, which consists of 19 enzyme isoforms. These enzymes share a common structural organization, with each monomer comprising three distinct domains: a NAD(P)-binding domain, a catalytic domain, and an oligomerization domain. Both the NAD(P)-binding and catalytic domains are characterized by Rossmann folds, which are crucial for their function (Xanthis2023Human; Shortall2021Insights).

The catalytic mechanism of ALDH6A1 involves a modified catalytic triad, where a glutamic acid is substituted by asparagine, while the other two catalytic residues, cysteine and asparagine, are conserved. This modification results in a unique catalytic process where the reduced cofactor is released before the deacylation step, producing a CoA ester product instead of a free carboxylic acid (Xanthis2023Human).

Although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ALDH6A1 are not provided, the general structure of ALDH enzymes is described as forming homotetramers or homodimers, with subunits of approximately 450-500 amino acids (Shortall2021Insights). There is no information available on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for ALDH6A1.

## Function
The ALDH6A1 gene encodes the enzyme methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH), which is crucial in the catabolic breakdown of valine and thymine. In healthy human cells, MMSDH is involved in the metabolism of valine, producing the intermediate (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyric acid (HIBA), which is then oxidized to (S)-methylmalonic semialdehyde (MMSA) by 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase. Thymine metabolism generates (R)-aminoisobutyric acid (AIBA), which is deaminated to (R)-methylmalonic semialdehyde. These two enantiomers of MMSA are substrates for MMSDH, which catalyzes their oxidative decarboxylation to propionyl-CoA, a process essential for the proper breakdown and utilization of these amino acids (Marcadier2013Mutations).

MMSDH is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic balance. The enzyme's activity is vital for energy production and detoxification processes, contributing to the organism's overall metabolic health (Vasiliou2005Analysis). Disruptions in this pathway can lead to metabolic abnormalities, highlighting the enzyme's importance in normal metabolic function (Marcadier2013Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALDH6A1 gene, which encodes the enzyme methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH), are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as MMSDH deficiency. This condition is characterized by dysmyelination and transient methylmalonic aciduria, leading to a variety of metabolite abnormalities, including the accumulation of 3-hydroxyisobutyric, 3-hydroxypropionic, 3-aminoisobutyric, and methylmalonic acids, as well as β-alanine (Marcadier2013Mutations). Clinically, it presents with a highly variable phenotype, including developmental delays, dysmorphic features, and abnormal myelination on brain MRI (Marcadier2013Mutations).

Specific mutations identified in the ALDH6A1 gene include missense mutations such as c.785C > A (p. Ser262Tyr) and c.184C > T (p. Pro62Ser), which have been linked to 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria, a condition with elevated urinary levels of 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid and associated developmental delays (Sass20113‐Hydroxyisobutyrate). These mutations affect highly conserved amino acids and are predicted to be damaging, contributing to the pathobiology of the disorder (Sass20113‐Hydroxyisobutyrate).

The clinical presentation of MMSDH deficiency is heterogeneous, with symptoms ranging from mild hypotonia and gastroesophageal reflux to severe developmental delays and dysmorphic features (Dobrowolski2020Clinical; Marcadier2013Mutations). The condition may also involve mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced ATP production and increased oxidative stress in patient-derived fibroblasts (Dobrowolski2020Clinical).
