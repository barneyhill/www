# C12orf75

## Overview
C12orf75 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 12 open reading frame 75. This protein is categorized as a non-kinase, non-receptor protein and is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The gene is also referred to as Overexpressed in Colorectal Carcinoma-1 (OCC-1) due to its notable expression in certain cancer types. Alterations in the expression levels of C12orf75 have been associated with diverse prognostic outcomes across different cancers, such as bladder urothelial carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis, while in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, higher expression is linked to better outcomes (Cai2021Pancancer). The protein's role in immune cell infiltration and tumor progression further underscores its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and therapy (Cai2021Pancancer).

## Clinical Significance
The C12orf75 gene, also known as Overexpressed in Colorectal Carcinoma-1 (OCC-1), has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. Overexpression of C12orf75 is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and uveal melanoma (UVM) (Cai2021Pancancer). In contrast, higher expression of C12orf75 is linked to better prognosis in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) (Cai2021Pancancer). The gene's expression is also correlated with advanced tumor stages and grades in BLCA and LIHC, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Cai2021Pancancer).

C12orf75 expression is positively correlated with immune cell infiltration in certain cancers, such as BLCA and LIHC, where it is associated with the presence of CD8+ T cells and macrophages, potentially influencing tumor progression and patient outcomes (Cai2021Pancancer). Genetic alterations, particularly amplifications of C12orf75, have been observed in several cancers, including prostate, ovarian, and breast cancers, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Cai2021Pancancer). Despite its low expression in glioblastoma, C12orf75 has been studied for its potential role in this cancer type, although its clinical significance remains unclear (Evangelou2019Assessment).
