# ANGPTL4

## Overview
ANGPTL4, or angiopoietin-like 4, is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in various physiological processes, primarily lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. The protein, categorized as a multifunctional regulatory protein, plays a critical role in modulating plasma triglyceride levels by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, thereby influencing lipid and glucose metabolism (Aryal2019ANGPTL4; Köster2005Transgenic). ANGPTL4 is expressed in multiple tissues, including adipose tissue and the liver, and its expression is regulated by nutritional and hormonal factors. Beyond its metabolic functions, ANGPTL4 is implicated in angiogenesis, wound healing, and inflammation, interacting with integrins and extracellular matrix proteins to influence vascular permeability and tumor metastasis (Goh2010Angiopoietinlike; Grootaert2012Angiopoietinlike). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in conditions such as coronary artery disease, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Dewey2016Inactivating; Zuo2023Dual).

## Structure
ANGPTL4 is a secreted protein involved in lipid metabolism, consisting of 410 amino acids. It features an N-terminal signal sequence, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like motif. The coiled-coil domain is crucial for oligomerization, which occurs through intermolecular disulfide bonds involving cysteine residues at positions 76 and 80. This oligomerization is essential for the protein's stability and its ability to increase plasma triglyceride levels (Ge2004Oligomerization).

The C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain undergoes glycosylation, although this modification is not necessary for the protein's triglyceride-increasing effect (Ge2004Oligomerization). ANGPTL4 is subject to regulated proteolytic processing, resulting in a truncated C-terminal domain, which may alter its functional properties (Ge2004Oligomerization).

ANGPTL4 does not bind to the Tie2 receptor, distinguishing it from other angiopoietin family members (Ge2004Oligomerization; HERMANN2005Angiopoietinlike4). The protein's expression is influenced by nutritional and hormonal factors, such as fasting and PPAR agonists, and it plays roles in adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and energy metabolism (Ge2004Oligomerization).

## Function
ANGPTL4, or angiopoietin-like protein 4, is a multifunctional protein primarily involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. It is secreted by various tissues, including adipose tissue and the liver, and plays a crucial role in regulating plasma triglyceride levels by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. This inhibition reduces the hydrolysis of triglycerides, leading to increased circulating triglyceride levels and decreased fatty acid uptake into tissues (Aryal2019ANGPTL4; Köster2005Transgenic).

ANGPTL4 exists in different molecular forms due to processes such as cleavage, glycosylation, and oligomerization. The N-terminal coiled-coil domain of ANGPTL4 is essential for its function, as it binds to LPL and converts it from active dimers to inactive monomers, effectively reducing LPL activity (Yin2009Genetic; Sukonina2006Angiopoietinlike). This interaction is crucial for modulating lipid metabolism, particularly during fasting, when ANGPTL4 expression is upregulated to redirect fatty acids from adipose tissue to other tissues (Sukonina2006Angiopoietinlike).

In addition to its role in lipid metabolism, ANGPTL4 is involved in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis, wound healing, and inflammation. It influences cell-extracellular matrix communication and affects processes like tumor metastasis by binding to integrins and disrupting endothelial barrier integrity (Grootaert2012Angiopoietinlike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANGPTL4 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In coronary artery disease (CAD), inactivating mutations such as the E40K variant are associated with reduced triglyceride levels and increased HDL cholesterol, offering a protective effect against CAD (Dewey2016Inactivating). These mutations decrease the gene's ability to inhibit lipoprotein lipase, leading to favorable lipid profiles (Dewey2016Inactivating). However, some studies report conflicting results, with the E40K mutation sometimes linked to increased CAD risk, possibly due to variations in study populations (Guo2013Role; Aryal2019ANGPTL4).

In metabolic diseases, ANGPTL4 plays a role in glucose metabolism. Its deficiency improves glucose metabolism by enhancing lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, while the E40K variant is associated with lower fasting glucose levels and improved insulin sensitivity (Aryal2019ANGPTL4). In inflammatory diseases, ANGPTL4 expression is upregulated in conditions like acute pancreatitis, where it exacerbates inflammation and injury (Zuo2023Dual). Conversely, in heart disease, ANGPTL4 secreted by mesenchymal stem cells has anti-inflammatory effects, providing cardioprotection during myocardial infarction (Zuo2023Dual). These diverse roles highlight ANGPTL4's potential as a therapeutic target in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ANGPTL4 (angiopoietin-like 4) is involved in various protein interactions that influence processes such as wound healing, vascular permeability, and cancer progression. ANGPTL4 interacts with extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin and vitronectin, which are crucial for wound healing. These interactions help protect the matrix proteins from degradation by matrix metalloproteinases, facilitating keratinocyte migration over wound beds (Goh2010Angiopoietinlike).

In the context of vascular permeability, ANGPTL4 interacts with integrins such as αvβ3 and α5β1. The interaction with integrin αvβ3 helps counteract hypoxia-induced vascular permeability by modulating Src signaling downstream of VEGF receptor 2 (Gomez2016ANGPTL4αvβ3). ANGPTL4 also binds to integrin α5β1, VE-cadherin, and claudin-5, disrupting endothelial junctions and increasing vascular permeability, which is significant in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Huang2011ANGPTL4).

In ovarian cancer, ANGPTL4 interacts with endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM1), promoting angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation through the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway (Li2024ANGPTL4). These interactions highlight ANGPTL4's role in modulating cell-matrix communication and vascular integrity.
