# POLK

## Overview
The POLK gene encodes DNA polymerase kappa (Pol κ), a specialized enzyme belonging to the Y-family of DNA polymerases. Pol κ is primarily involved in translesion synthesis (TLS), a critical process that allows DNA replication to proceed past lesions that would otherwise stall the replication machinery. This enzyme is characterized by its unique structural features, including an N-terminal extension known as the N-clasp, which enhances its DNA binding and stability. Pol κ plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by bypassing DNA damage and preventing the degradation of stalled replication forks. It interacts with various proteins, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Rev1, to facilitate its function in DNA repair and replication checkpoint responses. Clinically, mutations and altered expression of the POLK gene have been associated with increased cancer susceptibility and progression, highlighting its significance in genomic maintenance and disease (Pillaire2014Role; Dai2016Association; Lone2007Human).

## Structure
DNA polymerase kappa (Pol κ), encoded by the POLK gene, is a member of the Y-family of DNA polymerases. Its molecular structure is characterized by a unique N-terminal extension known as the N-clasp, which is crucial for DNA binding and encirclement. This N-clasp consists of a U-shaped tether and two helices (aN1 and aN2) that interact with various domains of the polymerase and the DNA, enhancing the enzyme's binding affinity and stability (Hoitsma2019Structure; Lone2007Human).

The primary structure of Pol κ includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains such as the catalytic core, which comprises the palm, fingers, and thumb domains, as well as the polymerase-associated domain (PAD) or little finger domain. The palm domain contains active site residues D107, D198, and E199, which are essential for the nucleotidyl transfer reaction (Jha2017Structural; Lone2007Human).

The tertiary structure of Pol κ forms a right-handed grip typical of polymerases, with the N-clasp providing additional stability by encircling the DNA. This structural arrangement allows Pol κ to bypass DNA lesions and extend mismatches effectively (Lone2007Human; Jha2016Structure). Pol κ lacks proofreading activity but maintains moderate processivity and fidelity, with error frequencies ranging from 10^-2 to 10^-4 (Hoitsma2019Structure).

## Function
DNA polymerase kappa (Pol κ) is a member of the Y-family of DNA polymerases, specialized for translesion synthesis (TLS), which allows DNA replication to continue past lesions that block the main replicative DNA polymerases. In healthy human cells, Pol κ plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by bypassing DNA damage and abnormal DNA structures during replication (Pillaire2014Role). It is particularly adept at extending mispaired primer termini on undamaged DNA and plays a significant role in the extension step of lesion bypass, often requiring the sequential action of two polymerases: an 'inserter' and an 'extender,' with Pol κ acting as the extender (Lone2007Human).

Pol κ is involved in protecting stalled replication forks from degradation by nucleases, such as MRE11, and is crucial for preventing nascent DNA degradation, a process that involves fork reversal and protection against nucleolytic degradation (Tonzi2018Translesion). It also collaborates with Pol ζ for error-free lesion bypass and is implicated in the repair of interstrand cross-links and the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which may protect against UV irradiation (Pillaire2014Role). Pol κ's ability to replicate past bulky DNA adducts and its involvement in replication checkpoint efficiency and microsatellite stability are essential for preventing genomic instability and cancer development (Pillaire2014Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the POLK gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the POLK gene, such as rs10077427 and rs5744533, are associated with breast cancer susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. The rs5744533 polymorphism is linked to a decreased risk in postmenopausal women, while rs10077427 is more frequent in premenopausal women (Dai2016Association). In prostate cancer, somatic mutations in the POLK gene, including p.E29K and p.G154E, have been identified in 28% of tumors, affecting the enzyme's catalytic efficiency and fidelity, which may contribute to carcinogenesis (Yadav2015Somatic).

POLK overexpression is associated with advanced stages and poorer prognosis in glioma patients and is also linked to mutant TP53 status in non-small cell lung carcinomas, where it increases mutation frequency (Dai2016Association; Sweasy2006DNA). Inflammation-induced carcinogenesis in the colon is exacerbated in the absence of POLK, as seen in Polk -/- mice, suggesting its role in suppressing inflammation-induced mutagenesis (Hakura2023DNA). These findings highlight the clinical significance of POLK in cancer susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
DNA polymerase kappa (Pol κ) interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA repair and translesion synthesis. Pol κ contains two PCNA-interacting peptides (PIP1 and PIP2) that facilitate its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), although these interactions are weaker compared to other polymerases (Pillaire2014Role). The ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domains of Pol κ enhance its affinity for monoubiquitylated PCNA, a process regulated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase RAD18 and disrupted by RAD18 depletion or K164-PCNA mutation (Pillaire2014Role; Bi2006Rad18).

Pol κ also interacts with the C-terminal domain of Rev1 through a Rev1-interacting region (RIR), which is shared with other Y-family polymerases like Pol η and Pol ι, potentially facilitating polymerase exchange during translesion synthesis (Pillaire2014Role). Additionally, Pol κ is involved in the replication checkpoint response, interacting with the Rad9 subunit of the 9-1-1 complex, which is crucial for ATR-mediated Chk1 activation (Bétous2013DNA). These interactions highlight Pol κ's role in maintaining genomic stability and its involvement in complex networks of protein interactions during DNA damage response and repair.
