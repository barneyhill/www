# EXTL3

## Overview
EXTL3 is a gene that encodes the protein exostosin-like glycosyltransferase 3, a type II transmembrane protein involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a critical component of the extracellular matrix. The EXTL3 protein is characterized by its glycosyltransferase activity, specifically within the GT47 and GT64 domains, which are essential for its role in HS chain elongation (Yamada2020Specific; Wilson2022The). As a member of the EXT family, EXTL3 forms homodimers and interacts with other proteins such as EXT1 and EXT2, facilitating the synthesis and modification of HS (Wilson2022The). The gene is highly conserved across eumetazoans, underscoring its fundamental role in various biological processes, including cell signaling and development (Yamada2020Specific). Mutations in EXTL3 are linked to severe clinical conditions, including immunoskeletal dysplasia with neurodevelopmental abnormalities (ISDNA), highlighting its significance in human health (Mizumoto2021Congenital; Bajaj2022An).

## Structure
The EXTL3 protein is a type II transmembrane protein composed of 919 amino acids, making it the longest member of the EXT family. It features a short cytoplasmic region, a transmembrane region, and a long Golgi luminal region (Yamada2020Specific). The protein contains two glycosyltransferase domains: GT47 and GT64. The GT64 domain is responsible for both GlcNAc transferase I and II activities, while the GT47 domain may not exhibit enzyme activity (Yamada2020Specific; Wilson2022The). The GT47 domain adopts a GT-B fold with two Rossman-fold subdomains, featuring five β-strands and eight α-helices (Wilson2022The). 

The EXTL3 protein forms a symmetrical homodimer, which is important for its function in heparan sulfate synthesis (Wilson2022The). The GT64 domain is involved in homodimeric interactions, stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bridges (Wilson2022The). The structure of EXTL3 includes a stem domain that connects the globular part to the N-terminal transmembrane helix, which has been extended and rigidified (Wilson2022The). 

Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation at Asn290 and Asn592, which are crucial for proper folding and secretion (Yamada2020Specific). The EXTL3 protein is conserved across eumetazoans, indicating its essential role in biological processes (Yamada2020Specific).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXTL3 gene are associated with a range of severe health conditions, primarily affecting the skeletal, immune, and nervous systems. These mutations lead to a condition known as immunoskeletal dysplasia with neurodevelopmental abnormalities (ISDNA), characterized by severe skeletal deformities such as platyspondyly, kyphoscoliosis, pelvic distortion, and brachydactyly, as well as neurological issues including seizures, intellectual disability, and muscular hypotonia (Mizumoto2021Congenital; Bajaj2022An). Patients with EXTL3 mutations often exhibit a decrease in T-lymphocyte subsets and immunoglobulins, contributing to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-related disorders (Volpi2017EXTL3).

The EXTL3 gene mutations also result in abnormalities in heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis, affecting intracellular signaling pathways such as the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway. This disruption contributes to the clinical manifestations observed in these disorders (Volpi2017EXTL3). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg513Cys, lead to mislocalization of the EXTL3 protein, potentially causing a loss of function (Wilson2022The). The clinical significance of these mutations is underscored by their impact on multiple systems, leading to life-threatening conditions and high mortality due to increased infection susceptibility (Bajaj2022An).

## Interactions
EXTL3 is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis. It forms a homodimer stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bridges, which is crucial for its function (Wilson2022The). EXTL3 interacts with EXT1 and possibly EXT2, which are essential for its enzymatic activities, particularly in the synthesis of HS (Wilson2022The). These interactions suggest that EXTL3 might stimulate the activity of EXT1 and/or EXT2 through protein interactions, although the exact nature of these interactions is not fully detailed (Wilson2022The).

EXTL3 also interacts with NDST-1, a protein involved in HS modification. This interaction reduces the N-sulfotransferase activity of NDST-1, contributing to the generation of N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues in HS (Yamada2020Specific). Despite its role in HS biosynthesis, EXTL3's interactions with nucleic acids are not explicitly detailed in the available literature (Wilson2022The).

In the context of endometriosis, EXTL3 interacts with specific serum factors, leading to increased colony formation in endometrial stromal cells. This interaction is significant in understanding the molecular mechanisms of endometriosis (Aints2019EXTL3interacting).
