# VWA1

## Overview
The VWA1 gene encodes the von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 1 (WARP), a crucial component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) involved in maintaining the structural integrity of various tissues. This protein is characterized by the presence of a von Willebrand factor A (VWFA) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for cell adhesion and signaling. WARP is predominantly expressed in tissues such as cartilage, peripheral nerves, and muscle, where it interacts with ECM components like perlecan and collagen VI. These interactions are vital for the stability and function of the ECM, particularly in the peripheral nervous system and muscle tissues. Mutations in the VWA1 gene have been linked to several neuromuscular and craniofacial disorders, highlighting its significance in developmental and maintenance processes (Pagnamenta2021An; Wang2020A; Deschauer2021Biallelic).

## Structure
The VWA1 gene encodes a protein known as von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 1 (WARP), which consists of 445 amino acids and includes a von Willebrand factor A (VWFA) domain followed by two fibronectin type III repeats (Pagnamenta2021An; Deschauer2021Biallelic). The VWFA domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is characterized by a conserved metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif, which is crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling (Pagnamenta2021An). 

The secondary and tertiary structures of the VWA1 protein are significantly altered by specific mutations, such as the c.G905A:p.R302Q mutation, which disrupts a helix and introduces several sheets, affecting the protein's conformation and function (Wang2020A). The protein's structure is important for its role in the extracellular matrix, where it interacts with other components like perlecan and type VI collagen, contributing to the structural integrity of tissues (Pagnamenta2021An). 

The VWA1 protein is expressed in various tissues, including cartilage cells, basement membranes of the peripheral nervous system, and skeletal and cardiac muscle, indicating its diverse functional roles (Wang2020A).

## Function
The VWA1 gene encodes a protein known as von Willebrand factor A domain containing 1, which is a component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and is involved in stabilizing ECM structures. This protein interacts with other ECM components such as perlecan and collagen VI, playing a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of peripheral nerves and muscle tissues (Pagnamenta2021An; Deschauer2021Biallelic). VWA1 is highly expressed in the tibial nerve and is thought to contribute to the development and maintenance of the peripheral nervous system, including nerve, neuromuscular junction, and muscle (Pagnamenta2021An).

In healthy human cells, VWA1 is detectable in dermal fibroblasts and is involved in ECM deposition, although it does not incorporate into the ECM in the cell layer (Pagnamenta2021An). The protein is a component of basement membranes in various tissues, including muscle, vasculature of the central nervous system, and the endoneurium of peripheral nerves, suggesting a role in establishing or maintaining the blood-brain barrier and blood-neural barrier (Deschauer2021Biallelic). The absence of VWA1 does not affect the ECM localization of collagen VI in muscle, indicating that its role in collagen VI stabilization is not critical in this context (Pagnamenta2021An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VWA1 gene have been linked to several neuromuscular and craniofacial disorders. Biallelic variants in VWA1 are associated with an autosomal-recessive hereditary motor neuropathy characterized by early-onset, non-length-dependent axonal neuropathy, slow disease progression, and largely preserved ambulation. A specific 10-bp repeat expansion, p.(G25Rfs*74), is a major disease-associated allele found in many affected individuals, particularly in European populations (Pagnamenta2021An). This mutation is believed to have originated approximately 47,000 years ago (Pagnamenta2021An).

VWA1 mutations are also implicated in neuromyopathy, a condition with both myopathic and neurogenic changes. This disorder is characterized by muscle weakness, foot deformities, and mixed electromyographic changes, indicating both neurogenic and myopathic damage (Deschauer2021Biallelic).

Additionally, a point mutation in VWA1, c.G905A:p.R302Q, has been associated with hemifacial microsomia (HFM), a congenital disorder affecting craniofacial development. This mutation disrupts cranial neural crest cell proliferation and chondrocyte organization, potentially through the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway (Wang2020A).

## Interactions
The VWA1 protein, also known as von Willebrand factor A domain containing 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the extracellular matrix and cellular processes. VWA1 interacts with collagen VI and perlecan, which are important for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues such as muscle and peripheral nerves (Arribat2021Genetic; Deschauer2021Biallelic). These interactions are significant in the context of neuromuscular disorders, where mutations in VWA1 can lead to compromised neuromuscular function (Deschauer2021Biallelic).

In the context of craniofacial development, VWA1 is predicted to interact with proteins in the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway, including FGF23, SPP1, CDH2, and SDC2, suggesting a role in craniofacial cartilage development (Wang2020A). 

In Dictyostelium, VWA1 interacts with the F-box protein FbxwD, which is part of the SCF (Skp1/cullin-1/F-box protein) complex involved in protein ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating developmental processes in Dictyostelium, with VWA1 acting as a binding hub for multiple proteins (Boland2023Synergy). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of VWA1 in various biological pathways and its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.
