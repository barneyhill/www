# ZBTB39

## Overview
ZBTB39 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 39, which is part of the BTB-zinc finger family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric à brac) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, and zinc finger motifs that typically facilitate binding to DNA. The ZBTB39 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and protein degradation pathways. It has been identified as a target for degradation by molecular glues such as pomalidomide, indicating its potential role in therapeutic strategies for diseases like neuroendocrine cancers, where it is highly expressed (Park2022The; Kozicka2021Haven’t). Additionally, ZBTB39's interaction with thalidomide and its analogs suggests its involvement in species-specific responses to these compounds (Donovan2018Thalidomide).

## Interactions
ZBTB39 is a zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein that may participate in various protein interactions. It has been identified as a target for degradation by molecular glues, specifically pomalidomide, a thalidomide derivative. This interaction suggests that ZBTB39 can be recruited to the CRL4 CRBN complex, facilitating its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Kozicka2021Haven’t). 

In the context of neuroendocrine (NE) cancer, ZBTB39 is one of the BTB proteins that show a positive correlation with the NE signature. It is highly expressed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a subtype of NE cancer, and is correlated with NE markers such as CHGA and DPYSL5. This suggests that ZBTB39 may interact with other proteins involved in NE cancer pathways, although specific protein interactions are not detailed (Park2022The).

ZBTB39 is also mentioned in studies exploring the effects of thalidomide and its analogs on zinc finger transcription factors, indicating that it may be affected by these compounds, leading to species-specific effects. However, specific interactions of ZBTB39 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature (Donovan2018Thalidomide).
