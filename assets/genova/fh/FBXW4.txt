# FBXW4

## Overview
FBXW4 is a gene that encodes the protein F-box and WD repeat domain containing 4, which is a member of the F-box protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an F-box domain, which is essential for its role in the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. As part of this complex, FBXW4 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a critical cellular process for protein degradation and homeostasis. The protein's interactions with components such as SKP1, CUL1, and the COP9 signalosome highlight its regulatory functions in protein ubiquitination and neddylation. FBXW4 is implicated in various cellular pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, and has been associated with several human cancers and developmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Huang2022Pancancer; Lockwood2013The).

## Function
FBXW4 is a member of the F-box protein family, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It is a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in tagging proteins for degradation through ubiquitination. This process is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression and signal transduction (Lockwood2013The).

The FBXW4 protein contains an F-box domain, which is critical for its interaction with other components of the SCF complex, such as Skp1 and Cullin1. It also interacts with the COP9 signalosome, a complex that regulates the activity of ubiquitin ligases, facilitating the ubiquitin ligase-substrate interaction (Lockwood2013The). This interaction suggests that FBXW4 is involved in protein degradation pathways, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Lockwood2013The).

FBXW4 is also implicated in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and differentiation (Huang2022Pancancer). Despite its significant role in these molecular processes, the precise organismal outcomes of FBXW4 activity in healthy cells are not completely understood.

## Clinical Significance
The FBXW4 gene is implicated in various human cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, where it is frequently mutated, lost, and under-expressed. Specific mutations such as R96L, G106W, and R367C are predicted to disrupt protein function, while the E245fs* mutation results in a protein lacking critical motifs. These alterations are associated with reduced mRNA expression levels in cancers like skin, breast, CNS, and lung cancer, correlating with poor survival outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma patients (Lockwood2013The).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FBXW4 is highly expressed and linked to poor prognosis, with higher expression associated with shorter event-free and overall survival. This suggests FBXW4 as a potential poor prognostic biomarker in AML (Han2020FBXW4).

FBXW4 is also involved in chemotherapy resistance in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Higher expression levels are found in chemotherapy-sensitive tissues, indicating its potential as a marker for chemotherapy response prediction (Zhang2020FBXW4).

Additionally, FBXW4 is associated with split hand and foot malformation (SHFM3) and radial ray deficiencies (RRDs), with duplications and deletions in the 10q24 region affecting its expression and potentially contributing to these developmental disorders (Vergult2013Complex; Dai2013Discontinuous).

## Interactions
FBXW4 is a protein that interacts with several components of the ubiquitin ligase complex and the COP9 signalosome. It specifically interacts with SKP1, CUL1, and RBX1, which are key components of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. These interactions are dependent on the F-box domain of FBXW4, which is crucial for its function in the ubiquitination process (Lockwood2013The). The interaction with SKP1 is particularly significant, as it is a core component of the SCF complex, facilitating the assembly of the ubiquitin ligase (Lockwood2013The).

FBXW4 also interacts with the COP9 signalosome, a multiprotein complex that regulates various ubiquitin ligase complexes. This interaction is also F-box dependent and is suggested to play a role in the neddylation of CUL1, which is important for the activation of the ubiquitin ligase complex (Lockwood2013The). The protein's ability to interact with ubiquitinated proteins is enhanced when the proteasome is inhibited, indicating its involvement in the ubiquitination pathway (Lockwood2013The). These interactions suggest that FBXW4 may function as a tumor suppressor, as it is often mutated, lost, or under-expressed in various human cancers (Lockwood2013The).
