# TACR1

## Overview
The TACR1 gene encodes the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is primarily activated by the neuropeptide substance P and plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including pain perception, inflammation, and stress responses. NK-1R is widely expressed in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, where it is integral to neurotransmission and immune responses (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation). The receptor's involvement extends to reproductive functions, where it influences sperm motility and gonadotropin release (Campo2022Tachykinins; Navarro2014The). Clinically, alterations in the TACR1 gene have been linked to neuropsychiatric conditions such as panic disorder and alcohol dependence, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Hodges2008Association; Seneviratne2009Susceptibility).

## Structure
The TACR1 gene encodes the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. The NK-1R is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, typical of class A GPCRs, and consists of 407 amino acids in its full-length form (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation; Rodríguez2022The). A truncated splice variant of NK-1R, lacking the C-terminal domain, comprises 311 amino acids (Rodríguez2022The). The receptor's primary structure includes specific residues like W261, which are crucial for its function (Rodríguez2022The).

The secondary structure of NK-1R involves intrahelical and interhelical hydrogen bonds that facilitate the insertion of helices into the lipid bilayer, impacting interactions with ligands and other proteins (Rodríguez2022The). The tertiary structure is defined by the arrangement of these helices, with the receptor's activity influenced by dynamic bond formations and atomic displacements (Rodríguez2022The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain, are essential for receptor internalization and interaction with β-arrestins (Rodríguez2022The). The NK-1R also undergoes glycosylation, which affects its signaling capabilities (Rodríguez2022The). The receptor's quaternary structure may involve dimerization or oligomerization, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
TACR1 encodes the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), a G protein-coupled receptor primarily involved in binding the neuropeptide substance P. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, including the regulation of pain perception, inflammation, and stress responses. NK1R is widely expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, where it plays a crucial role in neurotransmission and immune responses (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation).

In the context of reproductive functions, TACR1 is expressed in the uterus and is involved in enhancing sperm motility and stimulating contractility in the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. It is also implicated in the regulation of gonadotropin release, particularly through its action on Kiss1 neurons, which are essential for the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (Campo2022Tachykinins; Navarro2014The).

TACR1 is also involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, influencing reproductive hormone release. It acts through kisspeptin-dependent mechanisms, with its expression noted in certain Kiss1 and GnRH neurons. The receptor's activation by specific agonists can stimulate luteinizing hormone (LH) release, indicating its role in the reproductive axis (Navarro2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TACR1 gene, which encodes the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and physiological conditions. Variations in TACR1 are associated with panic disorder (PD), where genetic linkage and association studies suggest a potential role in susceptibility to PD. TACR1 antagonists have shown efficacy in reducing anxiety-like behaviors, indicating its involvement in anxiety regulation (Hodges2008Association; mclaughlin2011role).

The TACR1 gene is also linked to alcohol dependence (AD). A significant association was found between the SNP rs6715729 in TACR1 and AD, suggesting a genetic susceptibility locus for this condition (Seneviratne2009Susceptibility).

In addition to psychiatric disorders, TACR1 is involved in pain transmission and is associated with conditions such as telogen effluvium, liver and skin problems, and peripheral nervous issues. Deleterious single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TACR1 can impact the function of the NK1 receptor, contributing to these diseases (Devarapalli2014Identification).

Despite its involvement in various conditions, TACR1 was excluded as a candidate gene for dyslexia, as no significant mutations or associations were found in studies focused on this disorder (PeyrardJanvid2004Fine).

## Interactions
The TACR1 gene encodes the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), which is a G protein-coupled receptor primarily activated by the neuropeptide substance P. NK1R is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with different proteins and signaling pathways. Upon activation, NK1R preferentially couples with Gq proteins, leading to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and the production of second messengers such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). These messengers activate protein kinase C (PKC) and increase intracellular calcium levels, which subsequently activate pathways like MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt, crucial for cell survival and proliferation (GarcíaAranda2022Neurokinin1).

NK1R also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is significant in cancer therapy, as NK1R antagonists can block receptor activation by interfering with substance P binding (GarcíaAranda2022Neurokinin1). In the context of neuroblastoma, TACR1 interacts with the long non-coding RNA RMRP and is involved in the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for neuroblastoma progression, as TACR1 overexpression can reverse the inhibitory effects of RMRP depletion on cell proliferation and migration (Pan2018LncRNA). Additionally, TACR1 is targeted by miR-206, and its expression is regulated by the RMRP/miR-206 axis (Pan2018LncRNA).
