# CUX1

## Overview
CUX1, or cut like homeobox 1, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, cell proliferation, and differentiation. The protein product of CUX1, also known as CDP/Cut, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple DNA-binding domains such as Cut repeats and a homeodomain, enabling it to function as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. CUX1 is implicated in critical biological functions, such as cell cycle regulation and energy homeostasis, through its interactions with other proteins and DNA sequences. Clinically, mutations in the CUX1 gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, where it can act as a tumor suppressor or be overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression (Oppermann2022CUX1related; Stratigopoulos2011Cutlike; Wong2013Inactivating).

## Structure
The CUX1 protein, also known as CDP/Cut, is a transcription factor with a complex structure that includes several DNA-binding domains. It contains three Cut repeats (CR1, CR2, and CR3) and a Cut homeodomain (HD), which are crucial for its function in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Ramdzan2014CUX1; Liu2020CUX1). The protein also features an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain and two active repression domains (R1 and R2) at the C-terminus (Ramdzan2014CUX1; Liu2020CUX1).

CUX1 undergoes proteolytic processing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including p200 (full-length), p150, p110, p90, p80, and p75. These isoforms are generated through alternative transcription initiation and proteolytic cleavage by enzymes such as cathepsin L (Sansregret2008The; Liu2020CUX1). The p110 isoform, for example, is produced by cathepsin L cleavage and is involved in cell cycle regulation (Goulet2004A).

Post-translational modifications of CUX1, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase C and casein kinase II, generally inhibit its DNA binding and transcriptional activity (Sansregret2008The; Nepveu2001Role). Acetylation by PCAF acetyl-transferase also affects its function (Sansregret2008The). These modifications and isoform variations contribute to the diverse functional roles of CUX1 in cellular processes.

## Function
CUX1 (cut like homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation in healthy human cells. It functions primarily in the nucleus, where it influences various molecular processes by binding to specific DNA sequences. CUX1 can act as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, depending on the context and the specific isoform involved (Stratigopoulos2011Cutlike).

CUX1 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly by repressing the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p27^kip1, which is crucial for cell cycle progression. This repression is facilitated through interactions with co-repressors like Grg4 and the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Sharma2009The). In the context of kidney development, CUX1 is highly expressed in the nephrogenic zone, where it regulates cell proliferation by modulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle control (Sharma2009The).

CUX1 also plays a role in energy homeostasis and metabolism by regulating the expression of genes such as FTO and RPGRIP1L, which are involved in leptin receptor signaling. This regulation affects processes like energy balance and body weight maintenance (Stratigopoulos2011Cutlike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CUX1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers. CUX1-related neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized by intellectual disability or developmental delay, speech and motor delays, hypotonia, and seizures. Some individuals also exhibit autism spectrum disorder, cardiovascular abnormalities, and physical features such as a broad forehead and low-set ears (Oppermann2022CUX1related). The disorder is linked to haploinsufficiency of CUX1, with missense variants often leading to seizures (Oppermann2022CUX1related).

In oncology, CUX1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene, and its inactivation is linked to poorer survival outcomes in myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (Wong2013Inactivating). CUX1 mutations can lead to hyperactivation of the PI3K signaling pathway, suggesting potential therapeutic targets in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (Wong2013Inactivating). Overexpression of CUX1 is observed in gliomas and is associated with poor prognosis, promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Feng2021CUX1). CUX1's role in cancer is complex, as it is often overexpressed in tumor cells despite its function as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor (Liu2020CUX1).

## Interactions
CUX1, a transcription factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. The p110 isoform of CUX1 cooperates with E2F transcription factors, particularly E2F1 and E2F2, to activate cell cycle-regulated genes. This cooperation involves weak protein-protein interactions that facilitate the recruitment of E2F1 and E2F2 to target promoters, such as the DNA polymerase α gene promoter, enhancing transcriptional activation (Truscott2008p110).

CUX1 also interacts with the co-repressor Grg4 during kidney development, repressing the expression of the p27kip1 gene. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, indicating a direct interaction that may be stabilized by other proteins in a complex. CUX1, along with Grg4, HDAC1, and HDAC3, forms a complex that binds to the p27kip1 promoter, highlighting its role in gene repression (Sharma2009The).

In the context of DNA replication, CUX1 binds to specific DNA sequences during the S phase of the cell cycle, activating transcription of DNA replication genes. This binding is phase-specific and involves the consensus-binding site ATCRAT (Harada2007Genomewide).
