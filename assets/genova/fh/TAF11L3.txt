# TAF11L3

## Overview
TAF11L3 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 3, which is involved in the regulation of transcription. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, which is essential for the initiation of gene expression. TAF11L3 is part of a larger family of TATA-box binding protein associated factors (TAFs) that interact with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. This complex is critical for the transcription of genes by RNA polymerase II, influencing various cellular processes and developmental pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
