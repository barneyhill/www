# XAGE1B

## Overview
XAGE1B is a gene that encodes the protein X antigen family member 1B, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen (CTA) family. This family of proteins is typically expressed in various cancers and the testis, but not in normal somatic tissues, making them of particular interest in cancer research and immunotherapy (Zendman2001Characterization). The XAGE1B protein is characterized by a highly acidic C-terminus and a bipartite nuclear localization signal, which facilitates its localization to the nucleus where it forms distinct intranuclear dots, suggesting a role in nuclear processes (Zendman2001Characterization). The gene's expression is notably associated with certain cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma and ovarian cancer, where it serves as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Jumaa2021Cancer; Ohue2016Survival). Additionally, due to its immunogenic properties, XAGE1B is being explored as a target for cancer immunotherapy (Ali2003Immunoscreening; Nakagawa2005XAGE1).

## Structure
The XAGE1B gene encodes a protein that is part of the cancer/testis antigen family, with a transcript length of approximately 0.5 kb, coding for a putative protein of 81 amino acids (Zendman2001Characterization). The protein is characterized by a highly acidic C-terminus and contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is a common feature among cancer/testis antigens (Zendman2001Characterization). This NLS, although not completely consensus, is similar to those found in other CTAs like SPAN-Xc CTp11 and SSX (Zendman2001Characterization).

The XAGE1B protein is in-frame with the longer XAGE-1a transcript but lacks its N-terminal domain (Zendman2001Characterization). The protein's calculated isoelectric point (pI) is 9.65, and its molecular weight is approximately 9 kDa (Zendman2001Characterization). The protein's structure allows it to localize to the nucleus, forming distinct intranuclear dots, which suggests a role in nuclear processes (Zendman2001Characterization). The epitope for the monoclonal antibody USO 9-13, used to detect XAGE1B, is located at the COOH terminus, specifically residues 65 to 81, indicating the importance of this region in the protein's function (Nakagawa2005XAGE1).

## Clinical Significance
XAGE1B, also known as GAGED2a, is a cancer/testis antigen with significant clinical implications in various cancers, particularly lung adenocarcinoma. Its expression is notably higher in lung adenocarcinoma compared to other non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtypes, such as squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma, where it is either low or absent (Duréndez2024Liquid; Ohue2016Survival). XAGE1B is predominantly expressed in the nucleus of tumor cells and has been associated with poorer prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients, as those with XAGE1B-positive tumors tend to have shorter overall survival (Ohue2016Survival).

In addition to its role in lung cancer, XAGE1B expression has been observed in ovarian cancer, where it serves as a potential diagnostic biomarker. Its expression is significantly higher in malignant ovarian tumors compared to benign ones, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis (Jumaa2021Cancer). The gene's expression in exosomes derived from lung adenocarcinoma suggests its potential as a biomarker for histological classification and prognosis in NSCLC (Duréndez2024Liquid).

XAGE1B's immunogenicity makes it a promising target for cancer immunotherapy, as it is recognized by sera from cancer patients, indicating its potential role in immune surveillance and as a target for vaccine-based therapies (Ali2003Immunoscreening; Nakagawa2005XAGE1).
