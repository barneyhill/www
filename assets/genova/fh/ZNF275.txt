# ZNF275

## Overview
ZNF275 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 275, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is composed of 464 amino acids and includes 11 zinc finger motifs, likely of the C2H2-type, which facilitate its interaction with DNA (Mallon2000Comparative; Russo2008Fullterm). Zinc finger protein 275 is involved in various biological processes and is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting a broad functional role. It has been implicated in the progression of cervical cancer through its interaction with the AKT signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis (Ye2023The). Additionally, while a synonymous variant of ZNF275 has been identified in the context of premature ovarian insufficiency, it appears to contribute to genomic variability rather than being directly associated with the disease (Ramos2022WT1).

## Structure
ZNF275, also known as zinc finger protein 275, is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which are typical of proteins involved in DNA binding. The primary structure of ZNF275 includes 464 amino acids, with a notable presence of 11 zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its function in transcriptional regulation and DNA binding (Mallon2000Comparative; Russo2008Fullterm). These motifs are likely to feature C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are common in zinc finger proteins and facilitate interaction with DNA.

The secondary structure of ZNF275 is expected to include beta sheets and alpha helices, which are typical of zinc finger proteins, allowing the protein to maintain a stable conformation for DNA binding. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to enable effective interaction with DNA, although specific details on the tertiary structure of ZNF275 are not provided in the available context.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, which is common in zinc finger proteins, although specific modifications for ZNF275 are not detailed in the context. The gene is expressed in various tissues, indicating its potential involvement in diverse biological processes (Mallon2000Comparative).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF275 has been implicated in cervical cancer, where it is highly expressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its knockdown leads to reduced cell viability and enhanced apoptosis. The gene's role in cervical cancer progression is linked to its interaction with the AKT signaling pathway, as ZNF275 knockdown reduces phosphorylated-AKT levels and downregulates the apoptosis-associated protein Bcl-2, increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. These findings suggest that ZNF275 may promote cervical cancer progression through the AKT pathway, and its expression levels could influence the therapeutic response to treatments like cisplatin and triciribine (Ye2023The).

In the context of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a study identified a synonymous single-nucleotide variant in ZNF275, but found no significant association between this variant and POI. The study suggests that the identified variants in ZNF275 may contribute to genomic variability rather than being directly linked to the disease, indicating a minimal role in the genetic etiology of POI (Ramos2022WT1).
