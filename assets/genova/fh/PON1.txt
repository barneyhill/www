# PON1

## Overview
Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme paraoxonase 1, a calcium-dependent esterase and lactonase primarily associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the bloodstream. The PON1 enzyme plays a crucial role in cardiovascular health by hydrolyzing a variety of substrates, including organophosphates, aryl esters, and lactones, and by protecting low-density lipoproteins (LDL) from oxidative stress, thereby preventing atherosclerosis (Précourt2011The; Mackness2015Human). The gene is expressed mainly in the liver, and the enzyme is secreted into the plasma, where it associates with HDL particles (Mackness2015Human). PON1's activity is influenced by genetic polymorphisms, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices, which can affect its protective effects against cardiovascular diseases (Costa2005Modulation). Additionally, PON1 is involved in innate immunity by hydrolyzing bacterial quorum-sensing molecules, potentially reducing bacterial infections (Précourt2011The).

## Structure
Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a protein with a unique molecular structure characterized by a six-bladed β-propeller fold, which is crucial for its function and stability (Khersonsky2005Structure−Reactivity; TalerVerčič2020The). This structure includes two calcium ions: one structural and one catalytic, essential for maintaining the protein's integrity and enzymatic activity, respectively (Josse2002PON1; TalerVerčič2020The). The active site of PON1 involves several key residues, including histidines, tryptophan, and aspartic/glutamic acids, which are critical for its catalytic functions (Josse2001The; TalerVerčič2020The).

PON1 is highly glycosylated, with N-glycosylation occurring at Asn-253 and Asn-324, contributing to its stability and function (Josse2002PON1). The protein also contains a disulfide bond between Cys-42 and Cys-353, with Cys-284 being a free thiol group (Josse2002PON1). PON1 is associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), and its oligomeric state can vary, with the smallest active form being a dimer (Josse2002PON1). The N-terminal signal peptide, predicted to form a hydrophobic alpha-helix, is crucial for its interaction with phospholipids and HDL (Josse2002PON1).

## Function
Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an enzyme primarily associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the bloodstream, where it plays a significant role in cardiovascular health. PON1 functions as a calcium-dependent esterase and lactonase, hydrolyzing a variety of substrates, including organophosphates, aryl esters, and lactones (Shamir2005Paraoxonases; Précourt2011The). It is synthesized mainly in the liver and secreted into the plasma, where it associates with HDL particles (Mackness2015Human).

PON1's antioxidative properties are crucial for protecting low-density lipoproteins (LDL) from oxidative stress, thereby preventing the formation of oxidized LDL, which is a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis (Précourt2011The; Mackness2015Human). By hydrolyzing oxidized lipids, PON1 reduces inflammatory responses and promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophages, which is essential in preventing foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesion development (Précourt2011The; Mackness2015Human).

PON1 also plays a role in innate immunity by hydrolyzing quorum-sensing molecules from bacteria, potentially reducing bacterial infections (Précourt2011The). Its activity is modulated by genetic polymorphisms, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices, which can influence its protective effects against cardiovascular diseases (Précourt2011The; Costa2005Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the PON1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. The Q192R polymorphism affects the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze different substrates, influencing susceptibility to organophosphate toxicity and cardiovascular diseases (Costa2011Pharmacological; Macharia2012The). The L55M polymorphism is associated with lower plasma PON1 levels and has been linked to increased cancer risk, particularly breast and prostate cancer (Kim2013Pharmacogenetics). 

PON1 activity is crucial in protecting against oxidative stress-related diseases. Low PON1 activity has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease, and certain cancers (Kim2013Pharmacogenetics; Mackness2015Human). In type 2 diabetes, PON1 activity is generally lower, and polymorphisms like L55M and Q192R are linked to complications such as diabetic nephropathy and insulin resistance (Shokri2020Importance).

Ethnic differences in PON1 polymorphism distribution can lead to significant variations in enzyme activity, affecting disease susceptibility across populations (Mackness2015Human). Additionally, PON1's role in metabolizing organophosphates and certain drugs highlights its importance in pharmacogenomics and disease risk assessment (Kim2013Pharmacogenetics).

## Interactions
Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an enzyme associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and plays a significant role in modulating oxidative stress and inflammation through its interactions with other proteins. PON1 forms a functional ternary complex with myeloperoxidase (MPO) and HDL, where it partially inhibits MPO activity. Conversely, MPO can inactivate PON1 by oxidizing it at tyrosine 71, a residue critical for HDL binding and PON1 function (Huang2013Myeloperoxidase). This interaction is significant in the context of acute inflammation, as demonstrated in studies with transgenic and knockout mice (Huang2013Myeloperoxidase).

PON1 also interacts with apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1), a major protein component of HDL. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing PON1 and enhancing its lactonase activity, which is essential for its protective role against low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and stimulation of macrophage cholesterol efflux (Rosenblat2006The). Specific sequences on APOA1, such as P1 (L38-L46) and P2 (S201-K208), are identified as binding sites for PON1, which are important for maintaining PON1's activity and stability (Huang2013Myeloperoxidase). These interactions underscore PON1's role in cardiovascular health by modulating HDL function and protecting against atherosclerosis.
