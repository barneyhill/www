# USP44

## Overview
USP44 is a gene located on human chromosome 12 that encodes the protein ubiquitin-specific peptidase 44, a deubiquitinating enzyme. This enzyme is part of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, which plays a critical role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from target proteins. The USP44 protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining genomic stability, regulating the cell cycle, and participating in DNA damage repair. It is a key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division by modulating the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (Stegmeier2007Anaphase; Lou2022Insight). Additionally, USP44 has been implicated in immune response regulation and cancer progression, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogenic factor depending on the cellular context (Lou2022Insight).

## Structure
USP44 is a gene located on human chromosome 12, encoding a protein composed of 712 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 80 kDa (Lou2022Insight). The protein structure includes several key domains: a ZnF-UBP domain located at amino acid residues 29-97, which is involved in ubiquitin binding, and a conserved catalytic USP domain spanning residues 273-678 (Quesada2004Cloning; Lou2022Insight). The catalytic domain is characterized by a Cys box, an Asp-containing motif, and a His box, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and are common features among ubiquitin-specific proteases (Sippl2011UbiquitinSpecific; Quesada2004Cloning).

USP44 also contains a conserved centrin-binding domain, which is related to its centrosome distribution and function in preventing chromosomal hysteresis (Lou2022Insight). The protein is primarily located in the nucleus, where it participates in chromosome-related activities, gene expression regulation, and DNA damage repair (Lou2022Insight). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate its activity, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Lou2022Insight). The activation of USP44's catalytic activity depends on binding to partner proteins, such as the N-COR complex (Lou2022Insight).

## Function
USP44, or ubiquitin-specific peptidase 44, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it is involved in chromosome-related activities such as gene expression regulation and DNA damage repair (Lou2022Insight). USP44 is a key regulatory factor in the spindle assembly checkpoint, preventing premature activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) by promoting the deubiquitination of CDC20. This action stabilizes the mitotic checkpoint complex, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Stegmeier2007Anaphase; Lou2022Insight).

USP44 also plays a role in centrosome separation, DNA repair, and immune response regulation. It opposes the ubiquitination of histone H2A, affecting non-homologous end joining pathways and stabilizing DNA damage-binding protein 2 during nucleotide excision repair (Lou2022Insight). In immune function, USP44 acts as a deubiquitinase for FOXP3, a transcription factor important for regulatory T cell function, and is involved in the regulation of immune responses to DNA viruses (Lou2022Insight). These activities highlight USP44's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and stability.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in USP44 expression and function have significant clinical implications across various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), USP44 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its overexpression linked to reduced cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Low USP44 expression is associated with advanced-stage HCC and poorer patient survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhou2023Integrated).

In gastric cancer, USP44 overexpression is linked to DNA aneuploidy and poor prognosis, particularly in cases with DNA aneuploidy, indicating its role in cancer progression through mitotic errors (Nishimura2017High). In prostate cancer, high USP44 promoter methylation correlates with aggressive disease and reduced survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Londra2021USP44).

USP44 also plays a dual role in breast cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogenic factor depending on the context. Its expression is associated with poor survival in certain cancer stem cell subclones (Lou2022Insight). In colorectal cancer, USP44 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, with its downregulation linked to cancer progression (Huang2020USP44). In lung cancer, reduced USP44 expression is associated with increased tumorigenesis and aneuploidy, correlating with poorer clinical outcomes (Zhang2012USP44).

## Interactions
USP44 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the DNA damage response by interacting with histone H2A, where it promotes deubiquitylation, counteracting the ubiquitin chain formation catalyzed by RNF168. This interaction is crucial for modulating protein recruitment to DNA double-strand break sites (Mosbech2013The). USP44 also interacts with MITA (also known as STING) in the innate immune response to DNA viruses. It stabilizes MITA by removing K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, preventing its degradation and enhancing the antiviral response (Zhang2020USP44).

In the context of cancer, USP44 interacts with WDR5 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This interaction stabilizes WDR5 by repressing its ubiquitination, promoting T-ALL cell proliferation and survival (Chi2022USP44). USP44 also plays a role in colorectal cancer by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through the deubiquitination of axin 1, acting as a tumor suppressor (Lou2022Insight). These interactions highlight USP44's diverse roles in cellular regulation, from DNA repair and immune response to cancer progression.
