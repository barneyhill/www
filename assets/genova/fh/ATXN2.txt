# ATXN2

## Overview
The ATXN2 gene encodes the ataxin-2 protein, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism, translational regulation, and stress response. Ataxin-2 is characterized by its polyglutamine (polyQ) tract and several functional domains, such as the Lsm and Lsm-associated domains, which facilitate RNA binding, and the PAM2 domain, which interacts with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (LastresBecker2019New; JiménezLópez2014Insights). As a component of stress granules, ataxin-2 plays a crucial role in stress granule dynamics and endocytosis, and it is highly expressed in the nervous system, where it contributes to neuronal homeostasis (Costa2024The). Mutations in ATXN2, particularly expansions of the CAG repeat, are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), highlighting its clinical significance (LaffitaMesa2013De; Costa2024The).

## Structure
The ATXN2 gene encodes the ataxin-2 protein, which is composed of 1312 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa (van2009Ataxin2; LastresBecker2019New). The primary structure includes a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract located at the N-terminus, with normal alleles containing up to 30 glutamine repeats and expansions over 32 repeats associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) (van2009Ataxin2; JiménezLópez2014Insights).

The secondary structure of ataxin-2 predominantly consists of β-structures and coils, with a minimal presence of helical structures. However, in pathological variants like ataxin-2-79Q, there is an increase in helical structures (Wen2016Effects). The protein contains several functional domains, including the Lsm and Lsm-associated (LsmAD) domains, which are involved in RNA binding, and the PAM2 domain at the C-terminus, which interacts with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (LastresBecker2019New; JiménezLópez2014Insights).

Ataxin-2 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure (Sinha2017Simulation). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination are common, affecting the protein's function and localization (Sinha2017Simulation). Several splice variant isoforms exist, which are found in different human tissues and cell lines, including the brain and skin fibroblasts from SCA2 patients (LastresBecker2019New).

## Function
The ATXN2 gene encodes the ataxin-2 protein, which is involved in several critical cellular functions in healthy human cells. Ataxin-2 plays a significant role in RNA metabolism and translational regulation. It interacts with polyribosomes and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), suggesting a role in mRNA transport, stability, and translation. This interaction is mediated by the Lsm/Lsm-associated domain (LsmAD) and the PAM2 motif, which facilitate RNA binding and interaction with PABP, respectively (Satterfield2006Ataxin2).

Ataxin-2 is also involved in the regulation of mRNA translation by stabilizing mRNAs and negatively regulating translation through its interaction with PABP-1, affecting the translation initiation complex (Costa2024The). It is implicated in the miRNA pathway, where it is required for miRNA-mediated translational repression, particularly in synapse-specific long-term plasticity (McCann2011The).

In addition to its role in RNA metabolism, ataxin-2 is involved in stress granule dynamics, endocytosis, and calcium signaling. It is highly abundant in the nervous system, where it is crucial for maintaining neuronal homeostasis (Costa2024The). Ataxin-2's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular function and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATXN2 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2) is primarily caused by CAG repeat expansions in ATXN2, leading to neurodegeneration, RNA-mediated toxicity, and oxidative stress (Costa2024The). These expansions result in the formation of neuronal inclusions, although their exact role remains unclear (Costa2024The). In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), intermediate-length CAG repeats in ATXN2 are associated with increased disease risk, particularly when the repeat number exceeds 30 (LaffitaMesa2013De). ATXN2 mutations can exacerbate TDP-43 toxicity and interact with the FUS gene, contributing to ER stress and Golgi fragmentation in ALS (Costa2024The).

ATXN2 is also implicated in Parkinson's Disease, where certain CAG repeats may lead to parkinsonian features (Costa2024The). The gene is a risk factor for frontotemporal-dementia-ALS when combined with C9orf72 mutations (Costa2024The). In Machado-Joseph Disease/Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (MJD/SCA3), intermediate-length polyQ ATXN2 is linked to an earlier onset of symptoms (Costa2024The). Additionally, ATXN2 dysfunction is associated with metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes, with altered ATXN2 expression affecting insulin receptor regulation and weight gain (Costa2024The).

## Interactions
The ATXN2 protein interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in RNA metabolism, translation, stress granule formation, endocytosis, and calcium-mediated signaling. In RNA metabolism, ATXN2 interacts with proteins involved in alternative splicing, such as A2BP1, RBM9, and RBPMS, suggesting a potential role in modulating RNA splicing (Costa2024The). It also binds to RNA and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), associating with components of the translation pre-initiation complex, including eIF4G, eIF4A1, eIF3B, and ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) (LastresBecker2016Mammalian).

ATXN2 is a component of stress granules, where it interacts with initiation factors and is concentrated in monosome fractions of polysome gradients (LastresBecker2016Mammalian). It also interacts with endophilins A1 and A3, Cbl, CIN85, and Src, affecting the internalization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) during endocytosis (Costa2024The). Additionally, ATXN2 interacts with Parkin, suggesting a role in ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis (Halbach2015Both).

In calcium-mediated signaling, ATXN2 interacts with RGS8 mRNA, stabilizing it and regulating mGluR1-mediated signaling in Purkinje cells (Costa2024The). ATXN2 also shares many binding partners with ALS-associated proteins like FUS and TDP-43, indicating its involvement in common protein complexes and cellular mechanisms (Blokhuis2016Comparative).
