# SYNPR

## Overview
The SYNPR gene encodes synaptoporin, a transmembrane protein predominantly located in the synaptic vesicle membrane. Synaptoporin is closely related to synaptophysin and plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle maturation and neurotransmitter release. It is particularly enriched in the mossy fiber axon terminals of the hippocampus, where it contributes to synaptic plasticity and homeostatic regulation. Synaptoporin's interaction with synaptobrevin suggests its involvement in synaptic vesicle fusion and exocytosis, especially during heightened synaptic activity (Ho2020Labelfree; Apóstolo2019Synapse). The protein's expression and function are implicated in various neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its significance in maintaining synaptic integrity and function (Taoufik2018Synaptic; Han2021Class).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The SYNPR gene, encoding synaptoporin, is implicated in several neurological disorders due to its role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Alterations in SYNPR expression have been associated with schizophrenia (SCZ), a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by synaptic dysfunction. Studies using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to model SCZ have shown increased mRNA levels of presynaptic proteins, including SYNPR, in mutant neurons. This suggests that presynaptic defects, potentially involving SYNPR, play a significant role in the pathophysiology of SCZ (Taoufik2018Synaptic).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the expression of SYNPR is affected by the presence of β-amyloid (Aβ), a hallmark of AD pathology. Research has demonstrated that treatment with a class I HDAC inhibitor, BG45, can upregulate SYNPR expression, which may contribute to the repair of synaptic and cytoskeletal damage in AD models. This indicates a potential therapeutic role for targeting SYNPR expression in early-stage Aβ-related neurodegenerative diseases (Han2021Class).

While the clinical significance of SYNPR mutations is not fully detailed, these findings highlight its involvement in synaptic defects associated with both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
Synaptoporin (SYNPR) is a synaptic vesicle membrane protein that shares homology with synaptophysin and is involved in synaptic vesicle maturation. It binds to synaptobrevin, helping to reserve synaptobrevin for exocytosis during high synaptic activity (Ho2020Labelfree). Although SYNPR is not directly involved in exocytosis, its interaction with synaptobrevin suggests a role in synaptic vesicle fusion and release, particularly in response to synaptic processes following optic nerve crush (ONC) in mice (Sharma2014Optic).

In the hippocampus, SYNPR is expressed in mossy fiber axon terminals and is necessary for the homeostatic upregulation of synapses in response to chronic inhibition (Ho2020Labelfree). It is strongly enriched at MF-CA3 synapses, indicating its significant presence in these synaptic regions (Apóstolo2019Synapse). SYNPR also co-localizes with C1QL3, a marker for mossy fibers from the dentate gyrus, suggesting a presynaptic role in the hippocampus (Sticco2020C1QL3).

While the specific interactions of SYNPR in the cerebral cortex remain unclear, its involvement in synaptic processes and potential implications in language impairments highlight its importance in neuronal communication and synaptic plasticity (Ho2020Labelfree).
