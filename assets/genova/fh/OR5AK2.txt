# OR5AK2

## Overview
OR5AK2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily AK member 2, which belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR5AK2 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the vast diversity of olfactory detection mechanisms (Liu2005Pooled). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR5AK2 has been implicated in immune response pathways in prostate cancer and is associated with epidermal homeostasis in sensitive skin (Uehara2021Non‐invasive; Zhang2022Identification).

## Function
OR5AK2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of smell. OR5AK2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (Liu2005Pooled).

In addition to its role in olfactory signaling, OR5AK2 has been identified as a hub gene in co-expression modules related to immune response in prostate cancer. The gene is part of a module enriched in 'sensory perception of smell' and 'olfactory receptor activity', suggesting its involvement in olfactory signaling pathways even in non-olfactory tissues (Zhang2022Identification). Although the specific function of OR5AK2 in healthy cells is not detailed, its classification as an olfactory receptor implies a primary role in olfactory processes (Liu2005Pooled).

The expression of OR5AK2 and other olfactory receptor genes has also been studied in the context of sensitive skin, where downregulation of these genes is associated with skin sensitivity, indicating a potential role in epidermal homeostasis (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).
