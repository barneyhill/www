# GAGE12G

## Overview
GAGE12G is a gene that encodes the G antigen 12G protein, which is part of the GAGE family of cancer/testis antigens. These proteins are typically expressed in a variety of tumors and are known for their restricted expression in normal tissues, primarily in the testis. The G antigen 12G protein is implicated in oncogenic processes, including tumor progression and immune evasion, due to its altered expression patterns in malignancies such as glioblastoma and breast cancer (Voels2017The; Arias2023Electrostatic). Additionally, GAGE12G has been studied for its potential protective role in the context of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, where its expression is inversely related to disease severity (Gan2022Microbial). The multifaceted roles of GAGE12G in cancer and infectious diseases underscore its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Clinical Significance
GAGE12G, a member of the GAGE family of cancer/testis antigens, is implicated in various malignancies due to its altered expression. In glioblastoma (GBM), higher electrostatic complementarity scores between T-cell receptors and GAGE12G are associated with poorer disease-free survival probabilities, suggesting a role in tumor progression and immune evasion (Arias2023Electrostatic). The gene is also upregulated in glioma tissues, particularly in peripheral tumor regions, indicating its potential involvement in tumor invasion (Alenda2021FFPE).

In breast cancer, GAGE12G expression is linked to higher-grade tumors and is associated with a trend towards negative effects on disease-free and overall survival, although not statistically significant (Voels2017The). The expression of GAGE12G is influenced by metallothionein isoform 3 (MT3) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, where the C-terminal sequence of MT3 induces its expression, while the N-terminal sequence inhibits it (Voels2017The).

In the context of COVID-19, GAGE12G expression is negatively correlated with disease severity, suggesting a protective role against severe symptoms (Gan2022Microbial). These findings highlight the diverse roles of GAGE12G in different diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.
