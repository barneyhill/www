# OR1N1

## Overview
The OR1N1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily N member 1, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the detection of odorant molecules. As a GPCR, it is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for its role in signal transduction across cell membranes (cvicek2015structure). The olfactory receptor family, including OR1N1, is involved in the initial molecular events that lead to the perception of smell. These receptors are typically expressed in the olfactory epithelium and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals (Gregson2015Altered).

## Structure
The OR1N1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, facilitating their role in signal transduction across cell membranes (cvicek2015structure). The primary structure of OR1N1 consists of amino acid sequences that form the protein, which is typical for olfactory receptors. 

In terms of secondary structure, olfactory receptors like OR1N1 predominantly feature alpha helices, which span the cell membrane. The tertiary structure of OR1N1 involves the overall three-dimensional conformation of the protein, which is crucial for its function in detecting odorant molecules. Although specific details about the quaternary structure of OR1N1 are not provided, olfactory receptors generally function as monomers or dimers.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in olfactory receptors and may play a role in the stability and function of OR1N1. These modifications can affect the receptor's localization and interaction with other cellular components, although specific modifications for OR1N1 are not detailed in the available context (Gregson2015Altered).
