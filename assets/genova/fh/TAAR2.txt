# TAAR2

## Overview
TAAR2, or trace amine-associated receptor 2, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor involved in the detection and response to trace amines, which are structurally similar to classical biogenic amines. The protein product of TAAR2, trace amine-associated receptor 2, is categorized as a receptor and is expressed in various tissues, including immune cells and specific brain regions. It plays a significant role in the immune system by mediating responses to biogenic amines and is involved in the chemotactic migration of immune cells. In the central nervous system, TAAR2 is implicated in neurogenesis and the regulation of the dopaminergic system, influencing dopamine neuron development. Alterations in TAAR2 expression and function have been associated with psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance (Babusyte2013Biogenic; Rutigliano2019Molecular; Katolikova2023Expression).

## Function
TAAR2 (trace amine-associated receptor 2) is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in the detection and response to trace amines, which are structurally similar to classical biogenic amines. In healthy human cells, TAAR2 is expressed in various blood leukocytes, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), T cells, and B cells. It plays a role in the immune system by mediating responses to biogenic amines, which are crucial for immune response regulation. TAAR2, along with TAAR1, is involved in the chemotactic migration of PMN towards amines, facilitating immune cell movement and function (Babusyte2013Biogenic).

TAAR2 also participates in the regulation of cytokine and immunoglobulin secretion. It mediates amine-induced IL-4 secretion in T cells and IgE secretion in B cells, indicating its role in modulating immune responses (Babusyte2013Biogenic). The receptor is co-expressed with TAAR1 in a subpopulation of PMN, suggesting potential functional interactions between these receptors (Babusyte2013Biogenic).

In the brain, TAAR2 is expressed in regions such as the piriform cortex, hypothalamus, and midbrain, and is implicated in neurogenesis and the dopaminergic system. Its absence in animal models leads to changes in dopamine neuron development, suggesting a regulatory role in the dopaminergic system (Katolikova2023Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TAAR2 gene have been implicated in various psychiatric disorders. Studies have suggested a potential link between TAAR2 and mental health conditions such as schizophrenia and depression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TAAR2 have been associated with schizophrenia, although these findings have not reached genome-wide significance and require further validation (Zucchi2006Trace; Rutigliano2019Molecular). The TAAR2 gene is located on chromosome 6, a region repeatedly linked to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of these mental disorders (Rutigliano2019Molecular).

In animal models, the absence of TAAR2 has been shown to result in increased dopamine levels and altered stress responses, which may relate to mood disorders (Efimova2022Trace). Knockout studies in mice have demonstrated that TAAR2 deficiency leads to increased adult neurogenesis and changes in dopamine regulation, which could influence behaviors associated with depression and anxiety (Efimova2022Trace; Shemiakova2024TAARs). Despite these findings, the direct association of TAAR2 mutations or expression changes with specific diseases remains to be conclusively established, necessitating further research to clarify its clinical significance (Efimova2022Trace).
