# OR8H1

## Overview
OR8H1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily H member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the detection and differentiation of odorants, thereby contributing to the sense of smell. The OR8H1 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where the encoded receptor binds to specific odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in neuronal responses and the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional). The receptor's ability to recognize a variety of chemical compounds, such as l-carvone and methyl β-naphthyl ketone, underscores its importance in olfactory transduction pathways (Ieki2022Functional). Research utilizing cell lines, including LNCaP cells, has further elucidated the receptor's functional expression and its interactions with ligands, highlighting its role in identifying novel odorant-receptor pairs (Ieki2022Functional).

## Function
OR8H1 is an olfactory receptor that plays a role in the detection of odorants, contributing to the sense of smell. It is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is involved in signal transduction processes. In healthy human cells, OR8H1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odor molecules. This binding initiates a signal transduction pathway that results in the generation of neuronal responses, ultimately leading to the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional).

The receptor has been identified as responsive to specific odorants such as l-carvone and methyl β-naphthyl ketone, indicating its role in recognizing a variety of chemical compounds (Ieki2022Functional). The functional expression of OR8H1 and its interaction with ligands have been studied using various cell lines, including LNCaP cells, which have shown high basal activity and effectiveness in identifying novel OR-ligand pairs (Ieki2022Functional). These studies highlight the receptor's involvement in olfactory transduction pathways, which are crucial for the detection and differentiation of odors (Yin2020Functional).
