# CSRP3

## Overview
The CSRP3 gene encodes the muscle LIM protein (MLP), a crucial component in the physiology of striated muscle, including both skeletal and cardiac muscle. MLP is categorized as a scaffold protein, characterized by its two LIM domains, which are zinc finger motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. These domains are essential for the protein's role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells and in mechanotransduction processes. The protein is involved in various cellular functions, including the regulation of autophagy and glucose homeostasis, and it plays a significant role in muscle development and maintenance. Mutations in the CSRP3 gene have been linked to cardiomyopathies, underscoring its importance in cardiac muscle function (Germain2022Role; Kostek2007Gene; Chauhan2022LIM).

## Structure
The CSRP3 gene encodes the muscle LIM protein (MLP), which is composed of 194 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 21 kDa (Germain2022Role). The protein is characterized by two LIM domains, which are zinc finger motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These domains are connected by a flexible disordered linker region approximately 53 residues long, rich in glycyl and prolyl residues, contributing to the protein's conformational flexibility (Chauhan2023Computational). The LIM domains are crucial for the protein's function, with the C-terminal LIM domain interacting directly with actin filaments, stabilizing them and cross-linking them into bundles, while the N-terminal LIM domain is involved in self-association of CSRP3 (Chauhan2023Computational).

MLP exists in two isoforms: MLP-a, primarily expressed in myoblasts, and MLP-b, localized in the cytoplasm during early myoblast differentiation (Germain2022Role). The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, glutathionylation, and polyubiquitinylation, which may influence its nuclear import (Germain2022Role). The mechanosensitivity of MLP is related to its carboxyl end, and it can be found in both monomeric and polymeric forms, with monomeric MLPs being nuclear and polymeric MLPs associated with the cytoskeleton or cell molecular motors (Germain2022Role).

## Function
The CSRP3 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the physiology of striated muscle, including both skeletal and cardiac muscle. It is primarily involved in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanotransduction processes of muscle cells. CSRP3 is a component of the Z-disk in sarcomeres, where it binds to telethonin and is thought to translocate to the nucleus upon muscle stretch or stimulation. In the nucleus, it interacts with transcription factors such as MYOD, myogenin, and MRF4, influencing their ability to bind DNA and activate gene transcription, thereby promoting the terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle myoblasts (Kostek2007Gene).

CSRP3 also plays a significant role in regulating autophagy, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis in skeletal muscle. It interacts with the autophagosome marker LC3, promoting the formation of autophagosomes, which are critical for autophagy. This function helps protect against cell death by facilitating autophagy and is crucial for muscle development, maintenance, and protection against apoptosis (Cui2020The; Rashid2015Muscle).

Additionally, CSRP3 is involved in glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle, influencing insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Its expression is associated with improved glucose tolerance and insulin signaling, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress (HernandezCarretero2018Cysteine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CSRP3 gene, which encodes muscle LIM protein (MLP), are associated with several cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). These mutations often occur in the LIM domains of the protein, which are crucial for its structural stability and function. Notable mutations such as L44P and C58G have been identified as highly destabilizing, leading to altered protein structure and function, which contribute to the disease phenotypes (Chauhan2022LIM).

The C58G mutation, in particular, disrupts zinc ion coordination in the LIM domain, affecting domain stability and leading to protein depletion through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This depletion is linked to the activation of pro-fibrotic signaling and hypertrophic markers, contributing to the development of HCM (Ehsan2018Mutant). In mouse models, the C58G mutation results in left ventricular dysfunction and increased heart weight, indicative of a robust cardiomyopathy phenotype (Ehsan2018Mutant).

Additionally, the W4R mutation affects the protein's ability to bind to T-cap, impacting Z-disk stability and is found in both DCM and HCM patients (Vafiadaki2015Muscle). These mutations highlight the critical role of CSRP3 in maintaining cardiac muscle function and the severe consequences of its disruption.

## Interactions
The human gene CSRP3 encodes Muscle LIM Protein (MLP), which is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in muscle physiology. MLP contains two LIM domains, LIM1 and LIM2, with LIM1 responsible for binding to alpha-actinin at the Z-disk. This interaction is essential for the maintenance and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. MLP also interacts with telethonin and calcineurin, which are involved in hypertrophic signaling pathways in response to mechanical stress, crucial for calcium handling and myofibrillogenesis (Noureddine2023Structural).

MLP acts as a scaffold protein in the sarcomere and interacts with several structural proteins, including betaI-spectrin and N-RAP. It also forms a complex with cofilin 2 (CFL2) in cardiac and skeletal muscles, regulating F-actin depolymerization. This interaction is influenced by pH and CFL2 phosphorylation, affecting actin dynamics and myofibrillar structure (Papalouka2009Muscle).

MLP interacts with syndecan-4, a transmembrane proteoglycan involved in the hypertrophic response to pressure overload. This interaction is significant in stretch-sensing in cardiomyocytes and is affected by mutations associated with cardiomyopathies (Støle2024Exploring).
