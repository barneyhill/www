# CSAG1

## Overview
The CSAG1 gene, also known as Chondrosarcoma-Associated Gene 1, encodes a protein that plays a critical role in mitotic processes, particularly in cells with compromised p53 function. The CSAG1 protein is primarily associated with the centrosome, where it contributes to the stabilization of the mitotic spindle apparatus, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and preventing the formation of multipolar spindles. While not essential for mitosis in normal cells, CSAG1 becomes crucial in maintaining mitotic integrity in cancer cells, especially those with defective p53, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. The gene is notably overexpressed in various cancers, including chondrosarcoma, malignant melanoma, and breast cancer, where it is linked to poor prognosis and disease progression (Filippi2023Mining; Sapkota2019CSAG1).

## Structure


## Function
The CSAG1 gene, also known as Chondrosarcoma-Associated Gene 1, is involved in maintaining the integrity of the mitotic centrosome, particularly in cells with defective p53 function. In healthy human cells, such as RPE1 cells with normal p53 function, depletion of CSAG1 does not result in significant mitotic defects, although there is a marginal delay in mitotic progression and a small fraction of cells exit mitosis without complete chromosome alignment. This suggests that CSAG1 is not strictly essential for mitosis in normal cells but may play a role in increasing the fidelity of chromosome segregation (Sapkota2019CSAG1).

CSAG1 localizes to centrosomes during mitosis, and its depletion leads to defects in chromosome alignment and increased mitotic duration. The protein is crucial for proper spindle pole formation and chromosome segregation during mitosis, ensuring normal bipolar spindle formation and preventing the generation of extra spindle poles (Sapkota2019CSAG1). The exact molecular mechanisms through which CSAG1 stabilizes the pericentriolar material (PCM) are still under investigation, but it may involve phase separation processes (Sapkota2019CSAG1). CSAG1 expression levels vary widely among different cell types, with higher levels observed in malignant melanoma cell lines (Sapkota2019CSAG1).

## Clinical Significance
CSAG1 (chondrosarcoma associated gene 1) is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing a significant role in disease progression. In chondrosarcoma and other cancers, CSAG1 is highly expressed, particularly in cells with defective p53 function, where it helps maintain centrosome integrity during mitosis. Its depletion in such cells leads to multipolar spindles, suggesting its critical role in cancer cell mitosis (Sapkota2019CSAG1).

CSAG1 is also overexpressed in malignant melanoma and breast cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis (Filippi2023Mining; Sapkota2019CSAG1). In prostate cancer, CSAG1, as part of the MAGEA/CSAG subfamilies, is upregulated in castrate-resistant prostate cancer, indicating its potential as a biomarker for aggressive disease (Suyama2010Expression).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly alcohol-related cases, CSAG1 is upregulated, although its expression does not correlate with disease stage or grade (Zhang2019Identification). The gene is also linked to the expression of cancer-testis antigens in multiple myeloma, suggesting a role in cancer resistance mechanisms (Mei2020MAGEA). These findings highlight CSAG1's potential as a therapeutic target in cancers with p53 deficiencies and other malignancies.
