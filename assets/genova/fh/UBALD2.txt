# UBALD2

## Overview
UBALD2 is a gene that encodes the protein UBA like domain containing 2, which is involved in various cellular processes and signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its UBA-like domain, suggesting a role in ubiquitin-related processes, although its precise functions are still being elucidated. UBALD2 is notably expressed in the olfactory bulb, where it may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease by interacting with key neuropathological proteins (LachénMontes2020Smelling). Additionally, UBALD2 is implicated in the molecular mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus persistence and is involved in cancer-related pathways, highlighting its potential significance in both infectious and oncological contexts (KAYA2024Bioinformatics; Satoh2013Molecular).

## Interactions
UBALD2, also known as UBA like domain containing 2, is implicated in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. The protein is highly expressed in the granular cell layer of the olfactory bulb and may be involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, potentially interacting with neuropathological substrates like amyloid precursor protein (APP), Tau protein, and alpha-synuclein (LachénMontes2020Smelling).

In the context of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, UBALD2 is identified as a target of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1). This interaction suggests a role in the molecular network associated with EBV persistence in multiple sclerosis, involving pathways such as transcriptional regulation by interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (Satoh2013Molecular).

UBALD2 is also part of a regulatory axis in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, interacting within the hsa-miR-361-3p/KIFC1, UBALD2, CDC6 axis, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (KAYA2024Bioinformatics). These interactions highlight UBALD2's diverse roles in cellular signaling and disease processes.
