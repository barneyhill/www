# TEX35

## Overview
TEX35 is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 35, which is predominantly expressed in the testicular tissue. The protein is categorized as a testis-specific protein, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis or other testis-related functions. While the precise biological function of TEX35 remains to be fully elucidated, its expression pattern indicates a potential involvement in reproductive processes. Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms and pathways in which TEX35 participates, as well as its interactions with other proteins and its clinical significance.
