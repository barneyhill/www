# PHC1

## Overview
PHC1 (polyhomeotic homolog 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a critical component of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. The PHC1 protein is primarily involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing, functioning as part of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). This complex plays a significant role in the ubiquitination of histone H2A, a post-translational modification essential for maintaining chromatin structure and transcriptional repression of key developmental genes, including homeotic HOX genes (Awad2013Mutation). The PHC1 protein contains several conserved domains, such as the FCS finger domain and the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate its interactions and oligomerization within the PRC1 complex (Isono2005Mammalian). Beyond its role in gene repression, PHC1 is also involved in DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation, contributing to genomic stability and cellular differentiation (Awad2013Mutation; Chen2021PHC1). Mutations in the PHC1 gene have been linked to developmental disorders such as primary microcephaly and various cancers, underscoring its importance in normal cellular function and development (Awad2013Mutation; Chen2021PHC1).

## Structure
The PHC1 protein is a component of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins and is involved in chromatin remodeling. It contains several conserved domains that contribute to its function. One of the key domains is the FCS finger domain, which is a type of zinc coordination domain known to encode an RNA binding motif and regulate subnuclear localization (Isono2005Mammalian). Another important domain is the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for the oligomerization of PcG complexes. The SAM domain also plays a role in forming helical polymer structures, which may facilitate the bridging of distant chromatin templates (Isono2005Mammalian).

The PHC1 protein is part of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which functions as an E3 ligase to promote H2A ubiquitination, a post-translational modification important for chromatin structure and gene repression (Awad2013Mutation). Mutations in PHC1 can lead to rapid degradation of the protein, affecting its expression and function, as seen in primary microcephaly pathogenesis (Awad2013Mutation). The presence of splice variant isoforms of PHC1 may alter its functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
PHC1 (polyhomeotic homolog 1) is a crucial component of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, specifically part of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. In healthy human cells, PHC1 is involved in the ubiquitination of histone H2A, a process essential for maintaining chromatin structure and function. This modification is critical for the transcriptional repression of genes, including homeotic HOX genes, which are vital for proper development and cellular differentiation (Awad2013Mutation).

PHC1 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the formation of PRC1 complexes, impacting gene expression patterns necessary for normal development and cellular identity. It interacts with other proteins like PHC2 and BMI1 to facilitate H2A ubiquitination, thereby maintaining several genes in a repressive state (Awad2013Mutation). PHC1 also plays a role in DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation, ensuring genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Awad2013Mutation). Its function in chromatin remodeling is crucial for maintaining pluripotency in stem cells by organizing chromatin interactions at key loci such as the Nanog gene (Chen2021PHC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PHC1 gene are associated with primary microcephaly (PM), a developmental disorder characterized by reduced brain size, particularly affecting the cortex. A specific mutation, NM_004426.2:c.2974C.T, p.(Leu992Phe), has been identified in a consanguineous Saudi family, leading to decreased PHC1 protein levels due to increased proteasomal degradation. This mutation results in cell cycle abnormalities, increased Geminin expression, and impaired ubiquitination of histone H2A, which are critical for DNA repair processes (Awad2013Mutation). The mutation affects the SAM domain of PHC1, disrupting its role in chromatin remodeling and DNA damage response, contributing to the pathogenesis of PM (Awad2013Mutation).

PHC1 mutations also lead to reduced genome-wide H2AUb1 levels and impaired recruitment of PHC1 to DNA damage and repair sites, highlighting the sensitivity of neural development to H2AUb1 modification dysregulation (Naveed2018Comprehensive). These mutations are linked to MCPH11, a form of primary microcephaly, emphasizing the role of chromatin remodeling in this condition (Naveed2018Comprehensive).

Alterations in PHC1 expression or interactions can also contribute to developmental disorders and have been implicated in various cancers, including breast and prostate cancer, due to its role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation (Chen2021PHC1).

## Interactions
PHC1, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. PHC1 interacts with other PRC1 components, including RING1B, CBX7, and RYBP, although its suppression does not disrupt the assembly or target gene occupancy of PRC1, indicating potential PRC1-independent functions (Chen2021PHC1). Super-resolution imaging and ChIP-seq data suggest that while PHC1 and RING1B often co-occupy targets, they also have distinct binding sites, supporting the idea of PHC1's unique roles beyond PRC1 (Chen2021PHC1).

PHC1 also forms a complex with NANOG, a key pluripotency factor, independent of PRC1. This interaction is essential for organizing chromatin interactions at the Nanog locus, stabilizing chromatin loops necessary for the transcriptional regulation of pluripotency genes (Chen2021PHC1). In the context of primary microcephaly, a mutation in PHC1 impairs its interaction with H2A, reducing H2A ubiquitination, which is crucial for DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Awad2013Mutation). These interactions highlight PHC1's multifaceted role in both maintaining pluripotency and ensuring proper chromatin remodeling and DNA repair.
