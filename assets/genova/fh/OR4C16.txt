# OR4C16

## Overview
OR4C16 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily C member 16, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a critical role in the detection of odor molecules, facilitating the sense of smell. The OR4C16 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odorants, contributing to the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception (Ryu2018Association). The gene is part of a large and evolutionarily conserved family of olfactory receptors, which are essential for sensory perception and can influence individual differences in olfactory sensitivity (Hasin2008High-Resolution). Variations in the OR4C16 gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as recurrent pregnancy loss, highlighting its potential significance in human health (Ryu2018Association).

## Function
OR4C16 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules in the environment, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR4C16 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (Ryu2018Association).

The olfactory receptors, including OR4C16, are located in the nasal passage and are responsible for detecting odorants. These receptors are evolutionarily conserved and vary in size across species, playing a crucial role in sensory perception, which can impact quality of life and safety (Ryu2018Association). The variability in olfactory receptor gene dosages, such as those involving OR4C16, may contribute to the functional individuality of the human olfactory system (Hasin2008High-Resolution).

While the specific function of OR4C16 in healthy human cells is not detailed, it is part of a large family of receptors that are essential for the detection and differentiation of a wide range of odorants, influencing olfactory sensitivity and perception (Jimenez2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The OR4C16 gene has been implicated in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), particularly in Korean women. A study identified the OR4C16G>A polymorphism as significantly associated with an increased risk of RPL. Specifically, individuals with the AA genotype and those with the GG + GA genotype of this polymorphism were found to have a higher prevalence of RPL. This suggests that mutations in the OR4C16 gene may serve as a biomarker for the development, prevention, and prognosis of RPL (Ryu2018Association).

The study also explored gene-gene interactions and found that certain allele combinations involving OR4C16 were significantly different between RPL patients and controls. The OR4C16GA + AA genotype showed a synergistic effect with specific environmental factors, such as blood coagulation factors, which further increased the prevalence of RPL. These findings indicate that OR4C16 gene mutations may have clinical significance in the context of RPL, particularly when interacting with specific environmental factors (Ryu2018Association).

While the precise mechanisms by which OR4C16 mutations contribute to RPL are not fully understood, the gene's involvement in this condition highlights its potential clinical relevance (Ryu2018Association).
