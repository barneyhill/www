# AGFG1

## Overview
AGFG1 (ArfGAP with FG repeats 1) is a human gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. The protein, categorized as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), plays a crucial role in the regulation of ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) proteins, which are pivotal in vesicle formation and transport processes within the cell. AGFG1 is notably active in the cytoplasm and associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in endocytosis and exocytosis. Additionally, AGFG1 is recognized for its role as a cellular co-factor in HIV-1 infection, facilitating the transport of viral RNA. The protein's structure includes an Arf-GAP zinc finger domain and several phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motifs, which are essential for its function. AGFG1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues and is evolutionarily conserved, underscoring its fundamental biological importance (Panaro2011Organization; Catrina2016The).

## Function
The AGFG1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) proteins, which are essential in vesicle formation and transport processes within the cell. AGFG1 is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in both endocytosis and exocytosis processes (Panaro2011Organization).

In the context of HIV-1 infection, AGFG1, also known as HIV-1 Rev binding protein (HRB), acts as a cellular co-factor for the viral protein Rev. This interaction is crucial for the transport of unspliced virus-derived pre-mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytosol, facilitating the translation of proteins necessary for the formation of new HIV-1 virions (Panaro2011Organization). Structurally, AGFG1 contains an Arf-GAP zinc finger domain, several phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motifs, and four Asparagine-Proline-Phenylalanine (NPF) motifs, which are thought to be necessary for its role as an HIV-1 Rev cofactor (Panaro2011Organization). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in tissues and is relatively well conserved throughout evolution (Panaro2011Organization).

## Clinical Significance
AGFG1 (ArfGAP with FG repeats 1) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in gene expression and protein interactions. In lung neuroendocrine tumors (LNETs) and gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs), AGFG1 is identified among genes with mutations that are involved in chromatin remodeling and signaling pathways such as NF-kB and MAPK/ERK, which are crucial for tumor development and progression (Evangelou2024Lung).

In the context of infantile Pompe disease, AGFG1 is noted as one of the hub genes with altered expression in the lysosome pathway, suggesting its potential central role in the disease's molecular network (Karadağ2022To). This alteration in expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease and affect the response to enzyme replacement therapy.

In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), AGFG1 is targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs, showing a dual effect on patient survival. Initially, its expression is associated with increased survival, but a decline is observed after 100 days, indicating a complex role in the prognosis of HGSOC (Karatasli2022miRNA).

AGFG1 is also mentioned in the context of globozoospermia, a form of male infertility, due to its involvement in vesicle trafficking. However, its direct role in this condition remains unclear (Coutton2015Teratozoospermia:).

## Interactions
AGFG1, a human gene encoding a protein involved in intracellular trafficking, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. AGFG1 is known to coimmunoprecipitate with EPS15, an adaptor protein involved in intracellular trafficking, suggesting a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Catrina2016The). It also interacts with clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP2) and recruits VAMP7, a v-SNARE protein involved in lysosome fusion, indicating its involvement in vesicle docking and fusion processes (Catrina2016The).

In Drosophila, the homolog of AGFG1, known as Drongo, interacts with components of the Arp2/3 complex, which is involved in actin polymerization and vesicle trafficking. This interaction suggests a role in actin filament branching and cytoskeleton organization (Catrina2016The). Drongo also colocalizes with Rab11, a recycling endosome marker, indicating its involvement in endosomal recycling and actin dynamics during oogenesis (Catrina2016The).

AGFG1's role in viral RNA transport is highlighted by its requirement for the replication of RNA viruses such as HIV-1 and Influenza A, where it may facilitate RNA release and cytoplasmic transport (Catrina2016The).
