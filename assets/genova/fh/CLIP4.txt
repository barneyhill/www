# CLIP4

## Overview
The CLIP4 gene encodes the CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein family member 4, a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling and structural integrity. As a member of the T-cell ubiquitin ligand family, the protein is involved in the regulation of T-cell signaling and apoptosis, which are crucial for immune response and cellular homeostasis. The CAP-Gly domain within the protein facilitates microtubule binding, contributing to intracellular transport and cell structure stabilization. This domain is essential for maintaining cell polarity and migration, impacting overall cellular function and development. CLIP4's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in normal cellular architecture and function. Additionally, alterations in CLIP4 expression and methylation have been linked to various cancers, underscoring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Hu2018A; Fan2021CLIP4).

## Function
The CLIP4 gene, also known as UBASH3A or TULA, encodes a protein that is a member of the T-cell ubiquitin ligand family. In healthy human cells, CLIP4 proteins play a crucial role in suppressing T-cell signaling and facilitating apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal in T-cells. This function is important for regulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hu2018A).

CLIP4 is also involved in the accumulation of activated target receptors, such as T-cell receptors and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs). This activity influences cell invasiveness and metastasis, highlighting its role in cellular signaling pathways that are critical for normal cellular functions and responses to external stimuli (Hu2018A).

The protein contains a CAP-Gly domain, which is known for its ability to bind microtubules and associated proteins. This domain is essential for stabilizing microtubules, facilitating intracellular transport, and maintaining cell structure. These functions are vital for cell polarity, intracellular transport, and cell migration, impacting overall cellular function and organismal development (Fan2021CLIP4). CLIP4's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining normal cellular architecture and function.

## Clinical Significance
CLIP4 has been implicated in several cancers due to alterations in its expression and methylation status. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CLIP4 is often hyper-methylated, leading to its underexpression. This hyper-methylation is associated with the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, contributing to tumor development and progression. The hyper-methylation of CLIP4 in serum can serve as a biomarker for CRC diagnosis, distinguishing CRC patients from healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity (Liu2021Coupling).

In gastric cancer, CLIP4 expression is positively correlated with oncogenes and negatively correlated with tumor suppressor genes. High levels of CLIP4 are linked to poor survival rates, suggesting its role in cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis (GUL2021SATB1). Promoter methylation of CLIP4 is also associated with gastric cancer risk stratification, indicating its potential role in cancer development (Pirini2017Early).

In breast cancer, CLIP4 is downregulated primarily due to promoter hypermethylation. High CLIP4 expression is associated with better prognosis in certain breast cancer subtypes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Fan2021CLIP4).
