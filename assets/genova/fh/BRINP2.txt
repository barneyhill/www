# BRINP2

## Overview
BRINP2, or Bone Morphogenetic Protein/Retinoic Acid-Inducible Neural-specific Protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the BRINP family, which is characterized by its involvement in neural-specific functions. The BRINP2 protein is a soluble secretory protein, notable for its lack of a transmembrane domain and the presence of an NH2-terminal signal peptide, which suggests its role in membrane targeting and secretion (Kawano2004Identification). It contains a Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) domain, a putative Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding domain, and is rich in cysteine residues, although it lacks a clearly defined domain structure (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). BRINP2 is highly conserved across species such as humans, mice, and rats, and is predominantly expressed in neuronal cells, where it plays a crucial role in neurogenesis and cell cycle regulation (Kawano2004Identification; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). The gene's expression is linked to various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, as well as certain non-neuronal conditions, highlighting its broad clinical significance (Berkowicz2016Mice; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental).

## Structure
BRINP2 is a protein that belongs to the Bone Morphogenetic Protein/Retinoic Acid-Inducible Neural-specific Proteins (BRINPs) family. It contains a cleavable signal sequence followed by a Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) domain, which spans approximately one-third of the protein and is crucial for its function, although its role in pore formation is unclear (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). The protein also has a putative Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding domain, and the remainder of the protein is cysteine-rich but lacks an obvious domain structure. A C-terminus coiled-coil domain has been suggested but not confirmed (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental).

BRINP2 is highly conserved among humans, mice, and rats, showing about 95% identity across these species (Kawano2004Identification). The protein is composed of 760 to 783 amino acid residues and shares 70% identity with BRINP3 and 50% identity with BRINP1 (Kawano2004Identification). It is predicted to be a soluble secretory protein due to the absence of a transmembrane domain and the presence of an NH2-terminal signal peptide, which suggests membrane targeting and secretion (Kawano2004Identification). BRINP2 undergoes N-glycosylation, with high mannose type oligosaccharides, indicating post-translational modifications (Kawano2004Identification).

## Function
BRINP2 is a neural-specific gene that plays a significant role in the regulation of cell cycle progression, particularly at the G1/S transition, as demonstrated in NIH-3T3 cells (Kawano2004Identification). It is predominantly expressed in neuronal cells within the central and peripheral nervous systems and is involved in neurogenesis and cell cycle control (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). BRINP2 expression is associated with the maturation and phenotype determination of sympathetic neurons, with its expression being increased by nerve growth factor (NGF) (Kawano2004Identification).

In terms of subcellular localization, BRINP2 is found in the cytoplasmic space, particularly in granular structures overlapping with the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating its involvement in neural differentiation (Kawano2004Identification). The protein undergoes N-glycosylation, a post-translational modification necessary for its proper function (Kawano2004Identification).

BRINP2 is expressed in specific regions of the adult brain, such as the olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and hippocampus, suggesting its role in region-specific functions (Kawano2004Identification). Its expression patterns during development and in adult brains indicate a potential role in neuronal development and function, although the specific function in healthy human cells remains to be fully determined (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BRINP2 gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The BRINP2 gene, located at the 1q25.2 locus, is linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), microencephaly, and mental retardation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have suggested that mutations in BRINP2 are linked to substance abuse and reward dependence, indicating a potential role in dopaminergic reward systems and addiction (Berkowicz2016Mice; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). In mice, the deletion of BRINP2 results in hyperactivity, which may model ADHD in humans, particularly those with alterations at the 1q25.2 locus (Berkowicz2016Mice).

BRINP2 is also implicated in non-neuronal conditions. Overexpression of BRINP2 has been linked to oral squamous cell carcinoma and coronary heart disease, highlighting its potential role in these diseases (Berkowicz2016Mice). The gene's expression patterns suggest it plays a role in neurodevelopmental processes, with its expression in differentiated neurons within the mouse cerebral and cerebellar cortices during development (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). These findings underscore the clinical significance of BRINP2 in both neurological and non-neurological conditions.
