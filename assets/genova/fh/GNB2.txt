# GNB2

## Overview
The GNB2 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 2 (Gβ2), a critical component of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex involved in signal transduction. This protein is categorized as a signaling molecule and plays a pivotal role in transmitting signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to various downstream effectors. Structurally, Gβ2 forms a propeller-like arrangement essential for its interaction with other proteins within the G-protein complex, including Gα and Gγ subunits (Stallmeyer2017A). Functionally, Gβ2 is integral to the regulation of cardiac ion channels, particularly the G-protein activated K+ channel, which is crucial for heart rate modulation (Stallmeyer2017A). Beyond its role in cardiac physiology, GNB2 is involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways, influencing processes such as immune response and cell migration (Fjær2021A; Block2016Gnb). Mutations in GNB2 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cardiac dysfunctions, cancer, and neurological disorders, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Fjær2021A; Zhang2024A).

## Structure
The GNB2 gene encodes the G-protein subunit beta 2 (Gβ2), which is a component of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex involved in signal transduction. The Gβ2 protein forms a propeller-like structure composed of seven blades, each consisting of a β-sheet made up of four antiparallel β-strands (Stallmeyer2017A). This structural arrangement is crucial for its function and interaction with other proteins.

The GNB2 protein's tertiary structure involves the folding of these β-sheets into a three-dimensional propeller shape, which is essential for its role in the G-protein complex. The quaternary structure of Gβ2 involves its assembly with G-protein γ- and α-subunits, although the Arg52Leu mutation does not affect its binding to these subunits (Stallmeyer2017A).

The GNB2 protein is also involved in forming a stable dimer with the Gγ subunit, which is important for its function in signal transduction pathways (Stallmeyer2017A). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in modulating ion channel activity, particularly in cardiac tissues, where mutations can lead to altered channel activation and associated cardiac dysfunctions (Stallmeyer2017A).

## Function
The GNB2 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 2 (Gβ2), which is a component of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex involved in signal transduction. This complex is composed of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits and plays a crucial role in transmitting signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to downstream effectors. In healthy human cells, Gβ2 is involved in the regulation of heart rate by modulating cardiac ion channels, specifically the G-protein activated K+ channel (GIRK; Kir3.1/Kir3.4). This channel is important for maintaining the myocellular membrane potential and controlling the spontaneous activity of pacemaker cells in the heart (Stallmeyer2017A).

The Gβ2 subunit, as part of the Gβγ dimer, directly activates the inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK), which mediates the acetylcholine-dependent potassium current (IK,ACh). This activation is part of the parasympathetic nervous system's effect on slowing down the heart rate (Stallmeyer2017A). The GNB2 gene is expressed in various human heart tissues, including the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, and is crucial for the proper functioning of the heart's conduction system (Stallmeyer2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GNB2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, GNB2 is notably overexpressed in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and rectal adenocarcinoma (READ), where its high expression levels are associated with poor prognosis. The gene's expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, showing a positive correlation with CD8+ T cells in LIHC and a negative correlation in READ (Zhang2024A). GNB2 is also linked to glioma, where its high expression is associated with poor survival outcomes, particularly in patients with IDH wildtype and high M2 macrophage infiltration (Cai2021A).

In the context of Sturge-Weber syndrome, a novel somatic mutation in GNB2, specifically the K78E mutation, has been identified. This mutation affects the G-protein beta subunit and is associated with the classical phenotype of the syndrome, potentially through altered YAP signaling pathways (Fjær2021A). The mutation enhances cell migration and affects endothelial cell behavior, contributing to the vascular malformations characteristic of the syndrome (Fjær2021A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GNB2 in both oncological and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
GNB2, or G protein subunit beta 2, is involved in various protein interactions as part of the heterotrimeric G protein complex. It forms a stable dimer with Gγ subunits, such as Gγ2, and interacts with Gα subunits like Gαi2, playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways (Stallmeyer2017A; Clapham1997G). GNB2 is also known to interact with a wide range of effectors and regulators, including adenylyl cyclase isoforms, phospholipase C β2 and β3, and inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Lin2011Understanding).

The GNB2 subunit is part of the Gβγ complex that directly activates the G-protein activated inward rectifying potassium channels (GIRK), which are essential for heart rate modulation (Stallmeyer2017A). A mutation in GNB2, specifically Gβ2-Arg52Leu, has been shown to enhance GIRK channel activity, indicating a gain-of-function effect that impacts cardiac electrophysiology (Stallmeyer2017A).

In neutrophils, GNB2 is involved in a signaling pathway that includes interactions with Rac1 and phospholipase C β isoforms, leading to LFA-1 activation and neutrophil arrest, which are critical for immune responses (Block2016Gnb). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of GNB2 in cellular signaling and physiological processes.
