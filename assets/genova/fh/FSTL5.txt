# FSTL5

## Overview
FSTL5 is a gene that encodes the protein follistatin-like 5, which is a member of the SPARC family of acidic cysteine-rich secreted glycoproteins. This protein is characterized by its structural similarities to follistatin, including the presence of a follistatin-like module and a Kazal-like domain, which are indicative of its role as a serine protease inhibitor (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). Follistatin-like 5 is involved in various cellular processes, such as apoptosis and cellular signaling, and is active in the extracellular matrix where it influences cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). The gene's expression is noted in several tissues, including the central nervous system, although its precise physiological roles remain to be fully elucidated (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike; Masuda2014Follistatin‐like). FSTL5 has been implicated in various diseases, including certain cancers, where its expression levels can serve as a prognostic marker, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2018Follistatin‐like; Remke2011FSTL5).

## Structure
FSTL5 is a member of the SPARC family of proteins and shares structural similarities with follistatin. The protein is composed of 847 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 93 kDa (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). Its molecular architecture includes an N-terminal domain, a follistatin-like module, and a Kazal-like domain, which is characteristic of serine protease inhibitors (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). FSTL5 also contains one or two EF-hand domains and an immunoglobulin-like domain, which are involved in intercellular interactions (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike).

The protein's domain organization includes a cysteine-rich follistatin module and a Kazal domain, which are typical features of follistatin-like proteins (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). The C-terminal part of FSTL5 often contains an immunoglobulin-like domain or a von Willebrand factor C-like domain (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available literature, the presence of these domains suggests a complex structure that facilitates its role in cellular signaling and interactions. The article does not provide specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for FSTL5 (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike).

## Function
Follistatin-like 5 (FSTL5) is a protein that is part of the SPARC family of acidic cysteine-rich secreted glycoproteins. It shares structural similarities with follistatin, including domains involved in intercellular interactions, such as a Kazal-like domain and a follistatin-like module (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). FSTL5 is involved in cellular signaling pathways and is thought to play a role in apoptosis through a caspase-dependent mechanism, as its overexpression increases levels of cleaved activated caspases-3, -8, and -9 (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike).

The protein is active in the extracellular matrix, where it influences cellular interactions and signaling pathways, impacting processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). FSTL5 is expressed in various tissues, including the central nervous system, where it may play a role in maintaining specific functions, although its precise role in healthy human cells remains unclear (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike; Masuda2014Follistatin‐like). Despite its involvement in these processes, the full extent of FSTL5's functions in normal physiological conditions is not yet fully understood, highlighting the need for further research (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike).

## Clinical Significance
The FSTL5 gene has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In medulloblastoma, particularly in non-WNT/non-SHH subgroups, FSTL5 is overexpressed in group C tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. High FSTL5 expression correlates with unfavorable outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival, and is linked to high-risk molecular markers such as 17p loss, 17q gain, and CDK6 amplification (Remke2011FSTL5). 

Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FSTL5 expression is downregulated, and higher levels of FSTL5 are associated with a favorable prognosis. FSTL5 inhibits HCC growth through caspase-dependent apoptosis and regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2018Follistatin‐like). 

FSTL5 has also been studied in the context of thiopurine-related bone marrow toxicity in inflammatory bowel disease patients, where it may interact with metalloproteases at the extracellular matrix level, although its specific role remains unclear (Zabala2013New). These findings highlight the diverse roles of FSTL5 in different cancers and its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.
