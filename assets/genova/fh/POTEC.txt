# POTEC

## Overview
POTEC is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member C, which is part of the POTE gene family known for its involvement in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by structural domains such as ankyrin repeats, a cysteine-rich region, and spectrin-like α-helices, which suggest its role in protein-protein interactions and potential association with cell membranes (Sharma2019Epigenetic; Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). These features indicate that POTEC may play a significant role in cellular dynamics, particularly in cancer biology, where it is implicated in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance (Sharma2019Epigenetic; Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Additionally, genetic variants near POTEC have been linked to inflammatory conditions such as asthma, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Edris2023Asthma).

## Structure
The POTEC protein is part of the POTE gene family, which is characterized by specific structural domains that suggest its involvement in protein-protein interactions and association with cell membranes. The protein includes an N-terminal cysteine-rich region, central ankyrin repeats, and C-terminal spectrin-like α-helices (Sharma2019Epigenetic; Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). These structural features are indicative of its potential role in cellular processes, possibly involving interactions with other proteins or cellular structures.

The ankyrin repeat domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which may be crucial for the protein's function in cancer biology (Barger2018Expression). Some POTE proteins, including POTEC, may also have a C-terminal fusion with an actin gene, forming a chimeric protein that could influence its localization and function within the cell (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

While specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of POTEC are not provided, the presence of these domains suggests a complex structure that supports its functional roles. The protein's structure may also be subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could further modulate its activity and interactions.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The POTEC gene, a member of the POTE gene family, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression patterns. In breast cancer, including HER2-positive, triple-negative, and non-triple-negative subtypes, as well as in esophageal adenocarcinoma, POTEC is significantly up-regulated, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The gene is also overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer, particularly in high-grade serous carcinoma, where its expression is linked to chemoresistance and reduced survival rates (Sharma2019Epigenetic).

Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA hypomethylation, have been associated with increased POTEC expression in ovarian cancer, indicating that these changes may contribute to its oncogenic potential (Sharma2019Epigenetic). The gene's expression is also linked to the activation state of pericentromeric DNA, with hypomethylation of specific CpG sites in its promoter region correlating with higher expression levels (Sharma2019Epigenetic).

In asthma, a genetic variant near POTEC, rs8095133, has been associated with asthma exacerbations, suggesting a potential role in inflammatory conditions (Edris2023Asthma). These findings highlight POTEC's potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in cancer and other diseases.
