# ALDH3A2

## Overview
The ALDH3A2 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A2, also known as fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), which is a critical component of lipid metabolism. This enzyme is involved in the oxidation of long-chain fatty aldehydes to fatty acids, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of toxic aldehydes. ALDH3A2 is a membrane-bound enzyme, primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, and functions as a homodimer with distinct catalytic, cofactor-binding, and oligomerization domains. Mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene are associated with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, intellectual disability, and spasticity, due to the impaired metabolism of fatty aldehydes and alcohols (Weustenfeld2018Genotype; Rizzo2007Sjögren–Larsson).

## Structure
The ALDH3A2 gene encodes the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) enzyme, which is crucial for the metabolism of long-chain fatty aldehydes. The primary structure of ALDH3A2 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by 11 exons located on chromosome 17 (17p11.2) (Udhaya2020Comprehensive). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with a notable 'gatekeeper' helix spanning residues Ser446 to Leu456, which is essential for substrate specificity (Rajeshwari2021Novel; Keller2014A).

The tertiary structure of ALDH3A2 forms a globular shape, featuring a deep funnel-like formation at the interface of the catalytic and cofactor-binding domains, which is crucial for substrate selectivity (Udhaya2020Comprehensive). The enzyme's quaternary structure is a homodimer, with each subunit containing a cofactor-binding domain, a catalytic domain, and an oligomerization domain (Udhaya2020Comprehensive; Keller2014A).

ALDH3A2 is a membrane-bound enzyme, anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum or peroxisomes via a hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain (Keller2014A). The enzyme may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has splice variant isoforms that can result in different functional properties (Udhaya2020Comprehensive).

## Function
The ALDH3A2 gene encodes the enzyme fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), which is crucial for the oxidation of fatty aldehydes to fatty acids. This enzyme plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the conversion of fatty alcohols to fatty acids, a process essential for maintaining normal cellular function and preventing the accumulation of toxic aldehydes (Rajeshwari2021Novel; Rizzo2007Sjögren–Larsson). FALDH is a membrane-associated homo-oligomeric NAD+-dependent enzyme, composed of three subdomains: a cofactor-binding domain, a catalytic domain, and an oligomerization domain, which are critical for its function and substrate specificity (Rajeshwari2021Novel).

In healthy human cells, FALDH is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, where it is involved in the metabolism of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols (Rajeshwari2021Novel; Rizzo2007Sjögren–Larsson). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the ω-oxidation of eicosanoids, such as leukotriene B4, and the metabolism of sphingolipids and isoprenoid alcohols (Rizzo2007Sjögren–Larsson). This activity helps prevent the accumulation of toxic aldehydes, supporting normal epidermal differentiation and nervous system function (Rizzo2007Sjögren–Larsson).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene, which encodes the enzyme fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), are responsible for Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS), a rare autosomal recessive neurocutaneous disorder. This condition is characterized by a triad of symptoms: ichthyosis, intellectual disability, and spasticity (Weustenfeld2018Genotype; Rizzo2005SjögrenLarsson). The mutations lead to a deficiency in FALDH, resulting in the accumulation of toxic fatty aldehydes and alcohols in the skin and brain, which disrupts normal cellular functions and contributes to the clinical manifestations of SLS (Didona2007Novel; Rizzo2007Sjögren–Larsson).

Over 70 mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene have been identified, including missense mutations, deletions, and splice-site mutations, which significantly reduce enzyme activity (Rizzo2005SjögrenLarsson; Rizzo2007Sjögren–Larsson). These mutations can lead to the formation of harmful adducts with proteins and lipids, further exacerbating the symptoms of SLS (Weustenfeld2018Genotype). The disease exhibits a wide range of clinical features, and the severity of symptoms can vary between individuals, complicating genotype-phenotype correlations (Weustenfeld2018Genotype). Current treatments are limited to symptomatic management, highlighting the need for further research into targeted therapies (Weustenfeld2018Genotype).
