# STEAP3

## Overview
STEAP3 is a gene that encodes the STEAP3 metalloreductase, a transmembrane protein primarily involved in iron metabolism. This protein plays a critical role in the erythroid transferrin cycle by reducing ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+), facilitating iron uptake in erythroid precursor cells. Structurally, STEAP3 metalloreductase is characterized by an N-terminal cytosolic oxidoreductase domain and a C-terminal heme-containing transmembrane domain, which are essential for its function as a ferrireductase (Sendamarai2008Structure). Beyond its role in iron homeostasis, STEAP3 is implicated in exosome secretion and is regulated by the p53 pathway, influencing cellular communication and immune function (Lespagnol2008Exosome). The gene's expression and mutations have been associated with various clinical conditions, including cardiac hypertrophy, cancer, and hereditary anemias, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Wu2022STEAP3; Li2020STEAP3; Liu2016Human).

## Structure
The human STEAP3 protein, also known as STEAP3 metalloreductase, is a key component in the erythroid transferrin cycle, primarily involved in the reduction of ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+). Structurally, STEAP3 is characterized by a unique combination of domains. It features an N-terminal cytosolic oxidoreductase domain and a C-terminal heme-containing transmembrane domain. The oxidoreductase domain is similar to the archaeal oxidoreductase FNO and is predicted to utilize flavin derivatives such as FMN or FAD as cofactors (Sendamarai2008Structure).

The primary structure of STEAP3 includes specific amino acid sequences that facilitate its function. The secondary structure comprises a six-stranded parallel β-sheet and five α-helices in the nucleotide-binding domain, along with a smaller C-terminal subdomain that includes a short α-helix followed by a β-α-β supersecondary structure (Sendamarai2008Structure). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, forming a dimer interface that is crucial for its function. This dimer interface is relatively small and involves both hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues (Sendamarai2008Structure).

STEAP3 can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with the dimer formation being reversible. The dimeric form is essential for its function in electron transfer, as it facilitates the transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH to the heme moiety in the transmembrane domain (Sendamarai2008Structure). The protein's structure and function are distinct from other known eukaryotic reductases, highlighting its specialized role in iron homeostasis (Sendamarai2008Structure).

## Function
STEAP3, also known as TSAP6, is a crucial protein involved in iron metabolism, particularly in erythroid precursor cells. It functions as a ferrireductase, reducing ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+) within erythrocyte endosomes. This reduction is essential for the transferrin cycle, the primary mechanism for iron uptake in erythroid cells, facilitating the transport of iron across the endosomal membrane by divalent metal iron transporter 1 (DMT1) (Sendamarai2008Structure). STEAP3 is characterized by an N-terminal cytosolic oxidoreductase domain and a C-terminal heme-containing transmembrane domain, utilizing flavin derivatives like FMN or FAD as cofactors for electron transfer from cytosolic NADPH to endosomal Fe3+ (Sendamarai2008Structure).

In addition to its role in iron metabolism, STEAP3 is involved in exosome secretion, regulated by the p53 pathway. It facilitates the secretion of proteins such as the translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) through the nonclassical exosomal pathway, which is significant for cellular communication and immune function (Lespagnol2008Exosome). The absence of STEAP3 leads to impaired exosomal expulsion of transferrin receptors, affecting reticulocyte maturation and resulting in microcytic anemia (Lespagnol2008Exosome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the STEAP3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of cardiac health, STEAP3 acts as a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Its downregulation is associated with exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, as observed in STEAP3 knockout mice subjected to pressure overload (Li2020STEAP3). In cancer, STEAP3 expression is upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and is associated with poor prognosis. It contributes to tumor progression by influencing iron metabolism and the tumor microenvironment, promoting immune evasion and metastasis (Wu2022STEAP3). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), higher STEAP3 expression correlates with poorer patient outcomes, making it a potential prognostic marker (Yuan2023Upregulation).

STEAP3 mutations are also implicated in hereditary microcytic anemias, such as congenital sideroblastic anemia, due to impaired ferrireductase activity necessary for iron uptake in erythroblasts. Despite the presence of loss-of-function mutations, some carriers do not exhibit significant hematologic changes, suggesting compensatory mechanisms may exist (Liu2016Human). In liver hepatocellular carcinoma, STEAP3 is downregulated and may act as a tumor suppressor by enhancing apoptosis and influencing immune regulation (Yan2021Downregulated).

## Interactions
STEAP3, also known as STEAP3 metalloreductase, participates in several protein interactions that influence its function in various biological processes. In the context of cardiac hypertrophy, STEAP3 interacts directly with Rac1, a small GTPase, to suppress the activation of the MEK-ERK signaling cascade. This interaction is crucial for its role in inhibiting pathological cardiac hypertrophy, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Li2020STEAP3).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, STEAP3 facilitates the nuclear trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), enhancing the RAC1-ERK-STAT3 signaling pathway. This interaction is significant for cancer cell proliferation, as STEAP3 complexes with EGFR in the nuclear membrane and nucleoplasm, promoting EGFR-mediated STAT3 transactivity (Wang2021STEAP3).

STEAP3, also known as TSAP6, is involved in exosome secretion and is regulated by the p53 pathway. It interacts with proteins such as Nix, a proapoptotic Bcl2 family member, and Myt1 kinase, a negative regulator of the G2/M transition. These interactions are essential for the nonclassical pathway of protein secretion, including exosome-mediated transport (Lespagnol2008Exosome).
