# MMP19

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 19 (MMP19) is a gene that encodes the protein matrix metallopeptidase 19, a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family. This family of enzymes is known for its role in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is crucial for various physiological processes such as tissue repair, angiogenesis, and cellular migration. MMP19 is characterized by its modular structure, including a catalytic domain essential for its enzymatic activity and a hemopexin-like domain involved in substrate recognition and binding (Mysliwy2006Structural; Caterina2000Characterization). The protein is expressed as a zymogen and requires activation through proteolytic cleavage. MMP19 is involved in normal tissue restructuring and has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer, fibrosis, and inflammatory diseases, where its expression levels and activity can influence disease progression and prognosis (Zhao2023Endothelial; Chen2019High; Impola2002Matrix).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 19 (MMP-19) is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, characterized by a modular structure that includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, a catalytic domain, and a hemopexin-like domain. The catalytic domain contains the MMP consensus sequence (HEXGHXXGXXH) essential for zinc ion coordination, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Caterina2000Characterization). The hemopexin-like domain is involved in substrate recognition and binding, and it can bind calcium ions, which induce conformational changes and enhance thermal stability (Mysliwy2006Structural).

The hemopexin-like domain of MMP-19 typically exhibits a -propeller structure with four hemopexin-type repeats forming a funnel-like channel, serving as an ion-binding site (Mysliwy2006Structural). This domain can also bind insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), facilitating the release of IGF-1, a growth factor (Mysliwy2006Structural). The presence of calcium ions affects the conformation and stability of the hemopexin-like domain, as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Mysliwy2006Structural).

MMP-19 is expressed as a zymogen and requires proteolytic cleavage for activation. The propeptide domain contains a cysteine residue that maintains the enzyme in an inactive state until cleavage occurs (Massova1998Matrix). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, although specific sites and their conservation between species vary (Caterina2000Characterization).

## Function
MMP19, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 19, is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family involved in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membranes. In healthy human cells, MMP19 plays a crucial role in tissue remodeling, particularly in areas of high cell proliferation and during epithelial repair. It is expressed by proliferating epithelial cells and is associated with normal tissue restructuring rather than tumor progression (Impola2002Matrix).

MMP19 is involved in the restructuring of the basement membrane and ECM, coexpressed with type IV collagen, and found in areas where the basement membrane is partially destroyed. It degrades several ECM components, including type IV collagen, laminin-1, nidogen, tenascin-C, and fibronectin, which are essential for maintaining tissue architecture (Bister2004Differential; Impola2002Matrix).

In addition to its role in ECM remodeling, MMP19 is involved in angiogenesis. It processes plasminogen to generate angiostatin-like fragments, which inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and reduce capillary-like structure formation, suggesting an anti-angiogenic function (Brauer2011Matrix). MMP19's activity is regulated by environmental signals such as growth factors and cytokines, indicating its involvement in cell proliferation and transformation (Impola2002Matrix).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of MMP19 have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and fibrotic conditions. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), MMP19 acts as a tumor suppressor and is significantly down-regulated in a large percentage of NPC tissues and cell lines. This down-regulation is associated with tumor progression and is attributed to mechanisms such as loss of heterozygosity and promoter hypermethylation, which lead to its silencing (Chan2011Catalytic).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), high expression of MMP19 is linked to poor prognosis, with increased levels associated with shorter overall survival and recurrence-free survival. This suggests that MMP19 could serve as a prognostic biomarker in CRC (Chen2019High; Yu2021Comprehensive).

MMP19 is also involved in pulmonary fibrosis, where its upregulation in endothelial cells contributes to disease progression by promoting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and monocyte infiltration. This exacerbates fibrosis, highlighting MMP19 as a potential therapeutic target (Zhao2023Endothelial).

In inflammatory bowel disease, particularly colitis, MMP19 deficiency leads to aggravated disease due to defects in innate immune cell function and compromised epithelial barriers (Brauer2016MMP19).

## Interactions
MMP19 interacts with several proteins and pathways, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with endothelin-1 (ET1), a marker of endothelial cell injury, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies. This interaction is associated with increased endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (E(nd)MT) and vascular permeability, contributing to pulmonary fibrosis (Zhao2023Endothelial). MMP19 also interacts with the SDF1/CXCR4 axis, facilitating monocyte adhesion and infiltration, which exacerbates fibrosis. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the interaction between MMP19 and SDF1, with confocal analysis showing their colocalization in endothelial cells (Zhao2023Endothelial).

The hemopexin-like domain of MMP19 is involved in substrate recognition and has been shown to bind calcium, which induces conformational changes and increases thermal stability. This domain also associates with the cell surface of macrophages, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes, suggesting its role in MMP19's interactions and activities (Mysliwy2006Structural). Additionally, MMP19 interacts with insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), processing it to release IGF-1, which promotes keratinocyte proliferation (Mysliwy2006Structural). These interactions highlight MMP19's involvement in cellular migration, invasion, and extracellular matrix remodeling.
