# CDK5RAP2

## Overview
The CDK5RAP2 gene encodes the CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 2, a centrosomal protein that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and centrosome function. This protein is integral to maintaining centriole engagement and cohesion, ensuring proper centriole duplication and genomic stability. It is involved in recruiting the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to the centrosome, which is essential for microtubule nucleation and spindle pole formation during mitosis. CDK5RAP2 also interacts with various proteins, including EB1 and components of the Hippo signaling pathway, influencing microtubule dynamics and centrosomal integrity. Mutations in the CDK5RAP2 gene are linked to primary autosomal recessive microcephaly type 3 (MCPH3) and other developmental anomalies, highlighting its significance in neural progenitor cell proliferation and brain development (Barrera2010CDK5RAP2; Sukumaran2016CDK5RAP2; Issa2012CDK5RAP2).

## Structure
The CDK5RAP2 protein is composed of 1,893 amino acids and features several key domains that contribute to its function. It contains a microtubule-binding domain located at residues 59-133, which is crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics (Kim2011Novel). The protein also includes two structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) domains, found in the N-terminal (residues 137-470) and C-terminal (residues 1,399-1,646) regions, which are involved in maintaining chromosome structure (Kim2011Novel). Additionally, CDK5RAP2 has a p35 interacting domain at residues 1,682-1,827 (Kim2011Novel).

The protein is predicted to predominantly contain coiled-coil domains, suggesting a filamentous structure typical of pericentriolar matrix scaffold proteins (Kraemer2011What’s). It also features a γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC)-binding site near the N terminus, an EB1-binding domain, and a CDK5R1-interaction domain (Sukumaran2016CDK5RAP2). The C-terminal region includes a Cnn Motif 2 (CM2) domain for Golgi complex interaction and binding to calmodulin (Kraemer2011What’s).

CDK5RAP2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in four known isoforms, each lacking specific exons, which may influence its functional roles (Kraemer2011What’s). The protein is subject to co- and post-translational modifications, leading to isoforms with different molecular weights, such as 70, 90, 105, and 230 kDa (Kraemer2011What’s).

## Function
The CDK5RAP2 gene encodes a centrosomal protein that plays a critical role in several cellular processes, particularly in cell cycle regulation and centrosome function. In healthy human cells, CDK5RAP2 is essential for maintaining centriole engagement and cohesion, which are crucial for proper centriole duplication and centrosome function. This ensures that centriole duplication occurs only once per cell cycle, preventing centriole amplification and maintaining genomic stability (Barrera2010CDK5RAP2).

CDK5RAP2 is involved in the recruitment of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to the centrosome, which is vital for microtubule nucleation and spindle pole formation during mitosis. This function is critical for proper spindle orientation and chromosome segregation, thereby ensuring mitotic fidelity (Megraw2011Cdk5rap2; Lizarraga2010Cdk5rap2). The protein also interacts with EB1, a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, to regulate microtubule dynamics and stability, which is important for cell polarization and directional movement (Kraemer2011What’s).

CDK5RAP2 is active at the centrosome and is involved in the assembly of the pericentriolar matrix (PCM) and mitotic microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). It plays a role in the spindle checkpoint function, interacting with proteins like CDC20 to ensure proper chromosome segregation during mitosis (Megraw2011Cdk5rap2; Kraemer2011What’s).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDK5RAP2 gene are associated with primary autosomal recessive microcephaly (MCPH), specifically type 3 (MCPH3). This condition is characterized by a significant reduction in brain volume, particularly affecting the cerebral cortex, and is accompanied by intellectual disability (Issa2012CDK5RAP2; Issa2013Clinical). The pathomechanism involves a premature shift from symmetric to asymmetric neural progenitor-cell divisions, leading to a depletion of the progenitor pool and a reduction in the final number of neurons (Issa2012CDK5RAP2). 

CDK5RAP2 mutations have also been linked to neurosensory defects, including small cochlea with incomplete partition type II, progressive deafness, microphthalmia with retinal pigmentation changes, and hypothalamic anomalies such as interhypothalamic adhesions (Nasser2020CDK5RAP2). These findings suggest that CDK5RAP2 plays a role in ocular and cochlear development and is necessary for hypothalamic nuclear separation (Nasser2020CDK5RAP2). 

In addition to microcephaly, some patients with CDK5RAP2 mutations exhibit Seckel-like microcephalic dwarfism, feeding difficulties, skin pigmentation changes, seizures, and deafness (Nasser2020CDK5RAP2). The gene's interaction with the Hippo signaling pathway, particularly with the transcriptional regulator TAZ and the kinase MST1, may also contribute to the pathology of MCPH (Sukumaran2016CDK5RAP2).

## Interactions
CDK5RAP2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in microtubule dynamics and centrosome function. It binds to EB1, a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, through a basic and Ser-rich motif. This interaction is essential for CDK5RAP2's localization to microtubule tips and its role in regulating microtubule dynamics. The EB1-binding motif in CDK5RAP2 is conserved in certain mammals, such as chimpanzees, bovines, and dogs, but not in rats and mice (Fong2009Interaction; Kraemer2011What’s). 

CDK5RAP2 also interacts with the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) at the centrosome, which is crucial for microtubule nucleation and organization. This interaction involves specific components of the γ-TuRC, including γ-tubulin and GCP3, and is necessary for maintaining organized microtubule networks (Fong2024Functional).

In the context of the Hippo signaling pathway, CDK5RAP2 binds to MST1, potentially serving as an anchoring point for the kinase, which affects centrosome function. This interaction is significant for centrosomal integrity and may influence brain size by affecting YAP/TAZ-dependent proliferative signaling in neural progenitor cells (Sukumaran2016CDK5RAP2).
