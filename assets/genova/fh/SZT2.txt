# SZT2

## Overview
The SZT2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the KICSTOR complex, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This protein, known as the SZT2 subunit, functions primarily as a scaffolding protein, facilitating the localization of the KICSTOR complex to lysosomes and interacting with the GATOR1 complex to modulate mTORC1 activity. The SZT2 subunit is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring that mTORC1 is activated only under nutrient-rich conditions, thereby preventing unwarranted cellular growth and proliferation (Nakamura2019Constitutive; Calhoun2021Determining). The gene is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and is implicated in protecting neuronal cells from oxidative stress (Trivisano2020Developmental). Mutations in SZT2 are linked to various neurological disorders, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, highlighting its clinical significance (Luo2023SZT2).

## Structure


## Function
The SZT2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the KICSTOR complex, which plays a significant role in regulating the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for cellular growth, metabolism, and autophagy. In healthy human cells, SZT2 functions as a scaffolding protein that localizes the KICSTOR complex to lysosomes, where it interacts with the GATOR1 complex to inhibit mTORC1 activity under nutrient-deprived conditions. This regulation ensures that mTORC1 is activated only when nutrients are sufficient, preventing unnecessary cell growth and proliferation (Nakamura2019Constitutive; Calhoun2021Determining).

SZT2 is widely expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the parietal and frontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and dorsal root ganglia. It is hypothesized to play a protective role against oxidative stress in neuronal cells (Trivisano2020Developmental). The proper function of SZT2 is crucial for maintaining normal mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, as it is involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activities, which are essential for ATP production and energy homeostasis (Uittenbogaard2018Novel). Dysregulation of SZT2 can lead to neurological disorders, including epilepsy and developmental delays (Luo2023SZT2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SZT2 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). These conditions are characterized by early-onset epilepsy, intellectual disability, macrocephaly, and dysmorphic facial features. Patients often exhibit abnormalities in the corpus callosum and cortical migration disorders (Muthaffar2023Insight; Trivisano2020Developmental). The SZT2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the KICSTOR complex, which negatively regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Disruption of this pathway due to SZT2 mutations can lead to hyperactivation of mTORC1, affecting cellular processes such as ciliogenesis, endocytosis, and mitochondrial function, contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Luo2023SZT2; Cattelani2022Induced).

Clinical manifestations of SZT2-related disorders include a spectrum of seizure types, developmental delays, and hypotonia. Seizures often begin within the first year of life and can be resistant to standard anti-seizure medications (Muthaffar2023Insight; Trivisano2020Developmental). The phenotypic spectrum varies, with some patients experiencing mild intellectual disability without epilepsy, while others suffer from severe DEE (Luo2023SZT2). The genotype-phenotype correlation suggests that biallelic null mutations are associated with more severe phenotypes compared to biallelic missense variants (Luo2023SZT2).

## Interactions
The SZT2 gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the KICSTOR complex, which includes KPTN, ITFG2, and C12orf66. This complex plays a crucial role in regulating mTORC1 signaling by interacting with the GATOR1 complex, which consists of DEPDC5, NPRL2, and NPRL3. SZT2 facilitates the recruitment of GATOR1 to the lysosomal surface, where it acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RRAGA/B, thereby inhibiting mTORC1 activity (Seibert2021Amino; Nakamura2019Constitutive).

SZT2's interaction with the GATOR1 complex is mediated through a specific structural domain within the SZT2 protein, which is essential for its function in mTORC1 regulation (Luo2023SZT2). The loss of SZT2 disrupts the interaction between GATOR1 and the KICSTOR complex, leading to constitutive activation of mTORC1 signaling, which is implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders (Nakamura2019Constitutive; Trivisano2020Developmental).

The KICSTOR complex, with SZT2 as a linker, is also involved in the interaction with RRAG GTPases, which are crucial for mTORC1 inhibition. This interaction highlights SZT2's role in the complex network of protein interactions that regulate cellular growth and metabolism (Seibert2021Amino).
