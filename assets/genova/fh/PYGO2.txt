# PYGO2

## Overview
PYGO2 is a gene that encodes the protein pygopus family PHD finger 2, which is a critical component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by its plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger motif, categorizing it as a transcriptional co-activator involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. PYGO2 plays a pivotal role in facilitating the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of Wnt target genes essential for cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and development (Shi2023Novel; Esposito2020PYGO2). The protein's interaction with histones and other chromatin-associated factors underscores its significance in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the context of tissue differentiation and oncogenesis (Wang2023Structural; Saxena2020A). Alterations in PYGO2 expression have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lu2018An; Saxena2020A).

## Structure
PYGO2 is a protein composed of 406 amino acids with a molecular mass of 41,244 Da. It is a member of the Pygopus family and contains two conserved domains: an N-terminal homology domain (NHD) and a C-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger motif. The NHD domain is crucial for transcriptional activation and is involved in the recruitment of histone modification factors, playing a role in histone methylation (Esposito2020PYGO2). The PHD finger, located between amino acids 327 to 385, is composed of 60 amino acids organized in C4HC3 motifs and is important for the formation of the PYGO2 PHD-BCL9-HD1 complex (Esposito2020PYGO2).

The N-terminal region of PYGO2 includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) from amino acids 41 to 47 and an NPF sequence that interacts with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling (Esposito2020PYGO2). The NPF motif is critical for its interaction with the LDB1-SSBP2 complex, forming part of the Wnt enhanceosome, which is essential for transcriptional activity (Wang2023Structural). The protein acts as a scaffold between β-catenin, HNMT, TMPRSS11D (HAT), and chromatin, and is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, playing a role in the nuclear retention of β-catenin (Esposito2020PYGO2).

## Function
PYGO2 is a key component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. The PYGO2 protein interacts with β-catenin, facilitating its nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of Wnt target genes. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin-LEF/TCF complex, which regulates gene expression necessary for developmental processes (Li2004Cloning; Shi2023Novel).

In the context of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs), PYGO2 promotes differentiation into cardiomyocyte-like cells. It enhances the expression of β-catenin and downstream components of the Wnt signaling pathway, such as TCF and Cyclin D1, indicating its role in the nuclear function of β-catenin (Shi2023Novel). PYGO2 also interacts with histones to form complexes that act as transcriptional co-factors, regulating gene expression through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway during the middle-late stages of differentiation (Shi2023Novel).

PYGO2 is active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation, playing a significant role in the differentiation and development of various tissues, including the heart and kidneys (Schwab2007Pygo1; Shi2023Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PYGO2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, PYGO2 is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis through its interaction with histones, particularly binding to H3K4me 2/3 marks. A mutation in the PHD domain of Pygo2, specifically A342E, disrupts this interaction, leading to smaller tumors and reduced metastasis in mouse models. This mutation also results in increased tumor differentiation, suggesting a dominant-negative function (Saxena2020A). PYGO2 expression is higher in primary tumors and metastatic lesions compared to normal breast tissue, indicating its role in malignant progression (Saxena2020A).

In prostate cancer, PYGO2 is identified as a driver of metastasis. Overexpression of PYGO2 is associated with increased tumor growth, invasion, and poor prognosis. It is located in a chromosomal region frequently amplified in advanced prostate cancer, correlating with higher Gleason scores and reduced survival rates (Lu2018An). PYGO2 also plays a role in glioma, where its overexpression correlates with poor overall survival and advanced tumor grades (Zhou2016Pygo2).

PYGO2's involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway is significant in these cancers, as it acts as a co-transcriptional activator, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Wang2023Structural).

## Interactions
PYGO2 interacts with several proteins and complexes, playing a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway. It is a component of the nuclear β-catenin transcriptional complex, where its ability to bind histones is crucial for the proper functioning of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This interaction enhances the signaling output of Wnt/β-catenin in mammary tumors (Saxena2020A). PYGO2 also interacts with the ChiLS complex, composed of LDB1 and SSBP2 proteins. The interaction involves three sets of contacts, including a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues from SSBP2 and LDB1 that interacts with the NPF motif of PYGO2. The PPP cluster and L72 of PYGO2 fit into a hydrophobic groove on SSBP2, and tight hydrogen bonds and salt bridges form between specific residues of PYGO2 and LDB1 (Wang2023Structural).

The interaction between PYGO2 and the ChiLS complex is crucial for the assembly of the Wnt enhanceosome. The N-terminus of PYGO2 contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and two conserved elements: a proline cluster (PPP) and an NPF motif, which are essential for its interaction with ChiLS (Wang2023Structural). These interactions are important for transcriptional activation and are potential targets for therapeutic drug discovery in cancer (Wang2023Structural).
