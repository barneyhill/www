# HPDL

## Overview
The HPDL gene encodes the protein 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like, which is primarily localized in the mitochondria and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function, particularly within the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. This protein is involved in maintaining the mitochondrial respiratory chain, specifically influencing the activity of complex II, which is essential for cellular energy metabolism (Sun2021HPDL). Although the precise enzymatic function of the HPDL protein remains to be fully elucidated, its structural similarities to the enzyme HPPD suggest a potential role in similar metabolic pathways (Wiessner2021Biallelic). HPDL is highly expressed in the nervous system, indicating its importance in neurological health, and mutations in this gene are associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, including hereditary spastic paraplegia (Wiessner2021Biallelic; Ghosh2021Biallelic).

## Structure
The HPDL gene encodes a protein composed of 371 amino acids, featuring a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and two vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) domains, which include three iron-binding sites (Ghosh2021Biallelic). The protein is predicted to contain two open beta-barrels, similar to the enzyme HPPD, with the carboxy-terminal domain suggested to possess the putative catalytic center (Wiessner2021Biallelic). The amino-terminal domain may play a role in dimer formation but does not have a direct catalytic function (Wiessner2021Biallelic).

HPDL is localized to the mitochondria, specifically the intermembrane space, as confirmed by immunofluorescence studies showing colocalization with mitochondrial markers (Ye20214Hydroxyphenylpyruvate). The protein's mitochondrial localization is supported by the presence of three TOMM20 recognition motifs and a region of maximum positively charged amphiphilicity, essential for mitochondrial presequence function (Ghosh2021Biallelic). The HPDL protein does not have reported alternative splice isoforms (Ghosh2021Biallelic).

While the specific enzymatic function of HPDL remains unknown, it shares sequence and structural similarities with its orthologue HPPD, suggesting they may metabolize similar substrates and share a conserved reaction mechanism (Wiessner2021Biallelic). Detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The HPDL gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in mitochondrial function, particularly in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway. It is involved in maintaining mitochondrial respiratory chain function by regulating electron transfer in complex II, without affecting its assembly, suggesting a post-assembly role (Sun2021HPDL). HPDL is localized in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, where it influences the activity of complex II, crucial for cellular energy metabolism (Sun2021HPDL). The protein is implicated in the formation or assembly of the iron-sulfur cluster in complex II, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Sun2021HPDL).

HPDL is expressed in various tissues, with particularly high expression in the nervous system, indicating its importance in neurological function (Wiessner2021Biallelic). The protein's mitochondrial localization and its involvement in mitochondrial processes suggest a role in energy metabolism and oxidative stress response, which are critical for maintaining healthy cellular function (Ghosh2021Biallelic). HPDL's function in healthy human cells is not fully understood, but its deficiency is linked to impaired mitochondrial respiration and neuromuscular disorders, highlighting its essential role in cellular and organismal health (Sun2021HPDL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HPDL gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily characterized by neurodegenerative and spastic movement phenotypes. Biallelic variants in HPDL have been linked to an infantile-onset neurodegenerative condition, presenting with symptoms such as spastic tetraplegia, microcephaly, brain atrophy, epilepsy, and severe intellectual and motor disabilities. Affected individuals often exhibit minimal psychomotor development and progressive neurological decline (Ghosh2021Biallelic).

HPDL mutations are also implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a condition marked by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from pure spastic paraplegia to more complicated forms involving additional neurological symptoms. The severity of the condition varies, with some individuals experiencing mild symptoms in late childhood and others facing severe developmental delays and infantile-onset spasticity (Wiessner2021Biallelic).

Research suggests that HPDL mutations may disrupt mitochondrial function, particularly affecting oxidative phosphorylation complex II activity. This disruption is linked to impaired mitochondrial respiratory function, contributing to the neuromuscular symptoms observed in patients (Sun2021HPDL). The gene's role in mitochondrial function and its expression in neural tissues underscore its significance in these neurological conditions (Wiessner2021Biallelic).
