# NUPR1

## Overview
NUPR1, or nuclear protein 1, is a gene that encodes an intrinsically disordered protein functioning as a transcriptional regulator. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in response to stress and in the progression of cancer. NUPR1 is characterized by its lack of stable secondary and tertiary structures, which allows it to interact flexibly with multiple molecular partners, including DNA and other proteins, without adopting a fixed conformation (Neira2019Dynamics; Bonucci2021Crowding). It contains a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that facilitates its role in transcriptional regulation (SantofimiaCastaño2017Intrinsically). The protein is implicated in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation, often through pathways such as the SMAD signaling pathway, and plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis, DNA repair, and stress adaptation (Pommier2012The; Lopez2015Functional). NUPR1's involvement in cancer, particularly in liver, pancreatic, breast, and colorectal cancers, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target due to its role in tumor progression and chemoresistance (Martin2021NUPR1; Emma2016NUPR1).

## Structure
NUPR1 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that lacks stable secondary and tertiary structures under physiological conditions. It is characterized by its high flexibility and disordered nature, which allows it to adopt various conformations upon binding to different partners (Neira2019Dynamics; Bonucci2021Crowding). The protein does not exhibit a well-defined structure in aqueous solutions, as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies, which show that NUPR1 behaves like a polymer coil with a flexible, unfolded conformation (Neira2019Dynamics; Bonucci2021Crowding).

NUPR1 contains a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with DNA and other proteins. This domain contributes to its role in transcriptional regulation (SantofimiaCastaño2017Intrinsically). The protein's intrinsically disordered regions facilitate its binding promiscuity, allowing it to interact with various targets without undergoing significant structural changes (SantofimiaCastaño2021Intrinsically).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence NUPR1's activity and stability, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Multiple splice variants of NUPR1 exist, potentially altering its functional properties, but specific isoforms are not described in the context (SantofimiaCastaño2017Intrinsically).

## Function
NUPR1, also known as nuclear protein 1, is a transcriptional regulator involved in cellular stress responses and cancer progression. It is structurally related to high-mobility group (HMG) transcriptional regulators and is implicated in chromatin remodeling and transcription. NUPR1 interacts with the histone acetylation-regulating factor MSL1, suggesting a role in chromatin remodeling (Pommier2012The). It is activated by transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) via the SMAD signaling pathway, which involves the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3, leading to the formation of a complex with SMAD4 that accumulates in the nucleus to activate target gene transcription (Pommier2012The).

In healthy cells, NUPR1 is part of the stress response mechanism, helping cells survive hostile conditions by expressing stress proteins. This response can be transient or permanent, depending on the stress conditions (Pommier2012The). NUPR1 is active in the nucleus and interacts with various molecular pathways, contributing to processes like DNA repair and cellular homeostasis, impacting organismal stress adaptation. It is involved in modulating gene expression, influencing cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis (Lopez2015Functional).

## Clinical Significance
NUPR1 (nuclear protein 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cellular stress responses and tumor progression. In liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NUPR1 is overexpressed and contributes to tumor growth, migration, invasion, and resistance to the drug sorafenib. Knockdown of NUPR1 in HCC cells increases sensitivity to sorafenib, suggesting its role in chemoresistance (Emma2016NUPR1). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), NUPR1 is upregulated and essential for tumorigenesis. Its expression correlates with poor prognosis, and its interaction with the RELB and IER3 genes is crucial for cancer progression (Hamidi2012Nuclear). 

NUPR1 also plays a significant role in breast and colorectal cancers. In breast cancer, high NUPR1 levels are associated with longer survival, while in colorectal cancer, its knockdown reduces tumor growth and increases apoptosis (Martin2021NUPR1). In pancreatic cancer, NUPR1 influences autophagy and cell survival, with its inhibition leading to increased apoptosis and reduced tumorigenicity (Martin2021NUPR1). These findings highlight NUPR1 as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers due to its involvement in tumor progression and resistance to treatment.

## Interactions
NUPR1, an intrinsically disordered protein, engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with prothymosin α (ProTα) and DNA, forming complexes with a dissociation constant of approximately 0.5 μM and maintaining a 1:1 stoichiometry. These interactions do not induce a structured conformation in NUPR1, which remains disordered, adopting a worm-like conformation (Neira2019Dynamics).

NUPR1 also binds to the C-terminal region of polycomb ring1b (C-RING1B), with specific residues around the 30s region, such as Ala33 and Thr68, being crucial for this interaction. This binding is characterized by a dissociation constant in the micromolar range, indicating the formation of 'fuzzy' complexes where NUPR1 remains disordered (SantofimiaCastaño2017Intrinsically).

Additionally, NUPR1 interacts with the armadillo-repeat domain of plakophilin 1 (PKP1), with a binding affinity constant of approximately 11 μM. This interaction involves minimal structural changes, highlighting NUPR1's ability to form complexes with various targets while retaining its disordered nature (SantofimiaCastaño2021Intrinsically).
