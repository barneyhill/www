# LAIR1

## Overview
LAIR1 (leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein, which functions as an inhibitory receptor predominantly expressed on various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. The LAIR1 protein is characterized by a single immunoglobulin-like domain and contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic tail, which are essential for its role in modulating immune responses (Lebbink2005Identification; Meyaard2007The). Upon phosphorylation, these ITIMs recruit phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, leading to the inhibition of downstream signaling pathways and maintaining immune homeostasis (Meyaard1997LAIR1). LAIR1 interacts with collagens in the extracellular matrix, which serves as high-affinity ligands, further contributing to its regulatory function by setting thresholds for immune cell activation and preventing overactivation that could result in chronic inflammation or autoimmunity (Lebbink2006Collagens).

## Structure
LAIR1 (leukocyte associated immunoglobulin like receptor 1) is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by a single immunoglobulin-like domain. The primary structure of LAIR1 includes a cytoplasmic tail with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are crucial for its inhibitory function (Lebbink2005Identification). The secondary structure of LAIR1 features a single I-type Ig-fold, consisting of a sandwich of two β-sheets composed of β-strands ABE and A'GFCC', connected by a disulfide bond between β-strands B and F (Brondijk2010Crystal). 

The tertiary structure of LAIR1 reveals a V-type immunoglobulin fold, with a disulfide bond stabilizing the structure between strands B and F. The LAIR1 ectodomain undergoes conformational changes upon interaction with RIFIN, although the overall structure remains similar to its ligand-free form (Xu2021Structural). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate LAIR1's function, and it may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing (Lebbink2005Identification). The protein's collagen-binding domain is similar to the D1 domains of other leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) receptors, with structural similarities to KIR2DL2, LILRA5, and GPVI D1 domains (Brondijk2010Crystal).

## Function
LAIR1 (leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1) functions as an inhibitory receptor on a wide range of immune cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. It plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses by delivering inhibitory signals that modulate cell activation. LAIR1 contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic tail, which, upon phosphorylation, recruit phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2. This recruitment leads to the inhibition of downstream signaling pathways, thereby reducing immune cell activation and maintaining immune homeostasis (Meyaard2007The; Meyaard1997LAIR1).

LAIR1 is highly expressed on naive T cells and can inhibit T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation, contributing to a higher threshold for activation in these cells. This high expression helps prevent undesired immune responses against self-antigens, as naive T cells predominantly reside in lymphoid tissues and interact with antigen-presenting cells presenting self-peptides (Jansen2007Regulated; MAASHO2005The).

LAIR1 also interacts with collagens, which are high-affinity ligands found in the extracellular matrix. This interaction inhibits immune cell activation, setting a threshold for immune responses and preventing overactivation that could lead to chronic inflammation or autoimmunity (Meyaard2007The; Lebbink2006Collagens).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the LAIR1 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In gliomas, LAIR1 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor prognosis and higher WHO glioma grades. Its overexpression promotes glioma cell growth and tumor progression, suggesting that LAIR1 could be a potential therapeutic target in glioma treatment (Wei2023LAIR1).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), LAIR1 is highly expressed in leukemia cells and is essential for their growth. Knockdown of LAIR1 in these cells inhibits leukemia development and increases apoptosis, indicating its critical role in leukemia progression (Kang2015The).

LAIR1 expression is also associated with severe malaria anemia (SMA) in children. Reduced LAIR1 expression is linked to increased susceptibility to SMA, with specific genetic variants influencing disease risk. These variants affect LAIR1 transcript levels, potentially altering immune responses and contributing to disease severity (Achieng2019Integrated).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), defective expression and function of LAIR1 in B lymphocytes lead to impaired inhibitory signaling, contributing to dysregulated immunoglobulin production and altered immune responses (Colombo2012Defective).

## Interactions
LAIR1 (leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1) is an inhibitory receptor that interacts with collagens, which are abundant proteins in the extracellular matrix. This interaction is characterized by high affinity and is mediated through the Gly-Pro-Hyp (GPO) repeating sequence in collagen molecules (Lebbink2006Collagens). LAIR1 binds to various types of collagen, including types I, II, III, and IV, and this binding can inhibit immune cell activation, suggesting a role in immune regulation (Lebbink2006Collagens; Lebbink2009Identification).

The interaction of LAIR1 with collagen involves specific residues, such as R59, E61, and W109, which are crucial for binding and are conserved in both LAIR1 and the platelet receptor GPVI (Brondijk2010Crystal). Mutations in these residues, such as R65K, significantly reduce LAIR1's ability to bind collagen, highlighting the importance of these amino acids in maintaining the receptor's function (Tang2009A).

LAIR1 can also associate with SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, which are involved in signal transduction pathways that modulate immune responses. This association further contributes to its role as an inhibitory receptor, dampening immune cell activation upon collagen binding (Lebbink2006Collagens).
