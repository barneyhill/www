# TAF11L13

## Overview
TAF11L13 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 13, which is involved in the regulation of transcription. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, which is essential for the initiation of gene expression. TAF11L13 is part of a larger family of TATA-box binding protein associated factors (TAFs) that interact with the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) to facilitate the transcription of specific genes. The precise mechanisms by which TAF11L13 influences transcription and its interactions with other proteins are subjects of ongoing research, highlighting its potential significance in various biological processes and disease pathways.
