# UNC5C

## Overview
UNC5C is a gene that encodes the unc-5 netrin receptor C, a type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the UNC5 family of netrin receptors. This protein plays a crucial role in axon guidance and cell migration by acting as a dependence receptor, which can induce apoptosis in the absence of its ligand, netrin-1, and promote cell survival when netrin-1 is present (Wu2017Methylation; Grady2007Making). The UNC5C protein is characterized by its structural domains, including immunoglobulin-like and thrombospondin type-I domains extracellularly, and ZU5 and death domains intracellularly, which are essential for its function in neuronal processes and its interaction with microtubules (Zhu2021UNC5; Treccarichi2024UNC5C:). UNC5C is predominantly expressed in the brain and kidneys, where it is involved in synaptic development and normal kidney function, respectively. Its expression is often down-regulated in various cancers, such as colorectal and renal cell carcinoma, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Lv2011Genetic; Zhu2021UNC5).

## Structure
The UNC5C protein is a member of the UNC5 family of netrin receptors, characterized by its distinct structural features. It is a type I transmembrane protein that includes two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and two thrombospondin type-I domains in its extracellular sequence (Zhu2021UNC5). The intracellular region of UNC5C contains a ZU5 domain and a death domain, which are crucial for its function as a dependence receptor (Treccarichi2024UNC5C:). These domains are involved in netrin-mediated axon repulsion and interact directly with microtubules, affecting microtubule dynamics and axon guidance (Treccarichi2024UNC5C:).

UNC5C can form homodimers or heterodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure, and may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Zhu2021UNC5). The protein's structure allows it to transmit opposing signals based on the presence or absence of its ligand, netrin-1, promoting cell survival or inducing apoptosis, respectively (Zhu2021UNC5). Splice variant isoforms of UNC5C may exist, leading to functional diversity (Zhu2021UNC5). These structural features and modifications are essential for its role in neuronal processes and its involvement in diseases such as Alzheimer's and cancer.

## Function
The UNC5C gene encodes a receptor that is part of the UNC-5 family of netrin receptors, which are involved in axon guidance and cell migration. In healthy human cells, UNC5C functions as a dependence receptor, transmitting signals related to cell proliferation and migration when its ligand, netrin-1, is present. In the absence of netrin-1, UNC5C induces apoptosis through caspase-mediated mechanisms, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Wu2017Methylation; Grady2007Making).

UNC5C is predominantly expressed in brain tissues, where it plays a pivotal role in neuronal processes such as synaptic development and axon guidance. It is involved in presynaptic development, neuronal apoptosis, and migration in the cerebral cortex. The binding of netrin-1 to UNC5C can induce the dissociation of UNC5C from polymerized TUBB3 within microtubules, affecting microtubule dynamics and axon repulsion, which are essential for proper neuronal development and function (Treccarichi2024UNC5C:).

In the kidney, UNC5C is expressed in the proximal convoluted tubules, suggesting a role in normal kidney function. Its expression is down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Lv2011Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the UNC5C gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). UNC5C acts as a tumor suppressor, and its expression is frequently down-regulated in CRC, with studies showing that its inactivation can confer a selective advantage in tumor progression (Zhu2021UNC5). Germline mutations, such as the p.Ala628Lys (A628K) variant, have been associated with familial CRC, suggesting a potential role in hereditary cancer predisposition, although these mutations are rare (Coissieux2011Variants). Epigenetic changes, particularly hypermethylation of the UNC5C promoter, lead to transcriptional silencing and are observed in a significant proportion of CRC cases, indicating an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis (Shin2007Epigenetic).

UNC5C is also implicated in other cancers, such as bladder cancer, where somatic missense mutations occur at a relatively high frequency, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Zhu2021UNC5). The gene's down-regulation is observed in various other cancers, including ovarian, breast, and lung cancers, highlighting its broader significance in tumor suppression (Zhu2021UNC5).

## Interactions
UNC5C interacts with TUBB3, a β-tubulin subunit, in a netrin-1-dependent manner. This interaction is specific, as UNC5C does not interact with other β-tubulin subunits like TUBB1 and TUBB2. Netrin-1 reduces the interaction and colocalization of UNC5C and TUBB3 in the growth cones of neurons, which is crucial for netrin-1-mediated axonal repulsion. The interaction between UNC5C and TUBB3 is modulated by microtubule dynamics, as agents that disrupt these dynamics abolish the netrin-1-reduced interaction (Shao2017Uncoupling).

UNC5C also interacts with TRIM9, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which regulates the mobility of UNC5C in the plasma membrane. This interaction occurs independently of DCC, another netrin receptor, and is not affected by the presence of netrin-1. TRIM9 influences the surface localization and mobility of UNC5C, potentially through mechanisms involving membrane composition and the cortical actin cytoskeleton (Mutalik2024TRIM9).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, UNC5C is cleaved by δ-secretase, enhancing its proapoptotic activity. This cleavage is associated with increased neuronal cell death and is implicated in neurodegeneration (Chen2021Netrin1).
