# PRPF39

## Overview
PRPF39, or pre-mRNA processing factor 39, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the spliceosome complex, which is essential for the splicing of pre-mRNA. This protein is categorized as a spliceosomal component and plays a pivotal role in the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts, facilitating accurate mRNA maturation and subsequent protein synthesis. The PRPF39 protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression through its involvement in alternative splicing processes. Its function is crucial for cellular homeostasis and proper gene expression, with implications in immune cell differentiation and activation. Additionally, PRPF39 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in liver cancer, where it influences chemotherapy sensitivity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Stark2012Functional; Qin2021Hsa‑circRNA‑G004213; Zhou2023Identification).

## Function
PRPF39 (pre-mRNA processing factor 39) is a crucial component of the spliceosome complex, which is responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA, a vital step in gene expression. This protein is involved in the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts, ensuring accurate mRNA maturation and proper protein synthesis. PRPF39 is active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in regulating gene expression and function through its involvement in alternative splicing processes (Zhou2023Identification).

In particular, PRPF39 has been shown to influence splicing in immune cell differentiation and activation, highlighting its importance in cellular function and organismal outcomes (Zhou2023Identification). The protein's expression levels are tightly coupled to gene transcription and subsequent splicing processes, indicating its regulatory role in these molecular activities (Zhou2023Identification).

Although specific functions of PRPF39 in healthy human cells are not directly addressed in the available studies, its involvement in pre-mRNA processing and spliceosome interaction suggests a fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper gene expression (Stark2012Functional).

## Clinical Significance
PRPF39 is implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in pre-mRNA splicing. Alterations in PRPF39 expression have been associated with liver cancer, where it plays a significant role in chemotherapy sensitivity. In liver cancer, PRPF39 is part of a regulatory network involving hsa-circRNA-G004213 and miR-513b-5p, which affects the sensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug. Overexpression of PRPF39 enhances cisplatin sensitivity, while its knockdown increases resistance, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in liver cancer treatment (Qin2021Hsa‑circRNA‑G004213).

PRPF39 is also identified as a substrate of the anticancer drug E7070, which leads to its degradation through a DCAF15-dependent mechanism. This degradation affects pre-mRNA splicing, potentially contributing to the drug's anticancer activity. The degradation of PRPF39 by E7070 is not due to changes in mRNA levels but results from post-translational regulation, specifically ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Jia2020pSILAC).

These findings highlight the importance of PRPF39 in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. However, specific mutations in PRPF39 and their direct association with other diseases are not detailed in the provided context.

## Interactions
PRPF39 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, primarily within the context of pre-mRNA splicing. It forms a homodimer in the human U1 snRNP complex, similar to the yeast Prp42/Prp39 heterodimer. This interaction is crucial for the association of alternative splicing factors with the U1 snRNP. PRPF39 directly interacts with the U1C-CTD, facilitating the assembly and function of the spliceosome (Li2017CryoEM).

PRPF39 is also part of a complex with other proteins such as Luc7L and PrpF40, which are implicated in alternative splicing regulation. These proteins may form a trimer and associate with human U1 snRNP through interactions with Luc7L and PRPF39 (Li2017CryoEM).

In the context of cancer treatment, PRPF39 is identified as a substrate of the anticancer drug E7070, which induces its degradation in a DCAF15-dependent manner. This process involves the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where E7070 treatment leads to the assembly of a protein complex between PRPF39 and DCAF15, resulting in PRPF39 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Jia2020pSILAC).
