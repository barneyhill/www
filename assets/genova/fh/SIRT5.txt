# SIRT5

## Overview
SIRT5 is a gene that encodes the protein sirtuin 5, a member of the sirtuin family of proteins, which are characterized by their NAD+-dependent enzymatic activity. Sirtuin 5 is primarily localized in the mitochondria and functions as a deacylase, with specific activities including desuccinylation, demalonylation, and deacetylation. These enzymatic activities are crucial for regulating various metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and the urea cycle, thereby influencing energy production and ammonia detoxification (Nakagawa2009SIRT5; Park2013SIRT5Mediated). The protein's structure features a conserved sirtuin core domain and a unique acyl-lysine binding pocket, which allows it to accommodate negatively charged acylated substrates (Mori2022Insights). SIRT5's role extends to interactions with other proteins, impacting cellular processes and potentially acting as an oncosuppressor (Fabbrizi2023Emerging). Alterations in the SIRT5 gene have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Giblin2021The; Fabbrizi2023Emerging).

## Structure
SIRT5 is a member of the sirtuin family, characterized by its NAD+-dependent enzymatic activity. The primary structure of SIRT5 includes a conserved sirtuin core domain, which is essential for its function as a deacylase (Mori2022Insights). The secondary structure of SIRT5 comprises fourteen α helices and nine β strands, organized into two main domains: the Zn2+-binding domain and the Rossmann fold domain, which is typical of NAD+-binding proteins (Mori2022Insights). 

The tertiary structure of SIRT5 features a larger acyl-lysine binding pocket compared to other sirtuins, due to the presence of Ala86, which allows it to accommodate negatively charged acylated substrates (Mori2022Insights). The active site includes distinctive amino acid residues such as Ala86, Tyr102, and Arg105, which are involved in forming hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions with substrates (Glas2022Development).

SIRT5 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with SIRT5 iso1 found in the cytosol and SIRT5 iso2 in the cytoplasm (Mori2022Insights). These isoforms may influence its function and localization within the cell. SIRT5 can also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its activity and interactions.

## Function
SIRT5 is a mitochondrial sirtuin that plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic processes through its desuccinylase, demalonylase, and deacetylase activities. It is primarily involved in the regulation of lysine succinylation, a post-translational modification that impacts various metabolic pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and ketogenesis (Rardin2013SIRT5; Park2013SIRT5Mediated). SIRT5 modulates the activity of key metabolic enzymes such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), thereby influencing cellular respiration and energy production (Park2013SIRT5Mediated).

In addition to its role in energy metabolism, SIRT5 is involved in the urea cycle by deacetylating and activating carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), which is essential for ammonia detoxification (Nakagawa2009SIRT5). This activity is particularly important during metabolic states such as fasting, where increased amino acid catabolism leads to elevated ammonia levels (Nakagawa2009SIRT5).

SIRT5's enzymatic activities are facilitated by its acyl pocket, which preferentially binds negatively charged acyl groups, allowing it to efficiently reverse lysine succinylation and malonylation, thus maintaining metabolic homeostasis in healthy human cells (Du2011Sirt5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIRT5 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In patients with mitochondrial-like disease pathology, two homozygous missense variants, P114T and L128V, were identified. These variants are associated with reduced SIRT5 stability and activity, leading to severe developmental delays and neurological symptoms, although they do not cause significant neuropathology or biochemical abnormalities in plasma or urine (Yuan2023SIRT5variants).

SIRT5 is also involved in cancer, where its expression levels and genetic alterations play a significant role. In melanoma, SIRT5 copy number gain is frequent and correlates with increased mRNA expression, contributing to adverse prognosis and chemoresistance (Giblin2021The). In colorectal cancer, SIRT5 promotes autophagy and cancer cell growth, with its knockout reducing cell proliferation (Fabbrizi2023Emerging). SIRT5 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, where it supports cancer cell proliferation and survival (Fabbrizi2023Emerging).

In metabolic disorders, SIRT5 is involved in regulating fatty acid oxidation and ammonia detoxification. Its deficiency can lead to reduced energy production and increased cardiac ischemia-reperfusion damage, highlighting its role in cardiac health (Fabbrizi2023Emerging). SIRT5's involvement in neurodegenerative diseases includes its neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress and inflammation, which are crucial in conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases (Fabbrizi2023Emerging).

## Interactions
SIRT5 interacts with various proteins, playing significant roles in metabolic regulation and cellular processes. It interacts with cytochrome C and the Complex I component NDUFA4, although the specific roles of these interactions are not fully determined (Fabbrizi2023Emerging). SIRT5 is involved in the regulation of the urea cycle by deacylating and activating carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) in liver cells, which is crucial for metabolic adaptation during caloric restriction (Fabbrizi2023Emerging). In non-liver cells, SIRT5 desuccinylates mitochondrial glutaminase (GLS), suppressing glutamine conversion into glutamate and ammonia production, suggesting a potential oncosuppressor function (Fabbrizi2023Emerging).

SIRT5 also interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 protein, acting as a proviral factor that supports viral replication. This interaction is specific to SARS-like coronaviruses and does not occur with Nsp14 from MERS-CoV or HCoV-OC43 (Walter2022SIRT5a). The interaction requires SIRT5's catalytic activity, although Nsp14 is not directly modified by SIRT5 (Walter2022SIRT5). SIRT5's interaction with Nsp14 is thought to influence viral replication and immune response modulation (Walter2022SIRT5a).
