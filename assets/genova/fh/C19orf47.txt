# C19orf47

## Overview
C19orf47, or chromosome 19 open reading frame 47, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The protein, also referred to as C19orf47, is characterized as a putative secreted protein with a signal peptide sequence, suggesting its presence in blood plasma and potential as a diagnostic marker (Narayanan2015Atlas). It interacts with several components of the transcription and export complex, such as ALYREF and CHTOP, indicating a role in mRNA export and RNA regulation (Dyakov2024Spatial). C19orf47 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including immune response modulation and extracellular matrix regulation, and is under investigation for its role in cancer and immune evasion (Gourmet2022Immune; Gourmet2024Immune). Despite its involvement in these processes, the full spectrum of its functions and clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
C19orf47 has been implicated in various cellular processes and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and immune evasion. In tumors that have evaded immune detection, C19orf47 is under significant negative selection, suggesting it may play a role in the evolutionary dynamics of these cancers (Gourmet2022Immune; Gourmet2024Immune). This indicates that C19orf47 might have a different significance in immune-escaped tumors compared to those that have not evaded immune detection.

Alterations in the expression of C19orf47 have also been observed in other contexts. For instance, the depletion of C19orf47 in HEK293 cells led to significant changes in mRNA levels, particularly a decrease in the expression of over 400 genes, many of which are involved in the extracellular matrix and cell adhesion (Dyakov2024Spatial). This suggests that C19orf47 may influence cellular processes related to the extracellular matrix, which could have implications for diseases involving these pathways.

In immune system processes, C19orf47 was identified as a downregulated protein in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells treated with a let-7e mimic, indicating its potential involvement in immune response modulation (Gui2018Effects). However, specific diseases directly linked to mutations or alterations in C19orf47 are not well-documented, and research is ongoing to determine its clinical significance.

## Interactions
C19orf47, also known as chromosome 19 open reading frame 47, is involved in transcriptional regulation and interacts with several key components of the transcription and export complex. It forms proximal interactions with proteins such as ALYREF, CHTOP, FYTTD1, NCBP3, POLDIP3, and ZC3H11A, suggesting a role in promoting mRNA export (Dyakov2024Spatial). These interactions indicate that C19orf47 may play a significant role in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its functions.

The protein is also associated with influenza viral infection and is described as a putative secreted protein with a signal peptide sequence at the N-terminus, present in blood plasma. This suggests its potential as a diagnostic marker, although specific interaction data with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context is not detailed (Narayanan2015Atlas). The current understanding of C19orf47's interactions highlights its involvement in RNA regulation and its potential as a component of multiprotein complexes within the cell nucleus.
