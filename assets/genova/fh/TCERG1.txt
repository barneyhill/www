# TCERG1

## Overview
TCERG1, or transcription elongation regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of transcription elongation and pre-mRNA splicing. The protein, also referred to as TCERG1, is characterized by its modular structure, which includes multiple WW and FF domains that facilitate interactions with various transcription and splicing components. As a transcription elongation regulator, TCERG1 plays a critical role in modulating the rate of transcription by interacting with RNA polymerase II, thereby influencing the alternative splicing of numerous genes. It is also essential for the integrity of Cajal bodies and the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, which are vital for the splicing process. TCERG1's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in gene expression regulation and cellular functions, including apoptosis. Alterations in TCERG1 expression and function have been linked to various diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and Huntington's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Montes2012TCERG1; Yang2022Overexpression; MorenoCastro2019Role; Lobanov2022Huntington’s).

## Structure
The TCERG1 protein is characterized by a modular architecture that includes three WW domains and six FF domains, which are crucial for its function in transcription regulation and RNA processing (Fidan2011Chemical). The WW domains are small, monomeric structures composed of triple-stranded, anti-parallel β-sheets, typically around 40 amino acids in length. These domains are known for recognizing proline-rich motifs and can fold autonomously (Fidan2011Chemical).

The first WW domain is part of the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine group and directly binds to the phosphorylated C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, playing a role in mRNA processing (Fidan2011Chemical). The second WW domain interacts with proline-rich motifs in pre-mRNA splicing factors (Fidan2011Chemical). The third WW domain's proper folding was achieved by including a C-terminal short α-helical region, which stabilizes the domain fold (Fidan2011Chemical).

TCERG1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which influences its activity and interactions. The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, affecting its structural and functional properties (Fidan2011Chemical). The synthesis and structural analysis of the third WW domain highlight the challenges in achieving correct folding, which is essential for its biological function (Fidan2011Chemical).

## Function
TCERG1, also known as transcription elongation regulator 1, is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of transcription elongation and pre-mRNA splicing in human cells. It interacts with RNA polymerase II and is involved in modulating the rate of transcription, which influences the alternative splicing of various genes, including the Bcl-x gene (Montes2012TCERG1). TCERG1 is composed of multiple protein domains, including WW and FF domains, which facilitate its interactions with transcription and splicing components (SánchezÁlvarez2006Human).

In the context of splicing, TCERG1 is essential for the integrity of Cajal bodies (CBs) and the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are critical for the splicing process. Knockdown of TCERG1 disrupts CB integrity and affects the recruitment of Sm proteins to snRNAs, impairing snRNP biogenesis (MorenoCastro2019Role). TCERG1 also influences apoptosis by modulating the splicing of apoptotic genes such as Bcl-x and Fas/CD95, affecting both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways (Montes2015Functional).

Overall, TCERG1 is a key player in the coordination of transcription and splicing, impacting gene expression and cellular functions such as apoptosis regulation.

## Clinical Significance
The TCERG1 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TCERG1 is overexpressed, and this overexpression is associated with a negative prognosis. High TCERG1 expression correlates with shorter overall survival, disease-specific survival, progression-free survival, and recurrence-free survival in HCC patients. It is considered an independent risk factor for poor prognosis, as it is linked to various clinical characteristics such as tumor stage and status (Yang2022Overexpression). 

In Huntington's disease (HD), TCERG1 plays a role in modifying the age at motor onset. A tandem hexamer repeat in exon 4 of TCERG1 is associated with the age at onset, with longer repeats linked to earlier onset. This repeat affects transcriptional processes and may influence the somatic expansion of the CAG repeat in the HTT gene, a key factor in HD. Increased TCERG1 expression is associated with earlier onset of HD, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Lobanov2022Huntington’s). 

These findings suggest that TCERG1's expression and genetic variations can significantly impact disease progression and prognosis in both cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
TCERG1, or transcription elongation regulator 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in transcription and splicing processes. It interacts with the Cajal body (CB) marker coilin, and this association is strong enough to withstand RIPA buffer washes, indicating a robust interaction. TCERG1 is also associated with other factors involved in CB homeostasis and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis, such as CRM1, SMN, and integrator complex subunit 11 (INTS11) (MorenoCastro2019Role).

In the context of transcription, TCERG1 interacts with the transcription elongation complex and is recruited to transcription sites independently of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Its interaction with the CTD requires phosphorylation of Ser7, which is enriched over introns, suggesting a role in cotranscriptional splicing (SánchezHernández2016The). TCERG1 also interacts with splicing factors such as SF1 and U2AF65, which may slow its mobility at splice sites and stabilize splicing factors to stimulate spliceosome assembly (SánchezHernández2016The).

TCERG1's interaction with C/EBPa results in its nuclear redistribution, indicating a physical interaction that affects TCERG1's localization pattern (Banman2009Nuclear). It also interacts with HIV-1 cofactors like P-TEFb and Tat-SF1, affecting the elongation of RNAPII by increasing the phosphorylation of Ser2 on the RNAPII CTD, which facilitates transcriptional elongation (Coiras2013Transcription).
