# PKD2L1

## Overview
The PKD2L1 gene encodes the protein polycystin 2 like 1, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel family, specifically classified as TRPP3. This protein is integral to various physiological processes, including calcium signaling, sensory perception, and development. Structurally, PKD2L1 is characterized by six transmembrane segments and forms both homotetramers and heterotetramers with other polycystin family members, such as PKD1L3. Functionally, it acts as a calcium-permeable cation channel, playing a crucial role in sour taste perception and hedgehog signaling pathways. PKD2L1 is expressed in diverse tissues, including taste buds and neurons, and its activity is modulated through interactions with proteins like RACK1. While mutations in PKD2L1 are linked to taste disorders and developmental anomalies, it is not directly associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (hussein2015functional; Ishimaru2010Interaction; Zheng2015A).

## Structure
The PKD2L1 protein, also known as TRPP3, is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and is characterized by its complex molecular structure. It consists of six transmembrane segments with a pore loop located between the fifth and sixth segments, which is crucial for its function as a cation channel (Su2018CryoEM; Zheng2015A). The protein's N-terminus is involved in dimerization, while the C-terminus contains a novel domain, C1, critical for trimerization and channel function (Zheng2015A).

PKD2L1 forms homotetramers and can also form heterotetramers with other polycystin family members, such as PKD1L3, through a shared mechanism of homotrimerization and heterodimerization (Su2018CryoEM; Zheng2015A). The protein's structure includes a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) composed of the first four transmembrane helices, and a pore domain formed by the S5 and S6 helices (Su2018CryoEM).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at residues N207 and N241, which are important for stabilizing inter-domain interactions (Su2018CryoEM). The PKD2L1 structure also features a polycystin mucolipin domain (PMD) that interacts with the pore and voltage-sensing domains, contributing to the tetrameric assembly and stability of the channel (Hulse2018CryoEM).

## Function
The PKD2L1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a calcium-permeable cation channel, part of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily. This protein is involved in several physiological processes, including calcium-dependent hedgehog signaling, intestinal development, and sour taste perception (hussein2015functional; Zheng2015A). PKD2L1 is expressed in various tissues, including taste buds and neurons surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord, where it responds to changes in extracellular pH, particularly in sour taste perception (hussein2015functional; Zheng2015A).

PKD2L1 forms complexes with other PKD proteins, such as PKD1L3, to sense fluid flow and acid, particularly in primary cilia and surface membranes. These complexes are organized as heterotetramers with a 3:1 stoichiometry, and the interaction between PKD2L1 and PKD1L3 through their transmembrane domains is necessary for their surface expression (hussein2015functional; Ishimaru2010Interaction). The protein is also involved in regulating calcium concentration and calcium-dependent hedgehog signaling, particularly in the plasma membrane and primary cilia of mammalian cells (Zheng2015A). PKD2L1's role in sensory perception and development highlights its importance in healthy human cells (hussein2015functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the PKD2L1 gene can lead to various clinical conditions. PKD2L1 is associated with sour taste disorders, as its absence or mutation results in a significant reduction in sour taste perception. PKD2L1 knockout mice exhibit moderate taste disorders and other malformations, such as intestinal malrotation and loose cell-to-cell contact in heart tissues (hussein2015functional). Although PKD2L1 shares similarities with PKD2, it is not directly linked to the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (hussein2015functional; yang2013function).

PKD2L1 is also involved in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway and may play a role in retinal detachment, as its downregulation correlates with the stage of detachment (hussein2015functional). In murine models, the deletion of PKD2L1 is associated with renal and retinal defects, suggesting its potential involvement in kidney and retinal conditions (yang2013function). The gene's expression and interactions with proteins like RACK1 and α-actinin influence its function and localization, which may impact its role in various tissues, including the brain, kidney, liver, and heart (yang2013function).

## Interactions
PKD2L1 interacts with several proteins, influencing its function and localization. One significant interaction is with the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), which inhibits PKD2L1 channel activity through physical interaction. This inhibition involves the N-terminal fragment of PKD2L1 (Met 1 - Pro 45) and the C-terminal region of RACK1 (Lys 139 - Arg 317). Overexpression of RACK1 reduces PKD2L1 channel activity and its expression on the plasma membrane, while knockdown of RACK1 increases PKD2L1 expression and activity (Yang2012Receptor).

PKD2L1 also forms a complex with PKD1L3, which is crucial for its localization at taste pores in circumvallate and foliate papillae. This interaction is mediated through their transmembrane domains, specifically TM7 to 10 of PKD1L3 and TM1 to 6 of PKD2L1. The interaction enhances PKD2L1's response to acidic stimuli, although PKD2L1 can function independently as a cation channel (Ishimaru2010Interaction).

PKD2L1 can form homodimers, trimers, and tetramers, as well as hetero-oligomers with partner proteins. The C-terminal domain is critical for trimerization and channel function, although it is not essential for channel activity, indicating other domains contribute to oligomerization (Zheng2015A).
