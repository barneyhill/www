# TRAPPC8

## Overview
TRAPPC8 is a gene that encodes the protein trafficking protein particle complex subunit 8, which is a component of the TRAPP (transport protein particle) complex. This complex is involved in vesicle-mediated transport within cells, playing a critical role in intracellular trafficking, particularly from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The TRAPPC8 protein is characterized by conserved ASH domains and tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its function in cellular signaling and trafficking (Schou2014Identification). TRAPPC8 is also crucial for ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, and is involved in the Rab11-Rabin8-Rab8 axis, which is vital for ciliary membrane biogenesis (Schou2014Identification). Additionally, TRAPPC8 plays a role in autophagy by regulating ATG9 trafficking, highlighting its multifaceted involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Lamb2015TBC1D14).

## Structure
TRAPPC8 is a subunit of the TRAPP complex, characterized by the presence of conserved ASH domains and tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats. The ASH domain, located in the C-terminal region of TRAPPC8, is a novel family of remote homologs of the immunoglobulin-like seven-stranded beta sandwich fold superfamily. This domain is suggested to form a protein-protein interaction interface involved in cellular signaling and trafficking activities (Schou2014Identification). The N-terminus of TRAPPC8 is predicted to consist of an α-solenoid structure with multiple TPR repeats, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Schou2014Identification).

TRAPPC8 localizes to the centrosome/basal body and is implicated in ciliogenesis, with its depletion impairing this process and affecting the recruitment of Rabin8 to the centrosome (Schou2014Identification). The protein is part of a complex with both TRAPPI and TRAPPII components in mammalian cells, and its C-terminal extension is related to TRAPPC9, which may explain its association with TRAPPII-specific subunits (Schou2014Identification). The molecular structure of TRAPPC8 in plants shares some similarities with its metazoan counterparts, although specific structural details remain to be fully elucidated (HoffmanSommer2024TheArabidopsis).

## Function
TRAPPC8 is a subunit of the TRAPP complex, which plays a crucial role in vesicle-mediated transport within cells. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport, and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting (Lamb2015TBC1D14).

In healthy human cells, TRAPPC8 localizes to the centrosome/basal body and is necessary for ciliogenesis, the process by which cilia are formed. Its depletion leads to a significant reduction in ciliation frequency, indicating its essential role in this process (Schou2014Identification). TRAPPC8 is implicated in the Rab11-Rabin8-Rab8 axis, crucial for the targeting of Rabin8 to the centrosome and the proper biogenesis of the ciliary membrane (Schou2014Identification). It interacts with the ciliopathy protein OFD1, facilitating its association with pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1), which is vital for ciliary growth and function (Zhang2020Distinct).

TRAPPC8 also plays a role in autophagy by regulating ATG9 trafficking. Its depletion affects the localization and trafficking of ATG9, which is essential for autophagy regulation (Lamb2015TBC1D14). Overall, TRAPPC8 is integral to processes related to ciliogenesis, vesicular trafficking, and autophagy in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the TRAPPC8 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Alterations in TRAPPC8 expression can disrupt cellular trafficking processes, which are crucial for maintaining normal cellular function. In neurodevelopmental disorders, these disruptions may lead to improper neuronal development and function, contributing to the pathology of these conditions. The precise mechanisms by which TRAPPC8 mutations lead to these disorders are still under investigation, but they are believed to involve the gene's role in vesicle-mediated transport, which is essential for neuronal communication and development.

In cancer, changes in TRAPPC8 expression levels have been associated with tumor progression and metastasis. The dysregulation of vesicle trafficking pathways, due to altered TRAPPC8 function, can affect the cellular environment in ways that promote cancer cell survival and proliferation. This suggests that TRAPPC8 may play a role in oncogenic processes, although the exact pathways and interactions involved are not yet fully understood. Understanding the clinical significance of TRAPPC8 mutations and expression changes is crucial for developing potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
TRAPPC8 is a component of the TRAPP complex, which is involved in vesicular trafficking and ciliogenesis. It interacts with various proteins and subunits within the TRAPP complex. TRAPPC8 is part of the TRAPPIII complex and interacts with the ciliopathy protein OFD1. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of OFD1 to centriolar satellites, which is necessary for ciliogenesis. TRAPPC8 inhibits the interaction between OFD1 and another TRAPPIII subunit, TRAPPC12, indicating distinct roles for these subunits in ciliogenesis (Zhang2020Distinct).

TRAPPC8 also interacts with components of the TRAPPII complex, such as TRAPPC9 and TRAPPC10, and is involved in targeting Rabin8 to the centrosome, which is essential for ciliary membrane biogenesis (Schou2014Identification). In Arabidopsis thaliana, TRAPPC8 interacts with other TRAPPIII-specific subunits, such as TRAPPC11, TRAPPC12, and TRAPPC13, suggesting a conserved role in the TRAPPIII complex across species (HoffmanSommer2024TheArabidopsis). These interactions highlight TRAPPC8's role in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and ciliogenesis through its participation in the TRAPP complex.
