# CAPSL

## Overview
The CAPSL gene encodes the calcyphosine-like protein, which is a member of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. This protein is primarily involved in calcium signaling and regulation within cells, playing a significant role in processes such as adipogenesis and autophagy. Calcyphosine-like protein is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, where it functions as a regulatory factor in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. The protein's expression is modulated during the early stages of adipogenesis, suggesting its involvement in the initial phases of fat cell development. Additionally, CAPSL has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as Multiple Symmetric Lipomatosis and Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy, where mutations in the gene can lead to altered protein function and disease phenotypes (Lindner2019Calcyphosinelike; Liu2024Dysfunction).

## Structure


## Function
The CAPSL gene, also known as calcyphosine-like, encodes a protein involved in calcium-binding processes within cells, specifically through its EF-hand motifs, which are part of a superfamily of calcium sensors and signal modulators (Santiago2008Study). In healthy human cells, CAPSL is expressed in adipose tissue and plays a role in adipogenesis, the process by which pre-adipocytes differentiate into mature adipocytes (Lindner2019Calcyphosinelike). During adipogenesis, CAPSL expression is upregulated in the early stages, indicating its involvement in the initial phases of adipocyte development (Lindner2019Calcyphosinelike).

CAPSL appears to have a regulatory function in adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. Knockout studies in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes have shown that the absence of CAPSL enhances differentiation into adipocytes, with increased lipid droplet accumulation, while overexpression of CAPSL reduces differentiation and lipid accumulation (Lindner2019Calcyphosinelike). This suggests that CAPSL may act as an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, CAPSL is involved in the regulation of autophagy, as indicated by changes in autophagosomal markers in cells with altered CAPSL expression (Lindner2019Calcyphosinelike). These functions highlight CAPSL's role in cellular processes related to fat cell metabolism and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CAPSL gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably Multiple Symmetric Lipomatosis (MSL) and Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). In MSL, a rare adipose tissue disorder, a heterozygous rare missense variant in the CAPSL gene was identified in a family, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis. CAPSL expression is notably absent in the adipose tissue of MSL patients, while it is present in control samples. This absence is linked to enhanced adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, indicating that CAPSL may play a regulatory role in adipogenesis (Lindner2019Calcyphosinelike).

In FEVR, a genetic disorder affecting retinal angiogenesis, CAPSL mutations such as c.88C>T (p.R30X) and c.247C>T (p.L83F) have been identified. These mutations lead to reduced CAPSL protein levels, impairing retinal vascular development. CAPSL deficiency in endothelial cells results in decreased proliferation and migration, contributing to FEVR phenotypes. The dysfunction of CAPSL in FEVR is associated with the down-regulation of the MYC signaling axis, which is crucial for cell growth and migration (Liu2024Dysfunction; Liu2024Defective).
