# EIF3G

## Overview
The EIF3G gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit G, a crucial component of the eIF3 complex, which is integral to the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. As part of the eIF3 complex, the EIF3G protein is involved in the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit with mRNA and initiator tRNA, facilitating the formation of the 48S pre-initiation complex, a critical step in translation initiation (Valášek2017Embraced). EIF3G is categorized as a translation initiation factor and is known for its interactions with other initiation factors and ribosomal proteins, playing a significant role in mRNA recruitment and stabilization of the pre-initiation complex. Beyond its cytoplasmic functions, EIF3G also localizes in the nucleus, suggesting additional roles in gene expression regulation and RNA processing (ZHENG2016Nuclear). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes and its implications in cancer progression underscore its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states.

## Function
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit G (EIF3G) is a critical component of the eIF3 complex, which plays a vital role in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. EIF3G is involved in the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit with mRNA and initiator tRNA, facilitating the start of translation. It is part of a module with eIF3b and eIF3i that contributes to the stability of the eIF3 complex, particularly in yeast, and is essential for the formation of the 48S pre-initiation complex (Valášek2017Embraced).

EIF3G interacts with other initiation factors and ribosomal proteins, playing a role in mRNA recruitment and stabilization of the pre-initiation complex. It is also involved in translation reinitiation, particularly in the context of polycistronic mRNAs, by interacting with viral elements and facilitating the recruitment of eIF3 to polysomes (Valášek2017Embraced). In addition to its cytoplasmic functions, EIF3G has been found to localize in the nucleus, where it interacts with nuclear proteins, suggesting potential roles in gene expression regulation and RNA processing (ZHENG2016Nuclear). These activities highlight EIF3G's multifaceted role in cellular growth and gene expression regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the EIF3G gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast and bladder cancer. In breast cancer, increased expression of EIF3G is associated with lymph node metastasis and drug resistance, enhancing the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. EIF3G interacts with nuclear proteins such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), HSZFP36, and β-actin, which may influence gene expression and contribute to cancer progression (Yin2018The; ZHENG2016Nuclear).

In bladder cancer, EIF3G is involved in the regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway through its interaction with the long non-coding RNA LINC02446. While EIF3G mRNA levels do not significantly differ between cancerous and normal tissues, its protein is overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues. LINC02446 negatively regulates EIF3G protein expression, affecting its stability and half-life, and acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating EIF3G and inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the proliferation and metastasis of bladder cancer cells (Zhang2021Long).

These findings suggest that EIF3G plays a significant role in cancer development and progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
EIF3G, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with other eIF3 subunits, such as eIF3a, eIF3b, and eIF3c, forming part of the translation initiation machinery that recruits ribosomes to mRNA (Choe2012Translation). EIF3G also interacts with the CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (CTIF), which is crucial for ribosome recruitment during translation initiation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Choe2012Translation).

In breast cancer cells, eIF3g translocates to the nucleus and interacts with nuclear proteins such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), HSZFP36, and β-actin, suggesting roles in gene expression regulation and RNA processing (ZHENG2016Nuclear). EIF3G also forms complexes with the cytoskeletal protein pelota (PELO), indicating a role in the cytoskeletal network and apoptosis (BurnickaTurek2010Pelota).

Additionally, eIF3g interacts with Poly(A)-binding protein-interacting protein 1 (Paip1), forming complexes that stimulate translation (Martineau2008Poly(A)Binding page 3 of 5). These interactions highlight eIF3g's multifaceted role in translation initiation and cellular processes.
