# ACER3

## Overview
ACER3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme alkaline ceramidase 3, which is a member of the CREST superfamily of integral-membrane hydrolases. This enzyme is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain architecture and is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Alkaline ceramidase 3 plays a pivotal role in sphingolipid metabolism by hydrolyzing unsaturated long-chain ceramides, such as C18:1, C20:1, and C20:4 ceramides, as well as dihydroceramides and phytoceramides. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining ceramide homeostasis, which is essential for regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and lipid raft integrity. Mutations in the ACER3 gene have been linked to a rare form of inherited leukoencephalopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in neurogenetic disorders (Dehnavi2021ACER3related; Hu2010Alkaline).

## Structure
The ACER3 protein is a 267-amino acid enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 31.6 kDa. It is a member of the CREST superfamily of integral-membrane hydrolases and features a seven-transmembrane domain architecture (Coant2017Ceramidases; Yi2022Alkaline). The protein's active site is located at the bottom of a central hydrophobic cavity and operates via a Zn-dependent hydrolase mechanism. Key catalytic residues include three histidine residues, an aspartate, and a conserved serine, which are crucial for enzyme activity (Yi2022Alkaline).

The tertiary structure of ACER3 includes a catalytic Zn2+ binding site, and a Ca2+ binding site that is physically and functionally connected to the Zn2+ site, suggesting a regulatory role in enzymatic activity (Bielsa2021Discovery; Yi2022Alkaline). The protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, with its N-terminus exposed to the cytoplasm and the C-terminus facing the lumen (Bielsa2021Discovery).

Mutational analysis has shown that alterations in the conserved serine residue, specifically Ser77, significantly impact ceramidase activity, highlighting its importance in the protein's function (Yi2022Alkaline). The protein's structure and function are influenced by Ca2+, which may play a role in its tertiary structure (MAO2008Ceramidases:).

## Function
ACER3 encodes alkaline ceramidase 3, an enzyme that hydrolyzes unsaturated long-chain ceramides, including C18:1, C20:1, and C20:4 ceramides, as well as dihydroceramides and phytoceramides. This enzyme is distinct in its substrate specificity, as it does not act on the major mammalian ceramide species (Hu2010Alkaline). ACER3 is primarily localized to the Golgi complex and the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a critical role in regulating the levels of these ceramides and their derivatives, such as sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (Xu2021Alkaline; Hu2010Alkaline).

The activity of ACER3 is crucial for maintaining ceramide homeostasis, which influences cell proliferation and apoptosis. Its activity is inversely correlated with the levels of unsaturated long-chain ceramides in cells, suggesting a role in maintaining lipid raft integrity in the plasma membrane (Hu2010Alkaline). ACER3 also coordinates with ACER2 to regulate cell proliferation and survival, as its knockdown leads to the up-regulation of ACER2, which affects the levels of non-unsaturated long-chain ceramide species (Hu2010Alkaline).

In the brain, ACER3 is involved in preventing the accumulation of ceramides, particularly in the cerebellum, thereby protecting against neurodegeneration and maintaining normal brain function (Wang2015Alkaline).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACER3 gene are associated with a rare form of inherited leukoencephalopathy, a neurogenetic disorder affecting the central nervous system's white matter. These mutations lead to neurological manifestations such as developmental regression, dystonia, spasticity, and seizures. Imaging findings often reveal abnormal white matter signals, thinning of the corpus callosum, and ventriculomegaly (Dehnavi2021ACER3related). 

The ACER3 gene encodes an enzyme crucial for sphingolipid metabolism. Mutations can disrupt this process, resulting in the accumulation of sphingolipids and long-chain ceramides in the brain and blood, which contributes to the observed neurological symptoms (Dehnavi2021ACER3related). 

A specific mutation, p.Glu33Gly (E33G), has been identified in patients with progressive leukodystrophy, leading to the inactivation of ACER3's catalytic function. This results in altered sphingolipid metabolism, with increased levels of ceramides and sphingolipids in the blood (Edvardson2016Deficiency). 

ACER3-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by progressive neurological decline, motor impairments, and systemic features such as feeding difficulties and high blood lactate levels (Dehnavi2021ACER3related).
