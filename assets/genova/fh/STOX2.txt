# STOX2

## Overview
STOX2, or storkhead box 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the TGF-β signaling pathway. The protein product of STOX2, also named storkhead box 2, is characterized by a winged helix domain, which facilitates its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Renz2020Inhibition; renz2019time). This transcription factor is implicated in the regulation of pluripotency and differentiation in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), where it acts as a modulator and cofactor for SMAD2/4, key components of the TGF-β pathway (Renz2020Inhibition; renz2019time). STOX2's involvement extends to interactions with other signaling pathways, such as WNT, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (renz2019time). Clinically, alterations in STOX2 expression have been linked to conditions like pre-eclampsia and hydatidiform moles, underscoring its significance in reproductive health (Guo2022miR30a; Oudejans2016Noncoding).

## Structure
The STOX2 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a winged helix domain, which is involved in DNA binding (Renz2020Inhibition; renz2019time). This domain is located near the N-terminus of the protein and is conserved across mammals, indicating its importance in the protein's function (renz2019time). The primary structure of STOX2 includes 926 amino acids, as annotated in its transcript (Oudejans2016Noncoding).

The inclusion of an additional exon, known as exon 3B, in the STOX2 transcript can lead to a truncated protein due to the introduction of a stop codon. This results in the deletion of a conserved domain of 64 amino acids in the C-terminal region, affecting the protein's molecular structure (Oudejans2016Noncoding). The presence of different isoforms of the STOX2 protein is noted, although specific details on their structures are not provided (Oudejans2016Noncoding).

STOX2 is also involved in TGF-β signaling, where it may interact with SMAD2, suggesting a role in forming protein complexes, although specific quaternary structures are not detailed (Renz2020Inhibition). The protein's localization changes during cellular differentiation, indicating a dynamic role in cellular processes (renz2019time).

## Function
STOX2 is a gene that plays a significant role in TGF-β signaling, particularly in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It acts as a novel modulator and cofactor for SMAD2/4, which are key components of the TGF-β pathway. STOX2 is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of SMAD2 and SMAD4 proteins, as its suppression leads to decreased protein levels without affecting mRNA levels, suggesting a role in protein stability (Renz2020Inhibition; renz2019time).

STOX2 is primarily located in the cytoplasm but can translocate to the nucleus during specific differentiation processes, such as neuroectoderm specification, indicating its involvement in neuronal tissue development (renz2019time). It is directly regulated by TGF-β signaling, with SMAD2 binding to its promoter and enhancer regions, and its expression is modulated by lineage-specific transcription factors (Renz2020Inhibition; renz2019time).

In addition to its role in TGF-β signaling, STOX2 is implicated in the regulation of pluripotency and differentiation in hESCs, as it is integrated into the pluripotency network through interactions with factors like OCT4 and NANOG (Renz2020Inhibition). Its expression is also influenced by WNT signaling, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (renz2019time).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the STOX2 gene have been implicated in several conditions, most notably pre-eclampsia and hydatidiform moles. In Finnish pre-eclamptic patients, specific mutations in the STOX2 gene, particularly in the non-coding RNA STOX2-IT3-lncRNA and a superenhancer region within intron 1, have been identified. These mutations lead to a gain-of-function effect, resulting in increased expression of STOX2 transcripts and the inclusion of an additional exon (3B) that introduces a stop codon, potentially affecting trophoblast differentiation and placental development (Oudejans2016Noncoding).

In the context of hydatidiform moles, STOX2 is targeted by miR-30a, a microRNA that typically acts as a tumor suppressor. Low expression of miR-30a leads to increased STOX2 levels, promoting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of trophoblastic cells through the ERK, AKT, and P38 signaling pathways. This interaction suggests that STOX2 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of hydatidiform moles, with its overexpression contributing to the abnormal proliferation of trophoblastic cells (Guo2022miR30a; Guo2021STOX2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of STOX2 in both pre-eclampsia and gestational trophoblastic diseases.

## Interactions
STOX2 (storkhead box 2) is involved in several interactions within the TGF-β signaling pathway, particularly in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It is directly regulated by TGF-β signaling and interacts with SMAD proteins, which are key mediators of this pathway. STOX2 has been shown to physically interact with SMAD2, potentially forming a complex in a TGF-β dependent manner, although it remains unclear if this interaction is direct or mediated by other proteins (Renz2020Inhibition; renz2019time). 

Immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that STOX2 can precipitate with SMAD2, suggesting a role in stabilizing the SMAD complex, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of TGF-β target genes such as LEFTY1 and NODAL (Renz2020Inhibition; renz2019time). Despite the interaction with SMAD2, STOX2 does not appear to affect the mRNA levels of SMAD2 and SMAD4, but it does influence their protein stability and phosphorylation, indicating a post-transcriptional regulatory role (Renz2020Inhibition; renz2019time).

STOX2 is also suggested to be regulated by other pathways, such as WNT signaling, as indicated by β-catenin binding to its promoter and enhancer regions, highlighting its potential involvement in multiple signaling networks (renz2019time).
