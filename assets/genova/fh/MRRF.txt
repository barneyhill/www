# MRRF

## Overview
The MRRF gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor, a protein integral to the mitochondrial protein synthesis process. This protein is classified as a GTP-binding protein and is essential for the recycling phase of mitochondrial translation, where it facilitates the disassembly of mitoribosomes post-protein synthesis. By stabilizing the rotational conformational state of mitoribosomes and weakening specific subunit bridges, MRRF ensures the efficient dissociation of ribosomal complexes, thereby preventing premature reassociation and maintaining mitochondrial function (Wang2021Mitochondrial). The protein's interaction with elongation factor EF-G2 mt is crucial for ribosome recycling, underscoring its role in cellular survival and mitochondrial health (Christian2012Mechanism). Deficiencies in MRRF can lead to significant mitochondrial dysfunction, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wang2021Mitochondrial).

## Function
The MRRF gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor, a protein essential for the recycling phase of mitochondrial protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, MRRF plays a critical role in the disassembly of mitoribosomes after the completion of protein synthesis. This process is vital for preparing ribosomal subunits for subsequent rounds of translation, thereby maintaining efficient mitochondrial protein synthesis and overall mitochondrial function (Hughes2024Illuminating; Wang2021Mitochondrial).

MRRF is a GTP-binding protein that stabilizes the rotational conformational state of mitoribosomes and weakens specific subunit bridges, facilitating the dissociation of the ribosomal complex (Wang2021Mitochondrial). This activity is crucial for preventing the premature reassociation of ribosomal subunits, ensuring accurate and efficient protein synthesis within mitochondria (Wang2021Mitochondrial).

In human cell lines, MRRF is indispensable for survival, as its depletion leads to severe mitochondrial abnormalities, including mitoribosome aggregation and increased mitochondrial superoxide production. These defects result in the loss of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex, decreased growth rates, and cell death, highlighting the protein's importance in maintaining mitochondrial health and preventing dysfunction (Wang2021Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
The mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor (MRRF) plays a crucial role in the disassembly of the ribosome complex during mitochondrial protein synthesis. It interacts with the elongation factor EF-G2 mt (also known as RRF2 mt) to promote the dissociation of ribosomal subunits and the release of deacylated tRNA and mRNA, facilitating ribosome recycling for subsequent rounds of protein synthesis (Christian2012Mechanism). This interaction is essential for ribosome recycling, although GTP hydrolysis by EF-G2 mt is not directly necessary for ribosomal splitting but may be required for the release of EF-G2 mt and MRRF (Christian2012Mechanism).

MRRF is also part of the CLPX network, with interactions documented through coexpression and genomic neighbors in other organisms. However, these interactions are not conserved for CLPX in other species, as noted for CLPP (Auburger2022The). Despite being part of the CLPX network, MRRF was not detected in the proteome profiles of CLPP-deleted hearts in Mus musculus, suggesting that its interactions may not be prominent or detectable under certain conditions (Auburger2022The). The specific interactions of MRRF with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context.
