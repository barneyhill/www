# LEFTY2

## Overview
LEFTY2 is a gene that encodes the protein left-right determination factor 2, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of left-right asymmetry during embryonic development and is involved in various cellular processes, including the inhibition of TGF-beta signaling pathways. Unlike other TGF-beta family members, the LEFTY2 protein is unique in its monomeric form due to the absence of a cysteine residue necessary for dimerization (Cheng2004Lefty; Tabibzadeh2002Homeostasis). Functionally, LEFTY2 acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation and migration, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the prevention of fibrosis by modulating the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway (Yang2020LEFTY2). Additionally, LEFTY2 is implicated in reproductive processes and has been associated with various pathological conditions, including developmental anomalies and cancer, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Antony2022Spectrum; Gambichler2020Expression).

## Structure
LEFTY2 is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily and is involved in left-right asymmetry determination. The protein is characterized by a unique structure compared to other TGF-beta family members. It contains most of the conserved cysteine residues necessary for forming the cysteine knot structure, typical of TGF-beta related proteins. However, LEFTY2 has an additional cysteine residue 12 amino acids upstream from the first conserved cysteine, similar to TGF-beta, inhibins, and GDF-3 (Tabibzadeh2002Homeostasis). Unlike other TGF-beta family members, LEFTY2 lacks the cysteine residue necessary for forming intermolecular disulfide bonds, which means it does not dimerize and exists as a monomer (Cheng2004Lefty; Tabibzadeh2002Homeostasis).

LEFTY2 is secreted as two cleaved products of 28 and 34 kD due to the presence of two RXXR cleavage sites, RGKR and RHGR, with PC5A mediating cleavage at the RGKR site (Tabibzadeh2002Homeostasis). The protein contains five putative GSK-3β phosphorylation motifs, which are involved in its posttranslational regulation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Fei2017A). LEFTY2 is 366 amino acids long and shares 97% identity with LEFTY1, with 350 identical residues (Fei2017A).

## Function
LEFTY2, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, plays a significant role in regulating cellular processes by inhibiting the TGF-beta signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, LEFTY2 acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation and migration, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular function and preventing excessive fibrogenic activity (Yang2020LEFTY2). LEFTY2 achieves this by interacting with the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway, a key pathway involved in fibrosis and tissue remodeling. By inhibiting this pathway, LEFTY2 helps to suppress the activation of hepatic stellate cells and the expression of fibrosis-associated genes, such as α-SMA and COL1a1, which are typically upregulated in fibrotic conditions (Yang2020LEFTY2).

LEFTY2 is also involved in the homeostasis of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which are essential for TGF-beta signaling. This inhibition reduces collagen synthesis and promotes ECM degradation, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing fibrosis (Tabibzadeh2002Homeostasis). These functions highlight the importance of LEFTY2 in regulating cellular and tissue dynamics in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LEFTY2 gene have been implicated in various developmental and pathological conditions. LEFTY2 plays a critical role in establishing left-right asymmetry during embryonic development. Disruptions in its expression can lead to laterality defects, such as situs inversus, where the positioning of organs is mirrored, and congenital heart defects. Studies have shown that LEFTY2 is involved in the regulation of left-right patterning and cardiac looping, with abnormal expression linked to these developmental anomalies (Liu2022LOF; Antony2022Spectrum).

In the context of cancer, LEFTY2 expression has been associated with tumor progression and prognosis. In Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), low expression of LEFTY is significantly correlated with MCC-specific death, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Gambichler2020Expression). In glioblastoma, LEFTY expression is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, contributing to tumor cell survival and proliferation, indicating its involvement in tumor aggressiveness (Matsumoto2020Requirements). These findings highlight the complex role of LEFTY2 in both developmental processes and cancer, where its dysregulation can lead to significant clinical outcomes.

## Interactions
LEFTY2, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions that modulate signaling pathways. It acts as an antagonist to Nodal signaling by interacting with EGF-CFC coreceptors, such as Cripto and Oep, which are necessary for Nodal and Vg1/GDF1 signaling. This interaction prevents these ligands from binding to their coreceptors, thereby inhibiting their signaling pathways (Cheng2004Lefty). LEFTY2 does not affect Activin signaling, which is independent of EGF-CFC coreceptors, highlighting its specificity in targeting EGF-CFC-dependent pathways (Cheng2004Lefty).

In the context of liver fibrosis, LEFTY2 interacts with the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway. It inhibits the phosphorylation of Smad3, a critical step in the activation of this pathway, thereby reducing the expression of fibrogenic factors such as α-SMA and COL1a1 in hepatic stellate cells (Yang2020LEFTY2). This interaction suggests a potential therapeutic role for LEFTY2 in modulating fibrotic responses by blocking TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling (Yang2020LEFTY2).

LEFTY2 also plays a role in endometrial receptivity by downregulating ORAI1 expression, which affects calcium signaling pathways crucial for embryo implantation (Salker2017LEFTY2). This interaction highlights its involvement in reproductive processes by modulating calcium ion concentration and related gene expression (Salker2017LEFTY2).
