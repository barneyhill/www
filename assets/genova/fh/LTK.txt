# LTK

## Overview
The LTK gene encodes the leukocyte receptor tyrosine kinase, a receptor tyrosine kinase that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as secretion and proteostasis. As a kinase, the protein is involved in the regulation of ER-to-Golgi trafficking, influencing the formation and function of ER exit sites, which are crucial for the export of secretory cargo (Centonze2019LTK). LTK's interactions with proteins such as Sec12 and its involvement in the phosphorylation of signaling molecules highlight its importance in cellular signaling pathways (Centonze2019LTK). Additionally, LTK is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including neuronal development, autoimmunity, and cancer, with its expression noted in the adult hippocampus and immune cells (Zhang2014Deorphanization).

## Function
The LTK (leukocyte receptor tyrosine kinase) gene encodes an ER-resident receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating secretion and proteostasis in healthy human cells. LTK is involved in the regulation of ER-to-Golgi trafficking, influencing the number of ER exit sites (ERES) and the efficiency of ER export. It interacts with and phosphorylates Sec12, a type-II transmembrane protein that acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Sar1, which is essential for the formation of COPII vesicles at ER exit sites. These vesicles are responsible for transporting secretory cargo out of the ER (Centonze2019LTK).

LTK's role in ER export is further supported by its effect on the dynamics of Sar1A, where LTK inhibition reduces the mobile fraction of Sar1, indicating reduced exchange activity. This suggests that LTK is integral to the regulation of ER export and trafficking processes (Centonze2019LTK). LTK is also implicated in various biological processes, including autoimmunity, neuronal development, and cancer, with its expression observed in the adult hippocampus and immune cells (Zhang2014Deorphanization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LTK gene have been implicated in resistance to targeted cancer therapies, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the CLIP1-LTK fusion. This fusion acts as an oncogenic driver, leading to constitutive activation of LTK and promoting tumorigenesis. The CLIP1-LTK fusion is present in approximately 0.4% of NSCLC cases and is mutually exclusive with other known oncogenic drivers (Izumi2021The). 

Lorlatinib, a third-generation ALK inhibitor, has shown effectiveness against NSCLC with the CLIP1-LTK fusion due to the high sequence identity between LTK and ALK in their kinase domains. However, resistance to lorlatinib can develop through mutations in the LTK kinase domain, such as L650F, G596R, and G663A, which reduce the drug's binding affinity and efficacy (Mori2024LTK). 

Gilteritinib has been identified as a potential treatment to overcome resistance mediated by these mutations, particularly the L650F mutation, by effectively inhibiting LTK phosphorylation and inducing apoptosis in resistant cells (Mori2024LTK). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LTK mutations in the context of targeted cancer therapies.

## Interactions
Leukocyte receptor tyrosine kinase (LTK) participates in several interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling. LTK interacts with secreted midkine, a heparin-binding cytokine, to promote the survival of migrating neural crest cells. This interaction is essential for preventing apoptosis in these cells, suggesting that midkine acts as a ligand for LTK, triggering intracellular pathways that support cell survival and migration (Vieceli2018Leukocyte).

LTK also interacts with FAM150A and FAM150B, identified as ligands through a signaling screen of the extracellular proteome. FAM150A binds to the extracellular domain of LTK with high affinity, significantly inducing LTK phosphorylation, which is a key step in activating downstream signaling pathways (Zhang2014Deorphanization).

In addition to these ligand interactions, LTK is involved in intracellular signaling through its interaction with adaptor proteins such as Grb2 and Shc. These interactions facilitate the activation of the Ras signaling pathway, which is important for cell growth and survival. LTK phosphorylates IRS-1 at tyrosine 485, which is crucial for its association with Grb2 and Syp, indicating that LTK utilizes similar signaling molecules as the insulin receptor system (Ueno1996Growth).
