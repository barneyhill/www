# ARHGAP11B

## Overview
ARHGAP11B is a human-specific gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 11B, which plays a pivotal role in the development of the human neocortex. This gene emerged from a partial duplication of the ARHGAP11A gene approximately 5 million years ago, resulting in a protein with unique structural and functional properties (Heide2021HumanSpecific). The ARHGAP11B protein is characterized by its mitochondrial localization and its involvement in neocortical expansion through the promotion of basal progenitor proliferation, particularly basal radial glia (bRG) (Xing2024Functional; Namba2020HumanSpecific). Unlike its paralog ARHGAP11A, ARHGAP11B lacks RhoGAP activity due to a truncated GAP domain, which instead facilitates interactions with mitochondrial proteins such as the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) (Namba2020HumanSpecific). These interactions are crucial for modulating mitochondrial function and enhancing metabolic pathways that support neural progenitor proliferation, contributing to the increased complexity and surface area of the human neocortex, which is associated with advanced cognitive functions (Dehay2020Evolution).

## Structure
The ARHGAP11B protein is a human-specific protein that arose from a partial duplication of the ARHGAP11A gene. It has a unique molecular structure that contributes to its function in expanding neocortical progenitors. The protein contains three functional domains: an N-terminal domain necessary for mitochondrial localization, a middle domain with a truncated GAP domain, and a C-terminal domain with a 47 amino acid human-specific sequence (Namba2020HumanSpecific).

The N-terminal domain includes a mitochondrial targeting sequence within the first 30 amino acids, which is crucial for its import into mitochondria (Namba2020HumanSpecific). The middle domain retains a portion of the GAP domain from ARHGAP11A but is truncated, resulting in the loss of RhoGAP activity. This truncated GAP domain interacts with the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) in mitochondria, affecting mitochondrial function (Namba2020HumanSpecific).

The C-terminal domain is unique to humans and results from a single nucleotide substitution that creates a novel splice donor site, leading to a frameshift and a unique sequence (Florio2016A). This domain is essential for the protein's role in mitochondrial function and neocortical development (Namba2020HumanSpecific). The ARHGAP11B protein does not exhibit nuclear localization signals, differentiating it from its paralog ARHGAP11A (Namba2020HumanSpecific).

## Function
ARHGAP11B is a human-specific gene that plays a crucial role in the development and expansion of the human neocortex. It arose from a partial duplication of ARHGAP11A approximately 5 million years ago and is primarily expressed in the ventricular and subventricular zones during fetal neocortex development (Heide2021HumanSpecific). The protein encoded by ARHGAP11B is localized in mitochondria, where it interacts with the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) to inhibit the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This interaction increases intramitochondrial calcium levels and promotes glutaminolysis, a metabolic pathway that enhances the proliferation of basal progenitors, particularly basal radial glia (bRG) (Xing2024Functional; Heide2021HumanSpecific).

ARHGAP11B's activity in mitochondria is essential for the amplification of basal progenitors, which are critical for the production of neurons in the developing neocortex. This gene's function is enhanced by the ape-specific protein GLUD2, which also operates in mitochondria and catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG), further supporting the increased proliferative capacity of neural progenitors (Xing2024Functional). The gene's role in promoting the proliferation of bRGs contributes to the increased surface area and complexity of the human neocortex, which is associated with advanced cognitive functions (Dehay2020Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
The ARHGAP11B gene is associated with several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders due to its role in brain development and function. Alterations in the ARHGAP11B gene, such as duplications or deletions, have been linked to early-onset bipolar disorder (EOB) and schizophrenia. A duplication in the 15q13.3 region, which includes ARHGAP11B, has been identified in patients with EOB, manifesting symptoms like social isolation and mood disorders. This duplication is considered probably pathogenic for schizophrenia, suggesting a significant role in psychiatric conditions (Gregoric2021CNVs).

In autism, ARHGAP11B is implicated through copy number variations (CNVs) that affect its expression levels. Higher CN states of ARHGAP11B are associated with enhanced brain stem cell formation and an enlarged brain phenotype, characteristics observed in autism. These CNVs, particularly duplications, are frequent in certain populations and contribute to the susceptibility to autism when combined with other genetic mutations (Agarwala2020Identification).

Additionally, ARHGAP11B deletions are often found alongside CHRNA7 microduplications, increasing the risk for various neurological phenotypes, including intellectual disability and language impairment (Chilian2013Dysfunction). These genetic alterations highlight the clinical significance of ARHGAP11B in neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
ARHGAP11B, a human-specific protein, is known for its interactions with mitochondrial proteins, particularly the adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2). This interaction is facilitated through the truncated GAP domain of ARHGAP11B and is crucial for its role in mitochondrial processes related to neocortical development (Namba2020HumanSpecific). The interaction with ANT2 is significant as it delays the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which increases mitochondrial calcium concentration. This increase activates α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, enhancing the TCA cycle and promoting glutaminolysis, a metabolic pathway critical for the proliferation of basal progenitors (BPs) (Namba2020HumanSpecific).

ARHGAP11B's interaction with ANT2 was confirmed through various experimental methods, including pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation experiments. These studies demonstrated that ARHGAP11B directly binds to ANT2, both in vitro and in living cells (Namba2020HumanSpecific). The interaction does not affect the ADP/ATP translocation activity of ANT but specifically influences the regulation of the mPTP, highlighting its role in mitochondrial regulation (Namba2020HumanSpecific). This interaction is essential for the protein's function in expanding neocortical progenitors by promoting glutaminolysis (Namba2020HumanSpecific).
