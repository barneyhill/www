# ENPP6

## Overview
ENPP6 is a gene that encodes the protein ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 6, which is a member of the phosphodiesterase family. This enzyme is characterized by its choline-specific glycerophosphodiester-phosphodiesterase activity, playing a pivotal role in choline metabolism by hydrolyzing glycerophosphocholine to produce choline and glycerol-3-phosphate. The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly within the myelin sheaths of oligodendrocytes, and is crucial for myelin production and maintenance. Additionally, ENPP6 is expressed in the liver and kidneys, where it contributes to lipid metabolism and choline reabsorption, respectively. The enzyme's structure includes a choline-binding pocket, which is essential for its substrate specificity. Alterations in ENPP6 expression have been linked to various diseases, including Niemann-Pick type C disease, low-grade diffuse astrocytomas, and medullary sponge kidney disease, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and its significance in pathological conditions (Morita2016Structure; Granata2021Sphingomyelin).

## Function
ENPP6 is a choline-specific glycerophosphodiester-phosphodiesterase that plays a crucial role in choline metabolism by hydrolyzing glycerophosphocholine (GPC) to produce choline and glycerol-3-phosphate. This enzymatic activity is essential for the synthesis of choline-containing phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), which are vital components of cell membranes (Morita2016Structure). ENPP6 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the myelin sheaths of oligodendrocytes, where it contributes to myelin production by supplying choline necessary for phospholipid synthesis (Morita2016Structure).

In the liver, ENPP6 is expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells, where it facilitates choline supply for hepatic function, playing a role in lipid metabolism and preventing conditions such as fatty liver (Morita2016Structure). ENPP6 is also active in the kidney, where it contributes to choline reabsorption by hydrolyzing GPC in primary urine (Morita2016Structure). The enzyme's structure includes a choline-binding pocket formed by conserved tyrosine and glutamic acid residues, which is crucial for its substrate specificity and function (Morita2016Structure).

## Clinical Significance
ENPP6 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, ENPP6 is significantly downregulated in the corpus callosum of affected mice. This downregulation is associated with disrupted myelination and hypomyelination, suggesting a critical role for ENPP6 in maintaining normal myelin structures (Yang2019Proteomics).

In low-grade diffuse astrocytomas, ENPP6 is overexpressed at the protein level, although this overexpression is not supported at the transcript level. This discrepancy highlights ENPP6 as a potential biomarker for these tumors, with immunohistochemistry confirming its overexpression in 30% of cases (Polisetty2016Microsomal).

In medullary sponge kidney (MSK) disease, ENPP6 is deregulated in the urine of patients and upregulated in plasma. This alteration suggests a significant role for ENPP6 in the pathophysiology of MSK, potentially linked to its involvement in sphingomyelin metabolism (Granata2021Sphingomyelin). These findings indicate that ENPP6 may play diverse roles in different pathological contexts, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.
