# C6orf15

## Overview
C6orf15, or chromosome 6 open reading frame 15, is a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 6. It encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by C6orf15 is implicated in several signaling pathways, including the WNT/β-catenin pathway, which plays a significant role in cell proliferation and differentiation (Yu2024C6orf15). Research has highlighted its involvement in oncogenic processes, particularly in colorectal and liver cancers, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis (Xiong2023C6orf15; Yu2024C6orf15). Additionally, genetic variants of C6orf15 have been associated with type 2 diabetes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this condition (Barbitoff2018Identification). Despite these associations, further studies are required to fully understand the functional mechanisms of the C6orf15 protein and its broader implications in human health and disease.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
C6orf15 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels or genetic mutations. In colorectal cancer (CRC), C6orf15 is associated with liver metastasis and poor prognosis. Studies have shown that C6orf15 is more highly expressed in metastatic liver lesions compared to primary colon cancer lesions, and its expression is linked to advanced tumor stages and lower survival rates in CRC patients (Yu2024C6orf15). The gene promotes CRC progression through the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis (Yu2024C6orf15).

In colon cancer, high expression levels of C6orf15 are correlated with deeper tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis, indicating a poor prognosis. The gene is involved in oncogenic signaling pathways such as ECM-receptor interaction and Hedgehog signaling (Xiong2023C6orf15).

C6orf15 has also been identified as a potential marker for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a Russian population, with specific genetic variants like rs2233984 being associated with the disease (Barbitoff2018Identification). In liver cancer, C6orf15 expression levels have been linked to overall survival, with high expression associated with prolonged survival in female mice models (Oh2021Estrogen).
