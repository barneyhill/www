# UCN

## Overview
The UCN gene encodes the peptide hormone urocortin, which is a member of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family. Urocortin is primarily involved in stress-related physiological processes and plays a significant role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. It is categorized as a peptide hormone and functions by binding to CRF receptors, particularly CRHR1 and CRHR2, which are G-protein-coupled receptors. This interaction initiates various signaling pathways that influence cardiovascular and neuroendocrine functions. Urocortin is known for its cardioprotective properties, reducing oxidative stress and myocardial damage, and is also involved in modulating immune responses through interleukin-6 secretion. Its expression is regulated by estrogens, contributing to gender differences in stress responses (Haeger2006Estrogen; Barry2010New; Kageyama2006Urocortin).

## Structure
The human Urocortin (UCN) protein is a member of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family and exhibits a primarily alpha-helical secondary structure. The NMR analysis of UCN reveals that its backbone adopts a helix-loop-helix motif, with the C-terminal helices being amphipathic, which facilitates interaction with the extracellular domain of CRF receptors (Grace2007Common). The N-terminal helices are involved in receptor activation, while the C-terminal helices contribute to receptor binding (Grace2007Common).

The tertiary structure of UCN is characterized by its amphipathic alpha-helices, which are crucial for its interaction with CRF receptors. These helices are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and possibly disulfide bonds, although specific details on disulfide linkages are not provided in the context (Pal2012Structure). The presence of a small curvature in the C-terminal helix is noted, which may influence its binding properties (Grace2007Common).

Post-translational modifications, such as amidation at the C-terminus, are common in UCN and related peptides, potentially affecting their structural conformation and receptor interaction (Grace2007Common). The structural integrity and ligand specificity of UCN are further supported by conserved structural features within the CRF family (Pal2012Structure).

## Function
Urocortin (UCN) is a peptide hormone that is part of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family, which plays a significant role in stress-related activities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In healthy human cells, UCN is involved in various physiological processes, particularly in the cardiovascular system. It binds to CRF receptors, specifically CRF 2β, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels and the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in aortic smooth muscle cells. This interaction suggests a role in modulating IL-6 levels, which are important in vascular processes and the interaction between the neuroendocrine and immune systems (Kageyama2006Urocortin).

UCN also provides cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by reducing infarct size and enhancing cardiac function. It modulates gene expression related to cell death, oxidative stress, and metabolism, influencing G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. UCN reduces oxidative stress and free radical damage following myocardial infarction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for heart protection (Barry2010New).

In the brain, UCN is expressed in various regions, including the hypothalamus, where it is involved in stress responses. It is regulated by estrogens, which differentially affect its transcriptional activity through estrogen receptors α and β, contributing to gender differences in stress responses (Haeger2006Estrogen).

## Interactions
Urocortin (UCN) interacts with corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors, particularly CRHR1 and CRHR2, which are G-protein-coupled receptors involved in various physiological processes. UCN1 binds with high affinity to both CRHR1 and CRHR2, while UCN2 and UCN3 are selective agonists for CRHR2 (Squillacioti2019Urocortins). These interactions initiate signaling cascades involving several kinases, such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase B/Akt (Akt), protein kinase C (PKC), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which contribute to cardioprotection by modulating apoptosis and cellular metabolism (Davidson2009The).

UCN1 also interacts with the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K ATP) and calcium-insensitive phospholipase A2 (iPLA2), which are involved in cardioprotection during ischemic conditions (Davidson2009The). UCN2 enhances cardiomyocyte contractility through CRHR2 and PKA activation, involving CaMKII and AMPK, and increases phosphorylated AMPK in rat papillary muscle, suggesting its role in cardioprotection (Popov2021Cardioprotective). These interactions highlight the complex network of signaling pathways through which UCN exerts its effects, particularly in stress response and cardiovascular functions.
