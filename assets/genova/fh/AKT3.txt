# AKT3

## Overview
AKT3 is a gene that encodes the protein AKT serine/threonine kinase 3, also known as protein kinase B gamma. This protein is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family and plays a pivotal role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including growth, survival, and metabolism. AKT3 is predominantly expressed in the brain and testes, where it is essential for normal brain development and function. The protein's activity is regulated through phosphorylation, which is necessary for its full activation and function. AKT3's involvement in the regulation of organ size, particularly brain size, underscores its importance in neurodevelopment. Mutations in the AKT3 gene have been linked to several developmental brain disorders and overgrowth syndromes, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Alcantara2017Mutations; Hers2011Akt; Easton2005Role).

## Structure
AKT3, also known as protein kinase B gamma, is a serine/threonine kinase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of AKT3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of AKT3 results in a compact, globular shape, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules and substrates.

AKT3 contains several specific domains critical for its function. These include the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is involved in phospholipid binding, and a central serine/threonine kinase domain, which is responsible for its catalytic activity (Srivastava2019Computationally). The protein also has a small carboxy-terminal regulatory domain that plays a role in its regulation and activation.

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are crucial for AKT3's activation and function. Phosphorylation occurs at specific sites, including the activation loop and the hydrophobic motif, which are necessary for full activation (Matheny2009Current). A splice variant of AKT3 has been identified, which lacks a portion of the hydrophobic domain, potentially altering its functional properties (Matheny2009Current).

## Function
AKT3, also known as protein kinase Bγ, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell growth, survival, and metabolism. In healthy human cells, AKT3 is predominantly expressed in the brain and testes, with significant roles in brain development and function (Hers2011Akt; Easton2005Role). 

AKT3 is involved in the regulation of organ size, particularly influencing brain size by affecting both cell size and number. In mice, the absence of AKT3 results in a significant reduction in brain size, highlighting its importance in normal brain development (Easton2005Role). This regulation is mediated through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, where AKT3 is necessary for the normal phosphorylation of downstream effectors like p70 S6 kinase and ribosomal protein S6, which are critical for postnatal brain growth (Easton2005Role).

AKT3 also plays a role in neuronal cell survival by suppressing apoptosis through various mechanisms, including the inhibition of caspase-9 and altering gene expression (Hers2011Akt). Its activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes such as glucose metabolism and cell proliferation (Easton2005Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AKT3 gene are associated with a range of developmental brain disorders and overgrowth syndromes. These include hemimegalencephaly, megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, and megalencephaly-capillary malformation syndrome (MCAP) (Alcantara2017Mutations; Takagi2017A). The p.E17K mutation in AKT3 is linked to segmental brain malformations such as hemimegalencephaly and has been identified in melanoma tumors, indicating its role in cancer as well (Poduri2012Somatic; Davies2008A). 

AKT3 mutations can be either germline or mosaic, with mosaic mutations often found in surgically removed brain tissues (Alcantara2017Mutations). These mutations lead to increased kinase activity, contributing to the pathological effects observed in these conditions (Alcantara2017Mutations). Gain-of-function mutations, such as p.Glu40Lys, have been associated with megalencephaly and growth hormone deficiency, suggesting a role in pituitary development (Takagi2017A).

Alterations in AKT3 expression levels, such as copy number changes, are linked to brain size anomalies, with deletions causing microcephaly and duplications leading to macrocephaly (Lopes2019The). These genetic variations contribute to intellectual disabilities and developmental delays, highlighting the gene's significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Lopes2019The).

## Interactions
AKT3, a serine/threonine kinase, participates in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One notable interaction is with phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (p-PDK1). AKT3-174aa, a protein encoded by circular AKT3 RNA, competes with AKT isoforms to bind to p-PDK1, inhibiting its activity and reducing AKT kinase activity. This interaction specifically inhibits the phosphorylation of AKT at the Thr308 site, acting as a natural dominant-negative variant of AKT and limiting aberrant activation of p-AKT (Xia2019A).

AKT3 also interacts with the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). This interaction is crucial for the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and cell survival post-irradiation. AKT3 binds to DNA-PKcs, enhancing the activation of both AKT and DNA-PKcs, which contributes to cell proliferation and tumor growth. This interaction is significant in K-RAS-mutated cancer cells, where AKT3, along with AKT1, stimulates proliferation and post-irradiation cell survival (Toulany2017Akt1).

In melanoma, AKT3 phosphorylates various proteins, including V600E B-Raf and TBX3, influencing cell cycle progression and promoting melanoma cell invasion and migration (Madhunapantula2017Targeting).
