# FBN2

## Overview
The FBN2 gene encodes fibrillin-2, a large extracellular glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in connective tissues. Fibrillin-2 is a key component of microfibrils, which are essential for the structural integrity and elasticity of various tissues, including skin, lungs, and blood vessels. The protein is characterized by a high cysteine content and a multidomain structure, including numerous calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domains and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) binding-like domains, which contribute to its structural stability and function (Peeters2022The; Hubmacher2010Microfibrils). Fibrillin-2 interacts with fibrillin-1 to form microfibrils, providing a scaffold for elastin deposition and playing a role in regulating the bioavailability of growth factors such as TGF-β (Davis2012Structure; van2020Role). Mutations in the FBN2 gene are associated with congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint contractures and skeletal abnormalities (Xu2020A; Zhang2023A).

## Structure
Fibrillin-2, encoded by the FBN2 gene, is a large extracellular glycoprotein characterized by a high cysteine content and a multidomain structure. The primary structure of fibrillin-2 consists of 2,889 amino acids, organized into five distinct regions labeled A, B, C, D, and E, with varying degrees of homology to fibrillin-1 (Zhang1994Structure; Frédéric2008TheFBN2gene:). The protein includes 47 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains, most of which are calcium-binding (cbEGF) domains, crucial for structural stabilization and protection against proteolysis (Peeters2022The; Hubmacher2010Microfibrils). These domains contain six highly conserved cysteine residues forming three disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stiffness and rod-like shape (Hubmacher2010Microfibrils).

Fibrillin-2 also contains seven transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) binding-like (TB) domains and two hybrid domains, which are unique to fibrillins and latent TGF-β binding proteins (Peeters2022The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at 12 conserved sites, which are important for protein folding and stability (Frédéric2008TheFBN2gene:). Fibrillin-2 forms microfibrils through heterotypic interactions with fibrillin-1, where the C terminus of fibrillin-1 interacts with the N terminus of fibrillin-2 (Davis2012Structure).

## Function
The FBN2 gene encodes fibrillin-2, a glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in connective tissues. Fibrillin-2 is a major component of microfibrils, which are essential for the structural integrity and elasticity of tissues. It is involved in the assembly of elastic fibers, particularly during early embryonic development, and is expressed in various tissues, including bone, cartilage, and skin (Lee2019Unique; Davis2012Structure).

Fibrillin-2 interacts with fibrillin-1 to form microfibrils, which provide a scaffold for elastin deposition, contributing to the elasticity and flexibility of tissues such as the lungs, skin, and blood vessels (van2020Role). It also plays a role in regulating the bioavailability of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) by interacting with latent TGFβ binding proteins (LTBPs), which is important for processes like mesenchymal cell differentiation and extracellular matrix formation (Davis2012Structure).

In bone development, fibrillin-2 is expressed in osteoblasts and is involved in osteoblast differentiation and maturation, influencing bone formation and health (Lee2019Unique). Its expression is regulated by factors such as relaxin, which can modulate its levels in response to tissue remodeling needs (Samuel2003Relaxin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FBN2 gene are primarily associated with congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), a rare connective tissue disorder. CCA is characterized by joint contractures, arachnodactyly, scoliosis, pectus deformities, and crumpled ears (Xu2020A; Zhang2023A). The condition is caused by mutations that disrupt the stability and expression of fibrillin-2, a protein crucial for the structural integrity of connective tissues (Zhang2023A). These mutations often occur in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains of the FBN2 gene, leading to decreased fiber elasticity and the clinical manifestations of CCA (Xu2020A).

CCA shares some clinical features with Marfan syndrome, such as skeletal abnormalities, but is caused by mutations in a different gene, FBN1 (Gupta2001Ten). Unlike Marfan syndrome, CCA typically lacks ocular and cardiovascular complications (Gupta2001Ten). The mutations in FBN2 can lead to the skipping of specific exons during transcription, resulting in in-frame deletions that contribute to the disease phenotype (Xu2020A; Zhang2023A). These genetic alterations can impair the formation of microfibrils, which are essential for maintaining the elasticity and strength of connective tissues (Sun2022Identification).

## Interactions
Fibrillin-2 (FBN2) is a large extracellular glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the formation of microfibrils, which are essential components of the extracellular matrix. FBN2 interacts with various matrix components, including fibronectin, microfibril-associated glycoproteins, decorin, and versican, forming supramolecular protein assemblies that contribute to tissue homeostasis and elastic fiber formation (van2020Role). FBN2 also binds growth factors such as TGF-β and BMPs, playing a significant role in regulating their bioavailability and activation, which is crucial for processes like tumor angiogenesis and connective tissue disorders (van2020Role; Hubmacher2010Microfibrils).

FBN2 can form heteropolymeric microfibrils with FBN1, although it does not form homopolymeric interactions (Peeters2022The). It interacts with proteins like MFAP5, MFAP2, and ADAMTS17, although studies on these interactions are limited (Peeters2022The). FBN2 also directly interacts with UCMA, a protein involved in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, independent of calcium binding (Lee2019Unique). Additionally, ADAMTS6 binds to and cleaves FBN2 microfibrils, suggesting a role in its proteolytic degradation and regulation of microfibril assembly (Mead2022Proteolysis). These interactions highlight FBN2's multifaceted role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix.
