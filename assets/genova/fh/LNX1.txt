# LNX1

## Overview
LNX1, or Ligand of Numb-Protein X 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The LNX1 protein is characterized by its domain architecture, which includes a RING domain, zinc finger motifs, and multiple PDZ domains, facilitating diverse protein-protein interactions. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, LNX1 is crucial for targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and degradation, thereby regulating intracellular signaling pathways such as Notch signaling. It plays a significant role in synaptic integrity and neurotransmission in the brain, particularly in the hippocampal CA3 region, and is involved in the maturation and maintenance of perisynaptic Schwann cells at the neuromuscular junction. LNX1's interactions extend to various proteins, influencing processes like synaptic function and cancer progression, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene (Young2018LNX1LNX2; Young2005LNX1; Hong2020The).

## Structure
The LNX1 protein is characterized by a unique domain architecture that includes an N-terminal RING domain flanked by zinc finger motifs (ZnFs), a NUMB-binding NPAY motif, four PDZ domains, and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (Young2018LNX1LNX2). The RING domain is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins (Flynn2011Molecular). The PDZ domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, typically binding to the carboxyl-terminal sequence motifs of partner proteins (Young2018LNX1LNX2). 

LNX1 exists in multiple isoforms, such as LNX1p80, LNX1p70, and LNX1p62, which are expressed in different tissues. LNX1p80 is expressed outside the central nervous system, while LNX1p70 and LNX1p62 are primarily found in neurons (Young2018LNX1LNX2; Lenihan2017Proteomic). The LNX1p70 isoform lacks the RING domain but retains the NPAY motif, suggesting it may function as a scaffold to recruit other E3 ligases (Lenihan2017Proteomic). 

The protein's tertiary structure is influenced by its PDZ domains, which form compact, globular units that facilitate interactions with various proteins (Guo2012Proteomics). LNX1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its function and interactions (Hong2020The).

## Function
The LNX1 gene encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. In the brain, LNX1 is essential for maintaining synaptic integrity, particularly in the hippocampal CA3 region, by regulating glycinergic neurotransmission through its interaction with the glycine transporter GlyT2. This interaction leads to GlyT2 degradation, affecting glycine reuptake and synaptic transmission (Hong2020The; de2019E3).

LNX1 also plays a significant role in the formation of functional synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 neurons, which is critical for social recognition memory. It acts as a scaffold, recruiting proteins such as EphB2 and NMDAR subunits to the postsynaptic membrane, thereby facilitating memory formation (Hong2020The). In peripheral tissues, LNX1 is involved in the regulation of ErbB2 receptor levels in perisynaptic Schwann cells, influencing the maturation and maintenance of these cells at the neuromuscular junction (Young2005LNX1).

LNX1's ubiquitin ligase activity extends to the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, including the modulation of Notch signaling through the degradation of the Numb protein, an intracellular Notch inhibitor (Young2018LNX1LNX2).

## Clinical Significance
LNX1 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in protein interactions and signaling pathways. In cancer, LNX1 exhibits dual roles as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene. It is associated with tumor-suppressive functions in colorectal carcinoma by negatively regulating cancer stemness, while its methylation status serves as a diagnostic marker for nasopharyngeal tumors (Hong2020The; Young2018LNX1LNX2). Conversely, LNX1 can act as an oncogene by destabilizing the tumor suppressor p53 through interactions with MDM2 and NUMB, particularly in tumors with wild-type p53 (Hong2020The).

LNX1 is also involved in neurological disorders. Altered expression of LNX1 has been observed in gliomas and other nervous system tumors, where reduced expression is noted (Hong2020The). In the context of infectious diseases, LNX1 influences the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, affecting bacterial survival (Hong2020The).

In terms of chemotherapy resistance, LNX1 overexpression contributes to cisplatin resistance in cancer cells, highlighting its role in oncogenic responses and growth signaling pathways (Jang2021LNX1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LNX1 in disease progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
LNX1, a protein encoded by the human gene LNX1, is involved in numerous protein interactions primarily through its PDZ domains. These domains facilitate the binding of LNX1 to a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in signal transduction and cellular processes. LNX1 interacts with the transcriptional regulator SKIP/SNW1, suggesting a role in NOTCH signaling (Young2018LNX1LNX2). It also binds to NP9, a protein expressed in tumors, and PBK/TOPK, a kinase involved in cancer, leading to PBK's ubiquitination and degradation, which moderates its growth-promoting effects (Young2018LNX1LNX2).

LNX1 is known to interact with c-SRC, enhancing its ubiquitination and potentially targeting it for degradation (Young2018LNX1LNX2). It also binds to RHO-C, affecting AP-1 transcriptional activity, and BCR, a RHOGAP, targeting it for degradation (Young2018LNX1LNX2). LNX1's PDZ domains recognize the carboxy termini of various transmembrane proteins, such as CAR, JAM4, and Claudin-1, and cytosolic proteins like CAST, SKIP, RhoC, and Src (Wolting2011Biochemical).

LNX1 also interacts with proteins involved in synaptic function, such as ERC2 and LIPRIN-α1, which are part of the presynaptic cytomatrix of the active zone complex (Young2018LNX1LNX2). These interactions highlight LNX1's role as a scaffold for multiprotein complexes, facilitating the assembly of signaling complexes regulated by ubiquitylation (Wolting2011Biochemical).
