# PRRG3

## Overview
PRRG3 is a gene that encodes the proline rich and Gla domain 3 protein, a vitamin K-dependent transmembrane protein characterized by its Gla domain, which facilitates calcium ion binding. This protein is integral to coagulation processes and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in protein modification and trafficking, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Afonso2020Genetic). The PRRG3 protein has been associated with various biological processes, including immune response and signal transduction, and has been identified as a potential risk factor for glioblastoma, indicating its role in cancer progression (Li2022Identification). Additionally, its expression in monocyte-like cells within breast tissue suggests a role in cellular heterogeneity and tissue homeostasis (Henry2021Characterization). Despite these findings, the precise functions of PRRG3 in normal human physiology remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research.

## Structure


## Function
PRRG3 (proline rich and Gla domain 3) encodes a vitamin K-dependent transmembrane protein that contains a Gla domain, which is involved in binding calcium ions. This domain is crucial for the protein's role in coagulation processes, which are related to the innate immune system (Afonso2020Genetic). The protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in protein modification and trafficking, contributing to cellular homeostasis and proper physiological outcomes.

In the context of cancer, PRRG3 has been identified as a risk factor for glioblastoma, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains less clear (Li2022Identification). In breast tissue, PRRG3 is expressed in monocyte-like cells, indicating its role in cellular heterogeneity and tissue homeostasis (Henry2021Characterization). Additionally, PRRG3 has been implicated in immune response and signal transduction pathways, highlighting its potential regulatory impact in various biological processes (Afonso2020Genetic). Despite these associations, detailed functional studies in healthy human cells are limited, and further research is needed to fully elucidate its roles.
