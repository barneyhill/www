# CFC1B

## Overview
CFC1B is a gene that encodes the protein cryptic, EGF-CFC family member 1B, which is part of the epidermal growth factor-Cripto/FRL-1/Cryptic (EGF-CFC) family. This protein functions as a co-receptor in the Nodal signaling pathway, playing a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly in the establishment of the left-right axis and body patterning processes such as gastrulation (Shylo2024Decrypting). The CFC1B gene, along with its counterpart CFC1, is crucial for proper embryogenesis, and mutations in these genes have been linked to congenital heart disease and heterotaxy, conditions that arise from disrupted developmental signaling (Shylo2024Decrypting). The evolutionary trajectory of CFC1B indicates its origin from a single ancestral gene in deuterostomes, with subsequent specialization and gene loss events in tetrapods and eutherian mammals, respectively (Shylo2024Decrypting).

## Function
CFC1B, a member of the EGF-CFC family, plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the left-right axis. This gene encodes a protein that functions as a co-receptor in Nodal signaling pathways, which are essential for early embryogenesis and body patterning processes such as gastrulation and left-right patterning (Shylo2024Decrypting). The protein is active in the extracellular space, where it facilitates interactions necessary for proper cellular communication and development (Shylo2024Decrypting).

In humans, the CFC1B gene is part of a duplicated gene pair, with its counterpart being CFC1. Mutations in these genes have been associated with congenital heart disease and heterotaxy, highlighting their importance in left-right patterning (Shylo2024Decrypting). The evolutionary history of CFC1B suggests that it originated from a single ancestral gene in deuterostomes and underwent specialization in tetrapods, with subsequent gene loss and translocation in eutherian mammals (Shylo2024Decrypting). This specialization is evident in the mouse genome, where the homologous genes Cripto and Cryptic have distinct roles in mesoderm formation and left-right patterning, respectively (Shylo2024Decrypting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CFC1B gene are associated with congenital heart defects and laterality disorders, such as heterotaxy syndrome. These conditions arise due to disrupted signaling pathways during embryonic development, particularly affecting the Nodal signaling pathway, which is crucial for proper body patterning processes like gastrulation and left-right patterning (Shylo2024Decrypting). The evolutionary history of the EGF-CFC protein family, to which CFC1B belongs, highlights the gene's role in these developmental processes. In humans, the Cryptic/CFC1 gene underwent duplication, resulting in CFC1B and CFC1, with mutations in these genes reported in patients with congenital heart disease and heterotaxy, underscoring their role in left-right patterning (Shylo2024Decrypting). The study of the EGF-CFC gene family suggests that the evolutionary flexibility of these proteins, despite little sequence conservation beyond the CFC-EGF domain, may contribute to the variability in clinical manifestations associated with CFC1B mutations (Shylo2024Decrypting). Further research is needed to explore the consequences of gene loss and the functions of EGF-CFC genes in different species, which may provide insights into the clinical significance of CFC1B in humans (Shylo2024Decrypting).
