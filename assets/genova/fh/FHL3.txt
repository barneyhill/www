# FHL3

## Overview
FHL3, or Four and a Half LIM Domains 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the LIM-only protein family, characterized by its zinc finger-like LIM domains. These domains are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for the protein's diverse biological functions. The FHL3 protein is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, where it plays a significant role in muscle development and differentiation by acting as a co-activator for transcription factors such as CREB and MyoD. Beyond its involvement in myogenesis, FHL3 functions as a scaffold protein, mediating interactions that influence cell growth, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization. Its role extends to various pathological contexts, including cancer, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or promoter, depending on the cancer type and cellular environment (Li2020FHL3; Huang2022The).

## Structure
The FHL3 protein is a member of the LIM-only protein superfamily, characterized by its multiple LIM domains, which are zinc finger-like structures involved in protein-protein interactions. FHL3 contains four complete LIM domains and an N-terminal half LIM domain, which is a single zinc finger domain (Huang2022The). The LIM domains are composed of two tandemly repeated zinc fingers, rich in cysteines, and contain 55 amino acids each. The consensus sequence for a LIM domain is CX2CX16-23HX2CX2CX2CX16-21CX2, where X represents any amino acid (Huang2022The).

FHL3 has two isoforms, with isoform 1 being 280 amino acids long and isoform 2 being 172 amino acids (Huang2022The). The full-length cDNA of the FHL3 gene encodes a protein of 280 amino acids, with the LIM domains identified as LIM domains I-IV, crucial for the protein's function (Zuo2007Fulllength). The presence of these LIM domains suggests a role in protein-protein interactions, typical for proteins containing such domains (Zuo2007Fulllength).

FHL3 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and cytoskeletal organization (Huang2022The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
FHL3 (four and a half LIM domains 3) is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in muscle development and differentiation. It is a member of the LIM-only protein family, characterized by zinc finger-like LIM domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions. FHL3 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, where it localizes to the Z-line and contributes to myogenesis and muscle reconstruction. It acts as a co-activator for transcription factors such as CREB and MyoD, regulating the expression of myosin heavy chains to promote myoblast differentiation (Huang2022The).

In addition to its role in muscle development, FHL3 is involved in regulating cell growth and signal transduction. It functions as a scaffold protein or adapter molecule, mediating interactions between various proteins and transcription factors. FHL3 can also act as a transcriptional corepressor, influencing cell growth and differentiation by modulating the expression of genes involved in these processes (Huang2022The).

FHL3's involvement in cellular processes extends to its role in inhibiting actin bundle aggregation, suggesting a function in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity. Its expression pattern during in vitro myogenesis is similar to that of FHL1, indicating its importance in muscle development (Huang2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The FHL3 gene is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and breast cancer, FHL3 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation in these cancers is associated with increased cell growth and migration, as it normally inhibits these processes by interacting with the TGFb/Smad signaling pathway and regulating tumor suppressor genes (Huang2022The).

Conversely, FHL3 is upregulated in gastric cancer, glioma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it often promotes tumor progression. In gastric cancer, FHL3 is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemotherapy resistance, correlating with higher TNM stages and worse survival outcomes (Cao2021FHL3). In PDAC, FHL3 prevents the degradation of EMT-associated transcription factors, facilitating cancer invasion and metastasis (Li2020FHL3). In NSCLC, FHL3 promotes tumor growth and invasion, contributing to poorer prognosis (Huang2022The).

These findings suggest that FHL3's role in cancer is context-dependent, acting as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the cancer type and its expression levels (Huang2022The).

## Interactions
FHL3, a member of the LIM-only protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its biological functions. It contains four full LIM domains and an N-terminal half LIM domain, which facilitate these interactions. FHL3 acts as a co-activator for transcription factors such as CREB and MyoD, playing a role in myogenesis and muscle reconstruction by regulating the expression of myosin heavy chains to promote myoblast differentiation (Huang2022The).

In cancer, FHL3 interacts with multiple proteins, affecting cell growth and differentiation. It acts as a transcriptional corepressor with MZF-1 and interacts with Smad2-4 proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma, promoting their phosphorylation and nuclear translocation to regulate tumor suppressor gene expression (Huang2022The). In breast cancer, FHL3 influences cell cycle arrest and the expression of cyclins D1 and B1, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21, through interactions with Smad proteins (Huang2022The).

FHL3 also interacts with angiogenin (Ang), a protein involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis inhibition. This interaction, confirmed through yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and GST pull-down assays, suggests a role for FHL3 in Ang-mediated cellular functions (Xia2012Identification). In pancreatic cancer, FHL3 binds to GSK3β, inhibiting the ubiquitination and degradation of EMT-associated transcription factors like snail1 and twist1, thereby promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Li2020FHL3).
