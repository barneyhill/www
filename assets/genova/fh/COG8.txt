# COG8

## Overview
The COG8 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, which is integral to the function and structural maintenance of the Golgi apparatus in eukaryotic cells. The COG8 protein is part of lobe B of the COG complex and plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of this complex by interacting with other subunits, such as COG1, to form a stable hetero-octameric structure (Foulquier2007A; Blackburn2019Maintaining). Functionally, COG8 is involved in the retrograde transport of proteins from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, ensuring the proper localization and function of glycosylation enzymes, and is also implicated in the assembly of Golgi SNARE complexes, which are essential for vesicle fusion processes (Laufman2013Deficiency; Kranz2007COG8). Mutations in the COG8 gene are linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation, highlighting its critical role in cellular and organismal homeostasis (Foulquier2007A; Kranz2007COG8).

## Function
The COG8 gene encodes a subunit of the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, which is essential for the proper functioning of the Golgi apparatus in human cells. The COG complex is involved in maintaining Golgi structure and function, particularly in glycosylation processes and vesicle-mediated transport (Foulquier2007A; Kranz2007COG8). COG8 is part of lobe B of the COG complex and plays a critical role in the assembly and stability of the entire complex by interacting with other subunits, such as Cog1, to form a stable hetero-octameric structure (Foulquier2007A; Blackburn2019Maintaining).

In healthy cells, COG8 is involved in the retrograde transport of proteins from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, ensuring the proper localization and function of glycosylation enzymes (Kranz2007COG8). It also plays a role in the assembly of Golgi SNARE complexes, which are crucial for vesicle fusion processes within the Golgi (Laufman2013Deficiency). The proper function of COG8 is necessary for maintaining the structural organization of the Golgi and for the correct glycosylation of proteins, which is vital for normal cellular and organismal functions (Kranz2007COG8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COG8 gene are associated with a rare congenital disorder of glycosylation, specifically type IIh (CDG-IIh). This condition is characterized by a range of clinical symptoms, including severe psychomotor retardation, seizures, failure to thrive, and intolerance to wheat and dairy products. Patients with COG8 deficiency often exhibit cerebellar atrophy, hypotonia, growth delay, and short stature (Foulquier2007A; Kranz2007COG8). The disorder results from mutations that lead to a truncated and unstable COG8 protein, which disrupts the stability and assembly of the COG complex, crucial for proper glycosylation processes (Foulquier2007A; Kranz2007COG8).

The COG8 mutations can lead to deficiencies in both N- and O-glycosylation, affecting the sialylation of glycoproteins. This is evidenced by increased non-sialylated species and decreased disialylated species in patient cells (Kranz2007COG8). The glycosylation defects are linked to the mislocalization and degradation of Golgi-associated glycosylation enzymes, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in patients (Foulquier2007A). The condition is extremely rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature (Yang2017Further).

## Interactions
COG8, a component of the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, participates in several critical protein interactions essential for Golgi function and vesicular trafficking. COG8 interacts with various Golgi SNARE proteins, including STX5, STX6, STX16, and GS27, as demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Willett2013COG). These interactions are crucial for the assembly and regulation of SNARE complexes, which are vital for vesicle fusion and trafficking within cells (Willett2013COG).

COG8 is part of Lobe B of the COG complex and interacts with COG1, a component of Lobe A, forming a heterodimeric unit that bridges the two subcomplexes. This interaction is essential for the assembly and stability of the entire COG complex (Foulquier2007A). A mutation in COG8 can disrupt its interaction with COG1, leading to instability and mislocalization of the COG complex, which affects Golgi function (Foulquier2007A).

In Arabidopsis, COG8 interacts directly with COG3, forming a complex that localizes to the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for maintaining Golgi structure and function (Tan2016Arabidopsis). These interactions highlight the role of COG8 in maintaining the structural integrity and functional capacity of the Golgi apparatus across different species.
