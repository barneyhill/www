# CNTROB

## Overview
The CNTROB gene encodes the protein centrobin, which is a centrosomal protein integral to centriole duplication and spindle assembly. Centrobin is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein due to its role in stabilizing microtubules and facilitating centriole biogenesis. It is characterized by a central coiled-coil domain that mediates protein-protein interactions, essential for its function in cellular processes (Jeong2007Characterization; Zou2005Centrobin). The protein is phosphorylated by kinases such as NEK2 and PLK1, which modulate its activity in microtubule stabilization (Kumari2018Regulation; Comartin2016Organizational). Centrobin's involvement in centriole duplication and microtubule dynamics underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Jeong2007Characterization; Gudi2011Centrobin–tubulin).

## Structure
Centrobin, encoded by the CNTROB gene, is a centrosomal protein involved in centriole duplication and microtubule stabilization. The protein is composed of 903 amino acids and features a central coiled-coil domain, which is a structural motif often involved in protein-protein interactions (Jeong2007Characterization; Zou2005Centrobin). This coiled-coil region is flanked by noncoiled regions at the termini, similar to other centrosomal proteins like pericentrin and ninein (Zou2005Centrobin).

Centrobin's C-terminal region is critical for its localization to the centrosome and is sufficient for centrosomal localization (Jeong2007Characterization). The protein is phosphorylated by kinases such as NEK2 and PLK1, which regulate its microtubule-stabilizing activity. PLK1-mediated phosphorylation enhances its ability to stabilize microtubules, while NEK2-mediated phosphorylation has a negative regulatory effect (Kumari2018Regulation; Comartin2016Organizational).

Centrobin also contains specific motifs crucial for its function in DNA repair, including the PP4-binding FRVP motif and the ATR kinase recognition SQ sequence (RéthiNagy2023Protein). These motifs are important for its interaction with Protein Phosphatase 4 and its role in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair (RéthiNagy2023Protein).

## Function
Centrobin, encoded by the CNTROB gene, is a crucial protein involved in centriole duplication, elongation, and stability in human cells. It is specifically associated with daughter centrioles and plays a vital role in the early stages of centriole biogenesis. Centrobin is recruited to the centriole biogenesis site early in the process, dependent on the presence of hSAS-6, but not on CPAP or CP110 (Gudi2011Centrobin–tubulin). The protein interacts directly with α- and β-tubulin, which is essential for centriole elongation and stability. This interaction is facilitated by a tubulin-binding domain located in the C-terminal region of centrobin (Gudi2011Centrobin–tubulin).

Centrobin is necessary for the recruitment of CP110, indicating its role as an early initiation protein in centriole biogenesis (Gudi2011Centrobin–tubulin). Disruption of the centrobin-tubulin interaction leads to impaired centriole elongation and destabilization, highlighting its importance in maintaining centriole structure and function (Gudi2011Centrobin–tubulin). Centrobin also contributes to the stability of the microtubule network and the assembly of functional mitotic spindles, playing a role in cell cycle progression and genomic stability (Jeong2007Characterization; Gudi2011Centrobin–tubulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CNTROB gene, which encodes the protein centrobin, have been implicated in several reproductive and developmental disorders. In rats, a mutation involving the insertion of a retroviral element into intron 10 of the CNTROB gene leads to the production of truncated centrobin proteins. This mutation disrupts normal spermatogenesis, resulting in male infertility characterized by sperm decapitation and structural abnormalities in the sperm flagellum (Liška2009RathdMutation; Liška2013Overexpression). The mutation also causes limb malformations, which can be corrected by overexpressing full-length centrobin, although male fertility is not restored (Liška2013Overexpression).

The CNTROB gene is also associated with the structural integrity of the head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) in sperm. Defects in this structure due to CNTROB mutations can lead to conditions such as 'easily decapitated sperm syndrome' in humans, which is a form of teratozoospermia (Chang2023Molecular; Liška2009RathdMutation). Additionally, alterations in CNTROB expression have been linked to susceptibility to respiratory infectious diseases, including mumps, as identified in a multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association study (Zhu2023Using). These findings suggest that CNTROB plays a critical role in both reproductive health and disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
CNTROB, also known as centrobin, is a protein that plays a critical role in centriole duplication and stability. It interacts with several proteins, including tubulin, CENPJ, CEP152, and NEK2, which are essential for its function in centriole biogenesis and microtubule dynamics.

CNTROB binds to tubulin through its C-terminal region, which is crucial for centriole elongation and stability. This interaction is necessary for the recruitment of CNTROB to the centriole biogenesis site and is dependent on hSAS-6 but not on CPAP and CP110 (Gudi2011Centrobin–tubulin). Overexpression of a truncated form of CNTROB, known as centrobin-TuBD, disrupts this interaction, leading to centriole destabilization (Gudi2011Centrobin–tubulin).

CNTROB also interacts with CEP152, which is necessary for the recruitment of other proteins like CDK5RAP2 and CENPJ to centrosomes. This interaction is crucial for centriole duplication, as RNAi of CNTROB blocks CENPJ recruitment to centrosomes (Comartin2016Organizational).

Additionally, CNTROB is phosphorylated by NEK2 kinase, which affects its conformation and cellular localization. This phosphorylation is essential for CNTROB's association with microtubules and its role in microtubule stabilization (Jeong2007Characterization; Comartin2016Organizational).
