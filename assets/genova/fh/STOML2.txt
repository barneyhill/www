# STOML2

## Overview
STOML2 is a gene that encodes the protein stomatin-like 2, a member of the stomatin family known for its involvement in membrane organization and ion channel regulation. The protein is characterized by a conserved stomatin domain, which is essential for its function and association with mitochondrial membranes (Gong2023STOML2). Stomatin-like 2 is capable of forming oligomers, a feature that contributes to its quaternary structure and functional role in cellular processes. It undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions with other cellular components (Ma2021STOML2). The protein is implicated in various cellular interactions and signaling pathways, particularly in cancer, where it influences cell proliferation and survival through pathways such as RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK and NF-κB (Zheng2021STOML2). As a result, STOML2 is considered a significant factor in cancer progression and a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Gong2024Overexpressing).

## Structure
STOML2, encoded by the STOML2 gene, is a protein that belongs to the stomatin family, which is known for its role in membrane organization and ion channel regulation. The protein is characterized by a conserved stomatin domain, which is crucial for its function and association with mitochondrial membranes. This domain is a key feature of the protein's molecular structure and contributes to its ability to interact with other membrane components.

STOML2 is capable of forming oligomers, indicating that it possesses a quaternary structure. This oligomerization is significant for its functional role in the cell, as it may influence the protein's stability and interaction with other proteins or membrane structures. The presence of splice variant isoforms suggests that STOML2 can exist in multiple forms, which may affect its function and localization within the cell.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are also associated with STOML2. These modifications can play a role in regulating the protein's activity, stability, and interactions with other cellular components. The combination of these structural features and modifications underscores the complexity and versatility of STOML2 in cellular processes.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STOML2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gliomas, increased STOML2 expression correlates with higher histological malignancy and poorer prognosis, making it an independent prognostic factor. High STOML2 levels are associated with shorter overall survival times in glioma patients (Song2011Knockdown). In colorectal cancer (CRC), STOML2 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. It promotes CRC proliferation through interactions with the protein PHB and activation of the MAPK signaling pathway (Ma2021STOML2). STOML2 also enhances CRC progression by activating the NF-κB pathway, which is crucial for tumor growth and angiogenesis (Gong2023STOML2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), STOML2 is overexpressed and associated with metastasis and poor survival outcomes. It interacts with PINK1 to promote mitophagy, supporting HCC growth and metastasis (Zheng2021STOML2). In multiple myeloma, STOML2 overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation and glycolytic metabolism, with its knockdown leading to reduced viability and increased apoptosis (Zhang2021Expression). STOML2 is also implicated in the pathology of oral squamous cell carcinoma, where it is overexpressed alongside STOML1 (Wang2020Coexisting). These findings suggest that STOML2 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
STOML2 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), STOML2 interacts with prohibitin (PHB), a protein that co-localizes with STOML2 in the cytoplasm of CRC cells. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK signaling pathway, which promotes cell proliferation (Ma2021STOML2). The interaction between STOML2 and PHB has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, highlighting its importance in CRC progression (Ma2021STOML2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), STOML2 interacts with PINK1, a key regulator of mitophagy. This interaction stabilizes PINK1, enhancing PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy, which contributes to cancer growth and metastasis (Zheng2021STOML2). The interaction between STOML2 and PINK1 has been demonstrated through immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, with confocal microscopy showing their co-localization in HCC cells (Zheng2021STOML2).

STOML2 also interacts with the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Death Domain (TRADD) in CRC, promoting the formation of the TRADD-RIP-TRAF2 complex. This interaction is essential for the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is associated with tumor proliferation and angiogenesis (Gong2024Overexpressing).
