# CIR1

## Overview
CIR1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as corepressor interacting with RBPJ, CIR1, which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation. This protein is categorized as a corepressor and is involved in the Notch signaling pathway, where it interacts with RBPJ, a DNA-binding factor. CIR1 is part of a class of ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme variant proteins, although it lacks ubiquitin-conjugating activity. The protein is expressed in all normal human tissues, with varying levels, and is notably upregulated in immortalized and tumor-derived cell lines, suggesting a potential role in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Located on chromosome 20q13.2, a region often amplified in cancers, CIR1 may contribute to cancer development or progression. Additionally, CIR1 is implicated in DNA repair processes, sharing sequence identity with proteins involved in DNA damage protection (Ma1998Upregulation; Xiao1998The).

## Structure
The CIR1 protein, encoded by the human CIR1 gene, plays a role in transcriptional regulation through its interaction with RBPJ, a component of the Notch signaling pathway. The molecular structure of CIR1 includes specific domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, such as coiled-coil regions. These domains are crucial for its function in forming complexes with other proteins.

The primary structure of CIR1 is defined by its amino acid sequence, which dictates the formation of secondary structures like alpha helices and beta sheets. These secondary structures contribute to the protein's overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of CIR1 involves the folding of these helices and sheets into a three-dimensional conformation, which is essential for its interaction with RBPJ and other molecular partners.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the function of CIR1 by altering its interaction capabilities or stability. These modifications can play a significant role in regulating the activity of CIR1 within the cell. While the potential for quaternary structure exists if CIR1 forms complexes, specific details on such structures are not provided in the available information. Understanding these structural aspects is key to comprehending CIR1's role in cellular processes.

## Function
CIR1, also known as CROC1 or UEV-1, is a protein involved in transcriptional regulation and is active in the nucleus of cells. It interacts with RBPJ, a key component of the Notch signaling pathway, acting as a corepressor. CIR1 is implicated in modulating gene expression by influencing chromatin structure, which affects cell differentiation and development. The protein is part of a class of ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme variant proteins, which share sequence similarity with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes but lack ubiquitin-conjugating activity (Ma1998Upregulation).

CIR1 is expressed in all normal human tissues, although expression levels vary significantly. It is notably upregulated in immortalized and tumor-derived human cell lines, suggesting a role in cell proliferation and possibly in tumorigenesis (Ma1998Upregulation). The gene is located on chromosome 20q13.2, a region frequently amplified in various human cancers, indicating its potential involvement in cancer development or progression (Ma1998Upregulation).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, CIR1 is involved in DNA repair processes. It shares significant amino acid sequence identity with hMMS2 and yeast Mms2, suggesting a conserved function in DNA repair and protection from DNA damage (Xiao1998The).

## Interactions
CIR1, a corepressor interacting with RBPJ, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcriptional repression. CIR1 acts as a corepressor by linking the DNA-binding factor CBF1 to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. It interacts with HDAC2 and SAP30, forming a bridge between CBF1 and the HDAC-mSin3-SAP30 complex, which is essential for CBF1-mediated transcriptional repression through chromatin modification (Hsieh1999CIR). The interaction between CIR1 and CBF1 is mediated by the amino-terminal region of CIR, specifically within amino acids 1-121, which is highly conserved between human CIR and its C. elegans homolog (Hsieh1999CIR).

In C. elegans, the homologous protein CIR-1 interacts with LAG-1, the worm ortholog of CBF1, and forms a complex with MOG-3 and MEP-1, indicating a role in epigenetic regulation and germ line development (Kasturi2010The). These interactions suggest that CIR1 and its homologs are integral to the regulation of gene expression through their involvement in multiprotein complexes that modify chromatin structure.
