# EIF3K

## Overview
EIF3K is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit K, a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. This complex is pivotal in the initiation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, facilitating the assembly of the 43S and 48S pre-initiation complexes necessary for mRNA translation (Wagner2020Selective). EIF3K is categorized as a non-essential subunit within the eIF3 complex, yet it plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the complex (Valášek2017Embraced). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of ribosomal protein production and translation efficiency, and it interacts with other proteins such as cyclin D3, influencing cell growth and proliferation (Marchione2013The; Shen2004Identification). Alterations in EIF3K expression have been linked to several diseases, notably cancer, where its dysregulation may affect tumor progression and cell survival mechanisms (Krassnig2021A).

## Function
EIF3K is a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The eIF3 complex is involved in the formation of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) and the 48S PIC, essential for the scanning and recognition of the start codon on mRNA (Wagner2020Selective). EIF3K, along with other subunits, contributes to the structural integrity of the eIF3 complex, which is positioned on the small ribosomal subunit to control initiation reactions (Valášek2017Embraced).

In healthy human cells, EIF3K is part of the octameric assembly of the eIF3 complex, which includes subunits with PCI and MPN domains (Valášek2017Embraced). It is involved in regulating ribosomal protein production and translation efficiency, specifically repressing the synthesis of the small ribosomal protein RPS15A (Herrmannová2023Perturbations). EIF3K is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of protein synthesis, impacting cell growth and proliferation (Marchione2013The). The balance of eIF3 subunits, including EIF3K, is important for maintaining cellular function and translation regulation (Herrmannová2023Perturbations).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF3K gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In gliomas, increased expression of EIF3K has been associated with poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential role in tumor progression and as a prognostic marker (Krassnig2021A). Dysregulation of EIF3K expression can impact cell survival mechanisms, as its depletion in epithelial cells leads to desensitization to apoptotic stimuli and retention of active caspase 3 in cytoplasmic inclusions, which may contribute to cancer cell survival (Valášek2017Embraced).

In the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, loss-of-function mutations in the eif-3.K gene result in a significant extension of lifespan and enhanced resistance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These effects are mediated through pathways involving the Forkhead transcription factor DAF-16, indicating a role for EIF3K in stress response and longevity (Cattie2016Mutations). Although these findings are in a model organism, they suggest that EIF3K may have similar roles in human stress responses and aging, potentially impacting diseases related to these processes. However, the direct clinical significance of EIF3K mutations in human diseases requires further investigation.

## Interactions
EIF3K, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, participates in several protein interactions. It specifically interacts with cyclin D3, but not with other D-type cyclins such as cyclin D1 or D2. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal domain of cyclin D3, and it has been confirmed through various experimental approaches, including yeast two-hybrid systems, GST pull-down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cells (Shen2004Identification).

Within the eIF3 complex, EIF3K is involved in the assembly of the 43S and 48S pre-initiation complexes, although it is considered a non-essential subunit. It forms a dimer with eIF3L, and this dimerization is crucial for their incorporation into the eIF3 complex. The presence of eIF3K and eIF3L is interdependent, as the knockdown of one affects the stability of the other (Herrmannová2019Adapted; Smith2013HumanLike).

EIF3K also interacts with the eIF4F complex within the 48S pre-initiation complex, suggesting a regulatory role in mRNA recruitment during translation initiation. Its peripheral location in the eIF3 complex allows it to modulate translation initiation by interacting with other regulatory factors (Herrmannová2019Adapted).
