# SNTB1

## Overview
The SNTB1 gene encodes the syntrophin beta 1 protein, a member of the syntrophin family, which is characterized by its role as an adaptor protein within the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). Syntrophin beta 1 is distinguished by its domain architecture, which includes pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a PDZ domain, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain, facilitating its involvement in lipid signaling and protein-protein interactions (Bhat2012Syntrophin). This protein is ubiquitously expressed across mammalian tissues and plays a critical role in linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby contributing to cellular stability and signal transduction (Bhat2012Syntrophin). Syntrophin beta 1 is particularly significant in neuromuscular junctions and the retina, where it is involved in the localization and function of ion channels and other membrane proteins, impacting processes such as potassium homeostasis and water regulation (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Rao2019Targeted). Alterations in SNTB1 expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including colorectal cancer, acute pancreatitis, and extreme myopia, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker (Motalebzadeh2020Syntrophin; Tang2019Association; Ye2019β1).

## Structure
Syntrophin beta 1 (SNTB1) is a protein encoded by the SNTB1 gene, characterized by a specific domain organization that includes two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a PDZ domain, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain. The PH domains are involved in binding to membrane lipids and protein oligomerization, with the PH1 domain being split into two halves by the insertion of the PDZ domain, forming a PH N -PDZ-PH C tandem structure (Bhat2012Syntrophin). This unique structure enhances lipid-binding avidity and is crucial for lipid signaling mechanisms (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

The PDZ domain in SNTB1 is essential for protein-protein interactions, recruiting various membrane proteins, ion channels, and kinases to the membrane (Bhat2012Syntrophin). This domain is characterized by seven β-strands and two α-helices, interacting with proteins through PDZ binding motifs (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

SNTB1 is known to interact with dystrophin and related proteins of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), playing a role in cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction (Bhat2012Syntrophin). It is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and is the predominant isoform among the beta syntrophins (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

## Function
The SNTB1 gene encodes the β1-syntrophin protein, which is a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). This protein plays a crucial role in linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby contributing to cell stability and signal transduction. β1-syntrophin is involved in the regulation of ion channels and signaling proteins, particularly through its interactions with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

In healthy human cells, β1-syntrophin is ubiquitously expressed and is predominantly found at the neuromuscular junction folds in skeletal muscle. It binds to dystrophin and related proteins, facilitating the proper targeting of proteins to the postsynaptic membrane (Bhat2012Syntrophin). The protein is also involved in the localization and function of various ion channels, such as the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1, which is crucial for maintaining potassium homeostasis in the retina (Rao2019Targeted).

β1-syntrophin's PDZ domain allows it to interact with other proteins, modulating the actin cytoskeleton and localizing ionic channels, which is essential for cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling (Bhat2012Syntrophin). These interactions are vital for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of cells, particularly in muscle and neuronal tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SNTB1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SNTB1 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with a 3.55-fold increase observed in CRC tumors. This overexpression is associated with advanced tumor stage, metastasis, and poorer disease-free survival, suggesting that SNTB1 could serve as a prognostic marker for CRC metastasis (Motalebzadeh2020Syntrophin; Lu2023Ursolic). Ursolic acid has been shown to inhibit CRC cell growth by targeting SNTB1 and regulating the PKN2/Akt/ERK pathway, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Lu2023Ursolic).

In the context of acute pancreatitis, SNTB1 plays a protective role by supporting autophagy initiation. The absence of SNTB1 in pancreatic acinar cells leads to increased severity of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis, characterized by enhanced cell necrosis and inflammation. This suggests that SNTB1 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tissue damage during pancreatitis (Ye2019β1).

SNTB1 has also been associated with extreme myopia, where a specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene is linked to the condition, highlighting its role in the progression of severe myopia (Tang2019Association).

## Interactions
Syntrophin beta 1 (SNTB1) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its PDZ domain. It binds to the C-terminal sequences of sodium channels (NaChs) in muscle, specifically interacting with the (S/T)XV motif, which is crucial for the localization and function of these channels (Gee1998Interaction). SNTB1 also interacts with the cardiac sodium channel Na v 1.5 through a PDZ domain-binding motif, forming part of a multiprotein complex with dystrophin (Gavillet2006Cardiac).

In the retina, SNTB1 is essential for the localization of the Kir4.1 channel in Müller cell endfeet. The absence of SNTB1 leads to mislocalization of Kir4.1, although the overall protein levels remain unchanged, indicating a specific role in channel anchoring (Rao2019Targeted).

SNTB1 also interacts with aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and is involved in the organization of signaling complexes at the membrane, affecting processes like water homeostasis and potassium buffering in the central nervous system (Bhat2012Syntrophin). Additionally, SNTB1 is implicated in interactions with the ABCA1 transporter protein, influencing cholesterol efflux and lipid homeostasis (Bhat2012Syntrophin).
