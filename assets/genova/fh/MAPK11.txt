# MAPK11

## Overview
MAPK11 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 11, also known as p38β, which is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. This protein functions as a kinase, playing a pivotal role in cellular responses to stress and inflammation by participating in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell survival, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Katopodis2021p38β). MAPK11 is characterized by its kinase domain with a T-G-Y dual phosphorylation motif, essential for its activity, and is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in endothelial cells (Gong2021Design; Katopodis2021p38β). The protein is involved in numerous cellular processes, including immune response and cell cycle regulation, and has been implicated in the progression of several diseases, such as cancer and Huntington's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Roche2020p38β; Yu2017Suppression).

## Structure
MAPK11, also known as p38β, is a protein encoded by the MAPK11 gene and consists of 364 amino acids. It features a kinase domain with a T-G-Y dual phosphorylation motif, which is essential for its kinase activity (Gong2021Design; Katopodis2021p38β). The three-dimensional structure of MAPK11 resembles that of a typical kinase, with a smaller β-sheet N-terminal domain and a larger C-terminal domain. The ATP-binding site is located between these two domains, linked by a single polypeptide chain (Gong2021Design). 

Structurally, MAPK11 is similar to MAPK14, but the relative orientation of the N- and C-terminal domains results in a smaller ATP-binding pocket in MAPK11, which can be exploited for selectivity in inhibitor design (Gong2021Design). MAPK11 can self-activate through autophosphorylation, a feature that distinguishes it from p38α, which requires activation by MKK3/6 (Katopodis2021p38β). The protein is expressed in most organs, with high expression in endothelial cells and low expression in hematopoietic cells (Katopodis2021p38β). The structural differences and phosphorylation capabilities of MAPK11 are crucial for its role in cellular responses to stress and inflammation.

## Function
MAPK11, also known as p38β, is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which plays a crucial role in cellular responses to stress and inflammation. It is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate various cellular processes, including cell survival, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Katopodis2021p38β). MAPK11 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes such as immune response and cell cycle regulation.

In healthy human cells, MAPK11 is activated by environmental stresses and inflammatory cytokines. It is expressed in most organs, with particularly high expression in endothelial cells, and is activated by the upstream kinase MKK6 (Katopodis2021p38β). The protein plays a role in tumor progression by regulating growth factors like TGF-1β and VEGF, as well as oncogenes such as lipocalin 2 (LCN2) (Katopodis2021p38β).

MAPK11 is also involved in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, as demonstrated in breast cancer cells, where it upregulates the expression and secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (He2014MAPK11). This highlights its role in bone metabolism and potential implications in bone-related diseases.

## Clinical Significance
MAPK11, also known as p38β, is implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular stress responses. In Huntington's disease (HD), MAPK11 regulates mutant huntingtin (mHTT) levels by affecting mRNA stability. Knocking down MAPK11 in HD models reduces mHTT levels, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to ameliorate HD symptoms (Yu2017Suppression). 

In cancer, MAPK11 is involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis. It interacts with proto-oncogenes and influences pathways like VEGF signaling, affecting angiogenesis and cancer progression. MAPK11 is linked to various cancers, including pancreatic, hepatocellular, bladder, prostate, and endometrial cancers, where it may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Roche2020p38β). In endometrial carcinoma, MAPK11 counteracts tumor-suppressing effects, promoting cancer progression (Li2019Knocking). 

In female-specific cancers, MAPK11 expression is generally lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, with significant methylation variations observed. Despite downregulation, MAPK11 can self-activate and influence oncogenic pathways, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Katopodis2021p38β).

## Interactions
MAPK11, a member of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase family, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It forms stable complexes with proteins such as MKNK1 and MAPKAP3, and is predicted to be phosphorylated in its T-loop region by associated p38 kinases, indicating its involvement in a regulatory network where MAPK family members are sequentially phosphorylated (Varjosalo2013The). MAPK11 also interacts with candidate substrates like ARHGAP12 and Cul7, which are linked to 3-M syndrome, suggesting its role in the molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder (Varjosalo2013The).

In the context of rice allelopathy, MAPK11 interacts with OsPAL2;3, a gene involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism, which is crucial for the synthesis of allelochemicals that suppress weed growth. This interaction has been validated through co-expression studies and co-immunoprecipitation (Fang2019MYB57). Additionally, MAPK11 is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis, where it is regulated by circ_0001955, a circular RNA that acts as a molecular sponge for miR-516a-5p, thereby modulating the expression of MAPK11 and contributing to cancer progression (Yao2019Circ0001955).
