# VSTM2A

## Overview
VSTM2A is a gene that encodes the V-set and transmembrane domain containing 2A protein, which is a secreted glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including adipogenesis and neural development. The protein is characterized by a single immunoglobulin V-set (IgV) domain, which facilitates its interaction with the LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), playing a crucial role in modulating Wnt signaling pathways (Dong2019VSTM2A). VSTM2A is predominantly expressed in committed preadipocytes and is implicated in the early stages of adipocyte differentiation by enhancing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling (Secco2017Amplification). Additionally, VSTM2A has been identified as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, where its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis due to promoter hypermethylation (Dong2019VSTM2A). The protein's expression and functional roles in both adipose tissue and cancer highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Structure
The VSTM2A protein is composed of 236 to 240 amino acids, depending on the source, and includes a signal peptide at the N-terminal, indicating its secretory nature (Secco2017Amplification; Dong2019VSTM2A). It contains a single immunoglobulin V-set (IgV) domain, which spans from amino acids 33 to 143 and is crucial for its interaction with the LRP6 receptor, playing a role in suppressing Wnt signaling (Dong2019VSTM2A). The protein undergoes N-linked glycosylation at two conserved asparagine residues, N35 and N175, which is essential for its proper maturation and secretion (Secco2017Amplification). 

VSTM2A is a secreted glycoprotein, and its secretion is specific to committed preadipocytes (Secco2017Amplification). The presence of unpaired cysteine residues suggests the potential for dimer formation, as evidenced by an 80-kDa band in western blot analyses (Secco2017Amplification). The protein is expressed in various isoforms, all sharing the IgV domain but differing at the C-terminal (Dong2019VSTM2A). These structural features highlight the functional complexity and regulatory roles of VSTM2A in cellular processes.

## Function
VSTM2A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of adipogenesis, particularly in the early stages of adipocyte development. It is highly expressed in committed preadipocytes and plays a crucial role in amplifying adipogenic commitment by enhancing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and PPARg2 expression. This gene is expressed early during adipocyte differentiation and is associated with the commitment of preadipocytes to the adipogenic lineage (Secco2017Amplification).

VSTM2A is a secreted glycoprotein that is expressed in adipose progenitor cells, particularly in the perivascular compartment of developing white adipose tissue (WAT). Its expression is induced during WAT expansion, such as in response to a high-fat diet or in genetically obese mouse models (Secco2017Amplification). The protein is involved in intracellular mechanisms that promote adipogenesis, as evidenced by increased spontaneous differentiation and lipid accumulation in preadipocytes upon VSTM2A overexpression (Secco2017Amplification).

In addition to its role in adipogenesis, VSTM2A is also expressed in the brain, suggesting a potential dual role in neural development. Despite being a secreted protein, its pro-adipogenic effects are primarily mediated through intracellular pathways (Secco2017Amplification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VSTM2A gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), VSTM2A is significantly downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which correlates with poor patient survival. This downregulation is associated with the hyperactivation of the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical factor in colorectal tumorigenesis. VSTM2A functions as a tumor suppressor by binding to the Wnt co-receptor LRP6, inhibiting its phosphorylation, and promoting its endocytosis and degradation, thereby suppressing Wnt signaling. The reduced expression of VSTM2A in CRC is linked to shorter overall survival and disease-free survival, making it an independent risk factor for poor prognosis (Dong2019VSTM2A).

In the context of renal cancer, VSTM2A overexpression serves as a sensitive and specific biomarker for mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSCC) of the kidney. It is highly expressed in MTSCC tumors but shows low or absent expression in other renal cell carcinoma subtypes, aiding in the differential diagnosis of MTSCC (Wang2018VSTM2A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of VSTM2A in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
VSTM2A interacts with the LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), a co-receptor in the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for VSTM2A's role in antagonizing Wnt signaling, which is often hyper-activated in colorectal cancer. VSTM2A binds specifically to the E1-E4 domains of LRP6 through its IgV domain, inhibiting LRP6 phosphorylation and promoting its endocytosis and degradation via a clathrin-mediated pathway (Dong2019VSTM2A). This binding reduces the cell surface levels of LRP6, thereby suppressing Wnt signaling upstream of the β-catenin degradation complex (Dong2019VSTM2A).

VSTM2A's interaction with LRP6 is significant in the context of colorectal cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis (Dong2019VSTM2A). The downregulation of VSTM2A in colorectal cancer is associated with poor patient survival, and this is primarily due to promoter hypermethylation (Dong2019VSTM2A; Maurya2021Transcriptome). These interactions highlight VSTM2A's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.
