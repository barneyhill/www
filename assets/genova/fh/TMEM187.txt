# TMEM187

## Overview
TMEM187 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 187, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cellular communication, due to its location spanning the cellular membrane. TMEM187 has been studied for its role in several diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders such as celiac disease and systemic lupus erythematosus, where it is implicated in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. Additionally, TMEM187 is being explored as a potential biomarker for osteoporosis, highlighting its significance in bone health and disease (HernangomezLaderas2023Sex; Feng2024Integration; Zhang2014Metaanalysis).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The TMEM187 gene has been implicated in several autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease (CeD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In celiac disease, TMEM187 is identified as a functional candidate gene, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with its expression. These SNPs are linked to CeD risk alleles and are negatively correlated with TMEM187 expression. The gene's expression is notably higher in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from female CeD patients at disease onset compared to non-celiac controls, suggesting a role in the sex bias observed in CeD prevalence, which is higher in women (HernangomezLaderas2023Sex).

In systemic lupus erythematosus, TMEM187 is part of the IRAK1-MECP2-TMEM187 region on the X chromosome, which has been associated with SLE susceptibility. SNPs in this region, particularly rs1059702 on IRAK1, show significant association with SLE in East Asian populations. The TMEM187 region has been identified as having independent association signals with SLE, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Jaiwan2024Single; Zhang2014Metaanalysis).

TMEM187 has also been linked to osteoporosis, where it is considered a potential diagnostic biomarker. Alterations in its expression may impact bone remodeling processes, indicating its significance in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis (Feng2024Integration).
