# DSP

## Overview
The DSP gene encodes the protein desmoplakin, a critical component of desmosomes, which are specialized structures that facilitate cell-cell adhesion in tissues subjected to mechanical stress, such as epithelial and cardiac tissues. Desmoplakin is categorized as a cytoskeletal linker protein, playing a pivotal role in anchoring intermediate filaments to desmosomal plaques, thereby maintaining tissue integrity and resilience. The protein is composed of multiple domains, including an N-terminal domain that interacts with other desmosomal proteins, a central rod domain that facilitates dimerization, and a C-terminal domain that binds intermediate filaments. Mutations in the DSP gene are implicated in various cardiomyopathies and skin disorders, highlighting its significance in both structural and signaling functions within cells (Green2019Desmosomes:; Keller2012De; Brandão2023Desmoplakin).

## Structure
Desmoplakin (DSP) is a critical component of the desmosomal junction, anchoring the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. It is a large protein composed of 2871 amino acids and is divided into three main domains: the N-terminal domain, the central rod domain, and the C-terminal domain (Keller2012De). The N-terminal domain, consisting of 1056 amino acids, includes a plakin domain of 580 amino acids, which is essential for targeting desmoplakin to junctions by mediating interactions with plakophilin and plakoglobin (AlAmoudi2011The; Keller2012De). This domain is predicted to have two pairs of spectrin repeats interrupted by a putative Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (AlAmoudi2011The).

The central rod domain is helical and spans amino acids 1057 to 1945, facilitating the formation of dimers through a coiled-coil structure (Keller2012De). The C-terminal domain contains three plakin repeat domains named A, B, and C, which are involved in binding intermediate filaments (Keller2012De).

Desmoplakin exists in multiple isoforms, including desmoplakin I (DSPI), desmoplakin II (DSPII), and a novel isoform, desmoplakin Ia (DSPIa), which differ in the size of their central rod domains due to alternative splicing (Cabral2010Identification). Desmoplakin undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and localization.

## Function
Desmoplakin (DSP) is a critical protein involved in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial and vascular tissues. It is a key component of desmosomes, which are specialized cell structures that facilitate cell-cell adhesion, enabling tissues to withstand mechanical stress (Hao2020GenomeWide; Cabral2010Identification). In healthy human cells, DSP is predominantly expressed in lung epithelial cells, particularly in ciliated cells, where it contributes to the maintenance of epithelial characteristics and barrier function (Hao2020GenomeWide). DSP anchors intermediate filaments to desmosomal plaques, providing mechanical strength and stability to tissues (Cabral2010Identification).

In the lungs, DSP is localized at the apical surface of airway epithelium and is involved in forming desmosomes that are crucial for maintaining airway epithelial integrity. Knockout studies have shown that loss of DSP leads to reduced transepithelial electrical resistance and increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition, indicating compromised epithelial barrier function (Hao2020GenomeWide). DSP also plays a role in regulating extracellular matrix-related genes, influencing cell migration and maintaining epithelial cell integrity (Hao2020GenomeWide). These functions are essential for normal respiratory function and the prevention of fibrotic changes in lung tissue (Hao2020GenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DSP gene, which encodes the desmosomal protein desmoplakin, are associated with a range of cardiomyopathies and skin disorders. Desmoplakin is crucial for cell-to-cell adhesion, particularly in cardiac and epidermal tissues. Mutations in DSP can lead to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), including its left-dominant variant (ALVC), which is characterized by left ventricular involvement, extensive fibrosis, and a high risk of arrhythmias (Di2023DSPRelated; Brandão2023Desmoplakin). DSP mutations are also linked to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a condition marked by ventricular arrhythmias and fibrofatty myocardial replacement (Bauce2005Clinical; Singh2018Autosomal‐dominant).

In addition to cardiac conditions, DSP mutations can cause skin disorders such as palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair, as seen in Carvajal syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder (Boyden2015Dominantde). Erythrokeratodermia-cardiomyopathy (EKC) syndrome, caused by dominant de novo missense mutations in DSP, presents with both skin and cardiac symptoms, including erythrokeratodermia and cardiomyopathy (Boyden2015Dominantde). These mutations disrupt the structural integrity of desmosomes, leading to compromised cell adhesion and tissue integrity.

## Interactions
Desmoplakin (DSP) is a key component of desmosomes, facilitating interactions with various proteins to maintain cellular adhesion and structural integrity. The C-terminus of DSP interacts with intermediate filament (IF) proteins, such as cytokeratins, desmin, and vimentin, primarily through the coil 1 domain of these proteins. This interaction is crucial for anchoring IFs to desmosomes, with a high binding affinity in the nanomolar range (Favre2018Desmoplakin).

DSP also interacts with other desmosomal proteins, including plakoglobin and plakophilins, through its N-terminus. These interactions are essential for linking DSP to transmembrane cadherins like desmogleins and desmocollins, which are involved in cell-cell adhesion (Romov2024Prevention; Green2019Desmosomes:). The phosphorylation of DSP, particularly at the GSR repeats in its C-terminal region, dynamically regulates its interaction with IFs, highlighting the role of post-translational modifications in these processes (Favre2018Desmoplakin).

In cardiac muscle cells, DSP is associated with Myozap, influencing RhoA signaling and cardiac hypertrophy. It also regulates actomyosin signaling and epithelial cell migration through pathways involving RhoA and p38 MAPK (Green2019Desmosomes:). These interactions underscore DSP's role in both structural and signaling functions within cells.
