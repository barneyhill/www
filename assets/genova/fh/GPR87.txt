# GPR87

## Overview
GPR87 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 87, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is primarily known for its role as a receptor for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid mediator involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival. GPR87 is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the placenta, ovary, testis, prostate, brain, and skeletal muscle, indicating its broad biological significance (Tabata2007The). The receptor's activation by LPA leads to intracellular signaling events, notably the mobilization of calcium ions, which are crucial for cellular responses. GPR87's structural similarity to P2Y receptors, despite its distinct ligand specificity, underscores its unique functional role in cellular homeostasis and tissue development (Tabata2007The). Additionally, GPR87 has been implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Bai2022GPR87; Ahn2021GPR87).

## Structure
GPR87 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs. The transmembrane regions of GPR87 have been identified using Fourier transform analysis, revealing seven distinct regions: TM1 (37-67aa), TM2 (70-102), TM3 (109-140), TM4 (160-180), TM5 (206-228), TM6 (255-281), and TM7 (291-316) (Tabata2007The). These regions are aligned with the P2Y12 receptor model to create a tentative 3D model, which is refined using molecular dynamics calculations (Tabata2007The). The 3D structure of the GPR87-LPA complex shows interactions between lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and specific residues, Arg115 and Lys296, within the transmembrane regions (Tabata2007The).

GPR87 shares 41-48% amino acid identity with P2Y receptors, indicating a structural similarity to this receptor subfamily (Tabata2007The). The protein is highly conserved across species, with nearly identical sequences in chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys, and some variation in mice, rats, and dogs (Glatt2008hGPR87). While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available sources, the protein's classification as a GPCR suggests it may undergo common post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function and localization. However, specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of GPR87 are not described in the provided context.

## Function
GPR87 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that functions as a receptor for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid mediator involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, GPR87 is implicated in LPA-induced signaling pathways, which are crucial for cellular responses such as calcium mobilization. This receptor is expressed in several tissues, including the placenta, ovary, testis, prostate, brain, and skeletal muscle, indicating its broad role in cell biology (Tabata2007The).

The activation of GPR87 by LPA leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels, a key signal transduction event that influences cell proliferation, migration, and survival. The receptor's function is characterized by its high affinity for LPA, and its activity can be inhibited by LPA receptor antagonists, confirming its role in mediating LPA-induced cellular responses (Tabata2007The).

Structurally, GPR87 shares similarities with P2Y receptors, although it is not activated by nucleotides. The receptor's 3D model suggests that LPA interacts with conserved residues, which are crucial for its function as an LPA receptor (Tabata2007The). These molecular interactions highlight GPR87's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in tissue development and repair.

## Clinical Significance
GPR87 is implicated in several cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In lung adenocarcinoma, GPR87 overexpression is associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis. It promotes cancer progression by enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activating the AKT-eNOS-NO pathway, which inhibits apoptosis and supports tumor growth (Ahn2021GPR87). High GPR87 expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and resistance to immunotherapy, suggesting a role in tumor immune escape (Bai2022GPR87).

In bladder cancer, GPR87 expression is linked to intravesical recurrence and shorter recurrence-free survival. It promotes cancer cell proliferation, particularly in cells with wild-type p53, by influencing p53 expression and activating the PI3K/Akt pathway (Zhang2015G; Okazoe2013Expression). In hepatocellular carcinoma, GPR87 is upregulated in CD133+ cancer stem-like cells, enhancing their growth and metastatic potential (Yan2013G). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, GPR87 promotes the expansion of cancer stem cells through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, contributing to tumor progression and poor patient outcomes (Jiang2020G). These findings suggest that GPR87 is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in various cancers.

## Interactions
GPR87, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in various interactions with other proteins that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with heterotrimeric G proteins, specifically coupling with Gα q and Gα i proteins, which play a role in inhibiting IP3 accumulation and activating transcription factors such as CREB, NFκB, NFAT, and SRE (Niss2017Signaling). GPR87 may also couple with Gα 12/13, as suggested by the inhibition of SRE activation in the presence of the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 (Niss2017Signaling).

The receptor is implicated in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cells, potentially through interactions with Gαi and Gαq proteins in a ligand-independent manner (Wang2017Overexpression). GPR87 is also involved in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, mediating the activation of Rho GTPases CDC42 and Rac1, which regulate MAP kinase cascades and lead to the phosphorylation of MAP3K10 and GlyRS (Luo2020Methionine).

Additionally, GPR87 is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, with p53 binding to a response element within the GPR87 gene, indicating a regulatory interaction that influences p53-dependent cell survival mechanisms (Zhang2009The).
