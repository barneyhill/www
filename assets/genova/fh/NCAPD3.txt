# NCAPD3

## Overview
NCAPD3 is a gene that encodes the non-SMC condensin II complex subunit D3, a crucial component of the condensin II complex involved in chromosome condensation during mitosis. The protein is characterized by HEAT repeat domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, essential for maintaining chromosome integrity and proper segregation during cell division (Martin2016Mutations). Beyond its role in mitosis, NCAPD3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, gene expression regulation, and immune response, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Wang2022CDC6). The gene's expression and mutations have been associated with several diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders, underscoring its clinical relevance (Yang2024Knockdown; Martin2016Mutations).

## Structure
The NCAPD3 protein is a component of the condensin II complex, which plays a critical role in chromosome condensation during mitosis. The molecular structure of NCAPD3 includes HEAT repeat domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, facilitating its association with other subunits of the condensin complex (Martin2016Mutations). These domains contribute to the protein's ability to maintain chromosome integrity during cell division.

NCAPD3 is characterized by its interaction with the kleisin subunit, NCAPH2, within the condensin II complex, which also includes SMC2 and SMC4 subunits. These subunits form a dimer at the hinge domain, with coiled-coil domains extending to ATPase head domains, indicating a complex quaternary structure (Martin2016Mutations).

The protein is also involved in mitochondrial function, where it may exist in a modified or truncated form, as suggested by its detection in mitochondria using an antibody targeting internal residues but not with an antibody recognizing C-terminal residues (Deutschman2019Condensin). This indicates potential post-translational modifications or alternative splicing events that could influence its localization and function. However, specific details about the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of NCAPD3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
NCAPD3, a subunit of the condensin II complex, plays a crucial role in chromosome condensation and stabilization during mitosis. It is involved in the regulation of chromosomal architecture, ensuring proper segregation of chromosomes, which is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and influencing cell division and proliferation (Yang2024Knockdown). NCAPD3 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to various cellular processes, including DNA repair, sister chromatid separation, gene expression regulation, cellular senescence, and histone modification (Wang2022CDC6).

In healthy human cells, NCAPD3 is involved in the removal of bacteria from cells in the lining of the human intestine, indicating a role in maintaining intestinal health and immune response (Wang2022CDC6). The protein's activity in these processes highlights its importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal health. While the specific molecular activities of NCAPD3 in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in critical cellular functions underscores its significance in maintaining normal cellular and physiological processes. The protein's role in immune response regulation further suggests its potential impact on overall immune system function (Wang2022CDC6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NCAPD3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NCAPD3 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its elevated levels are associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression. Knockdown of NCAPD3 in NSCLC cells results in increased apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and reduced proliferation, invasion, and migration, suggesting its role in promoting carcinogenesis through the PI3K/Akt/FOXO4 signaling pathway (Yang2024Knockdown).

In prostate cancer, NCAPD3 expression is linked to tumor progression by enhancing the expression of STAT3-MALAT1 and reducing miR-30a-5p levels, which contributes to increased cell proliferation and migration (Zhang2024NCAPD3). Conversely, in a specific subtype of prostate cancer, increased NCAPD3 expression is associated with favorable prognosis and decreased recurrence after surgery (Lapointe2008hCAPD3).

NCAPD3 mutations are also associated with microcephaly, a condition characterized by reduced brain size. These mutations lead to chromosome segregation errors during mitosis, resulting in impaired cell proliferation and increased cell death (Martin2016Mutations). The gene's dysregulation is linked to chromosomal instability, contributing to various cancers and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
NCAPD3, a subunit of the condensin II complex, plays a significant role in chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. Its interactions are crucial for various cellular processes. During mitosis, NCAPD3 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 and Plk1 kinases, which is essential for its interaction with Plk1. This interaction is necessary for the proper localization of Plk1 on chromosome axes, highlighting NCAPD3's role in recruiting Plk1 to chromosomal axes (Abe2011The).

In gastric cancer, NCAPD3 interacts with genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Knockdown of NCAPD3 leads to the downregulation of genes like CCND1 and ESR1, while promoting apoptosis-related genes such as IRF7 and DDIT3. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest direct interactions between NCAPD3 and CCND1 and ESR1, but not MYC (Zhang2024Role).

In prostate cancer, NCAPD3 suppresses miR-30a-5p expression through the STAT3-MALAT1 axis and MYC-mediated transcriptional repression. It enhances MALAT1 expression, which acts as a miRNA sponge, and increases MYC expression, which inhibits miR-30a-5p transcription. These interactions promote tumor growth by modulating the STAT3-MALAT1-miR-30a-5p pathway (Zhang2024NCAPD3).
