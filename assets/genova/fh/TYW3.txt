# TYW3

## Overview
The TYW3 gene encodes the tRNA-yW synthesizing protein 3 homolog, a SAM-dependent methyltransferase that plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA. This protein is involved in the biosynthesis of wybutosine, a hypermodified nucleoside located at position 37 in the anticodon loop of phenylalanine tRNA in eukaryotes and archaea. The TYW3 protein is characterized by a unique α/β fold, distinguishing it from other methyltransferase classes, and is composed of three domains: a SHS2 fold domain, a RAGNYA fold domain, and an N-terminal extension. These structural features facilitate its function in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the stability and accuracy of protein synthesis by ensuring proper codon-anticodon pairing. The gene's involvement in tRNA modification has significant implications for cellular health, with aberrations linked to diseases such as cancer and mitochondrial disorders (Currie2016Structural).

## Structure
The TYW3 protein, a SAM-dependent methyltransferase, is involved in the biosynthesis of wybutosine, a modified nucleoside in tRNA. The crystal structure of TYW3 reveals a novel α/β fold, which is distinct from other known classes of methyltransferases, suggesting it represents a unique class of SAM-dependent methyltransferases (Currie2016Structural). The structure is composed of three domains: a SHS2 fold domain, a RAGNYA fold domain, and an N-terminal extension (Currie2016Structural). The RAGNYA fold is involved in interactions with proteins and ligands, while the SHS2 fold is associated with protein-protein interactions and catalysis (Currie2016Structural).

The primary structure of TYW3 includes a conserved sequence motif (S/T)xSSCxGR, along with invariant aspartate and histidine residues that form the catalytic center (Currie2016Structural). These conserved residues are critical for substrate binding and catalysis, as mutations in these sites impair TYW3 function (Currie2016Structural). The electrostatic surface of the protein features a large positively charged patch adjacent to the active site, which may serve as a binding surface for the RNA substrate (Currie2016Structural).

## Function
The TYW3 gene encodes a SAM-dependent methyltransferase involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA, specifically in the synthesis of wybutosine, a hypermodified guanosine derivative found at position 37 in the anticodon loop of phenylalanine tRNA in eukaryotes and archaea (Currie2016Structural). This modification is crucial for stabilizing codon-anticodon base-pairing during protein synthesis, ensuring accurate translation of phenylalanine codons (Currie2016Structural). The TYW3 protein functions in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the stability and proper functioning of the translation machinery, impacting overall protein synthesis and cellular health.

The biogenesis of wybutosine involves a multistep enzymatic process, with TYW3 specifically methylating the N4 position of an intermediate compound in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (Currie2016Structural). Structural studies have revealed that TYW3 proteins have a novel α/β fold and form a distinct class of SAM-dependent methyltransferases, with essential residues identified for cofactor binding and methyltransferase activity (Currie2016Structural). Aberrant tRNA modifications, including defects in wybutosine synthesis, have been associated with human diseases such as cancer and mitochondrial disorders, highlighting the importance of TYW3 in maintaining normal cellular functions (Currie2016Structural).

## Clinical Significance
The TYW3 gene is implicated in several diseases due to its role in tRNA modification. Aberrant modifications in tRNA, including those involving wybutosine, have been linked to human diseases such as cancer and mitochondrial disorders. Specifically, defects in wybutosine synthesis have been observed in tumors, leading to immature forms of the base and inducing -1 frameshifting, which can influence cancer pathogenesis and the expression of viral proteins from human immunodeficiency viruses (Currie2016Structural).

Genome-wide association studies have identified the TYW3/CRYZ locus as being associated with circulating resistin levels, which are linked to insulin resistance and coronary heart disease (CHD). The SNP rs3931020 near the TYW3/CRYZ gene is associated with increased resistin mRNA levels and an increased risk of CHD, although its direct role in type 2 diabetes remains unclear (Qi2012Genomewide).

In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the TYW3/CRYZ locus has been identified as a susceptibility gene, suggesting a potential link between TYW3 and insulin resistance in ALS pathogenesis (Wei2019Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TYW3 in various diseases, although further research is needed to fully understand its role.

## Interactions
TYW3, a tRNA-yW synthesizing protein 3 homolog, is involved in the biosynthesis of wybutosine, a hypermodified nucleoside found in tRNA. This protein functions as a SAM-dependent methyltransferase, playing a crucial role in the methylation process during wybutosine synthesis. The TYW3 protein interacts with other proteins in the wybutosine synthesis pathway, such as TYW1, TYW2, and TYW4, forming a complex that modifies tRNA. These interactions are essential for the proper function and stability of tRNA molecules (Currie2016Structural).

The structural characterization of TYW3 has revealed a novel fold distinct from other methyltransferase classes, with key residues such as aspartate, cysteine, and arginine being crucial for its function. These residues are involved in substrate and cofactor binding, which are necessary for the enzymatic activity of TYW3 (Currie2016Structural). The protein's structure includes a RAGNYA fold domain, which is hypothesized to serve as a potential tRNA binding site, indicating a direct interaction with tRNA substrates (Currie2016Structural). The electrostatic surface of TYW3 also features a positively charged patch adjacent to the active site, which may facilitate RNA binding (Currie2016Structural).
