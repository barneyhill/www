# RAET1E

## Overview
RAET1E is a gene that encodes the protein retinoic acid early transcript 1E, which is a member of the NKG2D ligand family. This protein plays a pivotal role in immune surveillance by acting as a ligand for the NKG2D receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cell subsets. RAET1E is typically expressed at low levels in healthy cells but can be upregulated in response to cellular stressors such as viral infections, heat shock, and DNA damage. This upregulation facilitates the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate stressed or transformed cells. The RAET1E protein, also known as UL16-binding protein 4 (ULBP4), is involved in critical interactions that enhance immune responses, particularly in the context of viral infections and cancer. Its expression is regulated by transcription factors and histone deacetylases, with significant implications for diseases such as coronary artery disease and various cancers (PosadasSánchez2018Raet1e; Greene2016A; Carapito2015Genetics).

## Function
RAET1E, also known as retinoic acid early transcript 1E, is a member of the NKG2D ligand family, which plays a crucial role in immune surveillance. In healthy human cells, RAET1E is typically expressed at low levels but can be upregulated in response to cellular stress, such as viral infections, heat shock, DNA damage, or oxidative stress (PosadasSánchez2018Raet1e; Greene2016A). This upregulation is part of the body's mechanism to enhance immune responses, as RAET1E serves as a ligand for the NKG2D receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cell subsets, facilitating the recognition and destruction of stressed or transformed cells (Carapito2015Genetics).

The expression of RAET1E is regulated by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which represses its expression in normal conditions. During stress, such as viral infections, certain viral proteins can inhibit HDAC activity, leading to the de-repression and increased expression of RAET1E (Greene2016A). This process is crucial for activating NK cells, which are essential for controlling viral infections and cancer (Greene2016A). RAET1E is located near the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6, which is known for its role in immune processes (PosadasSánchez2018Raet1e).

## Clinical Significance
RAET1E has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In coronary artery disease (CAD), polymorphisms in the RAET1E gene, such as rs6925151, rs9371533, rs7756850, and rs9383921, are associated with an increased risk of developing premature CAD. These polymorphisms are linked to low adiponectin levels, high hypertension prevalence, and elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase and total cholesterol levels in CAD patients (PosadasSánchez2018Raet1e).

In ovarian cancer, high expression levels of RAET1E are associated with poor prognosis. Patients with elevated RAET1E expression have significantly shorter median survival times compared to those with low or no expression, suggesting that RAET1E serves as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in this cancer type (McGilvray2010ULBP2).

RAET1E is also identified as a high-risk gene in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), where its expression correlates with poorer survival outcomes. It is part of a prognostic signature that includes other immune-related genes, indicating its role in the tumor immune microenvironment and potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2020Identification; Zhang2021A).

## Interactions
RAET1E, also known as UL16-binding protein 4 (ULBP4), is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in immune surveillance. It serves as a ligand for the NKG2D receptor, which is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. This interaction is part of a mechanism where NKG2D acts as a sensor for stressed cells, such as those that are transformed or infected, facilitating immune responses (Lanier2015NKG2D).

The expression of RAET1E is regulated by transcription factors and histone deacetylases (HDACs). The Sp family of transcription factors, particularly Sp3, plays a significant role in regulating RAET1E expression. Sp3 binds to the Raet1e promoter, and this binding is necessary for the induction of RAE-1 expression by the viral protein m18. Inhibition of Sp factor binding reduces RAE-1 expression, highlighting the importance of Sp TFs in this regulatory process (Greene2016A).

RAET1E expression is also influenced by the activity of HDAC3, which represses the Raet1e promoter. The viral protein m18 can inhibit HDAC3 by interfering with casein kinase II (CK2), leading to increased histone acetylation and RAET1E expression (Greene2016A).
