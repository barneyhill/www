# SLC34A1

## Overview
The SLC34A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 34 member 1, commonly referred to as NaPi-IIa, which is a sodium-phosphate cotransporter. This transmembrane protein is predominantly expressed in the renal proximal tubules and plays a vital role in phosphate homeostasis by facilitating the reabsorption of inorganic phosphate from the renal filtrate into the bloodstream (Hernando2021Phosphate; Levi2019Mechanisms). NaPi-IIa operates with a stoichiometry of 3:1 for sodium and phosphate ions and is regulated by various factors, including dietary phosphate levels, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor 23 (Hernando2021Phosphate). Mutations in SLC34A1 can lead to metabolic disorders such as idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis/hypophosphatemic osteoporosis type 1, underscoring its importance in maintaining phosphate balance and overall metabolic function (Giusti2023A; De2019CYP24A1).

## Structure
The SLC34A1 gene encodes the NaPi-IIa protein, a sodium-phosphate cotransporter primarily expressed in the renal proximal tubule. The protein consists of approximately 640 amino acids and features eight transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-termini located intracellularly (Murer2004The; Forster2013Phosphate). A significant structural component is a large extracellular loop containing two N-glycosylation sites and a crucial disulfide bridge, which is essential for the protein's function (Murer2004The; Forster2012Phosphate).

The NaPi-IIa protein is characterized by an inverted repeat motif, which is important for substrate coordination and transport function (Forster2013Phosphate; Wagner2013The). The protein's secondary structure includes α-helical components, and its topology is confirmed by cysteine scanning mutagenesis studies (Forster2012Phosphate). The protein is assumed to function as a monomer, although evidence suggests it may form dimers or tetramers (Forster2012Phosphate).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, play a role in the protein's function and stability. The protein's transport activity is influenced by pH, with higher rates observed at more basic external pH values (Murer2004The).

## Function
The SLC34A1 gene encodes a sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter, primarily expressed in the renal proximal tubules, where it plays a crucial role in phosphate homeostasis. This transporter, known as NaPi-IIa, facilitates the reabsorption of inorganic phosphate from the renal filtrate back into the bloodstream, a process essential for maintaining normal phosphate levels in the body (Hernando2021Phosphate; Levi2019Mechanisms). The cotransporter operates with a stoichiometry of 3:1 for sodium and phosphate ions, and its activity is pH-dependent, following an elevator-type alternating access model (Hernando2021Phosphate).

SLC34A1 is regulated by various factors, including dietary phosphate levels, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Under low phosphate conditions, its expression is upregulated to enhance phosphate reabsorption, while high phosphate levels lead to downregulation, reducing reabsorption (Hernando2021Phosphate; Levi2019Mechanisms). The protein's function is also influenced by its interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as NHERF1, which are crucial for its trafficking and membrane localization (Hernando2021Phosphate).

Mutations in SLC34A1 can disrupt phosphate transport, leading to metabolic disorders such as kidney stones and osteoporosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining phosphate balance and overall metabolic function (Hernando2021Phosphate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC34A1 gene, which encodes the sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaPi-IIa, are associated with several clinical conditions due to their impact on phosphate homeostasis. These mutations can lead to idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH), characterized by severe hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal complications. IIH is linked to hypophosphatemia and suppressed FGF23 levels, resulting in increased 1,25(OH)2D3 levels and a hypercalcemic phenotype (Schlingmann2016AutosomalRecessive; De2019CYP24A1).

SLC34A1 mutations are also implicated in nephrolithiasis/hypophosphatemic osteoporosis type 1 (NPHLOP1), an autosomal dominant condition marked by idiopathic hyperphosphaturia, hypophosphatemia, recurrent kidney stones, and bone demineralization (Giusti2023A). The gene's mutations can cause hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis, which may present as an autosomal dominant trait, leading to renal stone disease (Fearn2018Clinical).

Additionally, digenic mutations involving SLC34A1 and SLC34A3 can result in dominant hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria, highlighting the gene's role in phosphate transport and its complex inheritance patterns (Gordon2020Digenic). These conditions underscore the critical role of SLC34A1 in maintaining phosphate balance and its impact on renal and skeletal health.

## Interactions
The SLC34A1 gene encodes the NaPi-IIa protein, a sodium-phosphate cotransporter primarily expressed in the kidney. NaPi-IIa interacts with several proteins that influence its expression and regulation. A key interaction involves the NHERF1 (Na+/H+ exchange regulatory cofactor 1), which is crucial for the stability of NaPi-IIa at the membrane. The absence of NHERF1 leads to reduced expression of NaPi-IIa and increased urinary phosphate excretion. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation, which can be induced by hormones such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), dopamine, and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), leading to the dissociation of NaPi-IIa from NHERF1 (Wagner2013The).

NaPi-IIa also interacts with Shank2E, which is involved in the intracellular trafficking of the cotransporter. Additionally, NaPi-IIa interacts with GABARAP, independent of the PDZ-binding motif, affecting intracellular trafficking and expression levels. GABARAP knockout mice show increased NaPi-IIa expression and reduced urinary phosphate excretion, although plasma phosphate levels remain unchanged due to decreased intestinal NaPi-IIb expression (Wagner2013The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms that control NaPi-IIa function and its role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis.
