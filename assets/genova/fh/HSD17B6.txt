# HSD17B6

## Overview
HSD17B6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 6 (17βHSD6), which is a key player in steroid metabolism, particularly within the prostate. This enzyme is classified as an oxidoreductase and is involved in the conversion of androgens to estrogens, specifically transforming 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) into 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol (3β-Adiol), a potent ligand for estrogen receptor β (ERβ) (Muthusamy2011Estrogen). The activity of 17βHSD6 is crucial for maintaining the balance between androgenic and estrogenic effects, thereby regulating prostate growth and function. Beyond its role in the prostate, HSD17B6 is implicated in various metabolic and immune processes, interacting with a network of proteins involved in hormone biosynthesis and metabolism (Lv2020Downexpression). The gene's expression and function are clinically significant, with alterations linked to conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, and polycystic ovary syndrome (Jones2006Polymorphism; Lv2020Downexpression).

## Function
The human gene HSD17B6 encodes the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 6 (17βHSD6), which plays a crucial role in steroid metabolism within the prostate. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to the estrogen 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol (3β-Adiol). This conversion is significant because 3β-Adiol is a high-affinity ligand and agonist of estrogen receptor β (ERβ), which exerts antiproliferative effects in the prostate (Muthusamy2011Estrogen). The balance between androgen receptor activation by DHT and ERβ activation by 3β-Adiol is important for regulating prostate growth. In healthy human cells, particularly in the prostate, 17βHSD6 is expressed in ERβ-positive epithelial cells and contributes to the formation of 3β-Adiol, thus playing a role in growth regulation (Muthusamy2011Estrogen).

The enzyme's activity is linked to the regulation of prostate growth, as it is colocalized with ERβ in prostatic epithelial cells. The presence of potential ER/AP-1-binding sites in the promoter region of the HSD17B6 gene suggests that ERβ may regulate the expression of 17βHSD6, which in turn produces its own ligand (Muthusamy2011Estrogen). This prereceptor regulation is crucial for maintaining the balance between proliferative and antiproliferative effects in the prostate (Muthusamy2011Estrogen).

## Clinical Significance
The HSD17B6 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases and conditions through mutations, altered expression levels, and disrupted interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HSD17B6 is significantly down-regulated, correlating with poorer clinical outcomes such as reduced overall survival, progression-free survival, and recurrence-free survival. This downregulation is linked to increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and immune evasion, partly through the TGFB1 pathway (Wu2021Hydroxysteroid; Lv2020Downexpression). 

In prostate cancer, reduced expression of HSD17B6 is associated with higher Gleason grades and worse prognosis, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Lv2020Downexpression). The gene is also implicated in non-small-cell lung cancer and liver fibrosis risk (Lv2020Downexpression).

Polymorphisms in HSD17B6 are linked to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), affecting glucose-insulin ratios and body mass index. These genetic variations may lead to increased synthesis of potent androgens, contributing to the pathophysiology of PCOS (Jones2009Independent; Jones2006Polymorphism). The gene's expression is influenced by DNA methylation and HNF4A regulation, with hypermethylation potentially reducing HNF4A binding, impacting its normal function (Lv2020Downexpression).

## Interactions
HSD17B6, a hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in steroid metabolism. The protein encoded by HSD17B6 interacts with a network of proteins involved in hormone metabolic processes, particularly androgen and steroid biosynthesis. Using the STRING database, ten proteins have been identified to interact with HSD17B6: RD5A2, CYP11B1, SRD5A1, CYP11B2, CYP17A1, HSD3B2, HSD3B1, CYP19A1, SULT1E1, and AKR1D1. These interactions suggest that HSD17B6 is part of a complex network that regulates steroid biosynthetic processes, with six of these proteins specifically involved in the androgen biosynthetic process (Lv2020Downexpression).

HSD17B6 also exhibits oxidoreductase and epimerase activities, converting 3 alpha-adiol to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androsterone to epiandrosterone, which are critical steps in androgen metabolism (Lv2020Downexpression). The protein's interactions and enzymatic activities are linked to its role in regulating immune responses and tumor progression in hepatocellular carcinoma, as it influences the expression of immune checkpoint genes and immune cell infiltration (Lv2020Downexpression). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of HSD17B6 in both metabolic and immune regulatory pathways.
