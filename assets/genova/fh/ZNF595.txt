# ZNF595

## Overview
ZNF595 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 595, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to nucleic acids. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by interacting with DNA and potentially influencing gene expression. The zinc finger protein 595 is implicated in several biological pathways and has been associated with various diseases, including dengue fever, schizophrenia, and certain cancers. Its role as a biomarker in disease diagnosis and its involvement in genetic mutations highlight its clinical significance and potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Jiang2020Retracted:; Kanwal2018Characterization; Xiong2022Identification).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF595 has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the context of dengue fever, ZNF595 has been identified as a biomarker capable of distinguishing between dengue fever (DF) and its more severe form, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The gene's differential expression provides an acceptable diagnostic value for predicting DHF in acute stages of infection (Xiong2022Identification).

In schizophrenia, ZNF595 is associated with de novo mutations that are more prevalent in patients compared to their unaffected siblings. These mutations, particularly in regulatory regions, may affect gene expression and are suggested to play a role in disease predisposition. ZNF595 shows higher expression in the prenatal stage, indicating a potential involvement in early neurodevelopmental processes related to schizophrenia (Jiang2020Retracted:).

ZNF595 has also been studied in the context of cancer. Although mutations in ZNF595 have been observed in familial lung cancer and gastric cancer, their direct link to lung cancer as germline mutations remains unclear. The gene's role in cancer development and progression requires further investigation (Kanwal2018Characterization).
