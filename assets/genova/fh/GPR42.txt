# GPR42

## Overview
GPR42 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 42, a transmembrane receptor involved in cellular signaling. Initially classified as a pseudogene, GPR42 is now recognized as functional, playing a role in various physiological processes through its activation by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Puhl2015Human). The receptor is expressed in human tissues such as the sympathetic ganglia and colon, where it is implicated in modulating calcium channels and potentially influencing metabolic processes, obesity, diabetes, and immune function (Puhl2015Human). GPR42 shares similarities with the closely related receptor FFAR3, although it exhibits distinct genetic variations, including copy number polymorphisms and specific polymorphisms like R174W, which may affect its function and prevalence across different populations (Schöneberg2020Mutations). Despite its expression in heterologous systems, the precise role of GPR42 in human health remains to be fully elucidated (Puhl2015Human).

## Function
The GPR42 gene, previously classified as a pseudogene, is now considered functional and is involved in various physiological processes. It encodes a G-protein coupled receptor that is activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are important in metabolic processes and cellular signaling pathways. GPR42 is expressed in human tissues such as sympathetic ganglia and the colon, where it is implicated in modulating Ca2+ channels in rat sympathetic neurons, suggesting a role in cellular signaling similar to that of FFAR3, a closely related receptor (Puhl2015Human).

The gene exhibits copy number polymorphism, with some variants showing decreased potency but equal efficacy compared to FFAR3, indicating that GPR42 can still be activated by endogenous ligands like SCFAs (Puhl2015Human). The presence of GPR42 in human studies highlights its potential impact on human health, particularly in relation to metabolic processes, obesity, diabetes, and immune function (Puhl2015Human). Despite its functional expression in heterologous systems, the specific role of GPR42 in healthy human cells remains to be definitively proven, though evidence suggests it may play roles similar to FFAR3 (Puhl2015Human).

## Clinical Significance
The GPR42 gene, previously classified as a pseudogene, has been reconsidered as functional due to its transcription and expression in human tissues, such as the sympathetic ganglia and colon (Puhl2015Human). Variants of GPR42, including the R174W polymorphism, have been identified, which affect its response to short-chain fatty acids. This polymorphism is prevalent in European populations but less so in African and East Asian populations, suggesting population-specific functional implications (Schöneberg2020Mutations).

The gene exhibits copy number polymorphism, with a notable 12.5 kb deletion variant found in some populations, which may influence its expression and function (Puhl2015Human). Although direct associations with specific diseases are not extensively documented, the gene's potential role in energy metabolism, sympathetic function, diabetes, immune function, and gut microbiota interactions has been suggested (Puhl2015Human). The genetic variability and structural variations in GPR42, such as the R174W substitution leading to a null phenotype in certain haplotypes, highlight its potential impact on metabolic pathways and related conditions (Puhl2015Human).
