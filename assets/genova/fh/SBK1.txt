# SBK1

## Overview
SBK1 (SH3 domain binding kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways. The protein product, SH3 domain binding kinase 1, is characterized by its ability to interact with SH3 domains, which are common in proteins involved in signaling pathways. As a kinase, it plays a role in phosphorylating target proteins, thereby modulating their activity and function. SBK1 has been studied for its involvement in cancer biology, where alterations in its expression have been linked to prognosis and treatment response in several cancer types, including lung and ovarian cancers (Guo2023A; Li2019Identification). Its potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and therapy highlights its clinical significance (Hu2022CD69).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
SBK1 (SH3 domain binding kinase 1) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SBK1 is identified as an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Its expression is significantly correlated with overall survival, and it is part of a risk model that includes other genes like FBP1 and AURKA, which are associated with the immune microenvironment in LUAD patients (Guo2023A). In the context of cancer immunotherapy, SBK1 expression is downregulated in lung cancer responders to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for treatment response (Hu2022CD69).

In ovarian cancer, SBK1 is highlighted as a survival-associated gene, with its expression levels being significantly related to overall survival. It is part of a network of co-expressed genes that may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis or treatment (Li2019Identification). Additionally, in classical Hodgkin lymphoma, SBK1 is mentioned among genes with significant mutations, although its specific clinical significance in this context is not detailed (Gomez2023UltraDeep).
