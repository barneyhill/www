# MYL7

## Overview
MYL7 is a gene that encodes the myosin light chain 7 protein, a regulatory component of the myosin complex specifically expressed in the atrial tissue of the heart. This protein plays a critical role in cardiac muscle contraction by modulating the interaction between actin and myosin, which are fundamental to the contractile machinery of muscle cells. As a regulatory light chain, myosin light chain 7 is involved in calcium binding and is essential for the structural organization and function of atrial myofibrils. The expression of MYL7 is developmentally regulated, being widespread in the heart during early development and later restricted to the atria in adults, underscoring its specialized function in atrial contraction (Sitbon2019Insights; Gregorich2017Distinct). The protein's interactions with myosin heavy chains and its posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are crucial for maintaining the contractile properties and structural integrity of atrial muscle fibers (Wang2018Thick).

## Function
The MYL7 gene encodes the atrial isoform of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), which is crucial for the structural organization of the atrial myofibrillar apparatus. In healthy human cells, MYL7 is involved in the regulation of muscle contraction, particularly in the atria of the heart. It plays a significant role in modulating the contractile properties of atrial tissue by influencing the interaction between actin and myosin, which are essential components of the muscle contraction machinery (Sitbon2019Insights).

MYL7 is expressed throughout the heart during early development but becomes restricted to the atria in adulthood, indicating its specific role in atrial function (Gregorich2017Distinct). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of calcium binding, which is vital for muscle contraction and relaxation processes (Sitbon2019Insights).

Studies have shown that MYL7 is essential for proper atrial function and embryogenesis, as its absence leads to disrupted atrial myofibrillar organization and diminished atrial contraction, although the left ventricles contract normally (Sitbon2019Insights). This highlights the distinct roles of atrial and ventricular RLC isoforms in cardiac function and development.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MYL7, also known as myosin light chain 7, is involved in crucial interactions with myosin heavy chains (MyHC) in cardiac muscle fibers. It binds to the second IQ motif present in the lever arm of MyHC via its EF-hand motifs, which is essential for the proper organization and function of myofibrils during cardiac atrial development (Wang2018Thick). This interaction is critical for maintaining the structural integrity and contractile function of atrial muscle fibers. Disruptions in these interactions can lead to cardiac developmental defects, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality observed in homozygous Myl7 knockout mice due to major defects in the atria (Wang2018Thick).

MYL7 is also subject to posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which play a role in regulating force production in atrial muscles. Specifically, MYL7 is phosphorylated on Ser21 and Ser22 in response to stretch and α1-adrenergic signaling, mediated by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) (Wang2018Thick). These modifications further influence the interaction of MYL7 with MyHC, affecting the contractile properties of cardiac muscle fibers. The phosphorylation of MYL7 highlights its role in modulating muscle contraction and its interactions with other proteins involved in cardiac function (Wang2018Thick).
