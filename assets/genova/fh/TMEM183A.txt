# TMEM183A

## Overview
TMEM183A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 183A, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cellular communication, due to its location spanning the cellular membrane. The gene has been studied for its role in several physiological and pathological contexts, such as genetic hearing loss, Crohn's Disease, and cancer. Mutations and alterations in the expression of TMEM183A have been linked to these conditions, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease mechanisms (Wu2023The; Harini2023Investigating; Dinu2012SNPSNP).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM183A has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression. In the context of genetic hearing loss, a novel mutation in TMEM183A has been identified, which may affect the function of mechanoelectrical transduction channels in hair cells, crucial for hearing (Wu2023The). This suggests a potential link between TMEM183A mutations and hearing loss.

In Crohn's Disease, TMEM183A was identified as a gene associated with disease susceptibility through SNP-SNP interaction analysis, despite not showing strong evidence in single-SNP analyses (Dinu2012SNPSNP). This highlights its possible role in complex genetic interactions contributing to the disease.

TMEM183A expression has also been studied in the context of cancer. In breast cancer, TMEM183A exhibits a high rate of gene amplification, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Harini2023Investigating). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, TMEM183A is characterized as a significant gene in epithelial cells, although its direct association with specific conditions in this context is not detailed (Ye2023The).

Additionally, TMEM183A has been associated with carfilzomib-related cardiotoxicity in multiple myeloma patients, indicating its potential role in drug response and adverse effects (Tantawy2023WholeExome).
