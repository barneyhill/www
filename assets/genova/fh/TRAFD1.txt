# TRAFD1

## Overview
TRAFD1 (TRAF-type zinc finger domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through its role in interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling pathways. The protein encoded by TRAFD1 is characterized by its TRAF-type zinc finger domain, which categorizes it as a regulatory protein involved in immune signaling. It functions as a negative regulator of the NFκB pathway, playing a crucial role in controlling inflammation and immune responses. TRAFD1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cytokine and chemokine signaling, antigen processing, and presentation, particularly through the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) pathway. The protein's activity is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to environmental triggers, making it significant in both innate and adaptive immune systems (van2021Systematic; Gupta2022Integrative).

## Function
TRAFD1 (TRAF-type zinc finger domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through its role in interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling pathways. This protein acts as a master regulator in these pathways, influencing the expression of various genes involved in immune activation and response (van2021Systematic). TRAFD1 is implicated in the modulation of cytokine and chemokine signaling, which are crucial for the activation and function of both the innate and adaptive immune systems (van2021Systematic).

In cellular biology, TRAFD1 functions as a negative regulator of the NFκB pathway, which is essential for controlling inflammation and immune responses. It is involved in processes such as antigen processing and presentation, particularly through the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) pathway (van2021Systematic). TRAFD1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes like cytokine production and cellular stress responses (Gupta2022Integrative).

The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of immune responses, including the modulation of IFNγ and IFNβ signaling pathways, which are critical in maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to environmental triggers (van2021Systematic).

## Clinical Significance
TRAFD1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in immune response regulation. In celiac disease (CeD), TRAFD1 acts as a master regulator of IFNγ signaling, influencing the expression of multiple genes involved in immune functions such as cytokine signaling and antigen processing. Its mediation effects may contribute to the pathogenesis of CeD by modulating immune responses and disrupting intestinal epithelial integrity, which is associated with villous atrophy in CeD patients (van2021Systematic).

TRAFD1 is also linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through its interaction with microbial abundance. The gene is associated with the regulation of the microbe Enterorhabdus, which is connected to autism-like behaviors. Alterations in TRAFD1 expression can influence social behavior and microbial colonization, suggesting a potential role in ASD pathogenesis, particularly in the context of maternal infection and inflammatory responses during pregnancy (Bubier2018Systems).

Additionally, TRAFD1 is involved in inflammatory processes through its regulation of the NFκB pathway. It acts as a negative regulator, and its knockdown has been shown to affect immune responses, highlighting its significance in conditions characterized by inflammation (van2021Systematic).

## Interactions
TRAFD1, or TRAF-type zinc finger domain containing 1, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play a significant role in immune response regulation. In the context of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, TRAFD1 interacts with the OAS3_D3 protein. This interaction is characterized by hydrogen bonds and salt-bridge-mediated interactions, specifically involving the catalytic triad residues Asp814, Asp818, and Asp888 of OAS3_D3 with Arg67 of TRAFD1. The interaction has a buried surface area of 1706.5 ± 71.8 Å², with multiple hydrogen bonds formed between the proteins (Gupta2022Integrative).

In black carp, a homolog of TRAFD1, known as bcTRAFD1, interacts with the MAVS protein, negatively regulating MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating a firm association between bcTRAFD1 and bcMAVS, which suggests an inhibitory role in the antiviral activity of MAVS (Yan2020Black).

TRAFD1 is also part of a signalosome in T cells, interacting with proteins such as TRAF1, TRAF2, BIRC2, BIRC3, and TAB2. These interactions are involved in TNF receptor family signaling, leading to the activation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways (RitmeesterLoy2024Differential).
