# ESCO2

## Overview
ESCO2 is a gene that encodes the protein establishment of sister chromatid cohesion N-acetyltransferase 2, a member of the GNAT (GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during cell division by acetylating the Smc3 subunit of the cohesin complex, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation and genomic stability. The ESCO2 protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal acetyltransferase domain and an N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins. Mutations in the ESCO2 gene are linked to Roberts syndrome, a rare genetic disorder marked by growth retardation and limb malformations, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Ajam2020Alternative; Vega2009Phenotypic).

## Structure
The ESCO2 protein is a member of the GNAT (GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase) family and plays a crucial role in sister chromatid cohesion. Its structure includes a conserved C-terminal acetyltransferase domain and an N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger domain. The zinc finger domain, located between residues 385-416, consists of two β-strands and one α-helix, coordinating a zinc ion through residues C386, C389, H404, and H407 (Ajam2020Alternative; Ajam2024Investigation).

The acetyltransferase domain of ESCO2 adopts a fold common to GNAT family acetyltransferases, featuring a conserved core region with β-strands and α-helices that form the active site architecture. This domain includes critical catalytic residues such as D567, S566, E491, and S527, which are involved in the acetylation process (Ajam2020Alternative; Ajam2024Investigation). The CoA cofactor is bound in a groove formed by β7, β8, α3, and α4 helices (Ajam2020Alternative).

Mutations in the acetyltransferase domain can lead to Roberts syndrome, highlighting the importance of this domain for ESCO2's function (Vega2009Phenotypic). The protein's structure is crucial for its enzymatic activity, with specific residues facilitating proton relay and nucleophilic attack processes (Ajam2020Alternative).

## Function
The ESCO2 gene encodes an acetyltransferase that plays a crucial role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. This protein is involved in the acetylation of the Smc3 subunit of the cohesin complex, a modification essential for the recruitment of Sororin, which stabilizes cohesin on chromatin. This stabilization is vital for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis, ensuring genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy (Whelan2012The; Ajam2024Investigation).

ESCO2 is particularly active during the S-phase of the cell cycle, where it facilitates the cohesion of sister chromatids by modifying cohesin complexes. This process is essential for accurate DNA replication and repair, particularly in the context of double-strand break repair, where ESCO2 localizes to DNA lesion sites (Whelan2012The; Ajam2024Investigation).

In addition to its role in chromatid cohesion, ESCO2 is involved in repressing Notch signaling, which is crucial for neuronal differentiation. By interacting with Notch signaling proteins, ESCO2 suppresses the transactivational activity of the Notch intracellular domain, promoting neuronal differentiation and maintaining the balance between neural progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation (Leem2011Esco2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ESCO2 gene are primarily associated with Roberts syndrome (RBS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth retardation, limb malformations, and craniofacial abnormalities. RBS is considered the severe form within the RBS/SC spectrum, with SC phocomelia being the milder form. The ESCO2 gene is crucial for sister chromatid cohesion during the S phase of cell division, and its mutations lead to chromosomal abnormalities such as premature centromere separation and heterochromatin repulsion (Afifi2016Expanding; Schulz2008Prenatal).

Most ESCO2 mutations result in premature stop codons, leading to truncated proteins lacking enzymatic activity. This disruption in protein function is linked to the characteristic 'railroad track' appearance of metaphase chromosomes in RBS patients, indicating a loss of cohesion in pericentric heterochromatin (Ajam2024Investigation). Phenotypic variability is notable among individuals with ESCO2 mutations, with some mutations correlating with specific clinical features such as corneal opacities, cardiac defects, and mental retardation (Vega2009Phenotypic).

In some cases, ESCO2 mutations have been misdiagnosed as Baller-Gerold syndrome due to overlapping symptoms, such as craniosynostosis and limb reductions, highlighting the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis (Colombo2019Phenotypic).

## Interactions
ESCO2, a human protein, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in chromatid cohesion and transcription regulation. It interacts with components of the CoREST-containing corepressor complex, including CoREST, BRAF35, PHF21A, HDAC1/2, and LSD1, suggesting a role in transcription regulation through chromatin modification (Kim2008Esco2). ESCO2 also interacts with histone methyltransferases such as Suv39h1, SETDB1, and G9a, contributing to its function as a transcription repressor by modulating chromatin structure (Kim2008Esco2).

In the context of neuronal differentiation, ESCO2 interacts with components of the Notch signaling pathway, including Notch1/2 and Maml1, and represses Notch signaling by interacting with the Notch 1 intracellular domain (NICD). This interaction is crucial for promoting neuronal differentiation by antagonizing Notch signaling (Leem2011Esco2).

ESCO2 also plays a role in the stabilization of the cohesin complex on DNA by acetylating the Smc3 subunit, which is essential for sister chromatid cohesion. It interacts with replication proteins like PCNA and MCM, highlighting its role during the S-phase of the cell cycle (Ajam2020Alternative; Faramarz2020Nonredundant).
