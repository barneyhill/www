# HOXD10

## Overview
HOXD10 is a gene that encodes the homeobox D10 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family. This family is characterized by the presence of a homeodomain, which facilitates DNA binding and regulation of gene expression. The HOXD10 protein plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including embryonic development, cell differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. It is particularly significant in maintaining the differentiated state of endothelial cells and regulating endometrial receptivity during the menstrual cycle. Additionally, HOXD10 is involved in the functional differentiation of mammary epithelial cells during lactation. Its role as a tumor suppressor is well-documented, with aberrant expression linked to several cancers, including gastric, colorectal, and thyroid cancers, where it influences cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (YANG2015HOXD10; Xu2014Regulation; Landua2020Hoxd10).

## Function
HOXD10 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining a quiescent, differentiated phenotype in healthy human cells, particularly in endothelial cells. It achieves this by suppressing the expression of genes involved in remodeling the extracellular matrix and cell migration, which is essential for maintaining normal cell behavior and preventing excessive proliferation and migration (YANG2015HOXD10). In the context of the female reproductive system, HOXD10 is highly expressed in the endometrium during the mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, a critical period for implantation. It is involved in regulating endometrial receptivity by affecting embryo attachment and stromal cell decidualization, which are vital for successful implantation and pregnancy (Xu2014Regulation).

In the mammary gland, HOXD10 is essential for secretory activation during lactation. It is expressed in various cell types, including luminal epithelial and stromal cells, and is involved in the prolactin signaling cascade, which is crucial for the functional differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Disruption of HOXD10 leads to impaired lactation, highlighting its systemic role in mammary gland development and function (Landua2020Hoxd10).

## Clinical Significance
The HOXD10 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In gastric cancer, HOXD10 is frequently downregulated through promoter hypermethylation, contributing to tumorigenesis. This downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while reexpression of HOXD10 can inhibit these processes and induce apoptosis (Wang2011Homeobox). In colorectal cancer, HOXD10 is also hypermethylated, correlating with advanced disease stages and metastasis. Restoring its expression suppresses cell growth and invasiveness, highlighting its tumor-suppressive functions (Pan2021Restoring).

In papillary thyroid cancer, particularly in cases with the BRAF V600E mutation, HOXD10 is often hypermethylated, leading to decreased expression and contributing to tumorigenesis. This suggests its potential as a biomarker for assessing recurrence and metastasis risk (Cao2017Aberrant). In cholangiocellular carcinoma, low HOXD10 expression is linked to poor prognosis, with overexpression inhibiting cell invasion and proliferation by affecting the RHOC/AKT/MAPK pathway (YANG2015HOXD10). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, HOXD10 overexpression suppresses invasion and migration, targeting E-cadherin and affecting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process (Ren2021Upregulation). These findings underscore the clinical significance of HOXD10 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
HOXD10 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its regulatory functions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HOXD10 interacts with the promoter region of the IGFBP3 gene, leading to increased expression of IGFBP3. This interaction results in the inhibition of ERK signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby suppressing cell invasion and migration in HCC cells (Guo2017Silencing).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), HOXD10 physically interacts with the promoters of AMOT-p80 and miR-146a. Overexpression of HOXD10 increases luciferase activity from a wild-type AMOT-p80 promoter reporter construct, indicating a direct transcriptional effect. This effect is not observed when the HOXD10-binding sites in the promoter are mutated. Similarly, HOXD10 overexpression suppresses luciferase activity from a wild-type miR-146a promoter reporter construct, with this suppression absent when the HOXD10-binding site is mutated (Hakami2014The).

HOXD10 also plays a role in spinal cord development, where it regulates the expression of downstream target genes by binding to specific Hox protein binding elements in their promoter regions. This regulation affects regional patterning in the lumbar spinal cord (Hedlund2004Identification).
