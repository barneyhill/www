# POLR3F

## Overview
POLR3F is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase III subunit F, a critical component of the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) complex in eukaryotic cells. This protein is integral to the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which are essential for protein synthesis and various cellular functions. As part of the Pol III initiation complex, RNA polymerase III subunit F plays a pivotal role in the initiation and regulation of transcription, contributing to cellular homeostasis and gene expression (Kessler2021The). Additionally, POLR3F is involved in the immune response, particularly in the detection of viral DNA, which can trigger interferon production, underscoring its significance in antiviral defense (Kessler2021The). The protein's interactions within the Pol III complex and its involvement in transcriptional regulation highlight its importance in maintaining cellular function and responding to external stimuli (Renaud2013Gene).

## Function
POLR3F encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), which is crucial for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, including tRNAs and 5S rRNA, in eukaryotic cells. This subunit is part of the Pol III initiation complex, playing a significant role in the initiation of transcription. POLR3F is involved in the synthesis of RNAs that are essential for protein translation and cellular function, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kessler2021The).

In healthy human cells, POLR3F is active in the nucleoplasm, where it participates in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs. These RNAs are vital for various cellular processes, including translation and RNA processing. The activity of POLR3F, as part of the Pol III complex, is essential for the efficient reuse of transcription complexes, a process known as termination-associated reinitiation-recycling, which is unique to Pol III (Unknownauthors2022EvolutionoftheRNACleavageSubunitC11RPC10).

POLR3F also plays a role in the immune response by contributing to the sensing of AT-rich viral DNA, which can lead to the activation of interferon production, highlighting its importance in antiviral defense mechanisms (Kessler2021The).

## Interactions
POLR3F, a subunit of RNA polymerase III, is involved in various protein-protein interactions within the Pol III complex. It forms part of a trimeric complex with POLR3C and POLR3G, which is crucial for the formation of transcription initiation complexes. This trimeric complex interacts with the transcription factor complex TFIIIB, specifically associating with BRF1 and TBP, components of TFIIIB, in mammalian cells. The interaction with BRF1 is essential for stabilizing the open preinitiation complex, which is necessary for Pol III to associate with its target genes (Renaud2013Gene).

During apoptosis, POLR3F is identified as a substrate for ADP-ribosylation by truncated PARP1 (tPARP1). This modification occurs at residue E100, and a mutation at this site impairs the ability of Pol III to induce IFN-β expression. The ADP-ribosylation of POLR3F may lead to conformational changes in the POLR3E-POLR3F-TFIIIB complex, affecting the catalytic center of Pol III and modulating its interactions with nucleic acids during transcription (Chen2022Truncated). These interactions highlight the role of POLR3F in both the structural integrity and functional regulation of the Pol III complex.
