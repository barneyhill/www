# TUBA8

## Overview
TUBA8 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin alpha-8, a member of the alpha tubulin family, which is integral to the formation of microtubules. These microtubules are critical components of the cytoskeleton, involved in maintaining cell shape, facilitating intracellular transport, and enabling cell division (Mubeen2016In; Diggle2017A). Tubulin alpha-8 is distinguished by its unique structural features, including the absence of certain post-translational modification sites found in other alpha tubulins, which may influence its role in microtubule dynamics and stability (Diggle2017A; Nsamba2022Tubulin). While TUBA8 is expressed in various tissues, it is notably abundant in the testis and muscle, suggesting specialized functions in these areas (Diggle2017A). The gene's divergence from other tubulins and its involvement in specific cellular processes underscore its potential significance in both normal physiology and disease contexts, such as its association with neurological disorders like polymicrogyria (Romaniello2015Mutations; Diggle2017A).

## Structure
TUBA8, a member of the alpha tubulin family, is a protein that forms heterodimers with beta tubulins to create microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton. TUBA8 is the most divergent member of this family, characterized by unique structural features. It lacks two key post-translational modification sites found in other alpha tubulins, including the lysine acetylation site at position 40, which is associated with microtubule stability. Instead, TUBA8 has an alanine at this position, although it possesses a lysine two amino acids downstream (K42), whose potential for acetylation and functional consequences remain unknown (Diggle2017A).

TUBA8 also terminates with a phenylalanine instead of the usual tyrosine, affecting microtubule stability and function. This structural variation could influence its interaction with other proteins and its role in microtubule dynamics (Nsamba2022Tubulin). The absence of the terminal tyrosine residue means TUBA8 does not undergo the detyrosination/tyrosination cycle, a post-translational modification that can impact microtubule behavior (Nsamba2022Tubulin). These structural differences suggest a unique role for TUBA8 in microtubule biology, particularly in tissues where it is abundantly expressed, such as testis and muscle (Diggle2017A).

## Function
The TUBA8 gene encodes tubulin alpha-8, a member of the alpha tubulin family, which plays a crucial role in the formation of microtubules, essential components of the cytoskeleton. Microtubules are involved in maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division (Mubeen2016In; Diggle2017A). TUBA8 is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the testis and muscle, and lower levels in the brain (Diggle2017A). 

In the cellular context, TUBA8 contributes to the assembly of microtubules by forming heterodimers with beta tubulins. These microtubules are integral to processes such as mitosis and intracellular trafficking (Mubeen2016In). Despite its low expression in the brain, TUBA8 may play a role in specific cell types critical for brain development, although its exact function in the brain remains less clear compared to other tubulin genes (Romaniello2015Mutations; Diggle2017A). 

TUBA8 is also involved in spermatogenesis, particularly in the development of spermatids, although it does not appear to be critical for mature sperm function (Diggle2017A). The gene's divergence from other alpha tubulins, including the absence of certain post-translational modification sites, suggests a unique role in microtubule biology (Diggle2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBA8 gene have been associated with polymicrogyria (PMG), a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal brain development. Initial studies identified homozygous hypomorphic mutations in TUBA8 in humans with PMG syndrome, suggesting a potential role in cerebral cortex development (Diggle2017A). However, further investigation revealed that the neurodevelopmental anomalies observed in these patients might be attributed to a concurrent mutation in the SNAP29 gene, which is linked to CEDNIK syndrome, rather than solely to TUBA8 deficiency (Diggle2017A).

Despite the association of TUBA8 mutations with PMG in humans, a Tuba8 knockout mouse model did not exhibit PMG or other neurological abnormalities, indicating that TUBA8 may not be critical for brain development in mice (Diggle2017A). This discrepancy suggests that the role of TUBA8 in human neurological disorders may be more complex and potentially involves interactions with other genetic factors.

In addition to its potential involvement in neurological conditions, TUBA8 is highly expressed in the testis and plays a role in spermatogenesis. However, knockout mice remained fertile, suggesting that TUBA8 is not essential for fertility, although it may contribute to spermatid development (Diggle2017A).
