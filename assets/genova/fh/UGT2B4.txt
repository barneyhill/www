# UGT2B4

## Overview
UGT2B4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B4, a critical component of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family involved in the glucuronidation process. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and plays a pivotal role in phase II metabolism by catalyzing the conjugation of glucuronic acid to a variety of substrates, including bile acids, bilirubin, steroids, and drugs, thereby enhancing their solubility and facilitating excretion (Barbier2003Peroxisome). The UGT2B4 protein is characterized by its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear structures, which supports its function in detoxification processes (Lévesque2010Extensive). The gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can modulate the enzyme's activity and interactions within the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family (Lévesque2010Extensive). UGT2B4's activity is regulated by nuclear receptors such as FXR and PPARα, which are involved in maintaining bile acid homeostasis and preventing cytotoxic accumulation (Barbier2003FXR; Barbier2003Peroxisome).

## Structure
The UGT2B4 protein is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, involved in the glucuronidation process. The classical isoform, UGT2B4_i1, is a 55-kDa protein with several key structural features. It includes an N-terminal signal peptide that targets the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a substrate binding domain located between amino acid residues 104 and 221 (Lévesque2010Extensive). The C-terminal half contains the UGT signature sequence, a putative cofactor binding domain between residues 335-438, and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain in residues 493-509, which is involved in ER retention (Lévesque2010Extensive).

Alternative splicing of the UGT2B4 gene results in various isoforms, such as UGT2B4_i2, i3, and i4, which lack the transmembrane domain and ER retention signal, potentially altering their function and localization (Lévesque2010Extensive). Other splice forms, like UGT2B4_i5 and i6, result from internal exon skipping, leading to proteins that lack the UDP-glucuronic acid co-substrate binding domain, essential for enzymatic activity (Lévesque2010Extensive). Despite these structural differences, all UGT2B4 splice forms are expressed in the ER and perinuclear structures (Lévesque2010Extensive). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in bile acid metabolism and glucuronidation.

## Function
UGT2B4 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B4) is an enzyme primarily active in the liver, where it plays a crucial role in the glucuronidation process, a major phase II metabolic pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conjugation of glucuronic acid to various endogenous and exogenous compounds, including bile acids, bilirubin, steroids, and drugs, enhancing their solubility and facilitating their excretion via bile or urine (Barbier2003Peroxisome). UGT2B4 is particularly important for the glucuronidation of the bile acid hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), where it exhibits strict substrate specificity for the 6-OH group of HDCA, contributing significantly to its detoxification in the liver (Pillot1993Glucuronidation).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by nuclear receptors such as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). FXR activation by bile acids induces UGT2B4 expression, suggesting a feedback mechanism to control intracellular bile acid levels and prevent their cytotoxic accumulation (Barbier2003FXR). PPARα also enhances UGT2B4 expression, further increasing its glucuronidation activity, which is crucial for maintaining bile acid homeostasis and preventing cholestatic conditions (Barbier2003Peroxisome). UGT2B4's localization to the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear structures supports its role in these essential detoxification processes (Lévesque2010Extensive).

## Interactions
UGT2B4, a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function. The UGT2B4 gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct structural properties. These isoforms can interact with each other, affecting enzymatic activity. For instance, when isoforms such as UGT2B4_i2, i3, or i5 are co-expressed with the active UGT2B4_i1 isoform, they significantly reduce its glucuronidation activity by 40-50%, suggesting potential interactions or competitive inhibition among these isoforms (Lévesque2010Extensive).

UGT2B4 is also part of a broader network of interactions within the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family. It has been identified as an interacting partner of UGT1A enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism and detoxification. These interactions are consistent with known expression profiles in tissues such as the liver and kidney, indicating a complex network of UGTs that collaborate in metabolic processes (Rouleau2017Endogenous). The interactions between UGT2B4 and other UGT family members highlight its role in forming a functional network that modulates glucuronidation and contributes to bile acid homeostasis (Lévesque2010Extensive).
