# ISL1

## Overview
ISL1, or ISL LIM homeobox 1, is a gene that encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. The ISL1 protein is characterized by the presence of two LIM domains and a homeodomain, which facilitate its function as a transcription factor by enabling protein-protein interactions and specific DNA binding, respectively (Behravan1997Expression; Bach2000The). As a transcription factor, ISL1 is integral to the development and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells, influencing the formation of cardiac structures and the function of pacemaker cells in the heart (Fonoudi2013ISL1; Liang2015Transcription). Beyond its cardiac roles, ISL1 is involved in the specification of heart chambers and interacts with various proteins to regulate gene expression in different tissues (Quaranta2018Revised; Eeckhoute2006Hepatocyte). Mutations in the ISL1 gene have been linked to congenital heart defects and other conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Ma2018ISL1; Zhang2024Missense).

## Structure
The ISL1 protein is a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor characterized by the presence of two LIM domains and a homeodomain. The LIM domains are zinc-binding structures that facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for forming transcriptional complexes. These domains do not bind DNA directly but are involved in the assembly of multiprotein complexes, playing a significant role in gene regulation and cellular functions such as cytoskeleton organization and cell lineage specification (Bach2000The; Matthews2009It).

The homeodomain of ISL1 is a conserved 60 amino acid sequence responsible for specific DNA binding. It has been shown to bind specifically to the -TAAT-core sequence, with a helix content of approximately 40% as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Behravan1997Expression). The presence of DNA stabilizes the secondary structure of the homeodomain, significantly increasing the free energy of unfolding (Behravan1997Expression).

ISL1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms: Isl1α and Isl1β. The alternative isoform, Isl1β, lacks 23 amino acids in the C-terminal region, affecting its ability to form certain transcriptional complexes (Whitney2015Alternative). These isoforms exhibit different functional properties and tissue-specific expression patterns (Whitney2015Alternative).

## Function
The ISL1 gene encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells. In healthy human cells, ISL1 is involved in the differentiation of cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It acts at the top of a cascade of cardiac transcription factors, marking myocardial lineage during mammalian cardiogenesis and contributing significantly to the formation of various cardiac structures, including the outflow tract, right ventricle, and atria (Fonoudi2013ISL1; Laugwitz2008Islet1).

ISL1 is also essential for the development and function of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN) of the heart. It regulates the expression of genes necessary for normal pacemaker function, including those encoding ion channels and transcription factors. ISL1 is crucial for the survival, proliferation, and function of SAN cells, maintaining a normal heart rate and preventing sinus arrhythmia (Liang2015Transcription).

In addition to its role in cardiac development, ISL1 influences the specification of heart chambers by promoting ventricular identity and suppressing atrial specification through its interaction with retinoic acid signaling pathways (Quaranta2018Revised).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ISL1 gene have been implicated in several congenital heart defects (CHDs) and other conditions. A novel heterozygous mutation, c.409G > T (p.E137X), has been identified in families with CHDs such as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and ventricular septal defect (VSD). This mutation results in a truncated ISL1 protein, leading to a loss of function and is associated with autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance (Ma2018ISL1). Another mutation, c.631A>T (p.Lys211*), is linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), disrupting interactions with transcription factors crucial for cardiac development (Xu2018Identification).

ISL1 mutations are also associated with type 2 diabetes. The E283D missense mutation affects insulin secretion and is linked to decreased insulin expression in pancreatic islets, contributing to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (Zhang2024Missense).

Additionally, common polymorphisms in the ISL1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of CHDs in various populations, supporting the common variant-common disease hypothesis (Stevens2010Common). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ISL1 in various genetic disorders.

## Interactions
ISL1 (ISL LIM homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that engages in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. ISL1 interacts with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α), serving as a cofactor on promoters such as HNF1α and PPARα. This interaction is facilitated by ISL1's homeodomain and LIM domain, which are essential for binding to HNF4α, and is enhanced by the recruitment of the cofactor CLIM2, forming multi-protein complexes that boost transcription (Eeckhoute2006Hepatocyte).

In neuroblastoma, ISL1 physically interacts with the transcription factor GATA3, co-regulating genes critical for tumor proliferation and differentiation. This interaction is characterized by substantial co-occupancy at binding regions, with ISL1's binding being less dependent on GATA3, although both are required for robust gene activation (Zhang2019Collaborative).

ISL1 also forms a complex with Pou4f2 in developing retinal ganglion cells, co-regulating target genes by binding to specific DNA motifs. This interaction involves both proteins' DNA-binding domains and is confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (Li2014Isl1).

In the context of motor neuron specification, ISL1 interacts with Lhx3, forming a complex that recruits coactivators like p300 and RbBP5, enhancing transcription of target genes such as Hb9 (Seo2015Critical).
