(TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. The protein forms homo-oligomers via the coilel-coil region and localizes to cytoplasmic bodies. It appears to function as a E3 ubiquitin-ligase and ubiqutinates itself to regulate its subcellular localization. It may play a role in retroviral restriction. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.
