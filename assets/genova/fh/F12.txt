# F12

## Overview
The F12 gene encodes coagulation factor XII (FXII), a serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. Synthesized primarily in the liver, FXII circulates in the plasma as an inactive zymogen and is activated upon contact with negatively charged surfaces, initiating a cascade of reactions that lead to thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation (Naudin2017Factor). Structurally, FXII is a single-chain glycoprotein with multiple domains, including fibronectin type-II, epidermal growth factor-like, and kringle domains, which facilitate its interactions and activation (Heestermans2021Identification; côté1993studies). Despite its critical role in coagulation, FXII deficiency does not result in bleeding disorders, highlighting its non-essential role in hemostasis in humans (Naudin2017Factor). Mutations in the F12 gene are linked to hereditary angioedema type III, characterized by recurrent swelling episodes due to increased bradykinin production (Martin2007Hereditary). Additionally, certain polymorphisms in F12 are associated with an elevated risk of venous thrombosis (Tirado2004Association).

## Structure
Coagulation factor XII (F12) is a single-chain glycoprotein composed of 596 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 80,000. It is synthesized in the liver and undergoes post-translational modifications, including the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides and at least one O-linked fucose residue (côté1993studies). The primary structure of F12 includes several domains: a fibronectin type-II (Fib-II) domain, two epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains, a fibronectin type-I (Fib-I) domain, a kringle (KR) domain, and a proline-rich (PR) domain. The serine protease domain is located in the C-terminal light chain (Heestermans2021Identification).

The kringle domain, composed of approximately 80 amino acids with six invariant cysteine residues forming three disulfide bridges, is involved in binding interactions (côté1993studies). The EGF-like regions, each about 50 amino acids long, contain nine invariant cysteine and glycine residues and are present in various proteins, suggesting potential metal ion-binding sites (côté1993studies). The PR-III region within the proline-rich domain is critical for contact activation, as it contains a surface binding site necessary for FXII activation (Heestermans2021Identification).

## Function
Coagulation factor XII (F12), also known as Hageman factor, is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. It is primarily produced by hepatocytes and circulates in the plasma as an inactive zymogen at a concentration of approximately 30 μg/mL, with a half-life of 50 to 70 hours (Naudin2017Factor). Upon contact with negatively charged surfaces, FXII undergoes activation to form FXIIa, an active protease that initiates a cascade of reactions leading to thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation (Naudin2017Factor).

FXIIa activates factor XI (FXI), which is essential for the formation of thrombin and fibrin, key components of blood clotting (Naudin2017Factor). FXIIa also activates plasma kallikrein, which releases bradykinin, a proinflammatory mediator, linking coagulation with inflammatory processes (Naudin2017Factor). The activity of FXIIa is regulated by the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH), which serves as its main inhibitor (Naudin2017Factor).

FXII is involved in thrombus formation and stabilization, particularly in pathological conditions, and its deficiency can lead to defective thrombus formation, as demonstrated in FXII-deficient mice (Renné2005Defective). Despite its role in coagulation, FXII deficiency does not result in bleeding disorders, indicating that it is not essential for hemostasis in humans (Naudin2017Factor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the F12 gene, which encodes coagulation factor XII, are associated with hereditary angioedema type III (HAE-FXII). This condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of swelling in the skin, abdomen, and upper respiratory tract. Unlike other forms of hereditary angioedema, HAE-FXII occurs with normal C1 inhibitor function and is linked to specific mutations such as p.Thr328Lys and p.Thr309Lys in the F12 gene (Dewald2006Missense; Bork2009Hereditary; Martin2007Hereditary). These mutations lead to increased activity of the Hageman factor protease, resulting in excessive bradykinin production, which increases vascular permeability and causes edema (Martin2007Hereditary).

HAE-FXII predominantly affects women, with symptoms often triggered by high estrogen levels during pregnancy or contraceptive use (Bork2009Hereditary; Bork2015Hereditary). The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance, meaning not all individuals with the mutation exhibit symptoms (Bork2009Hereditary; Bork2015Hereditary).

Additionally, a polymorphism in the F12 gene, specifically the 46C→T transition, has been associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Individuals homozygous for the T allele have a significantly higher risk of developing venous thrombosis, potentially due to lower levels of factor XII activity (Tirado2004Association).

## Interactions
Coagulation factor XII (F12) is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. It interacts with various proteins and surfaces, facilitating its activation and function. F12 binds to negatively charged surfaces, such as kaolin and polyphosphate, which induces a conformational change necessary for its activation (Konrath2021Mechanism). The heavy chain of F12 contains domains that mediate contact with other proteins and surfaces, including the fibronectin type II (Fib-II) domain, which is identified as a surface binding site (Konrath2021Mechanism).

F12 interacts with high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) and plasma prekallikrein (PK) to form the plasma contact activation system, leading to the release of bradykinin and activation of inflammatory processes (Heestermans2021Identification). The PR-III region of F12 is crucial for its binding to surfaces, and deletion of this region prevents surface-induced activation (Heestermans2021Identification).

F12 also forms complexes with the C1 inhibitor (C1INH), which binds and inactivates both wild-type and Thr309-mutated FXIIa similarly, suggesting that hereditary angioedema type III is not due to a functional deficiency of C1INH (Björkqvist2015Defective). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of F12 in coagulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
