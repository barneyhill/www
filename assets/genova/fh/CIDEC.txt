# CIDEC

## Overview
The CIDEC gene encodes the protein cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c, which is a member of the CIDE family of proteins. This protein is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, playing a critical role in the regulation of lipid droplet dynamics within adipocytes. CIDEC is predominantly expressed in white adipose tissue, where it facilitates the fusion and growth of lipid droplets, thereby promoting efficient lipid storage. The protein's structure includes distinct domains that enable it to interact with other proteins and phospholipids, crucial for its function in lipid droplet fusion and growth. CIDEC's activity is modulated by various factors, including insulin and TNF-α, which influence its expression and, consequently, lipid metabolism. Alterations in the CIDEC gene have been associated with metabolic disorders such as partial lipodystrophy and obesity-related conditions, highlighting its significance in maintaining metabolic health (Chen2019CIDE; Slayton2019CIDE; Tan2016TNF‐α).

## Structure
The CIDEC protein, also known as cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c, is a member of the CIDE family, which includes CIDEA and CIDEB. It is characterized by two main domains: the CIDE-N domain and the CIDE-C domain, connected by a linker region. The CIDE-N domain, comprising amino acids 39-119, is involved in homodimerization and plays a regulatory role in promoting lipid droplet (LD) growth (Wang2018Polybasic). The CIDE-C domain, spanning amino acids 136-239, is crucial for LD targeting and fusion, containing amphipathic α-helices and hydrophobic regions (Wang2018Polybasic).

The linker region, consisting of amino acids 120-135, includes a polybasic RKKR motif that interacts with acidic phospholipids, inhibiting LD fusion through electrostatic interactions (Wang2018Polybasic). Mutations in this motif can lead to the formation of supersized LDs, highlighting its regulatory importance (Wang2018Polybasic).

CIDEC can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and its interaction with Perilipin1 (PLIN1) via the CIDE-N domain activates LD fusion (Wang2018Polybasic). The protein's secondary structure includes coil, helix, and strand elements (Wang2013Cell).

## Function
The CIDEC gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in human cells. CIDEC is primarily expressed in white adipose tissue and is involved in the regulation of lipid droplet dynamics, promoting the fusion and growth of lipid droplets (LDs) to facilitate efficient lipid storage (Chen2019CIDE; Slayton2019CIDE). The protein is enriched at lipid droplet contact sites, where it facilitates the transfer of neutral lipids from smaller to larger droplets, a process essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis (Chen2019CIDE).

CIDEC interacts with other proteins, such as perilipin1, to enhance lipid droplet fusion and growth, and it is regulated by factors like insulin and TNF-α (Slayton2019CIDE; Tan2016TNF‐α). Insulin upregulates CIDEC expression, promoting lipid droplet enlargement, while TNF-α downregulates it, leading to increased lipolysis (Tan2016TNF‐α; Ito2010Differential). CIDEC also inhibits adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), reducing lipolysis and promoting triglyceride storage, which is crucial for maintaining insulin sensitivity and preventing ectopic lipid accumulation (Tan2016TNF‐α). Overall, CIDEC is a key regulator of lipid storage and energy balance in adipocytes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CIDEC gene are linked to several metabolic disorders. In humans, mutations in CIDEC can lead to partial lipodystrophy, characterized by the absence of adipose tissue in specific body regions, insulin-resistant diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis. A specific case involves a homozygous nonsense mutation resulting in a truncated protein that cannot associate with lipid droplets, leading to these conditions (Greenberg2011The; Vigouroux2012Genetic).

Altered expression of CIDEC is associated with obesity and related metabolic dysfunctions. In obese individuals, CIDEC expression is reduced, correlating with increased TNF-a levels and systemic lipolysis, which may contribute to ectopic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance in muscle and liver (Tan2016TNF‐α). In mice, Cidec-knockout models show increased lipolysis and reduced fat mass, with protection against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, although this compensatory pathway is insufficient to prevent insulin resistance (Greenberg2011The; Xu2012CIDE).

Rare coding variants in CIDEC have been linked to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), particularly in patients with small low-luminance deficits. These variants may lead to defects in lipid droplet formation and fat storage, potentially contributing to AMD pathophysiology (Kim2023Rare).

## Interactions
CIDEC, also known as FSP27, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in lipid droplet (LD) fusion and lipid metabolism. One significant interaction is with perilipin 1 (PLIN1), which enhances CIDEC's activity. This interaction is electrostatic, involving the acidic motif of PLIN1 and the positively charged residues at the N terminus of CIDEC. This interaction reduces the concentration threshold for CIDEC phase separation, leading to larger lipid transfer areas (Lyu2021A). 

CIDEC also interacts with phospholipids through a polybasic RKKR motif in its linker region. This motif interacts with acidic phospholipids on the LD surface, regulating LD fusion and growth. Mutations in this motif can lead to the formation of supersized LDs, indicating its regulatory role in maintaining LD size and structure (Wang2018Polybasic).

The N-terminal region of CIDEC is crucial for its condensation and interaction at LD contact sites, forming a gel-like structure that facilitates lipid transfer. This region undergoes phase separation, which is essential for the formation of lipid droplet contact sites and modulates LD fusion in cells (Lyu2021A). These interactions highlight CIDEC's role in lipid metabolism and its regulatory mechanisms in cellular lipid homeostasis.
