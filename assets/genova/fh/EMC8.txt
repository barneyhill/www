# EMC8

## Overview
EMC8 is a gene that encodes the ER membrane protein complex subunit 8, a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC). This protein is involved in the insertion and folding of transmembrane domains into the ER membrane, playing a significant role in the biogenesis and stabilization of membrane proteins. As a cytosolic subunit, EMC8 interacts with other integral membrane subunits of the EMC, contributing to its function as a membrane insertase. The protein is characterized by its structural homology to other peptide hydrolase folds and forms a cap-like structure on the cytoplasmic domain of the EMC, interacting with subunits such as EMC2, EMC4, and EMC5. These interactions are essential for the assembly and stability of the EMC, which is vital for maintaining ER homeostasis and ensuring the correct insertion and folding of membrane proteins (Pleiner2020Regulated; Hegde2022The; MillerVedam2020Structural).

## Structure
EMC8 is a subunit of the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a crucial role in the insertion and folding of membrane proteins. The primary structure of EMC8 shares approximately 44% sequence identity with its paralog EMC9, indicating a high degree of homology (Hegde2022The; MillerVedam2020Structural). The secondary structure of EMC8 is modeled to have a globular density on the distal face of the EMC2 solenoid, with structural homology to CSN5 and Rpn11, which are known for their peptide hydrolase folds (MillerVedam2020Structural). 

In terms of tertiary structure, EMC8 is predicted to have a core fold similar to EMC9, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.6 Å when compared to EMC9, suggesting a nearly identical alpha-carbon backbone (O’Donnell2020The). The quaternary structure of EMC8 involves its interaction with EMC2, forming a composite interface crucial for the stability of the EMC complex (Pleiner2020Structural). EMC8, along with EMC2, forms a cap-like structure on the cytoplasmic domain of the EMC, interacting with other subunits such as EMC4 and EMC5 (Hegde2022The). The specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of EMC8 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
EMC8 is a component of the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a critical role in the biogenesis of membrane proteins. This complex is involved in the insertion and folding of transmembrane domains (TMDs) into the lipid bilayer of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, impacting the abundance and localization of various membrane proteins, including tail-anchored proteins and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Chitwood2019The; Page2023Role). EMC8, along with its paralog EMC9, is one of the cytosolic subunits that associates with the integral membrane subunits of the EMC, contributing to the complex's function as a membrane insertase (Chitwood2019The).

EMC8 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the EMC by displacing WNK1, a regulatory protein, and facilitating subsequent interactions with other EMC subunits (Pleiner2020Regulated). This displacement is crucial for the proper assembly of the EMC, which is essential for maintaining ER homeostasis and ensuring the correct insertion and folding of membrane proteins. The EMC, including EMC8, operates in conjunction with other complexes like the Sec61 translocon to facilitate the insertion of transmembrane domains, particularly in proteins that adopt an Nexo topology (Page2023Role).

## Interactions
EMC8 is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC) and participates in several interactions with other proteins. It is involved in the assembly and function of the CaV1.2 channel by interacting with the CaVb3 protein through a site known as the 'Cyto dock'. This interaction involves a network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, suggesting that EMC8 stabilizes the CaV1.2/CaVb3 complex (Chen2022EMC).

EMC8 also interacts with EMC2, forming part of the EMC2-8 heterodimer, which is crucial for the assembly of the EMC complex. This interaction is characterized by an extended hydrophobic patch on EMC2 that overlaps with the binding site of WNK1, a kinase involved in cellular ion homeostasis. The binding of EMC8 to EMC2 is necessary for subsequent interactions with EMC5, indicating a sequential assembly pathway (Pleiner2020Regulated).

In humans, EMC8 and its paralog EMC9 cap the cytoplasmic domain of the EMC, interacting with EMC2, EMC3, EMC4, and parts of EMC5. This cap-like structure is involved in the structural organization of the EMC complex (MillerVedam2020Structural). EMC8's interactions are essential for the stability and function of the EMC, as it competes with E3 ubiquitin ligase binding, reducing the ubiquitination of EMC2 (Pleiner2020Regulated).
