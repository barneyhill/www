# ATP10A

## Overview
ATP10A is a gene that encodes the ATPase phospholipid transporting 10A (putative), a member of the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a lipid flippase. This protein is integral to the translocation of specific phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine and glucosylceramide, across cellular membranes, thereby maintaining lipid asymmetry crucial for various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking and signal transduction (Norris2024Deficiency; Andersen2016P4ATPases). ATP10A is predominantly active in the plasma membrane, where it plays a vital role in cellular communication and membrane dynamics (Andersen2016P4ATPases). The gene's expression and function are significant in metabolic and reproductive health, with deficiencies linked to conditions such as insulin resistance and infertility (Norris2023Deficiency; Norris2024ATP10A). Additionally, ATP10A is located in a genomic region associated with Angelman syndrome, highlighting its potential involvement in neurobehavioral disorders (van2014Cellular).

## Structure
ATP10A is a member of the P4-ATPase family, which are phospholipid flippases involved in the translocation of phospholipids across cellular membranes. The protein is composed of a large polypeptide chain, approximately 120 kDa in size, and is predicted to have a structure with 10 transmembrane segments. These segments are organized into four main domains: the N-domain, which binds ATP; the P-domain, containing a conserved aspartic acid residue crucial for phosphorylation; the A-domain, which facilitates dephosphorylation; and the M-domain, responsible for translocating lipid substrates across membranes (Andersen2016P4ATPases).

The M-domain is particularly significant, with segments M1-M6 forming the principal transport unit, while M7-M10 play a supporting role (Andersen2016P4ATPases). ATP10A interacts with CDC50 proteins, specifically CDC50A, which serve as accessory subunits essential for its functional activity (Andersen2016P4ATPases). This interaction is crucial for the proper folding and exit of ATP10A from the endoplasmic reticulum, although CDC50 proteins do not directly influence its subcellular targeting post-ER exit (Andersen2016P4ATPases). ATP10A is involved in the uptake of phosphatidylcholine, as demonstrated in studies using HeLa cells (Andersen2016P4ATPases).

## Function
ATP10A encodes a type IV P-type ATPase, also known as a lipid flippase, which is involved in the translocation of specific lipids across cell membranes. This protein primarily translocates phosphatidylcholine (PC) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) from the exoplasmic or luminal leaflets to the cytosolic leaflets of cell membranes, contributing to the asymmetric distribution of lipids within membranes (Norris2024Deficiency). This activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including apoptosis, vesicular trafficking, and signal transduction (Norris2023Deficiency).

In healthy human cells, ATP10A is active in the plasma membrane and plays a significant role in maintaining membrane asymmetry, which is essential for cellular communication and membrane dynamics (Andersen2016P4ATPases). The protein's function is vital for processes like vesicle formation and lipid signaling, impacting cellular communication and membrane dynamics (Andersen2016P4ATPases). ATP10A's activity in translocating PC is particularly important, as PC is the most abundant phospholipid in cellular membranes and its metabolites are involved in modulating inflammation and disease states (Norris2024Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATP10A gene have been implicated in several metabolic and reproductive conditions. ATP10A deficiency is associated with insulin resistance and vascular complications, such as atherosclerosis. Variants in ATP10A have been linked to an increased risk of insulin resistance, while variants in the related gene ATP10D are associated with atherosclerosis risk (Norris2023Deficiency; Norris2024Deficiency). In mice, ATP10A deficiency leads to female-specific dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated plasma triglycerides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol, as well as altered VLDL and HDL properties. This condition is more pronounced in females and is linked to hepatic insulin resistance (Norris2023Deficiency; Norris2024Deficiency).

ATP10A is also linked to male-specific infertility in mice. Deficiency in this gene results in smaller testes, reduced sperm count, and decreased sperm motility, leading to infertility. These changes are associated with alterations in gonadotropin-dependent signaling and elevated testosterone levels, despite reduced testicular size (Norris2024ATP10A). Additionally, ATP10A maps within the 15q11-q13 region, commonly deleted in Angelman syndrome, which is characterized by neurobehavioral anomalies (van2014Cellular).

## Interactions
ATP10A, a member of the P4-ATPase family, interacts with CDC50A, a protein essential for its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to other cellular compartments. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and function of ATP10A, as CDC50A stabilizes the E2P conformation of P4-ATPases, preventing dephosphorylation and facilitating the ATPase reaction cycle (Tone2019ATPase). The interaction between ATP10A and CDC50A is particularly associated with the E2P conformation, and coimmunoprecipitation studies have demonstrated that CDC50A interacts with both wild-type and certain mutant forms of ATP10A (Tone2019ATPase).

ATP10A is also involved in the translocation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) across the plasma membrane, which is critical for maintaining membrane asymmetry and influencing cellular processes such as cell adhesion and membrane curvature (Miyano2016Alteration; Takada2018Phospholipid‐flipping). While specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, ATP10A's role in lipid translocation suggests it may indirectly influence signaling pathways and cellular dynamics through its effects on membrane composition and structure (Norris2024ATP10A).
