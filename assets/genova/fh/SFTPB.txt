# SFTPB

## Overview
The SFTPB gene encodes surfactant protein B (SP-B), a crucial component of the pulmonary surfactant system, which is essential for normal respiratory function. SP-B is a hydrophobic protein that belongs to the Saposin-like Protein (SALIP) family, characterized by amphipathic helical sequences and conserved cysteine residues. It plays a vital role in reducing surface tension in the alveoli, thereby preventing their collapse during exhalation and facilitating efficient gas exchange. The protein is synthesized as a precursor and undergoes proteolytic processing to form a mature, disulfide-linked dimer that is active in alveolar type II cells and nonciliated bronchiolar cells. SP-B is integral to the adsorption and spreading of phospholipids at the air-liquid interface in the lungs and is involved in the processing of other surfactant proteins, such as surfactant protein C (SP-C). Mutations in the SFTPB gene can lead to severe respiratory conditions, including neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, underscoring its critical role in pulmonary health (Patel2018Progress; Hamvas2007Comprehensive; Lin2018Genetic).

## Structure
The SFTPB gene encodes surfactant protein B (SP-B), which is initially synthesized as a 42 kDa proprotein consisting of 381 amino acids. This precursor undergoes proteolytic processing to produce a mature 7-8 kDa peptide of 79 amino acids (Patel2018Progress; Hamvas2008Developmental). The primary structure of SP-B includes a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids, making up 52% of its sequence, which contributes to its interaction with lipid membranes (Patel2018Progress).

The secondary structure of SP-B is characterized by a high α-helical content, estimated to be between 40-50% (Patel2018Progress). The tertiary structure is stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bridges formed by six of its seven cysteine residues (Patel2018Progress). SP-B is part of the Saposin-like Protein (SALIP) family, which is known for amphipathic helical sequences and conserved cysteine residues (Patel2018Progress).

SP-B functions as a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure, and is permanently associated with membranes, playing a crucial role in lipid spreading and membrane stabilization (Patel2018Progress). The protein's ability to induce membrane curvature and stabilize lipid vesicles is essential for its function in pulmonary surfactant (Patel2018Progress).

## Function
Surfactant protein B (SP-B), encoded by the SFTPB gene, is a critical component of pulmonary surfactant, a complex of lipids and proteins that reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing their collapse during exhalation. SP-B is synthesized as a 42 kDa precursor and processed into an 8 kDa mature protein, which is secreted as a disulfide-linked dimer (Cirera2008Porcine). This protein is primarily active in alveolar type II cells and nonciliated bronchiolar cells, where it facilitates the adsorption and spreading of phospholipids at the air-liquid interface in the lungs (Leung2015Plasma).

SP-B is essential for maintaining alveolar stability and is involved in the biophysical function of surfactant, contributing to respiratory efficiency and gas exchange (Lin2018Genetic). It also plays a role in the processing of surfactant protein C (SP-C), as deficiencies in SP-B can lead to aberrant SP-C processing (Lin2018Genetic). The protein's function is crucial for the successful fetal-neonatal pulmonary transition, and its deficiency is linked to severe neonatal lung diseases, such as respiratory distress syndrome (Hamvas2007Comprehensive). SP-B also exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which are significant in the context of lung diseases (Leung2015Plasma).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SFTPB gene, which encodes surfactant protein B, are linked to several severe respiratory conditions. SP-B deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by mutations in the SFTPB gene and leads to fatal respiratory disease in infants. The most common mutation associated with this deficiency is the c.397delCinsGAA mutation, which results in low levels of SP-B mRNA due to rapid degradation (Resch2015Surfactant). This deficiency is characterized by congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and is often fatal within the first few months of life (Wert2009Genetic).

The SFTPB gene is also implicated in cystic fibrosis (CF). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within SFTPB, such as rs7316, have been associated with mild CF and acute lung injury. These SNPs may affect polyadenylation regulation and SP-C processing, potentially influencing CF severity (Lin2018Genetic). Additionally, intergenic interactions between SFTPB and other surfactant protein genes may contribute to CF disease severity (Lin2018Genetic).

Overall, mutations and alterations in the SFTPB gene can lead to significant respiratory disorders, highlighting its critical role in lung function and disease.

## Interactions
Surfactant protein B (SFTPB) is integral to lung function, primarily through its interactions with other surfactant proteins and lipids. SFTPB interacts with surfactant protein A (SP-A) and surfactant protein C (SP-C) to form a complex that reduces surface tension in the alveoli, which is crucial for proper respiratory mechanics (Floros2001Surfactant). These interactions are essential for the spreading and stability of pulmonary surfactant, facilitating the adhesion and spreading of surfactant phospholipids and stabilizing the phospholipid monolayer (Foreman2008Polymorphic).

In the context of genetic interactions, SFTPB SNPs have been shown to interact with SNPs in other surfactant protein genes, such as SFTPA1, SFTPA2, SFTPC, and SFTPD, in relation to diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF) (Lin2018Genetic). These interactions are characterized by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfactant proteins, indicating a complex network of genetic interactions that influence lung function and disease progression (Lin2018Genetic). The interactions between SFTPB and other surfactant proteins suggest a cooperative role in the expression and severity of pulmonary diseases, highlighting the multifactorial nature of these conditions (Lin2018Genetic).
