# MARCHF11

## Overview
MARCHF11, or membrane associated ring-CH-type finger 11, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the ubiquitination process, which is essential for tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The MARCHF11 protein is predominantly active in cellular membranes, where it plays a significant role in intracellular transport and protein degradation pathways, influencing various cellular processes such as protein stability and signaling pathways (Wang2022Identification). Its activity is crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system, particularly in the long-term survival of nociceptive and autonomic ganglion neurons (Pranckėnienė2023Microevolutionary). Additionally, MARCHF11 has been implicated in the regulation of ferroptosis in diabetic nephropathy and is noted for its differential methylation in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease detection and monitoring (Wang2022Identification; Li2023Unveiling; Dasgupta2021Exploring).

## Function
MARCHF11, or membrane associated ring-CH-type finger 11, is a gene encoding a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. MARCHF11 is active in cellular membranes, where it influences intracellular transport and protein degradation pathways (Wang2022Identification).

In healthy human cells, MARCHF11 is involved in intracellular transport, which is essential for the long-term survival of nociceptive and autonomic ganglion neurons. This function is critical for maintaining the proper functioning of the nervous system by ensuring the timely degradation and recycling of proteins within cells (Pranckėnienė2023Microevolutionary).

The gene's activity in cellular membranes suggests its involvement in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein stability and signaling pathways. By facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, MARCHF11 helps control the levels of specific proteins, thus influencing cellular responses and adaptations to environmental changes (Wang2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
MARCHF11 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in DNA methylation changes. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), MARCHF11 is identified as one of the top differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in gene promoter regions, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer detection and monitoring (Li2023Unveiling). The gene is also highlighted in studies on oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), where significant methylation changes in MARCHF11 were observed in plasma cell-free DNA, indicating its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (Patel2023Plasma).

In vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC), MARCHF11 is among the top hyper-methylated genes, with a Δβ-value of 0.617, suggesting its involvement in the disease's epigenetic landscape (Dasgupta2021Exploring). Although specific diseases directly associated with MARCHF11 mutations are not detailed, its decreased relative fitness in the Lithuanian genome study suggests that natural selection may act on its variants, potentially impacting long-term survival of certain neurons (Pranckėnienė2023Microevolutionary). These findings underscore the gene's significance in cancer and its potential role in other conditions through altered methylation and expression patterns.

## Interactions
MARCHF11, a member of the MARCH family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, is involved in the ubiquitination process, which can tag proteins for degradation or regulate their activity. In the context of diabetic nephropathy (DN), MARCHF11 has been implicated in the regulation of ALOX15, a key gene associated with ferroptosis, a form of cell death characterized by iron dependency and lipid peroxidation. MARCHF11 is one of several E3 ligases predicted to be involved in the ubiquitination and regulation of ALOX15 expression and degradation, suggesting a role in modulating the ferroptosis pathway in DN (Wang2022Identification).

In the study of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC), MARCHF11 was identified as a differentially methylated gene, although specific interactions with proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed (Dasgupta2021Exploring). Additionally, in the analysis of microevolutionary processes in the Lithuanian genome, MARCHF11 was noted for its involvement in intracellular transport, which may be necessary for the long-term survival of nociceptive and autonomic ganglion neurons, although specific protein interactions were not described (Pranckėnienė2023Microevolutionary).
