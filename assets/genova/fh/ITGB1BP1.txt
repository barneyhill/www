# ITGB1BP1

## Overview
ITGB1BP1 is a gene that encodes the integrin subunit beta 1 binding protein 1, a cytoplasmic protein involved in critical cellular processes such as adhesion, signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. This protein functions as a cytosolic integrin regulator, specifically interacting with the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain, which is essential for cell-matrix interactions and signal transduction (Cheng2012Annexin). Through its regulatory role, ITGB1BP1 influences cell motility, proliferation, and differentiation, making it vital for physiological processes like tissue repair and immune responses. The protein's involvement in various diseases, including cancers and vascular malformations, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a prognostic marker (Lu2015ITGA2B; Plummer2006Neuronal; Miao2022Establishment).

## Function
ITGB1BP1, or integrin subunit beta 1 binding protein 1, is a small cytoplasmic protein that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and signaling processes. It interacts specifically with the carboxy-terminal region of the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain, acting as a cytosolic integrin regulator (Cheng2012Annexin). This interaction is significant for cell-matrix interactions, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction, contributing to cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation.

In healthy human cells, ITGB1BP1 is involved in regulating the activity of β1 integrin, which is essential for maintaining proper cell adhesion and motility. The protein's regulatory function is evidenced by its ability to negatively regulate β1 integrin, thereby increasing cell motility (Cheng2012Annexin). This regulation is crucial for various physiological processes, including tissue repair and immune responses, where controlled cell movement is necessary.

ITGB1BP1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences the organization of the cytoskeleton and the transmission of signals from the extracellular matrix to the cell interior. These activities underscore its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating communication between cells and their environment (Cheng2012Annexin).

## Clinical Significance
ITGB1BP1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ITGB1BP1 expression is significantly associated with prognosis, with a hazard ratio of 1.704, indicating that higher expression levels correlate with poorer outcomes (Lu2015ITGA2B). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high ITGB1BP1 expression is linked to poor prognosis, and it is part of a peroxisome-related gene signature used for prognostic prediction (Miao2022Establishment). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), elevated ITGB1BP1 expression is associated with inferior overall survival, highlighting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Lai2021Novel).

In the context of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), ITGB1BP1, also known as ICAP1, is expressed in neurons and may contribute to the development of these vascular malformations, although its specific clinical significance in this condition is not fully detailed (Plummer2006Neuronal). The gene's involvement in integrin interactions suggests a broader role in diseases where cell adhesion and signaling are disrupted, such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, although specific mutations in ITGB1BP1 have not been highlighted in this context (Vandersteen2023Genetic).
