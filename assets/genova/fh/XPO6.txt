# XPO6

## Overview
XPO6 is a gene that encodes the protein exportin 6, a member of the karyopherin family involved in the nuclear export of specific cargo molecules. Exportin 6 is primarily responsible for the transport of profilin-actin complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a process critical for maintaining cellular actin dynamics and preventing nuclear actin accumulation, which can disrupt nuclear functions (Stuven2003Exportin). This protein operates within the nuclear pore complex and is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates and insects, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular physiology (Stuven2003Exportin). Beyond its basic cellular functions, XPO6 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Zhu2021Cancerassociated).

## Function
Exportin 6 (XPO6) is a nuclear export receptor that plays a crucial role in the transport of profilin-actin complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This process is essential for maintaining the proper distribution of actin within cells, preventing its accumulation in the nucleus, which can interfere with nuclear structure and function (Stuven2003Exportin). XPO6 specifically binds to actin, and this interaction is enhanced by the presence of profilin, which induces a conformational change in actin necessary for high-affinity binding to XPO6 (Stuven2003Exportin). The export of profilin-actin complexes by XPO6 is highly specific and does not involve other exportins like CRM1 (Stuven2003Exportin).

XPO6 operates in the nuclear pore complex, facilitating the translocation of its cargo across the nuclear envelope. This function is conserved across vertebrates and insects, highlighting its evolutionary importance (Stuven2003Exportin). In human cells, XPO6 is involved in maintaining low levels of free nuclear actin, thus preventing actin polymerization within the nucleus, which is crucial for cellular processes that require the regulation of actin dynamics (Stuven2003Exportin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the XPO6 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. XPO6 is frequently upregulated in various cancer types, including breast, bladder, kidney renal clear cell, and liver hepatocellular carcinomas, and this upregulation is associated with poor patient survival (Zhu2021Cancerassociated). In breast cancer, high levels of XPO6 correlate with worse survival, especially in stage II patients, and are linked to lymph-node-positive status (Zhu2021Cancerassociated).

The upregulation of XPO6 leads to the nuclear exclusion of profilin-1 (Pfn1), inhibiting its anticancer effects. This interaction affects transcriptional regulation by reducing the expression of MYC and other cancer-driving genes, contributing to cancer progression (Zhu2021Cancerassociated). Knockdown of XPO6 has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth and sensitize cells to BET inhibitors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2021Cancerassociated).

In nonmalignant cells, XPO6 is crucial for maintaining epithelial quiescence by exporting nuclear actin. Disruption of this function can lead to morphological changes similar to early breast cancer progression, indicating its role in maintaining proper tissue architecture (Fiore2017Laminin111).

## Interactions
Exportin 6 (XPO6) is known for its specific interaction with profilin-actin complexes, facilitating their nuclear export. This interaction is highly specific, as XPO6 binds to the actin component of the complex, with profilin enhancing this interaction. Profilin acts as a cofactor, ensuring the solubility and export readiness of actin, while not being an XPO6 cargo itself (Stuven2003Exportin). 

XPO6 also interacts with the super elongation complex (SEC) through nuclear profilin-1 (Pfn1), which acts as a functional inhibitor of the SEC. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, as it is linked to the anticancer function of Pfn1 (Zhu2021Cancerassociated). 

In the context of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection, XPO6 interacts with the viral protein glycoprotein M (gM), facilitating its nuclear export late in the infection process. This interaction is specific to XPO6 and does not affect the localization of other nuclear envelope proteins (Boruchowicz2020The). 

These interactions highlight XPO6's role in regulating nuclear-cytoplasmic transport and its involvement in various cellular and viral processes.
