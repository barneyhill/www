# INO80B

## Overview
The INO80B gene encodes a protein known as INO80 complex subunit B, which is a critical component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including transcription, DNA repair, and replication, by facilitating the remodeling of nucleosomes to allow access to DNA. The INO80B protein is characterized by a novel winged helix domain, which may play a role in protein-protein interactions and cell cycle regulation. It is particularly significant in placental development, where it aids in the differentiation of extravillous trophoblast cells, essential for maternal-fetal circulation. Dysregulation of INO80B has been linked to conditions such as pre-eclampsia, highlighting its clinical importance (Oudejans2014Susceptibility).

## Function
The INO80B gene encodes a subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. INO80B is involved in chromatin remodeling, a process essential for regulating gene expression, DNA repair, and replication. This protein is active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the remodeling of nucleosomes, thereby allowing access to DNA for various cellular processes (Oudejans2014Susceptibility).

In the context of placental development, INO80B is crucial for the differentiation of extravillous trophoblast cells, which are important for the invasion into maternal tissue and modification of maternal vessel walls. This function is vital for establishing a connection between maternal and fetal circulations, ensuring the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus (Oudejans2014Susceptibility). The INO80B protein contains a novel winged helix domain, which may be involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation (Oudejans2014Susceptibility).

The regulation of INO80B is influenced by microRNAs, such as miR-1324, which modulate its expression levels. This regulation is significant for maintaining appropriate levels of chromatin assembly complex proteins, which are essential for chromatin remodeling and cell differentiation (Oudejans2014Susceptibility).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the INO80B gene have been implicated in the development of pre-eclampsia, a condition characterized by hypertension and proteinuria during pregnancy. The INO80B gene, located at the 2p13 locus, has been identified as a susceptibility gene for pre-eclampsia in Icelandic and Australian families. A specific susceptibility allele, rs34174194, affects the binding efficiency of microRNA miR-1324, leading to less effective silencing of the INO80B gene. This results in higher levels of INO80B transcripts in trophoblast cells, which is associated with the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia (Oudejans2014Susceptibility).

The INO80B gene is also involved in placental development, and defects in its expression may lead to premature differentiation of extravillous trophoblast cells, contributing to pre-eclampsia (Oudejans2014Susceptibility). The gene's role in cell cycle regulation and polyploidy is central to the development of pre-eclampsia and related conditions such as HELLP syndrome (Oudejans2014Susceptibility).

In addition to its role in pre-eclampsia, the INO80B gene is part of the INO80 chromatin-assembly complex, which is involved in regulating multiple effector genes controlling extravillous trophoblast invasion, further highlighting its clinical significance in pregnancy-related disorders (Oudejans2014Susceptibility).

## Interactions
The INO80B subunit is part of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription, DNA repair, and replication. INO80B is involved in the ATP-dependent exchange of histones, specifically promoting the exchange of H2A.Z/H2B variant dimers (Watanabe2015Structural). The INO80 complex, including INO80B, shares structural similarities with the SWR-C complex and contains a single ring of AAA+ ATPase subunits, specifically the Rvb1/Rvb2 ring, which is essential for its function (Watanabe2015Structural).

The INO80 complex interacts with nucleosomes in a unique manner, with the motor domains of INO80 located at the entry point to the wrap around the histone core. This arrangement allows the H3 tails of the nucleosome to play a regulatory role, differing from other characterized remodelers (Ayala2018Structure). The Arp5-Ies6 module of INO80 makes additional contacts on the opposite side of the nucleosome, facilitating nucleosome sliding and histone exchange (Ayala2018Structure). The complex also involves other subunits such as actin, Arp4, and Arp8, which are part of a flexible region termed SC1, suggesting potential interactions in different functional states (Ayala2018Structure).
