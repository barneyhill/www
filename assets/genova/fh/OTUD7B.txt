# OTUD7B

## Overview
OTUD7B is a gene that encodes the protein OTU deubiquitinase 7B, a member of the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain-containing family of deubiquitinating enzymes. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of ubiquitin-dependent signaling pathways, including the Wnt and NF-κB pathways, which are vital for cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses. OTU deubiquitinase 7B is involved in the modulation of protein stability and function by removing ubiquitin moieties from specific substrates, thereby influencing their degradation and activity. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it impacts cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Dysregulation of OTUD7B has been linked to various pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cancers, making it a significant focus of research for potential therapeutic interventions (Lee2023OTUD7B; Zhang2020OTUD7B; Tang2021OTUD7B).

## Function
OTUD7B (OTU deubiquitinase 7B) is a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in regulating several cellular processes through its role in the Wnt and NF-κB signaling pathways. In the Wnt signaling pathway, OTUD7B interacts with the transcription factor LEF1, enhancing its nuclear localization and interaction with β-catenin, which is crucial for the transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes. This interaction leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, which are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions (Lee2023OTUD7B).

OTUD7B also plays a role in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway by deubiquitinating TRAF3, which inhibits the accumulation of NIK and prevents the activation of this pathway. This regulation is important for controlling inflammation and immune responses, as well as maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing unwarranted activation of pathways that lead to cell migration and invasion (Zhang2020OTUD7B).

OTUD7B is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Its activity in these cellular compartments underscores its importance in regulating protein stability and signaling pathways critical for normal cellular function (Tang2021OTUD7B).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the OTUD7B gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and cancers. In autoimmune diseases, OTUD7B plays a critical role in T cell activation and inflammatory responses. Deficiency in OTUD7B leads to impaired T cell activation and a reduced inflammatory response, as seen in models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis. This deficiency results in a decreased frequency of Th1 cells, which are crucial for inflammatory responses, suggesting that OTUD7B is essential for the pathogenesis of T cell-dependent autoimmune diseases (Hu2016Otud7b).

In cancer, OTUD7B is involved in the progression of several types, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It acts as a deubiquitinase that stabilizes proteins involved in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. In breast cancer, OTUD7B stabilizes LSD1 and FOXM1, promoting metastasis and proliferation, respectively. High expression levels of OTUD7B are associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor grade in breast cancer (Wang2024OTUD7B; Gong2021OTUD7B). In NSCLC, OTUD7B facilitates cancer progression by activating mTORC2, which is mediated by the oncogenic kinase Akt (Chen2023AtomNetAided). These findings highlight OTUD7B as a potential therapeutic target in cancers where it is overexpressed.

## Interactions
OTUD7B, also known as Cezanne, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that participates in various protein interactions, influencing multiple signaling pathways. In breast cancer cells, OTUD7B interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), stabilizing it by removing ubiquitin chains, which prevents its degradation. This interaction occurs specifically with the AF1 domain of ERα, enhancing ERα stability and activity, and is associated with poor prognosis in ERα-positive breast cancer patients (Tang2021OTUD7B).

OTUD7B also plays a role in the Wnt signaling pathway by interacting with LEF1, a transcription factor. This interaction enhances LEF1's transcriptional activity and its association with β-catenin, promoting the expression of Wnt target genes. The binding occurs through the High Mobility Group (HMG) domain of LEF1 and the N-terminus of OTUD7B, which contains the UBA domain (Lee2023OTUD7B).

In the immune system, OTUD7B interacts with Zap70, a key component in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It deubiquitinates Zap70, preventing its association with negative-regulatory phosphatases, thus facilitating T cell activation and inflammatory responses (Hu2016Otud7b).

OTUD7B also interacts with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein, which enhances its deubiquitinase activity. This interaction negatively affects HCV replication, suggesting a role in viral pathogenesis (Sianipar2015Physical).
