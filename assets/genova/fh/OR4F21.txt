# OR4F21

## Overview
The OR4F21 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily F member 21, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in detecting odor molecules. The olfactory receptors, including OR4F21, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of odors. These receptors share a common structure characterized by seven transmembrane domains, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (Qiu2020aarFDC).
