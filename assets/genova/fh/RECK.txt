# RECK

## Overview
The RECK gene encodes a membrane-anchored glycoprotein known as reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. This protein is categorized as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein and is characterized by its structural domains, including cysteine knot motifs and Kazal-like domains, which are crucial for its function as a serine-protease inhibitor (Mendes2020Analysis; Matsuzaki2018The). RECK is essential for maintaining tissue integrity, regulating angiogenesis, and influencing cell migration and adhesion by modulating ECM dynamics (Ulrich2015Reck; de2015Critical). Its interactions with proteins such as ADAMTS10 and components of the WNT signaling pathway underscore its significance in both developmental and pathological processes, including tumor suppression and metastasis inhibition (Vallon2018A; Matsuzaki2018The). The clinical relevance of RECK is highlighted by its downregulation in various cancers, where it acts as a tumor suppressor, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Masuda2023Pancreatic; Jacomasso2020The).

## Structure
The RECK protein, encoded by the human RECK gene, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 125 kDa (Matsuzaki2018The). Its primary structure includes an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal GPI-anchoring sequence, both of which are removed in the mature protein (Willson2015Analysis). The protein is composed of 971 amino acids and features several key structural domains, including five cysteine knot motifs and three Kazal-like domains, which are serine-protease inhibitor-like domains (Mendes2020Analysis; Willson2015Analysis).

The secondary structure of RECK includes these Kazal motifs, which are crucial for inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (Willson2015Analysis). The tertiary structure is characterized by a compact four-helix bundle stabilized by three disulfide bonds, particularly in the CC domains, which are unique to the RECK protein (Chang2020Structure). These domains are involved in interactions with other proteins, such as GPR124 and WNT7A/WNT7B, essential for signaling pathways (Chang2020Structure).

Post-translational modifications of RECK include N-linked glycosylations at specific residues, which are essential for its function (Mendes2020Analysis). The protein's quaternary structure is not well-defined, but it is known to interact with other proteins, such as ADAMTS10, stabilizing them and influencing their activity (Matsuzaki2018The).

## Function
The RECK gene encodes a membrane-anchored glycoprotein that plays a critical role in regulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. In healthy cells, RECK is essential for maintaining tissue integrity and proper vascular patterning by inhibiting MMP activity, thereby preventing excessive ECM degradation (Ulrich2015Reck; de2015Critical). This regulation is crucial for angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, and is vital for vascular development and stabilization (Chandana2010Involvement; de2015Critical).

RECK is involved in several molecular processes, including the inhibition of metalloproteinase-dependent release of NOTCH ligands, which is important for maintaining local concentrations of signaling molecules (Chang2020Structure). It also stimulates canonical WNT signaling, particularly BETA-CATENIN signaling, in vascular endothelial cells, which is essential for central nervous system angiogenesis and blood-brain barrier formation (Ulrich2015Reck; Chang2020Structure). The protein is active on the cell surface, where it influences cell migration and adhesion by maintaining the integrity of the ECM and cell-cell interactions (Ulrich2015Reck; Chandana2010Involvement).

## Clinical Significance
The RECK gene is clinically significant due to its role as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation linked to various cancers. In melanoma, high levels of the alternatively spliced transcript RECKVar3 are associated with poor survival and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) like MMP-9 and MMP-14, while downregulating their inhibitor TIMP3, contributing to tumor progression (Jacomasso2020The). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), RECK inactivation promotes cancer formation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis. Low RECK expression correlates with poor differentiation, increased metastasis, and worse prognosis in PDAC patients (Masuda2023Pancreatic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RECK downregulation is linked to poor prognosis and increased metastasis. Genetic polymorphisms in RECK, such as rs10814325, are associated with higher susceptibility to HCC (Nassar2019RECK; Palladini2023Recent). In colon cancer, RECK is often epigenetically silenced through promoter methylation, which enhances tumor invasion. Treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can restore RECK expression and suppress cancer cell invasion (Cho2007Epigenetic). These findings underscore the potential of targeting RECK expression and its regulatory pathways as therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
The RECK protein interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in various biological processes. It is known to bind and stabilize ADAMTS10, a protease, preventing its degradation and maintaining its cellular association (Matsuzaki2018The). RECK also forms a complex with GPR124 and WNT7A, which is essential for canonical WNT7 signaling. This interaction is critical for processes such as CNS angiogenesis and blood-brain barrier formation (Vallon2018A). The RECK protein enhances the binding of WNT7A to Frizzled receptors, particularly FZD8, facilitating WNT7A signaling (Vallon2018A).

In addition to its role in WNT signaling, RECK interacts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14, inhibiting their activity and thus regulating extracellular matrix remodeling. This interaction is significant in processes like tumor invasion and metastasis (Masuda2023Pancreatic; Mendes2020Analysis). Through these interactions, RECK serves as a critical regulator of both developmental and pathological processes.
