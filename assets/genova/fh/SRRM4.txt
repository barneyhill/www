# SRRM4

## Overview
The SRRM4 gene encodes the serine/arginine repetitive matrix 4 protein, a splicing factor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of alternative splicing, particularly within neural tissues. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor due to its involvement in the inclusion of microexons, which are critical for modulating protein activity and interactions necessary for neuronal differentiation and function (QuesnelVallières2015Essential; Head2020Hypersilencing). SRRM4 operates primarily in the nucleus, where it interacts with spliceosomal components to influence pre-mRNA splicing, promoting the inclusion of neural-specific exons (Conn2020SRRM4). The gene's expression is associated with neuron-like splicing patterns and a reduction in cell proliferation, underscoring its role in promoting differentiation over cell cycle progression (Head2021Silencing). Dysregulation of SRRM4 has been implicated in various neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper neuronal function and development (QuesnelVallières2015Essential).

## Function
The SRRM4 gene encodes a splicing factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of alternative splicing, particularly in neural tissues. It is involved in the inclusion of microexons, which are small exons that modulate protein activity and protein-protein interactions, essential for neuronal differentiation and function (QuesnelVallières2015Essential; Head2020Hypersilencing). SRRM4 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the splicing of pre-mRNA by interacting with spliceosomal components, promoting the inclusion of neural-specific exons (Conn2020SRRM4).

In healthy human cells, SRRM4 expression induces neuron-like expression and splicing patterns, which are associated with a decrease in cell proliferation. This is because SRRM4 up-regulates microexon inclusion, leading to the expression of neuronal differentiation-related genes and splicing patterns (Head2021Silencing). The gene acts as a brake on proliferation, promoting differentiation over cell cycle progression, which is crucial for the cessation of cell division during neuronal differentiation (Head2020Hypersilencing).

SRRM4's regulation of microexons is vital for maintaining proper neuronal function and development, and its dysregulation may contribute to neurological disorders (QuesnelVallières2015Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SRRM4 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer, SRRM4 is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, which can influence tumor growth and progression. Overexpression of SRRM4 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in various cancer cell lines, suggesting an antiproliferative role. Conversely, decreased expression of SRRM4 is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation and growth, as seen in neuroendocrine prostate cancers (CRPC-NE) and other tumor types (Lee2018Development; Head2021Silencing). SRRM4's role in splicing dysregulation is also linked to the transformation of prostatic adenocarcinoma to therapy-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer, promoting cancer cell survival and metastasis (Dong2019Understanding).

In neurological disorders, SRRM4 is crucial for neuronal differentiation and function. Mutations in SRRM4 can lead to alternative splicing defects, contributing to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. These defects often involve neuron-specific exons, affecting genes related to nerve impulse transmission and synaptic function (QuesnelVallières2015Essential). In the Bronx waltzer mouse model, a mutation in SRRM4 causes deafness and balance defects due to splicing abnormalities in sensory hair cells (Nakano2012A).

## Interactions
SRRM4, also known as serine/arginine repetitive matrix 4, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in alternative splicing. The SRRM4 protein, particularly its eMIC domain, interacts with early spliceosomal factors such as SF1 and U2AF, which are involved in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to the branch site region of pre-mRNA. These interactions are essential for the initial steps of spliceosome assembly and microexon inclusion (TorresMéndez2019A).

In HeLa cells, SRRM4 forms a stable complex with the U2 snRNP auxiliary splicing factor, including U2AF1 (U2AF35) and U2AF2 (U2AF65), which facilitates the recruitment of U2 snRNP to branch sites. Approximately 40% of GFP-SRRM4 protein is in complex with U2AF1/U2AF2. SRRM4 also interacts with RNPS1 and SRSF11 splicing factors, as well as core components of the Exon Junction Complex, such as EIF4AIII, RBM8A, and MAGOHB (Capponi2019Neuronalspecific).

SRRM4 recognizes UGC motifs in pre-mRNA, which are crucial for its splicing activity. This interaction is necessary for the inclusion of neuron-specific exons, such as those in the protrudin gene, which are important for neurite outgrowth (Ohnishi2017SRRM4dependent).
