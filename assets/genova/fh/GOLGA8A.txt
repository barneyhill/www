# GOLGA8A

## Overview
GOLGA8A is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A8 family member A, which is part of the golgin family of coiled-coil proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus. These proteins are integral to maintaining the structure of the Golgi, facilitating vesicle tethering, and ensuring proper protein trafficking within cells. The GOLGA8A gene is located on chromosome 15 and is part of a subfamily that has expanded through segmental duplications, contributing to its involvement in basic cellular functions and potential interactions with other genes (Bekpen2019Human). The protein encoded by GOLGA8A is predicted to localize to the Golgi apparatus, Golgi stack membrane, and cytoplasm, similar to other members of the golgin family (Bekpen2019Human). While the specific molecular activities of golgin A8 family member A remain to be fully elucidated, its role in Golgi-related processes suggests it is crucial for intracellular transport and cellular organization.

## Function
GOLGA8A is a member of the golgin family, which are coiled-coil proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus. These proteins are involved in maintaining Golgi structure, facilitating vesicle tethering, and ensuring proper protein trafficking. GOLGA8A may play a role in Golgi dynamics and intracellular transport, impacting cellular organization and function. The GOLGA8 gene family, including GOLGA8A, encodes proteins that are predicted to localize to the Golgi apparatus, Golgi stack membrane, and cytoplasm, based on their similarity to GM130 (GOLGA2) (Bekpen2019Human). The GOLGA8 subfamily has expanded along chromosome 15 through segmental duplications, and these genes are involved in basic cellular functions, potentially interacting with target genes of their progenitor proteins to modify or regulate their core functions (Bekpen2019Human).

GOLGA8A is ubiquitously expressed at low levels in human tissues, with the highest expression in the testis (Bekpen2019Human). The integration of repetitive transposable elements and unrelated promoters during the duplication process has broadened their expression to more tissues, although the functional consequences of this expression have not been extensively studied (Bekpen2019Human). The specific molecular activities of GOLGA8A in healthy human cells remain unclear, but its involvement in Golgi apparatus-related processes suggests a role in intracellular transport and cellular organization.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GOLGA8A gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. Elevated levels of GOLGA8A expression have been linked to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), particularly in cases related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA-ICH) and hypertension (HTN-ICH). The study by Merino-Zamorano et al. found that GOLGA8A transcript levels were significantly increased in these ICH subtypes compared to controls, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for ICH occurrence and recurrence (MerinoZamorano2016Identification). 

GOLGA8A is also implicated in genomic instability, particularly in the 15q13.3 region of chromosome 15. This region is prone to microdeletions associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, autism, and epilepsy. The GOLGA8 core duplicons, which include GOLGA8A, are suggested to be hotspots for non-allelic homologous recombination, contributing to structural rearrangements and evolutionary instability (Antonacci2014Palindromic). 

Despite these associations, the exact role of GOLGA8A in these conditions remains unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance (Bekpen2019Human). The gene's involvement in maintaining Golgi structure and function suggests that disruptions could impact cellular processes, potentially leading to disease.
