# DSG3

## Overview
Desmoglein 3 (DSG3) is a gene that encodes the protein desmoglein 3, a cadherin-type transmembrane glycoprotein integral to the structure and function of desmosomes, which are specialized cell-cell adhesion complexes. Desmoglein 3 is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, such as the skin and mucous membranes, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity and resilience against mechanical stress (Stahley2014Desmosome). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and tight junction integrity, contributing to cell survival and barrier function (Li2019Desmoglein3). DSG3's interactions with other proteins, such as E-cadherin and Src kinase, underscore its importance in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Tsang2012Non‐junctional; Tsang2010Desmoglein). Clinically, DSG3 is significant in the context of autoimmune diseases like pemphigus vulgaris, where autoantibodies disrupt its function, and in various cancers, where its expression is often altered (Rehman2021Evolving; Brown2015Desmoglein).

## Structure
Desmoglein 3 (DSG3) is a cadherin-type transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell adhesion within desmosomes. The primary structure of DSG3 includes a sequence of amino acids forming its protein chain, which is organized into several distinct domains. The extracellular region of DSG3 consists of five domains: four cadherin repeats (EC1-4) and a less related membrane-proximal domain known as the extracellular anchor (EC5) (Dworschak2012Mapping). 

The secondary structure of DSG3 features regions with β-strand propensities and β-turns, particularly in segments such as 189-205 and 206-222, as predicted by the Chou-Fasman approach. These regions may also adopt α-helical conformations, as seen in segments like 342-358 (Szabados2015Characterization). 

The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these domains, contributing to the protein's functional conformation. The quaternary structure of DSG3 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but it likely involves interactions with other desmosomal proteins to form stable cell adhesion complexes.

DSG3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are typical for cadherin proteins and may influence its adhesion properties and stability (Szabados2015Characterization). The presence of splice variants can lead to different isoforms of DSG3, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
Desmoglein 3 (DSG3) is a desmosomal cadherin that plays a critical role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion, particularly in tissues subjected to mechanical stress, such as the skin and heart. In healthy human cells, DSG3 is associated with membrane rafts, which are microdomains within the plasma membrane enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. This association is crucial for the dynamics of desmosome assembly and disassembly, as it regulates the formation and maintenance of desmosomes, ensuring proper cell-cell adhesion and tissue integrity (Stahley2014Desmosome).

DSG3 also contributes to the structural integrity of epithelial tissues by anchoring to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, enhancing the adhesive strength of desmosomes (Stahley2014Desmosome). It is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is important for cell longevity and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thereby acting as a pro-survival protein (Li2019Desmoglein3). In addition, DSG3 enhances tight junction integrity, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier function, and its overexpression leads to increased transepithelial electrical resistance and reduced solute permeability, indicating stronger cellular junctions and better cell health (Li2019Desmoglein3).

## Clinical Significance
Desmoglein 3 (DSG3) is clinically significant due to its involvement in several diseases, primarily pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and certain cancers. In PV, an autoimmune blistering disease, autoantibodies target DSG3, leading to the loss of cell adhesion in the skin and mucosal membranes. This results in blister formation and is associated with the activation of various signaling pathways, including phospholipase C, p38 MAPK, Src, and Rho A, which contribute to the depletion of DSG3 and subsequent loss of intercellular cohesion (Spindler2011The; Rehman2021Evolving). DSG3 depletion is also linked to oxidative stress and the activation of the p53 pathway, leading to apoptosis and blistering in PV (Rehman2021Evolving).

In cancer, DSG3 expression is altered in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Reduced membranous expression and increased cytoplasmic accumulation of DSG3 are observed in OSCC, which may contribute to disease progression (Wang2007Altered). Conversely, DSG3 is upregulated in SCC, where it promotes cell migration and invasion, suggesting a role in tumor progression and metastasis (Brown2015Desmoglein). These findings indicate that DSG3 can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the context.

## Interactions
Desmoglein 3 (DSG3) is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cell adhesion and signaling pathways. DSG3 forms a complex with E-cadherin, a component of adherens junctions, and this interaction is crucial for cell-cell adhesion. The interaction between DSG3 and E-cadherin has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, indicating a significant role in maintaining cell junction integrity (Tsang2012Non‐junctional; Tsang2010Desmoglein).

DSG3 also interacts with Src kinase, acting as an upstream regulator of Src activity. This interaction is associated with the activation of Src, which in turn affects the phosphorylation of E-cadherin and catenins, influencing cell adhesion and motility (Tsang2012Non‐junctional; Tsang2010Desmoglein). The modulation of Src activity by DSG3 is significant in the context of pemphigus vulgaris, a disease characterized by the loss of cell adhesion (Tsang2012Non‐junctional).

Additionally, DSG3 is involved in the regulation of p38MAPK signaling, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of pemphigus. The disruption of DSG3 interactions by pemphigus autoantibodies leads to the activation of p38MAPK, contributing to the loss of keratinocyte cohesion (Waschke2014Desmosomes). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of DSG3 in cellular adhesion and signaling pathways.
