# FAM72A

## Overview
FAM72A is a gene located on chromosome 1 in humans, encoding a protein that is a member of the Family with sequence similarity 72 (FAM72). The FAM72A protein is involved in critical cellular processes, including DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, contributing to genomic stability. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and the degradation of uracil DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG2), a key protein in DNA repair and immune response (Bai2022Prognostic; Kisselev2024Evolutionary). The protein is also essential for somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination in B cells, processes vital for the adaptive immune response (Zhou2022Integrated; Kisselev2024Evolutionary). FAM72A's interactions with other proteins, particularly within the CTLH complex, underscore its role as an adapter in recruiting UNG2 for ubiquitination (Barbulescu2024FAM72A). The gene's expression is notably significant in immune tissues, although its full range of functions remains to be fully elucidated (Kisselev2024Evolutionary).

## Structure
The FAM72A protein is encoded by the FAM72A gene, which is part of the Family with sequence similarity 72 (FAM72) and is located on chromosome 1 in humans. The gene has several paralogs, including FAM72B, FAM72C, and FAM72D, which share a high sequence identity of 99.15% (Kisselev2024Evolutionary). The canonical transcript of FAM72A encodes a 149 amino acid peptide, which is highly conserved across mammalian species, with only five variable amino acid positions among the human paralogs (Kisselev2024Evolutionary). 

The FAM72A protein interacts with the UNG2 peptide, with specific amino acids playing crucial roles in this interaction. The FWMF motif (amino acids 101-104) and Trp/W125 are particularly important for binding with UNG2 (Renganathan2021Identification). Mutations in these regions can significantly affect the protein's binding energy and conformation, suggesting that these motifs are critical for the protein's function (Renganathan2021Identification). 

The protein's 3D structure has been modeled using various computational tools, although specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not explicitly detailed in the available literature (Renganathan2021Identification).

## Function
The FAM72A gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, contributing to genomic stability in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it participates in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, a critical process for maintaining genomic integrity and ensuring proper cell division (Bai2022Prognostic; Kisselev2024Evolutionary). FAM72A is involved in the degradation of uracil DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG2), a protein important for DNA repair and immune response, although the exact mechanism of this interaction remains unclear (Kisselev2024Evolutionary).

In the context of the immune system, FAM72A is crucial for somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination in B cells, processes essential for the adaptive immune response. This function is primarily mediated through its interaction with UNG2, highlighting its role in antibody maturation (Zhou2022Integrated; Kisselev2024Evolutionary). The gene's expression is widespread across various tissues, but its contribution to total expression levels is particularly significant in immune tissues (Kisselev2024Evolutionary). Despite its established roles, the full spectrum of FAM72A's functions in healthy human cells is not completely understood, suggesting potential additional roles or specializations (Kisselev2024Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
FAM72A is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and interaction with key cellular pathways. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FAM72A is significantly upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. High expression levels correlate with shorter overall survival and are linked to cell cycle alterations, promoting cancer cell proliferation and enhancing stemness. FAM72A is also associated with a higher frequency of TP53 mutations, which are crucial in cancer progression (Zhou2022Integrated). In lung adenocarcinoma, FAM72A overexpression promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration, contributing to tumorigenesis through its interaction with uracil DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG2) in the base excision repair pathway (Bai2022Prognostic).

FAM72A's expression is correlated with immune and stromal scores, immune cell infiltration, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) across various cancers. Tumors with low FAM72A expression may respond better to certain immunotherapies, suggesting its role in determining the response to immune checkpoint therapies (Bai2022Prognostic). In addition, FAM72A is linked to the mTOR signaling pathway in HCC, with high expression levels correlating with increased expression of mTOR pathway genes, affecting drug sensitivity and resistance (Zhou2022Integrated). These findings highlight FAM72A's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
FAM72A is known to interact with several proteins, primarily through its role in the CTLH complex. It interacts with UNG2 and CTLH complex members such as MKLN1, RANBP9/10, TWA1, RMND5A/B, and MAEA. These interactions are mediated by the N-terminal yippee-like domain and the C-terminal tail of FAM72A. The N-terminal HA-tagged FAM72A co-precipitates with MKLN1 and UNG2, indicating a direct interaction. The C-terminal tail of FAM72A is crucial for binding to MKLN1, while the yippee domain is involved in binding both MKLN1 and UNG2. FAM72A acts as an adapter, recruiting UNG2 to the CTLH complex for ubiquitination (Barbulescu2024FAM72A).

Cryo-EM structural analysis revealed that FAM72A interacts with UNG2 through the CTLH-MKLN1 complex, forming a composite model that includes FAM72A, MKLN1, RANBP9, and TWA1. This model suggests that FAM72A subunits are oriented towards the active site in the center of the complex, facilitating the recruitment and orientation of UNG2 for ubiquitination (Barbulescu2024FAM72A). The interaction with MKLN1 is particularly significant, as deletion of the C-terminal residues of FAM72A reduces binding to MKLN1. FAM72A can form a stable three-protein complex with MKLN1 and UNG2, serving as a bridge between these proteins (Barbulescu2024FAM72A).
