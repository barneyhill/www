# NDUFA13

## Overview
NDUFA13 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A13, also known as GRIM-19, which is a component of mitochondrial complex I. This protein plays a pivotal role in the electron transport chain, a critical process in cellular respiration and energy production. As a subunit of complex I, NDUFA13 is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for ATP synthesis (GonzálezQuintana2020Novel). Structurally, NDUFA13 is characterized by a transmembrane helix and a thioredoxin fold, suggesting its involvement in forming a channel within complex I (Padavannil2022The; Hu2017Electron). Beyond its role in mitochondrial function, NDUFA13 interacts with various proteins, including the transcription factor STAT3, and exhibits anti-oncogenic properties by inhibiting STAT3-dependent gene expression (Angebault2015Mutation; Moreira2011GRIM19). Mutations in NDUFA13 have been linked to mitochondrial disorders such as Leigh syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in both neurodegenerative and cardiac conditions (GonzálezQuintana2020Novel).

## Structure
The NDUFA13 protein, also known as GRIM-19, is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, playing a crucial role in the electron transport chain. Its molecular structure includes a single transmembrane helix (TMH) that extends into the intermembrane space (IMS), followed by a coil and two short α-helices at the C-terminus, forming a helix-turn-helix motif (Padavannil2022The). The N-terminal coil of NDUFA13 binds along the Q-module and interacts with other subunits such as NDUFA7, NDUFS2, and NDUFS8, as well as a lipid molecule at the interface of the matrix and inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFA13 is characterized by a thioredoxin fold and interacts with several other subunits, including ND6, NDUFB5, NDUFA1, NDUFS5, and NDUFA8, extending across the IMS side of the complex (Padavannil2022The). The protein's unique location and structure suggest it may form a channel within complex I, interconnecting the matrix with the membrane interstitium (Hu2017Electron). Mutations in NDUFA13, such as K5N, R115P, and R57H, have been linked to various conditions, including tumors and early onset of hypotonia (Padavannil2022The).

## Function
NDUFA13 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is the largest complex in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It plays a critical role in oxidative phosphorylation, a process essential for ATP production. NDUFA13 facilitates the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that drives ATP synthesis (GonzálezQuintana2020Novel).

In healthy human cells, NDUFA13 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular respiration. It is located at the heel position of complex I, forming a channel that interconnects the matrix with the membrane interstitium, which is crucial for regulating electron flow and preventing superoxide bursts (Hu2017Electron). This regulation is important for controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which can act as signaling molecules in moderate amounts but are damaging at high concentrations (Hu2017Electron).

NDUFA13's role extends to influencing mitochondrial membrane potential and the assembly of complex I, impacting the stability and activity of the entire electron transport chain. This function is vital for energy metabolism and overall cellular health (Ren2024SGK3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NDUFA13 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting mitochondrial function. Novel mutations in NDUFA13 have been linked to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency and Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities. These mutations can lead to complex I deficiencies, impacting the assembly and stability of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes. In one study, two heterozygous variants, a missense mutation (c.107T>C; p.(Leu36Pro)) and a frameshift mutation (c.194delT; p.(Phe65Serfs*34)), were identified in a patient with Leigh syndrome, resulting in significant reductions in complex I activity and ATP synthesis rates (GonzálezQuintana2020Novel).

Altered expression of NDUFA13 also plays a role in cardiac conditions. Moderate down-regulation of NDUFA13 in cardiac-specific models has been shown to confer protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury by reducing apoptosis and infarct size. This protective effect is mediated through increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which activates anti-apoptotic signaling pathways involving STAT3 dimerization (Hu2017Electron). These findings suggest that NDUFA13's role in ROS generation and mitochondrial function is crucial in both neurodegenerative and cardiac conditions.

## Interactions
NDUFA13, also known as GRIM-19, is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is essential for the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. It plays a critical role in the stability and assembly of complex I, interacting with other subunits to facilitate electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone (GonzálezQuintana2020Novel). Mutations in NDUFA13 can disrupt these interactions, leading to defects in complex I assembly and stability, as evidenced by lower levels of respirasomes and supercomplexes in affected individuals (GonzálezQuintana2020Novel).

NDUFA13 also interacts with other proteins beyond its role in complex I. It has been shown to interact with viral proteins and the transcription factor STAT3, inhibiting cell cycle progression and exhibiting anti-oncogenic effects (Angebault2015Mutation). This interaction with STAT3 is significant in cancer biology, as NDUFA13 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting STAT3-dependent gene expression, which is crucial for tumor growth (Moreira2011GRIM19). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of NDUFA13 in both mitochondrial function and cellular regulation.
