# SNW1

## Overview
The SNW1 gene encodes the SNW domain containing 1 protein, which is a multifunctional protein involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA splicing. As a transcriptional coregulator, SNW1 plays a pivotal role in linking DNA-binding proteins to the splicing machinery, thereby facilitating the coupling of transcription initiation to splicing. This function is essential for the proper operation of large protein complexes, such as those involving RNA polymerase II, and is crucial for cell cycle progression (Folk2004Transcriptional). The SNW1 protein is a component of the spliceosome, participating in the splicing of pre-mRNAs necessary for sister chromatid cohesion and mitotic progression (van2014SNW1). Additionally, SNW1 acts as a transcriptional co-activator in the NF-κB pathway, influencing immune responses and inflammation (Verma2019SNW1). Its interactions with various proteins, including those in the spliceosome and transcriptional complexes, underscore its significance in cellular processes and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer (Höflmayer2019SNW1).

## Structure
The SNW1 protein, also known as SNW domain containing 1, is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function in transcriptional regulation and splicing. The primary structure of SNW1 includes notable motifs such as a glycine-rich box, a proline-rich box, and an SNWKN signature conserved across genera. It also contains highly conserved amphiionic helical repeats and a region similar to the N-terminal half of SH2 domains (Folk2004Transcriptional).

The secondary structure of SNW1 is predicted to include a helical region between amino acids 299 and 360, which is highly charged and overlaps with binding sites for most SNW partners. This region is composed of recurring motifs with 'buttons' of negative charge interlaced with basic amino acids (Folk2004Transcriptional).

SNW1 is involved in forming complexes with other proteins, indicating its role in quaternary structures. It interacts with various components of the spliceosome and transcriptional complexes, such as the CDC5 complex and U2, U4, and U5 snRNAs, suggesting its involvement in higher-order assemblies (Folk2004Transcriptional).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are suggested by the presence of tentative phosphorylation sites within the protein (Folk2004Transcriptional). SNW1 may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions.

## Function
The SNW1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation and RNA splicing in human cells. SNW1 is involved in coupling transcription initiation to splicing, acting as a transcriptional coregulator that links DNA-binding proteins to the splicing machinery. This coupling is essential for the proper functioning of large protein complexes, such as those involving RNA polymerase II, and is crucial for cell cycle progression (Folk2004Transcriptional).

SNW1 is a component of the spliceosome, necessary for the splicing of pre-mRNAs that encode proteins essential for sister chromatid cohesion, such as sororin and APC2. Depletion of SNW1 leads to splicing defects, resulting in cohesion defects and mitotic progression issues (van2014SNW1). The protein is part of the NTC and U5 subcomplexes of the spliceosome, highlighting its role in the splicing of specific introns necessary for chromatid cohesion (van2014SNW1).

SNW1 also functions as a transcriptional co-activator in the NF-κB pathway, where it interacts with the NF-κB heterodimer in the nucleus to facilitate transcriptional activation of target genes involved in inflammation and immune responses (Verma2019SNW1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SNW1 gene have been linked to various cancers, including prostate cancer, where it serves as a prognostic biomarker. High SNW1 expression is associated with aggressive tumor features, high cell proliferation, and poor prognosis in prostate cancer. It is particularly overexpressed in ERG-positive cancers, potentially due to ERG-dependent activation of TGF-ß signaling (Höflmayer2019SNW1). SNW1 overexpression is also linked to unfavorable tumor features in other malignancies such as breast cancer, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and malignant pleural mesothelioma (Höflmayer2019SNW1).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SNW1 mutations or deletions may disrupt NOTCH1 signaling, leading to increased expression of NOTCH1-regulated genes and contributing to tumorigenesis (Edelmann2019Genomic). SNW1 is also implicated in the NF-κB pathway, where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. Misregulation of this pathway is associated with diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and various cancers, although direct links to SNW1 mutations are not specified (Verma2019SNW1).

SNW1's role in splicing is crucial for sister chromatid cohesion, and its depletion can lead to cohesion defects, potentially impacting conditions related to chromatid cohesion defects (van2014SNW1).

## Interactions
SNW1, also known as SKIP, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that play critical roles in various cellular processes. It is a component of the spliceosome complex, interacting with spliceosomal components such as U2, U4, and U5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) as part of the CDC5 complex, which includes proteins like Prp45p, Prp46p, and Prp22p (Folk2004Transcriptional). SNW1 interacts with the cell cycle regulator pRb, and this interaction is crucial for overcoming the transcription-repressing ability of pRb, facilitating cell cycle progression (Folk2004Transcriptional).

SNW1 also interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) in a ligand-dependent manner, forming ternary complexes that enhance vitamin D-dependent transactivation (Folk2004Transcriptional). It binds to Smad transcription factors, augmenting TGF-b-dependent transcription, and interacts with MyoD and poly(A)-binding protein 2 (PABP2) to stimulate MyoD's transcriptional activity (Folk2004Transcriptional).

In the context of immune responses, SNW1 interacts with IKKγ, facilitating the activation of the NF-kB and TBK1/IRF3 pathways, which are crucial for antiviral responses against influenza A virus infection (Zhang2020SNW1). SNW1 also interacts with the NF-κB transcription machinery, including p65, pol II, and p-TEFb, to facilitate the transcriptional elongation of NF-κB target genes (Verma2019SNW1).
