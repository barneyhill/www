# HOXA9

## Overview
The HOXA9 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes the homeobox A9 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its homeodomain. This domain is crucial for DNA binding and plays a significant role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and hematopoiesis (LaRondeLeBlanc2003Structure; Shenoy2023HOXA9). The HOXA9 protein is involved in the morphogenesis of the embryonic skeletal system, specification of the posterior part of the embryo, and development of the female reproductive tract (Xu2014Regulation; Shenoy2023HOXA9). It also plays a pivotal role in endothelial cell function, including migration and angiogenesis (Shenoy2023HOXA9). Clinically, HOXA9 is implicated in various cancers, particularly acute myeloid leukemia, where its upregulation is associated with poor prognosis (Collins2015Role; Shenoy2023HOXA9). The gene's involvement in cancer progression is linked to its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the tumor microenvironment (Tang2022Role).

## Structure
The HOXA9 protein is a member of the homeobox gene family, characterized by a homeodomain that plays a crucial role in DNA binding. This homeodomain consists of three alpha helices: Helix-I (residues 2-17), Helix-II (residues 24-34), and Helix-III (residues 37-60) (Roy2011Two). The third helix of the homeodomain lies in the major groove of DNA, facilitating core base contacts, while the N-terminal arm interacts with the minor groove (LaRondeLeBlanc2003Structure).

The HOXA9 protein forms a ternary complex with Pbx1 and DNA, where the homeodomains of HOXA9 and Pbx1 are arranged head-to-tail, contacting overlapping sites on nearly opposite faces of the DNA (LaRondeLeBlanc2003Structure). The hexapeptide motif of HOXA9, which includes a conserved tryptophan residue, is essential for binding to Pbx1 and is involved in hematopoietic cell transformation (LaRondeLeBlanc2003Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate HOXA9 activity, as suggested by the presence of a conserved serine residue in the linker region, which is a potential phosphorylation site (LaRondeLeBlanc2003Structure). The protein's interaction with TALE-class cofactors, such as PBX1 and MEIS1, is facilitated by specific residues in the homeodomain, including D29 and M56, which form alternative binding interfaces (Dard2019The).

## Function
The HOXA9 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various biological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in embryogenesis, where it helps determine body axis, skeletal morphology, and organ development in a tissue-specific manner (Shenoy2023HOXA9). HOXA9 is essential for the morphogenesis of the embryonic skeletal system and the specification of the posterior part of the embryo, particularly in axial skeletal patterning and forelimb morphogenesis (Shenoy2023HOXA9).

In the context of hematopoiesis, HOXA9 is abundantly expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, playing a critical role in blood formation and the differentiation of hemogenic precursors into blood cells (Shenoy2023HOXA9). It enhances myeloid potential and promotes cell cycle progression through the upregulation of the NF-κB pathway (Shenoy2023HOXA9).

HOXA9 is also involved in the development of the female reproductive tract, including the fallopian tube, and is regulated by ovarian steroids like progesterone and estrogen (Shenoy2023HOXA9). It plays a role in endometrial receptivity, crucial for embryo implantation, by regulating genes essential for uterine function (Xu2014Regulation).

In endothelial cells, HOXA9 is the only member of the HOX family expressed, playing a role in endothelial cell migration, angiogenesis, and wound healing (Shenoy2023HOXA9).

## Clinical Significance
The HOXA9 gene is implicated in various diseases, primarily due to its role in regulating gene expression during development and its involvement in cancer progression. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), HOXA9 is frequently upregulated, often in conjunction with the MEIS1 gene, contributing to leukemic transformation and poor prognosis (Collins2015Role; Shenoy2023HOXA9). Genetic alterations such as translocations and fusions at the HOXA9 locus are linked to leukemic transformation in AML (Shenoy2023HOXA9). The NUP98-HOXA9 fusion is one such example that promotes cancer progression (Shenoy2023HOXA9).

In solid tumors, HOXA9 is involved in processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, and the tumor microenvironment, affecting cancers such as ovarian, breast, and gastrointestinal cancers (Shenoy2023HOXA9; Tang2022Role). Aberrant expression of HOXA9 can lead to impaired immune responses and sustained activation of signaling pathways, fostering a tumor-friendly microenvironment (Shenoy2023HOXA9). Epigenetic changes, including promoter DNA methylation and interactions with noncoding RNAs, contribute to its deregulation in various cancers (Tang2022Role; Shenoy2023HOXA9). These alterations in HOXA9 expression and interactions are associated with disease progression and prognosis in multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
HOXA9 interacts with TALE-class cofactors, specifically PBX1 and MEIS1, to form both dimeric and trimeric complexes. The homeodomain (HD) of HOXA9 is crucial for these interactions, with specific residues such as D29 and M56 playing significant roles in trimeric complex formation with PBX1 and MEIS1. These residues act redundantly with the HX motif, which contains a conserved tryptophan residue that fits into a hydrophobic pocket formed by PYP residues in the PBX1 homeodomain (Dard2019The).

In myeloid cells, HOXA9 forms complexes with PBX2 and MEIS1, enhancing DNA binding affinity and selectivity. These interactions are crucial for HOXA9's role in leukemogenesis, as coexpression with MEIS1 is linked to rapid development of myeloid cell tumors (Shen1999HOXA9).

HOXA9 also interacts with Smad4, which results in transcriptional activation of the OPN promoter in response to TGF-β stimulation. This interaction involves the Smad4 MH1 domain and a loop that forms a complex with the HOXA9 homeodomain, dislodging it from DNA binding (Roy2011Two).

Phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) impairs HOXA9's DNA binding ability, affecting its interactions with PBX and MEIS1, and is linked to myeloid differentiation (Vijapurkar2004Protein).
