# OR8B3

## Overview
OR8B3 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily B member 3, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules and is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a critical role in olfactory signal transduction. Upon binding to specific odorants, the OR8B3 protein activates a signaling cascade that involves G proteins and the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), ultimately leading to the perception of smell (Ieki2022Functional). The receptor's function has been studied in various cellular environments, revealing its responsiveness to certain odorants and its potential variability in signaling pathways (Maßberg2015Monoterpene). Additionally, OR8B3 has been implicated in clinical contexts, such as Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer, where its expression patterns may contribute to disease pathophysiology (FONSECASANCHÉZ2013microRNA18b; FlorentinusMefailoski2021The).

## Function
OR8B3 is an olfactory receptor that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the recognition and transmission of olfactory signals. Upon binding with specific odorants, OR8B3 initiates a signal transduction pathway that involves the activation of G proteins, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This cascade ultimately results in the perception of smell (Ieki2022Functional).

In functional studies, OR8B3 has been shown to respond to several odorants, including l-carvone, anis aldehyde, and methyl β-naphthyl ketone, when expressed in HEK293 cells (Ieki2022Functional). The receptor's activity is characterized by its ability to mediate cAMP signals, which are crucial for the initial phase of odorant detection. However, in some cell lines, such as Huh7, OR8B3 did not evoke calcium signals upon activation by its known ligand R-carvone, suggesting that its role in calcium signaling pathways may be limited or context-dependent (Maßberg2015Monoterpene). These findings highlight the receptor's involvement in olfactory signal transduction and its potential variability in function across different cellular environments.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR8B3 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been explored in various studies, particularly in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and breast cancer. In Alzheimer's disease, studies have shown that the observation frequency of peptides from the OR8B3 gene is higher in AD patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathophysiology (ERDOĞAN2024EnSCAN:; FlorentinusMefailoski2021The). However, the specific clinical implications of OR8B3 mutations in AD are not fully understood (FlorentinusMefailoski2021The).

In breast cancer, particularly in miR-18b-deficient breast cancer cells, OR8B3 is among the olfactory receptor genes that are upregulated. This upregulation is part of a broader pattern observed in 55 olfactory receptor genes, which are typically expressed in sensory neurons but also found in various non-chemosensory tissues and tumor tissues (FONSECASANCHÉZ2013microRNA18b). The study suggests that miR-18b might regulate OR gene expression indirectly, although the exact mechanism remains to be confirmed (FONSECASANCHÉZ2013microRNA18b). Despite these findings, the direct clinical significance of OR8B3 mutations or alterations in its expression in breast cancer is not clearly established.
