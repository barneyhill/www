# ENDOV

## Overview
Endonuclease V (ENDOV) is a gene that encodes the protein endonuclease V, a specialized inosine-specific ribonuclease. This enzyme is part of the RNase H-like family and is characterized by its ability to cleave RNA substrates containing inosine, a nucleoside formed by the deamination of adenosine. The protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleoli, where it plays a critical role in RNA processing and metabolism. Unlike its bacterial counterparts, human endonuclease V exhibits a preference for RNA over DNA, reflecting its specialized function in RNA integrity and stability. The structural features of endonuclease V, including its conserved active site residues and unique cysteine motif, facilitate its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. The regulation of ENDOV activity is influenced by interactions with other proteins, such as polyadenylate-binding protein C1 (PABPC1), which modulate its function under various cellular conditions (Morita2013Human; Nawaz2016Regulation). Understanding the role of ENDOV in RNA processing is crucial for elucidating its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis.

## Structure
The human Endonuclease V (ENDOV) protein is characterized by a sequence of 282 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 31 kDa (Morita2013Human). The primary structure of ENDOV includes conserved active site residues such as Asp52, Tyr91, and Glu100, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Morita2013Human). The secondary structure of ENDOV features a central 8-stranded beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices, a common motif in the RNase H-like family (Dalhus2015Structural). This structure is similar to its bacterial counterparts, maintaining a general 'RNase H-like' fold, particularly in the wedge motif, metal-binding site, and hypoxanthine-binding pocket (Zhang2014Structure).

The tertiary structure of ENDOV includes a unique four-cysteine motif, with Cys227 and Cys228 playing crucial roles in catalysis (Zhang2014Structure). The protein also has a proline-rich C-terminal extension, which is unstructured and affects crystallization (Zhang2014Structure). The quaternary structure of ENDOV has not been explicitly detailed in the context provided.

Human ENDOV exhibits several splice variant isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing, which may affect its function and localization (Fladeby2012The). These isoforms often lack exon 3, which is crucial for the protein's core domain and function (Fladeby2012The). The protein is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleoli, suggesting a role in RNA processing (Fladeby2012The).

## Function
Human endonuclease V (ENDOV) functions primarily as an inosine-specific ribonuclease, targeting inosine-containing RNA rather than DNA. This enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it cleaves single-stranded and double-stranded RNA substrates at inosine sites, which are introduced by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) (Morita2013Human; Nawaz2016Regulation). The activity of ENDOV is regulated by its interaction with polyadenylate-binding protein C1 (PABPC1), which enhances its affinity for inosine-containing RNA. Under stress conditions, ENDOV and PABPC1 relocate to cytoplasmic stress granules, suggesting a role in managing RNA integrity during cellular stress (Nawaz2016Regulation).

ENDOV's role in RNA metabolism includes processing inosine-containing RNA, which is crucial for maintaining RNA stability and function. This activity may help regulate the balance between edited and non-edited RNA forms, impacting processes such as neurotransmission (Sebastian2013Endonuclease). The enzyme's preference for RNA over DNA suggests a distinct role in RNA processing rather than DNA repair in human cells (Morita2013Human). ENDOV's activity is crucial for maintaining RNA integrity, potentially influencing RNA editing and processing pathways in healthy human cells (Morita2013Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the ENDOV gene can significantly impact cellular processes, potentially leading to various diseases. ENDOV is crucial for RNA processing and DNA repair, and its dysfunction is associated with genomic instability. This instability can contribute to the development of cancer, as the accumulation of DNA damage and errors in RNA processing can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. Additionally, altered ENDOV expression or mutations may be implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. These conditions often involve the progressive loss of neuronal function and structure, which can be exacerbated by impaired DNA repair mechanisms. The role of ENDOV in maintaining genomic stability highlights its importance in understanding the mechanisms underlying these diseases. Research into ENDOV's interactions and expression levels continues to be significant for developing potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

## Interactions
Endonuclease V (ENDOV) in humans primarily interacts with nucleic acids, showing a preference for RNA substrates over DNA. This preference is attributed to specific structural features that facilitate stable RNA binding, such as the presence of loops that interact with the inosine and ribonucleotide upstream of the scissile phosphate (Wu2019Evolution). The enzyme forms stable one-to-one complexes with RNA, a characteristic that distinguishes it from its bacterial counterparts, which can bind both DNA and RNA (Wu2019Evolution).

The interaction with RNA is further enhanced by specific regions outside the active site, such as the loops L12, L56, and L78, which are crucial for substrate specificity. These loops have evolved to increase RNA cleavage activity, as demonstrated by experiments where bacterial EndoV was modified with loops from eukaryotic EndoV, resulting in enhanced RNA interaction (Wu2019Evolution).

In terms of protein interactions, the structure of human EndoV includes a surface-exposed α-helix that may play a role in protein-protein interactions, potentially affecting catalytic performance. This α-helix is absent in prokaryotic EndoV but is present in human EndoV, suggesting a role in forming complexes or interacting with other proteins (Nawaz2016Crystal).
