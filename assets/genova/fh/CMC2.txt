# CMC2

## Overview
CMC2 is a gene that encodes the protein C-X9-C motif containing 2, which is integral to mitochondrial function, particularly in the assembly and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX). This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial protein and is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a vital role in cellular respiration. CMC2 is evolutionarily conserved and shares significant sequence identity with CMC1, another mitochondrial protein, suggesting a cooperative role in copper trafficking necessary for COX biogenesis. Despite this cooperation, CMC2 and CMC1 have distinct, non-overlapping functions, as evidenced by the inability of CMC2-null yeast cells to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources even with overexpressed CMC1 (Gladyck2021Regulation). In humans, while the precise function of CMC2 remains to be fully elucidated, its importance is underscored by its involvement in mitochondrial translation of core subunits and its association with various diseases when mutated, particularly those affecting mitochondrial function (Gladyck2021Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CMC2 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly those affecting mitochondrial function. The twin CX9C proteins, which include CMC2, are crucial for the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, specifically through their involvement in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) regulation. Mutations in these proteins, including CMC2, have been linked to neurological disorders, cancers, and cardiomyopathy. The exact molecular mechanisms by which these mutations lead to COX deficiency remain largely unknown, but disruptions in the import process of these proteins into the mitochondrial intermembrane space can lead to COX dysfunction (Gladyck2021Regulation).

In yeast, the absence of CMC2 results in depleted COX activity and undetectable levels of COX subunits I and II, indicating its essential role in COX assembly. This suggests that similar disruptions in humans could contribute to mitochondrial disorders, although the specific function of human CMC2 in COX assembly is not yet fully understood (Gladyck2021Regulation). Understanding the role of CMC2 in human disease is critical, as current data are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions about its clinical significance (Gladyck2021Regulation).

## Interactions
CMC2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function, particularly in the assembly and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX). It is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and is essential for cellular respiration and COX activity in yeast. CMC2 shares a significant sequence identity with CMC1 and is evolutionarily conserved. The protein interacts with CMC1, as demonstrated by co-sedimentation and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, indicating a cooperative role in copper trafficking for COX biogenesis. Despite this interaction, CMC2-null yeast cells cannot grow on non-fermentable carbon sources even with overexpressed CMC1, COX11, or SCO1, suggesting that CMC1 and CMC2 have non-overlapping roles (Gladyck2021Regulation).

In humans, the exact function of CMC2 remains unproven, although it shares sequence overlap with human CMC1 and localizes similarly to mitochondria. The context does not provide specific details on CMC2's interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond its interaction with CMC1. The absence of CMC2 leads to severely diminished COX I production, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial translation of core subunits due to its role in COX assembly (Gladyck2021Regulation).
