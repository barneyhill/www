# SCHIP1

## Overview
The SCHIP1 gene encodes the schwannomin interacting protein 1, a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes related to cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling. This protein is characterized by its interaction with schwannomin (merlin), encoded by the NF2 gene, and is involved in the maintenance of podocyte foot processes in the kidney glomerulus, as well as axonal function in the nervous system. SCHIP1 is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein due to its involvement in actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and its interactions with proteins such as Nherf2, ezrin, and Ankyrin G. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular structures and functions, such as the filtration barrier in kidneys and the axon initial segment in neurons. Mutations in the SCHIP1 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and nephropathies, highlighting its clinical significance (Goutebroze2000Cloning; Perisic2015Schip1; Elsaid2017Homozygous).

## Structure
The SCHIP1 protein is composed of 487 amino acids and is highly conserved between humans and mice, with over 99% amino acid conservation (Goutebroze2000Cloning). It is predicted to be a highly acidic protein with an isoelectric point of 4.98 and a molecular mass of 53.5 kDa, although Western blot analysis has detected it as a 65-kDa protein, possibly due to its physical properties (Goutebroze2000Cloning).

SCHIP1 contains several notable structural features. It has a leucine zipper coiled-coil domain between amino acids 419 and 479, which is homologous to human FEZ1 and FEZ2 proteins and the C. elegans gene product UNC-76, all of which are involved in axonal outgrowth (Goutebroze2000Cloning). This coiled-coil region allows SCHIP1 to form homodimers and is crucial for its interaction with schwannomin (Goutebroze2000Cloning). SCHIP1 also contains two serine-rich regions, an acidic region, a PEST domain suggesting a short half-life, three SH3-binding motifs, and a potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site (Goutebroze2000Cloning).

The protein can self-associate via its coiled-coil domain, and its interaction with schwannomin is regulated by conformational changes in schwannomin, potentially influenced by post-translational modifications (Goutebroze2000Cloning).

## Function
SCHIP1 (Schwannomin interacting protein 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of podocyte foot processes in the kidney glomerulus. Podocytes are specialized cells essential for the kidney's filtration barrier, and their foot processes are supported by a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. SCHIP1 is highly enriched in the glomerulus and specifically localized to podocyte foot processes, where it is involved in actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. This function is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and function of podocytes. Inactivation of SCHIP1 in zebrafish leads to disorganization of foot processes and podocyte loss, resulting in proteinuria, highlighting its importance in maintaining podocyte structure (Perisic2015Schip1).

SCHIP1 forms a complex with Nherf2 and ezrin, proteins involved in actin remodeling, which is crucial for the maintenance of podocyte foot processes and the functional filtration barrier. Overexpression of SCHIP1 in vitro leads to changes in actin dynamics, promoting cell migration in response to PDGF-BB stimulation. SCHIP1 remains associated with F-actin structures even after actin disassembly, suggesting a strong functional connection with the actin cytoskeleton (Perisic2015Schip1). These findings indicate that SCHIP1 is a critical component in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes, essential for their function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCHIP1 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. A homozygous nonsense mutation in SCHIP1/IQCJ-SCHIP1 is associated with a neurodevelopmental brain malformation syndrome characterized by global developmental delay, learning difficulties, facial dysmorphism, and hearing loss. This mutation results in a premature stop codon, leading to the loss of critical protein regions, which affects protein stability and folding. The disorder is marked by specific brain MRI findings, such as thinning of the corpus callosum and absence of the anterior commissure, consistent with axonal guidance defects and cortical dysgenesis (Elsaid2017Homozygous).

SCHIP1 is also implicated in kidney function, particularly in maintaining the structure and function of podocyte foot processes. Inactivation of SCHIP1 in zebrafish leads to podocyte loss and proteinuria, suggesting its role in nephropathies characterized by podocyte dysfunction, such as glomerulosclerosis (Perisic2015Schip1).

Additionally, SCHIP1 has been associated with facial size and shape variations in humans. Genomewide association studies have identified its role in facial development, particularly in African populations, although its specific function in facial morphogenesis remains unclear (Cole2016Genomewide).

## Interactions
SCHIP1 (schwannomin interacting protein 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. SCHIP1 interacts with schwannomin, also known as merlin, which is encoded by the NF2 gene. This interaction is facilitated through specific regions on schwannomin, including the N-terminus and a central region, as demonstrated by GST pull-down experiments (Goutebroze2000Cloning). SCHIP1 also forms a complex with Nherf2 and ezrin in podocytes, linking the apical membrane protein podocalyxin to the actin cytoskeleton. This complex is essential for actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and maintaining podocyte structure (Perisic2015Schip1).

In the nervous system, SCHIP1 interacts with Ankyrin G (AnkG) and calmodulin, playing a role in the maintenance of the axon initial segment (AIS). The interaction with AnkG is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation, which enhances the binding affinity of SCHIP1 to AnkG, crucial for its localization at the AIS (Papandréou2015CK2‐regulated). SCHIP1 is also enriched at nodes of Ranvier and AISs, where it colocalizes with sodium channels and other axonal proteins, indicating its involvement in axonal function (Martin2008SchwannominInteracting). These interactions highlight SCHIP1's role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling.
