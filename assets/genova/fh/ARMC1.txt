# ARMC1

## Overview
ARMC1, or Armadillo Repeat Containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics and cellular health. The ARMC1 protein is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for its association with the outer mitochondrial membrane (Huang2021ARMC). This protein is a component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system/mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex (MICOS/MIB), playing a significant role in mitochondrial fission and distribution (Huang2021ARMC). ARMC1 interacts with several mitochondrial proteins, including solute carrier family 25 member 46 (SLC25A46), which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Wagner2019Armadillo). The protein's involvement in mitochondrial dynamics has implications for various diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and diabetes, highlighting its importance in cellular health and disease pathogenesis (Huang2021ARMC).

## Structure
The ARMC1 protein is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeat domains, which are central to its structure. These repeats are approximately 42 amino acids in length and are involved in protein-protein interactions, contributing to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures (Huang2021ARMC). The armadillo repeat domain facilitates the binding of ARMC1 to the outer mitochondrial membrane, interacting specifically with solute carrier family 25 member 46 (SLC25A46), which is crucial for mitochondrial fission and distribution (Huang2021ARMC).

The C-terminus of ARMC1 contains a heavy-metal-associated domain with two conserved cysteines, suggesting a role in metal ion binding, potentially related to metal ion transport or detoxification (Huang2021ARMC). Despite its association with the mitochondrial outer membrane, ARMC1 does not integrate into the membrane but associates with it, possibly through its C-terminal part (Wagner2019Armadillo). The protein is highly conserved among mammals, indicating a common functional role, although specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available literature (Huang2021ARMC; Wagner2019Armadillo).

## Function
ARMC1 is a subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system/mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex (MICOS/MIB), which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. It binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane through its armadillo repeat domain, interacting with solute carrier family 25 member 46 (SLC25A46). This interaction is involved in promoting mitochondrial fission and preventing the formation of hyperfilamentous mitochondria (Huang2021ARMC). Although mitochondria lacking ARMC1 do not show defects in cristae structure, respiration, or protein content, they appear fragmented and exhibit reduced motility, suggesting a role in mitochondrial distribution within the cell (Wagner2019Armadillo).

ARMC1 is highly conserved among mammals, indicating its importance in similar biological roles across species (Huang2021ARMC). Despite its peripheral role in the MICOS/MIB complex, ARMC1's interaction with SLC25A46 suggests it may regulate mitochondrial dynamics, potentially impacting cellular health and function (Huang2021ARMC). The protein's dual localization in both the cytosol and mitochondria might influence its function or represent a pool of inactive cytosolic ARMC1 that is recruited to mitochondria upon specific signals (Wagner2019Armadillo).

## Clinical Significance
ARMC1 is implicated in several diseases through its interactions with mitochondrial proteins. It binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane via its armadillo repeat domain, interacting with solute carrier family 25 member 46 (SLC25A46). This interaction is crucial for regulating mitochondrial fission and preventing the formation of hyperfilamentous mitochondria. Alterations in ARMC1 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a significant factor in the development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), glioma, and diabetes (Huang2021ARMC).

In Alzheimer's Disease, the dysfunction of ARMC1's interaction with SLC25A46 may contribute to mitochondrial fragmentation, a hallmark of the disease (Huang2021ARMC). Similarly, in Parkinson's Disease, this interaction is thought to lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a key factor in the disease's pathogenesis (Huang2021ARMC). In glioma, ARMC1's role in mitochondrial fission and distribution may promote tumorigenesis (Huang2021ARMC). Additionally, ARMC1's influence on mitochondrial function is suggested to play a role in diabetes, potentially through similar mechanisms of mitochondrial regulation (Huang2021ARMC). These findings highlight the importance of ARMC1 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and its potential impact on various diseases.

## Interactions
ARMC1, also known as Armadillo repeat-containing protein 1, is involved in several protein interactions, primarily within the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex (MICOS/MIB). It interacts with various components of this complex, including Mic60/Mitofilin, Mic19/CHCHD3, and DnaJC11, indicating its role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Wagner2019Armadillo). ARMC1 is not integrated into the outer mitochondrial membrane but associates with it, likely through its C-terminal region (Wagner2019Armadillo).

ARMC1 also interacts with the solute carrier family 25 member 46 (SLC25A46), a protein that promotes mitochondrial fission. This interaction is significant as it regulates mitochondrial fission and distribution, potentially leading to mitochondrial dysfunction when ARMC1 binds to SLC25A46 (Huang2021ARMC). The interaction between ARMC1 and SLC25A46 is implicated in various diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and diabetes, due to its role in mitochondrial dynamics (Huang2021ARMC).

Additionally, ARMC1 interacts with mitochondrial fission regulator 1-like (MTFR1L), further supporting its involvement in mitochondrial fission processes (Wagner2019Armadillo). These interactions highlight ARMC1's role in mitochondrial function and its potential impact on cellular health.
