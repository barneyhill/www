# MPLKIP

## Overview
The MPLKIP gene encodes the M-phase-specific PLK1-interacting protein, which is integral to cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. This protein interacts with polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a pivotal regulator of mitotic progression, and is phosphorylated by CDK1, underscoring its role in mitosis and cytokinesis. The protein is categorized as a cell cycle regulatory protein due to its involvement in these processes, which are essential for proper cell division and genomic stability (Zhou2018A; Orioli2018Trichothiodystrophy). MPLKIP is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and hair follicles, and is crucial for maintaining normal mitotic processes and transcription-related activities (Zhou2018A; Shah2016Mitral). Mutations in MPLKIP are linked to trichothiodystrophy, a disorder characterized by brittle hair and intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance (Strang‐Karlsson2021A; Zhou2018A).

## Function
The MPLKIP gene encodes a protein known as M-phase-specific PLK1-interacting protein, which plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. This protein interacts with polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a key regulator of mitotic progression, and is phosphorylated by CDK1. MPLKIP is involved in the regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis, processes essential for proper cell division and genomic stability (Zhou2018A; Orioli2018Trichothiodystrophy).

MPLKIP localizes to the nucleus and is expressed in various tissues, including fetal hair follicles, the brain, heart, lung, placenta, epidermis, and hair follicles (Zhou2018A; Shah2016Mitral). In HeLa cells, overexpression of MPLKIP leads to nuclear fragmentation, while its knockdown results in multiple nuclei or multipolar mitotic spindles, indicating its role in maintaining normal mitotic processes (Orioli2018Trichothiodystrophy; La2018Novel).

The protein also serves as a bridge in the protein-protein interaction network that connects the RNA Polymerase II complex with various cofactors, facilitating transcription-related activities. This involvement in transcription pathways is crucial for proper gene expression and cellular function (Zhou2018A). The loss of MPLKIP function can disrupt these interactions, affecting transcription activities and leading to various clinical symptoms (Zhou2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MPLKIP gene are associated with trichothiodystrophy (TTD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by brittle, sulfur-deficient hair, intellectual disability, and other systemic manifestations. Specifically, non-photosensitive trichothiodystrophy type 4 (TTD4) is linked to mutations in MPLKIP, such as the novel homozygous variant c.26del, p.(Pro9Glnfs*144), identified in Finnish patients. These patients exhibited developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and ataxia, suggesting a possible founder effect in the Finnish population (Strang‐Karlsson2021A).

Another mutation, a homozygous G insertion, leads to TTDN1 with symptoms including hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, osteoporosis, and intellectual disability. This mutation results in a truncated protein, likely causing a loss of function, and is associated with a tiger-tail pattern in hair shafts and low sulfur levels (Zhou2018A).

A splice variant, c.339 + 1G > A, has been identified in Pakistani families, leading to nonphotosensitive trichothiodystrophy with mitral regurgitation. This variant causes intron retention and protein truncation, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of MPLKIP-related disorders to include cardiomyopathy (Shah2016Mitral).

## Interactions
The MPLKIP gene encodes a protein that interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a key regulator of cell cycle progression, particularly during the M-phase. This interaction suggests a role for MPLKIP in cell cycle regulation and cytokinesis (Zhou2018A). MPLKIP also acts as a bridge between the RNA Polymerase II complex and other cofactors, indicating its involvement in transcription processes. Among the proteins interacting with MPLKIP are SBDS and FAM120C. SBDS is involved in ribosome biogenesis and is associated with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, while FAM120C is linked to intellectual disability and autism (Zhou2018A).

The disruption of these interactions due to mutations in MPLKIP, such as a homozygous G insertion, leads to a truncated protein and loss of function, contributing to conditions like trichothiodystrophy non-photosensitive 1 (TTDN1) and associated symptoms (Zhou2018A). The protein-protein interaction network of MPLKIP is enriched in RNA Polymerase II-related transcription processes and pathways, such as transcription elongation and nucleotide excision repair, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal cellular functions (Zhou2018A).
