# OR10H3

## Overview
OR10H3 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily H member 3, which belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory system. As a transmembrane receptor, it is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odor molecules, initiating a signaling cascade that ultimately results in the perception of smell (Ge2017Identification; Grünblatt2007Comparison). Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR10H3 and other olfactory receptors have been identified in various non-olfactory tissues, suggesting additional physiological roles such as cell migration and proliferation, although the specific functions of OR10H3 in these contexts are not yet fully understood (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Structure


## Function
OR10H3 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR10H3 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell. This process involves the activation of G-proteins, which then initiate a cascade of intracellular events leading to the generation of an electrical signal in olfactory neurons. This signal is transmitted to the brain, where it is interpreted as a distinct odor (Ge2017Identification; Grünblatt2007Comparison).

In addition to its role in olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR10H3 have been found in other tissues, suggesting potential roles beyond smell. For instance, olfactory receptors are involved in processes such as cell migration, proliferation, and regeneration in non-olfactory tissues, although the specific functions of OR10H3 in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The presence of OR10H3 in various tissues indicates its potential involvement in broader physiological processes.
