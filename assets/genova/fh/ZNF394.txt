# ZNF394

## Overview
ZNF394 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 394, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The protein is composed of several functional domains, including a krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, a leucine-rich region (LER), and multiple zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its DNA-binding capabilities and regulatory functions. ZNF394 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors such as c-Jun and AP-1, modulating their activities. The gene is expressed in various human tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, suggesting its involvement in the development and function of these tissues (Huang2004Inhibition). Additionally, ZNF394 has been implicated in complex protein interactions, including those with the stress-response protein PAGE4, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Rajagopalan2014The).

## Structure
The ZNF394 gene encodes a zinc finger protein consisting of 561 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 64 kDa. The protein structure includes several distinct domains: a leucine-rich region (LER or SCAN domain) at the N-terminus, a krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, and seven C2H2-type zinc finger motifs at the C-terminus (Huang2004Inhibition). The LER domain, spanning amino acids 60-170, is vertebrate-specific and functions as a protein interaction domain, mediating both hetero- and homoprotein-protein associations (Huang2004Inhibition). The KRAB domain, located between amino acids 155-214, is involved in transcriptional repression (Huang2004Inhibition).

The zinc finger motifs, located between amino acids 360-547, are characterized by conserved cysteine and histidine residues, forming a (Cys)2(His)2 configuration. These motifs are arranged in tandem arrays with a conserved consensus sequence TGEKPYX between adjacent motifs, facilitating DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Huang2004Inhibition). The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, suggesting its role in transcriptional regulation (Huang2004Inhibition). The ZNF394 protein is orthologous to the rat RLZF-Y protein, indicating a close evolutionary relationship (Huang2004Inhibition).

## Function
ZNF394 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in human cells. It is involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, where it modulates the transcriptional activities of key transcription factors such as c-Jun and AP-1. By inhibiting these transcription factors, ZNF394 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression associated with this pathway (Huang2004Inhibition).

The protein is characterized by specific domains, including a krüppel-associated box (KRAB), a leucine-rich region (LER), and seven C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its binding to DNA and its function as a transcription factor (Huang2004Inhibition). ZNF394 is predominantly located in the nucleus, where it exerts its regulatory effects on gene expression (Huang2004Inhibition).

ZNF394 is expressed in various adult human tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, suggesting its involvement in the development and function of these tissues. Its expression pattern and functional role imply that ZNF394 may influence cardiac development and function, as well as muscle development (Huang2004Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF394 is a zinc finger protein that has been identified as a potential interacting partner of the stress-response protein PAGE4. This interaction was discovered through a yeast two-hybrid screening, which suggested that ZNF394 may play a role in modulating the transcriptional activities of c-Jun, a transcription factor involved in the MAP kinase signaling pathway. In COS-7 cells, ZNF394 is known to inhibit the transcriptional activities of c-Jun and AP-1 reporters, indicating its function as a transcriptional repressor. However, in PC3 cells, ZNF394 does not repress c-Jun activity, and the presence of PAGE4 enhances c-Jun activity, suggesting a complex interaction between these proteins (Rajagopalan2014The).

ZNF394 is also mentioned as part of the human circadian network, which includes a vast array of gene interactions. Although specific interactions involving ZNF394 within this network are not detailed, its inclusion in such a network implies potential interactions with other circadian rhythm-related genes (Polo2017Evaluating). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of ZNF394 in cellular processes, particularly in transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways.
