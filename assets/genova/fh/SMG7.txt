# SMG7

## Overview
SMG7 is a gene that encodes the SMG7 nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factor, a protein integral to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. This pathway is crucial for the degradation of mRNAs containing premature termination codons, thereby preventing the synthesis of potentially deleterious truncated proteins. The SMG7 protein functions as a 14-3-3-like adaptor, interacting with phosphorylated UPF1, a key NMD factor, to facilitate the recruitment of decay enzymes and the assembly of mRNA decay complexes (Colombo2016Transcriptomewide; Fukuhara2005SMG7). Beyond its role in mRNA surveillance, SMG7 is involved in the regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein during the DNA damage response, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (Luo2016SMG7). Alterations in SMG7 expression and function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Yang2020Nonsense‐mediated; Deng2016Decreased).

## Structure
The SMG7 protein is characterized by a 14-3-3-like domain, which is crucial for its role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). This domain is composed of nine anti-parallel alpha helices arranged in helical hairpins, forming a horseshoe shape with a phosphopeptide-binding groove on the concave surface (Jonas2013An). The SMG7 protein also contains a middle alpha-helical domain and a C-terminal low-complexity region rich in proline residues, which is involved in mRNA degradation (Jonas2013An).

The quaternary structure of SMG7 involves its interaction with SMG5, forming a heterodimer. This interaction is facilitated by a complex network of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, π-stacking, and hydrophobic interactions, with a notable perpendicular arrangement of their α4 helices (Jonas2013An). The SMG5-SMG7 complex binds phosphorylated UPF1, with SMG7 specifically binding to the phosphorylated Ser1096 on UPF1's C-terminal tail (Jonas2013An).

SMG7's 14-3-3-like domain is structurally homologous to 14-3-3 proteins, featuring a crescent-shaped binding cleft and a conserved lysine residue (K66) necessary for interaction with phosphorylated serine/threonine residues (Cowen2019Characterization). The protein's structure is conserved across species, with similar domain architecture observed in Caenorhabditis elegans (Jonas2013An).

## Function
The SMG7 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, a cellular mechanism responsible for degrading mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) to prevent the production of truncated and potentially harmful proteins (Fukuhara2005SMG7). SMG7 functions as a 14-3-3-like adaptor protein, interacting with phosphorylated UPF1, a central NMD factor, and facilitating the recruitment of decay enzymes (Colombo2016Transcriptomewide; Fukuhara2005SMG7). It localizes to cytoplasmic mRNA decay foci, also known as P bodies, where it recruits UPF1 to these foci when coexpressed (Fukuhara2005SMG7).

In addition to its role in mRNA decay, SMG7 is involved in the regulation of p53 stability and function during the DNA damage response. It interacts with p53 and is necessary for the proper activation of p53-dependent targets, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Luo2016SMG7). SMG7 also facilitates ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Mdm2, which is crucial for p53 stabilization following DNA damage (Luo2016SMG7). This dual role in mRNA decay and p53 regulation highlights SMG7's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genome integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the SMG7 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and autoimmune disorders. In cancer, SMG7 plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis and the stability of tumor suppressor proteins. Loss of SMG7 expression leads to the downregulation of the tumor suppressor CYLD and increased resistance to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis through the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. This resistance is associated with the overexpression of oncogenic long non-coding RNAs such as PVT1, contributing to cancer cell survival and proliferation (Yang2020Nonsense‐mediated).

In the context of DNA damage response, SMG7 is essential for the stabilization and activation of the p53 protein. It interacts with Mdm2, preventing the degradation of p53 and facilitating its role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Disruption of this interaction can impair the DNA damage response, potentially leading to tumorigenesis (Luo2016SMG7).

In autoimmune diseases, decreased SMG7 expression has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to SLE risk correlate with reduced SMG7 mRNA levels, which may contribute to increased autoantibody production and immune dysregulation (Deng2016Decreased).

## Interactions
SMG7 is a crucial component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, interacting with several proteins to facilitate mRNA degradation. It forms a complex with SMG5, creating a unique 14-3-3-like heterodimer that is essential for high-affinity binding to phosphorylated UPF1, a central NMD factor. This interaction is critical for the recruitment of the general mRNA decay machinery and the dephosphorylation of UPF1, which is mediated by the phosphatase PP2A (Jonas2013An; Fukuhara2005SMG7).

SMG7 also interacts with SMG6, acting redundantly to promote the degradation of NMD targets. The SMG5-SMG7 complex and SMG6 can partially compensate for each other, highlighting their complementary roles in NMD (Jonas2013An). SMG7's interaction with UPF1 is not solely dependent on phosphorylation, as it can bind UPF1 in a phosphorylation-independent manner, which is crucial for NMD (Nicholson2018Dissecting).

In addition to its role in NMD, SMG7 has been shown to interact with the p53 protein, although this interaction does not affect p53 stabilization or activation in response to DNA damage (Cowen2019Characterization). These interactions underscore SMG7's multifaceted role in mRNA surveillance and decay pathways.
