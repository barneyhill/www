# CENPP

## Overview
CENPP, or centromere protein P, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the function of the kinetochore, a critical structure for chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein, centromere protein P, is a part of the Constitutive Centromere Associated Network (CCAN), which is essential for the proper attachment of spindle microtubules to the centromere, ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation. This function is vital for maintaining genomic stability, as errors in chromosome segregation can lead to conditions such as aneuploidy and cancer (Reinhold2011Identification). Beyond its role in cell division, CENPP is expressed in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti, implicating it in auditory function, with mutations in the gene linked to low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (RoblesBolivar2022A). The regulation of CENPP expression is influenced by CDK4, which binds to its promoter, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism that ensures its essential role in genomic integrity (Lee2021CDK4).

## Function
CENPP (centromere protein P) is a crucial component of the Constitutive Centromere Associated Network (CCAN) within the kinetochore, a multi-protein structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. CENPP is specifically involved in the assembly and maintenance of the kinetochore, ensuring proper attachment of spindle microtubules to the centromere, which is vital for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation (Reinhold2011Identification). This function is critical for maintaining genomic stability, as errors in chromosome segregation can lead to aneuploidy and genomic instability, which are often associated with cancer (Reinhold2011Identification).

CENPP is expressed in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti, indicating a potential role in auditory function. A novel nonsense variant in the CENPP gene has been linked to low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, suggesting its importance in maintaining proper auditory function (RoblesBolivar2022A). The protein's role in the kinetochore assembly and function is further supported by its co-regulation with other kinetochore-associated genes, which is maintained despite genetic and epigenetic changes, highlighting its essential role in cell division and genomic integrity (Reinhold2011Identification).

## Interactions
CENPP (centromere protein P) is a component of the Constitutive Centromere Associated Network (CCAN), which is essential for kinetochore function and chromosome segregation during mitosis. It is one of the 17 interacting proteins within this network, which includes other centromere proteins such as CENPA, CENPB, and CENPC. These proteins are crucial for the assembly and maintenance of the kinetochore complex, which interacts with centromeric chromatin and other kinetochore proteins (Reinhold2011Identification).

CENPP is also involved in the centromere-spindle microtubule interactions, playing a role in fixing the centromere to the spindle microtubules during cell division. This interaction is critical for proper chromosome alignment and segregation (RoblesBolivar2022A). Although specific physical interactions of CENPP with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available studies, its role within the CCAN complex suggests it participates in a network of protein-protein interactions essential for kinetochore function (Reinhold2011Identification; RoblesBolivar2022A).

Additionally, CDK4 has been shown to bind to the promoter of CENPP, indicating a potential regulatory interaction that may influence its expression and function in chromosomal segregation (Lee2021CDK4).
