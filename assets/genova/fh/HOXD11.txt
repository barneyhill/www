# HOXD11

## Overview
HOXD11 is a gene that encodes the homeobox D11 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family. This family is characterized by the presence of a homeodomain, which allows the encoded proteins to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. Homeobox D11 plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly in the patterning of the axial skeleton and limb formation. It is involved in the differentiation and proliferation of cells, influencing the development of vertebral elements and limb structures (Wellik2003Hox10). Additionally, HOXD11 is implicated in nephrogenesis and neonatal uterine development, as evidenced by studies in mice, suggesting similar functions in humans (Rossi2007Quantitative). The gene's critical role in these developmental processes underscores its importance in both normal physiology and in the context of congenital malformations when dysregulated.

## Function
HOXD11 is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development. In healthy human cells, HOXD11 is involved in the patterning of the axial skeleton and limb development. It influences the differentiation and proliferation of cells, contributing to the formation and organization of body structures (Wellik2003Hox10). HOXD11 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate the expression of target genes, impacting the development of specific vertebral elements and limb structures (Wellik2003Hox10).

In addition to its role in skeletal development, HOXD11, along with its paralogous gene HOXA11, is known to play a critical role in nephrogenesis and neonatal uterine development in mice, suggesting similar functions in humans (Rossi2007Quantitative). These functions are likely mediated through the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptotic responses, although the specific pathways in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Rossi2007Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the HOXD11 gene can lead to congenital limb malformations, most notably synpolydactyly. This condition is characterized by the presence of extra and fused fingers or toes, resulting from the gene's critical role in limb and skeletal development. Altered expression of HOXD11 may also impact bone growth and development, contributing to various skeletal disorders. These abnormalities arise because HOXD11 encodes a transcription factor that is essential for the proper formation and differentiation of skeletal structures during embryonic development. Disruptions in its normal function can lead to significant deviations from typical limb and skeletal morphology, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in developmental biology.
