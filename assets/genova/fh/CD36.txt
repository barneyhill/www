# CD36

## Overview
CD36 is a gene that encodes a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein, which plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including lipid metabolism, immune response, and cellular signaling. The CD36 protein, also known as a scavenger receptor, is involved in the uptake and transport of long-chain fatty acids and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL), contributing to energy metabolism and atherogenesis (Silverstein2009CD36; Pepino2014StructureFunction). It is expressed in a variety of cell types, such as adipocytes, myocytes, and enterocytes, and is implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis and sensory perception of dietary fats (Silverstein2009CD36). The gene is located on chromosome 7 and exhibits alternative splicing, which adds to the diversity of its mRNA and protein functions (Armesilla1994Structural). CD36's involvement in pathological conditions, such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases, underscores its clinical significance (Hirano2003Pathophysiology; LoveGregory2008Variants).

## Structure
The CD36 protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including fatty acid uptake and immune response. Structurally, CD36 consists of two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop. The extracellular domain is highly glycosylated, featuring 10 N-linked glycosylation sites, which contribute to its diverse interactions with ligands such as collagen and thrombospondin (Luiken2016Posttranslational; rac2007molecular). The protein also contains small cytoplasmic tails that are palmitoylated, with specific palmitoylation sites identified at cysteines 3, 7, 464, and 466. This modification is crucial for the protein's membrane targeting and function (Thorne2010Palmitoylation; Tao1996CD36).

CD36's structure includes disulfide bonds between extracellular cysteines, contributing to its stability and function (Luiken2016Posttranslational). The protein's topology is characterized by a horseshoe shape due to the palmitoylation of juxtamembrane cysteines, which are cytosolic (Thorne2010Palmitoylation). Additionally, CD36 undergoes phosphorylation, particularly at the Thr92-X-Arg motif, which affects its binding interactions with thrombospondin-1 (Chu2012CD36). The gene encoding CD36 is located on chromosome 7 and consists of 15 exons, with alternative splicing contributing to the heterogeneity of its mRNA (rac2007molecular; Armesilla1994Structural).

## Function
The CD36 gene encodes a multifunctional glycoprotein that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, immunity, and cellular signaling in healthy human cells. CD36 functions as a scavenger receptor, facilitating the uptake and transport of long-chain fatty acids (FAs) across cell membranes, which is crucial for energy metabolism in tissues such as muscle, adipose tissue, and the intestine (Ibrahimi2002Role; Pepino2014StructureFunction). It is involved in the high-affinity uptake of FAs, contributing to lipid accumulation and metabolic processes, and is essential for the formation of chylomicrons in the intestine (Pepino2014StructureFunction).

CD36 is also involved in the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) in macrophages, which can lead to proinflammatory and proatherogenic responses (Silverstein2009CD36). In addition, CD36 acts as a receptor for thrombospondin-1 on microvascular endothelial cells, serving as a negative regulator of angiogenesis, which is important in processes like tumor growth and wound healing (Silverstein2009CD36).

The protein is expressed in various cell types, including adipocytes, myocytes, and enterocytes, and is involved in the regulation of phospholipase activity and eicosanoid formation, affecting cellular functions such as fat perception and myocardial rhythm adaptation (Pepino2014StructureFunction). CD36's role in sensory perception includes the detection of fatty acids in taste bud cells, influencing dietary preferences and preparing the digestive system for fat intake (Silverstein2009CD36).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD36 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. CD36 deficiency is categorized into two types: Type I, where CD36 is absent in both platelets and monocytes, and Type II, where it is absent only in platelets. Type I deficiency is often due to mutations such as C268T, 949insA, and 329-330delAC, and is more prevalent in Asian populations. This deficiency can lead to the development of anti-CD36 isoantibodies after transfusion or during pregnancy (Kashiwagi1994Identification; rac2007molecular). 

CD36 deficiency is linked to metabolic syndrome, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, and cardiomyopathy. It is associated with abnormal glucose metabolism, altered serum lipids, and increased risks of cardiomyopathy, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance (Hirano2003Pathophysiology; Madan2019Functionalization; LoveGregory2008Variants). 

Alterations in CD36 expression can affect platelet activation and thrombo-embolism risk, as CD36 interacts with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and thrombospondin-1. Variants in the CD36 gene have been linked to platelet count, volume, and lipid levels, influencing cardiovascular disease risk (Madan2019Functionalization; Ghosh2011Platelet). CD36's role in fatty acid uptake and metabolism also implicates it in conditions like insulin resistance and atherosclerosis (Febbraio1999A).

## Interactions
CD36 is a multifunctional glycoprotein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, playing significant roles in physiological and pathological processes. It acts as a receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), facilitating its internalization and degradation, which is crucial in the formation of foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions (Endemann1993CD36). CD36 also interacts with thrombospondin-1 on microvascular endothelial cells, serving as a negative regulator of angiogenesis (Silverstein2009CD36).

The protein is involved in signal transduction through the activation of Src family kinases and MAPKs, despite lacking intrinsic kinase or phosphatase activity. It forms dynamic signaling complexes, potentially facilitated by its localization in lipid raft domains (Silverstein2009CD36). CD36 interacts with other membrane receptors such as integrins, tetraspanins, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which may influence its signaling capabilities (Silverstein2009CD36).

CD36 also binds to the malaria parasite protein PfEMP1, specifically the CIDRa2-6 domains, which have evolved to target a concave hydrophobic pocket on CD36. This interaction is significant for the parasite's adherence to endothelial cells, highlighting the evolutionary pressure on PfEMP1 to maintain binding capabilities (Hsieh2016The).
