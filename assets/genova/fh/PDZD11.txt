# PDZD11

## Overview
PDZD11 is a gene that encodes the protein PDZ domain containing 11, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in epithelial cells. The protein functions as a scaffold, facilitating the stabilization and organization of cell junctions by interacting with transmembrane proteins through its PDZ domain. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment and stabilization of nectins at adherens junctions, which are essential for maintaining epithelial cell integrity and function (Guerrera2016PLEKHA7). Additionally, PDZ domain containing 11 plays a role in copper homeostasis by interacting with the Menkes ATPase ATP7A, aiding in its trafficking to the cell periphery (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5). The gene's expression has been linked to clinical conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma, where its upregulation correlates with poor prognosis (Chen2021Elevated).

## Function
PDZD11, also known as PISP or AIPP1, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the stabilization of nectins at adherens junctions (AJs) in epithelial cells. It acts as a scaffold for transmembrane proteins by binding through its PDZ domain to their PDZ-binding motifs. This interaction is essential for the recruitment and stabilization of nectins, which are critical for the formation and maintenance of AJs. Nectins initiate junction formation, which is later followed by E-cadherin, a key component of cell-cell adhesion (Guerrera2016PLEKHA7).

PDZD11 is recruited to AJs by PLEKHA7, forming a complex that is necessary for the efficient assembly of apical junctions in epithelial cells. This interaction is significant for organizing the junctional clustering of PDZ-interacting proteins and stabilizing major adhesion transmembrane proteins like cadherins and nectins, which are crucial for maintaining epithelial cell integrity and function (Guerrera2016PLEKHA7).

In addition to its role in cell junctions, PDZD11 is involved in copper homeostasis by interacting with the Menkes ATPase ATP7A. It facilitates the targeting of ATP7A to the cell periphery, which is essential for regulating copper levels within cells (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5).

## Clinical Significance
PDZD11 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). Studies have shown that PDZD11 mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in LIHC, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. This overexpression is associated with decreased promoter methylation and is positively correlated with TP53 mutation status, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism in cancer progression (Chen2021Elevated). The elevated expression of PDZD11 in LIHC is linked to poor overall survival and unfavorable 5-year survival rates, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Chen2021Elevated).

PDZD11 is also involved in the stabilization of nectins at adherens junctions, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial cell integrity. Alterations in PDZD11 expression or function can disrupt these junctions, potentially contributing to pathological conditions such as cancer metastasis (Guerrera2016PLEKHA7). Additionally, PDZD11 interacts with the human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (hSMVT), influencing biotin uptake in intestinal epithelial cells. Disruption of this interaction could affect nutrient absorption, although specific clinical implications are not detailed (Nabokina2011Association).

Overall, PDZD11's role in cellular signaling and structural organization highlights its importance in disease pathogenesis, particularly in cancer and potentially in other conditions involving epithelial cell junctions.

## Interactions
PDZD11 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the Menkes ATPase ATP7A, a key player in copper homeostasis. PDZD11 binds to the C-terminus of ATP7A, facilitating its trafficking to the cell periphery, which is essential for copper efflux. This interaction is enhanced by the WW domains of PLEKHA5, PLEKHA6, and PLEKHA7, which bind to the N-terminus of PDZD11, promoting ATP7A's efficient targeting to the plasma membrane under elevated copper conditions (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5).

PDZD11 also interacts with PLEKHA7 at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment and stabilization of nectins, which are important for junction assembly. The interaction involves the first WW domain of PLEKHA7 and the N-terminal 44 residues of PDZD11, known as the P7-ID (Guerrera2016PLEKHA7).

Additionally, PDZD11 interacts with the human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (hSMVT), enhancing its function and cell surface expression. This interaction is mediated by the PDZ binding domain of hSMVT, which is essential for biotin uptake in intestinal epithelial cells (Nabokina2011Association).
