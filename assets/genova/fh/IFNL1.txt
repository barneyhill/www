# IFNL1

## Overview
The IFNL1 gene encodes the protein interferon lambda 1, a member of the type III interferon family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system's antiviral defense mechanisms. As a cytokine, interferon lambda 1 primarily targets epithelial cells, such as those lining the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, to mediate immune responses against viral infections. The protein functions by binding to a specific receptor complex, triggering the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of interferon-stimulated genes that inhibit viral replication and modulate immune responses (Hemann2017Interferon; Syedbasha2017Interferon). The IFNL1 gene's expression is tightly regulated and is characterized by a delayed but sustained response compared to type I interferons, making it crucial for maintaining antiviral defenses at mucosal surfaces (Hemann2017Interferon). Additionally, genetic variations in IFNL1 have been linked to differences in immune response effectiveness, influencing susceptibility to viral infections and potentially serving as prognostic markers in certain diseases (Hemann2017Interferon; Wang2023Portraying).

## Structure
The IFNL1 protein, also known as interferon lambda 1, is a cytokine that belongs to the type III interferon family. Its primary structure is defined by a specific sequence of amino acids, which is essential for its biological activity. The secondary structure of IFNL1 typically includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of IFNL1 forms a three-dimensional shape that is crucial for its interaction with receptors and other molecules, often involving disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein's conformation.

In terms of quaternary structure, IFNL1 may undergo dimerization or interact with other proteins, which can influence its signaling capabilities and biological effects. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in IFNL1 and play a significant role in enhancing its stability and activity. These modifications can affect how the protein is recognized by receptors and its overall function within the immune response. The structural features of IFNL1, including its specific domains and potential for post-translational modifications, are integral to its role in mediating antiviral responses and modulating immune system activity.

## Function
Interferon lambda 1 (IFNL1) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. It is part of the type III interferon family and primarily acts on epithelial cells, such as those in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. IFNL1 functions by binding to a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of IFNLR1 and IL10R2, which is predominantly expressed on epithelial cells and certain myeloid cells (Hemann2017Interferon). This binding activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit viral replication and modulate immune responses (Hemann2017Interferon; Syedbasha2017Interferon).

In healthy human cells, IFNL1 is involved in the early innate immune response to viral infections, such as influenza, by inducing a paracrine signaling mechanism. This allows IFNL1 to activate neighboring uninfected cells, enhancing their antiviral state and protecting them from subsequent infections (Ramos2019Innate). The expression of IFNL1 is regulated by pattern recognition receptors and is characterized by a delayed but sustained induction compared to type I interferons, contributing to its role in maintaining antiviral defense at mucosal surfaces (Hemann2017Interferon).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IFNL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. IFNL1, part of the type III interferon family, plays a significant role in antiviral defense, and its dysregulation can impact immune responses. In the context of cancer, IFNL1 and related genes are upregulated in certain cancer patients, particularly those with poor prognosis. This upregulation is associated with cancer progression and immune evasion, suggesting that IFNL1 may serve as an independent prognostic marker for cancer (Wang2023Portraying).

In viral infections, IFNL1 is involved in the body's response to pathogens. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IFNL1 and related genes are associated with outcomes in viral infections, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and respiratory viruses. These genetic variations can influence the effectiveness of the immune response, potentially affecting susceptibility to infections (Hemann2017Interferon).

The expression of IFNL1 is also linked to immune cell interactions and the modulation of adaptive immunity, which can affect the Th1/Th2 balance. This balance is crucial for clearing viral infections and may be disrupted by alterations in IFNL1 expression (Chinnaswamy2016Gene–disease).
