# SYCE1L

## Overview
SYCE1L is a gene that encodes the synaptonemal complex central element protein 1 like, a protein involved in the formation and stabilization of the synaptonemal complex during meiosis. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the synaptonemal complex, which is essential for homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination. The synaptonemal complex is a proteinaceous structure that plays a critical role in ensuring accurate chromosomal segregation and genetic diversity through recombination. SYCE1L is related to other synaptonemal complex proteins, such as SYCE1, SYCE2, and SYCE3, which collectively contribute to the structural integrity and function of the complex (Qiu2020aarFDC). The specific interactions and functions of SYCE1L within this complex are not fully understood, but its association suggests a significant role in meiotic processes.
