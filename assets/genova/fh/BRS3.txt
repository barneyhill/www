# BRS3

## Overview
The BRS3 gene encodes the bombesin receptor subtype 3, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, typical of this receptor family. This receptor is involved in various physiological processes, particularly in the regulation of glucose and energy metabolism. BRS3 is expressed in several tissues, including pancreatic β-cells, skeletal muscle, and the central nervous system, where it influences insulin secretion, glucose uptake, and energy balance (Fathi1993BRS3:; Guo2015Bombesinlike; Feng2011Bombesin). In placental mammals, BRS3 exhibits constitutive activity, meaning it can activate intracellular signaling pathways without ligand binding, which distinguishes it from other bombesin receptors (Tang2019Constitutively). The receptor's role in energy homeostasis and its potential involvement in metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes underscore its clinical significance and make it a target for therapeutic interventions (Mogul2021Cre; Xiao2020BRS3).

## Structure
The BRS3 gene encodes a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) with a seven transmembrane structure, typical of this receptor family. The protein consists of 399 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 44.4 kDa (Fathi1993BRS3:). The primary structure includes two potential N-linked glycosylation sites at asparagine residues 10 and 18, suggesting that BRS3 may be a glycoprotein (Fathi1993BRS3:; Jensen2007International). 

The secondary structure is characterized by seven stretches of hydrophobic amino acids, indicative of the transmembrane helices common in GPCRs (Fathi1993BRS3:). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices to form the receptor's functional conformation. The receptor contains a consensus site for potential protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation in the third cytoplasmic loop, and the carboxyl terminus is rich in serine and threonine residues, which may serve as additional phosphorylation sites (Fathi1993BRS3:; Jensen2007International). 

The BRS3 receptor does not typically form quaternary structures as it is a single polypeptide chain. The genomic organization of the BRS3 gene includes three exons and two introns, similar to other bombesin receptor genes (Fathi1993BRS3:).

## Function
Bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3) is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in several physiological processes, particularly in glucose and energy metabolism. In healthy human cells, BRS-3 plays a crucial role in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic islets. Activation of BRS-3 by specific agonists enhances insulin secretion, which is vital for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Feng2011Bombesin). BRS-3 is highly expressed in pancreatic β-cells, where it influences insulin secretion in response to glucose, although it does not affect the insulin secretion stimulated by GLP-1 (Feng2011Bombesin).

BRS-3 is also involved in glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In skeletal muscle, BRS-3 activation increases the expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4), enhancing glucose transport and mimicking insulin effects on glucose metabolism (Guo2015Bombesinlike). In the central nervous system, BRS-3 is expressed in neurons containing orexin, which are important for regulating feeding behavior and energy balance (RamosÁlvarez2015Insights). BRS-3's role in these processes highlights its potential impact on energy homeostasis and metabolic health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the BRS3 gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes. In mice, the inactivation of the BRS3 gene leads to obesity, characterized by increased body weight, adiposity, and food intake, as well as reduced metabolic rate and body temperature (Mogul2021Cre; Xiao2020BRS3). These phenotypes suggest that BRS3 plays a critical role in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation. The BRS3 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that is involved in regulating sympathetic outflow, food intake, metabolic rate, body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and insulin secretion (Tang2019Constitutively). Alterations in BRS3 function can disrupt these processes, potentially contributing to conditions such as hypertension and insulin resistance (Xiao2020BRS3).

BRS3 is considered an orphan receptor in placental mammals, functioning in a ligand-independent manner due to evolutionary changes that have altered its binding sites (Tang2019Constitutively). This constitutive activity may represent a new group of GPCRs that remain orphan, complicating the understanding of its clinical significance. Despite these challenges, BRS3 remains a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at treating metabolic disorders (Piñol2018Brs3).

## Interactions
BRS3 (bombesin receptor subtype 3) is a G protein-coupled receptor that exhibits constitutive activity in placental mammals, meaning it can activate intracellular signaling pathways without the need for ligand binding. In placental mammals, BRS3 interacts with G proteins, specifically coupling with Gs, Gq, and G12 proteins, to mediate its signal transduction pathways. This interaction leads to the activation of various intracellular signaling cascades, including those involving calcium mobilization and ERK phosphorylation (Tang2019Constitutively).

In nonplacental vertebrates, BRS3 can be activated by the ligands gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin B (NMB), which bind to the receptor and trigger downstream signaling pathways. However, in placental mammals, evolutionary changes in key residues of BRS3 have resulted in the loss of binding affinity for these ligands, leading to its constitutive activity (Tang2019Constitutively).

The receptor's constitutive activity and its interactions with G proteins suggest that BRS3 may play a role in various physiological processes, including energy homeostasis and metabolism, although its precise functions and interactions in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated (Tang2019Constitutively; Zhang2013Anatomical).
