# FZD10

## Overview
FZD10, or Frizzled Class Receptor 10, is a gene that encodes a member of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral to the Wnt signaling pathway. The protein product of FZD10, Frizzled Class Receptor 10, is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs, facilitating its role in signal transduction. This receptor is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, by interacting with Wnt proteins. FZD10 is particularly significant in developmental contexts, such as neural and lung development, where it mediates specific Wnt signaling pathways. Additionally, alterations in FZD10 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Schulte2019Structural; Wang2005Wnt7b; Javed2021In).

## Structure
FZD10, a member of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. The primary structure of FZD10 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in GPCRs. The tertiary structure of FZD10 is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain, typical of GPCRs, which facilitates its role in signal transduction (Schulte2019Structural).

FZD10 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions with other proteins (Schulte2019Structural). These modifications are crucial for the receptor's activity and stability. The protein can exist in different splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and localization, allowing it to participate in diverse signaling pathways (Schulte2019Structural).

The Frizzled receptors, including FZD10, have a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that is important for ligand binding and receptor activation. This domain plays a significant role in the selectivity and specificity of Wnt ligand interactions, contributing to the receptor's ability to mediate various signaling pathways (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled).

## Function
FZD10, also known as Frizzled Class Receptor 10, is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, FZD10 functions as a cell surface receptor that is activated by Wnt proteins, playing a significant role in regulating cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and stem cell renewal (Javed2021In). 

FZD10 is particularly important in the context of neural development. It mediates Wnt1 activity in the developing spinal cord, influencing cell proliferation and neurogenesis. The expression of FZD10 overlaps with dorsal progenitor markers such as Pax3 and Pax7, and its knockdown results in decreased mitotic cells and inhibited expression of these dorsal genes, indicating its role in cell proliferation and dorso-ventral patterning (Alrefaei2019FZD10).

In lung development, FZD10 interacts with Wnt7b and the coreceptor LRP5 to activate canonical Wnt signaling, which is essential for the development of vascular smooth muscle cells and the integrity of vascular structures (Wang2005Wnt7b). FZD10 is primarily expressed in the distal airway epithelium during embryonic development, suggesting its involvement in lung airway and vascular development (Wang2005Wnt7b).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FZD10 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer (GC), high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), and glioma. In CRC and GC, FZD10 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It is found in exosomes from the plasma of patients, and its expression levels in exosomes correlate with those in cancer tissues. This suggests that exosome-delivered FZD10 could serve as a biomarker for these cancers (Scavo2021Exosome).

In HGSOC, high methylation of FZD10 is linked to better progression-free and overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker for chemotherapy response. Downregulation of FZD10 enhances sensitivity to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug, suggesting its role in chemoresistance (Tomar2017Methylome).

In glioma, FZD10 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to older age and tumor progression. High FZD10 expression correlates with worse clinical outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Huang2023Identification).

FZD10 is also involved in resistance to PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated epithelial ovarian cancers, where m6A modification of FZD10 mRNA contributes to drug resistance by enhancing Wnt/b-catenin signaling (Fukumoto2019N6Methylation).

## Interactions
FZD10, also known as Frizzled Class Receptor 10, is involved in various interactions within the Wnt signaling pathway. It acts as a receptor for several Wnt proteins, including Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and Wnt1, facilitating canonical Wnt signaling. FZD10 interacts with Wnt7b to activate signaling pathways in epithelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, particularly in the context of lung development. This interaction is enhanced by the presence of the LRP5 co-receptor, which cooperatively activates the signaling pathway, leading to increased β-catenin stabilization (Wang2005Wnt7b).

In chick limb development, FZD10 interacts specifically with Wnt7a, synergistically inducing the expression of Wnt-responsive genes such as Siamois and Xnr3. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression, highlighting FZD10's role in limb patterning (Kawakami2000Involvement).

FZD10 also plays a role in the developing spinal cord, where it mediates Wnt1-induced neurogenesis. It requires the LRP6 co-receptor for effective signaling, indicating a specific interaction that is essential for cell proliferation and neural tube patterning (Alrefaei2019FZD10). These interactions underscore FZD10's involvement in key developmental processes through its participation in the Wnt signaling pathway.
