# MAB21L3

## Overview
MAB21L3 is a gene that encodes the mab-21 like 3 protein, which is a member of the mab-21 family of proteins. This protein is involved in various developmental processes, including cell differentiation and organogenesis. The mab-21 like 3 protein is characterized by its role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the eyes and neural tissues. It functions as a transcriptional regulator, influencing the expression of other genes critical for developmental pathways. Mutations or dysregulation of MAB21L3 have been associated with developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in normal physiological processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
