# MROH6

## Overview
The MROH6 gene encodes the protein maestro heat-like repeat family member 6, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by the presence of heat-like repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the MROH6 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific functions of the MROH6 protein are not fully elucidated, its involvement in cellular pathways related to inflammation and cancer has been suggested. The gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, including its downregulation in response to carfilzomib therapy in HLA-sensitized patients and its association with interleukin-18 levels in acute coronary syndromes (Woodle2020Proteasomal; Johansson2015NLRC4). Further research is needed to clarify the precise biological roles and clinical significance of MROH6.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the MROH6 gene is currently under investigation, with several studies suggesting its involvement in various conditions. In the context of carfilzomib therapy for HLA-sensitized patients, MROH6 was identified as one of the most downregulated genes in bone marrow plasma cells, indicating a potential role in the cells' survival and response to treatment (Woodle2020Proteasomal). Additionally, a genome-wide association study identified a significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the MROH6 gene associated with interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels in patients with acute coronary syndromes, suggesting a possible link between MROH6 and inflammatory processes (Johansson2015NLRC4).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma, MROH6 was found to be enriched in patients without perineural invasion, although its specific clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Kuk2024Prognostic). Furthermore, in acute myeloid leukemia, MROH6 is part of a gene signature used to assess leukemia stem cell activity, indicating its potential involvement in cancer cell self-renewal and survival (Massett2021A). These findings highlight the need for further research to fully understand the clinical implications of MROH6 gene alterations.
