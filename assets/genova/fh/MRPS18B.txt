# MRPS18B

## Overview
The MRPS18B gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18B, a crucial component of the 28S small subunit of the 55S mammalian mitoribosomes. This protein is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for the oxidative phosphorylation complex, which is vital for cellular energy production (Silva2022Chagas). As a zinc-binding protein, mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18B plays a non-redundant role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis (Cheong2020Expression). Beyond its primary function in mitochondrial translation, MRPS18B is involved in various protein-protein interactions, suggesting additional roles in cellular processes such as stress response and cell cycle regulation (Revathi2021Expression). Mutations in MRPS18B have been linked to metabolic disturbances and diseases, including Chagas disease and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Silva2022Chagas).

## Function
The MRPS18B gene encodes a protein that is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the 28S small subunit of the 55S mammalian mitoribosomes. This protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, which is essential for the production of proteins that form the oxidative phosphorylation complex (OX-PHOS), a key component in cellular energy production (Silva2022Chagas). MRPS18B is involved in the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, a process crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis in cells (Silva2022Chagas).

In healthy human cells, MRPS18B functions as part of the machinery that ensures proper mitochondrial function and energy production. It is a zinc-binding protein and contributes to mitochondrial translation, which is vital for the synthesis of proteins necessary for mitochondrial operations (Silva2022Chagas). The protein's role in the mitoribosome is non-redundant, highlighting its unique contribution to mitochondrial function (Cheong2020Expression). Mutations in MRPS18B can lead to metabolic and energy disturbances due to deficiencies in mitochondrial protein synthesis, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular health (Silva2022Chagas).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MRPS18B gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly Chagas disease and several types of cancer. In Chagas disease, a specific variant of MRPS18B, 688C > G (P230A), is associated with the digestive form known as chagasic megaesophagus (CME). This variant is linked to increased nitro-oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) stimulation, suggesting a role in the disease's progression by exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction (Silva2022Chagas).

In cancer, MRPS18B is considered an oncogene, with its overexpression linked to tumorigenic processes. It has been shown to interact with the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA-6), promoting cell cycle entry and transformation in cancer cells. This overexpression is associated with increased cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), particularly in prostate cancer, where it enhances migratory ability through the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Mushtaq2018The). MRPS18B is also implicated in endometrial and breast cancers, where its expression correlates with disease stage and metastatic potential, suggesting its utility as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Bacon2024Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
MRPS18B, a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that suggest roles beyond its primary function in mitochondrial protein synthesis. The protein has been shown to interact with several non-mitoribosomal proteins, indicating potential extramitochondrial functions. Notably, MRPS18B interacts with the proto-oncogene ROS1 and the circadian rhythm-related protein NPAS2, suggesting involvement in diverse cellular processes (Revathi2021Expression). 

MRPS18B also interacts with a range of heat shock proteins, including HSPA8, HSPA1L, HSPA2, HSPA5, HSPA6, HSPA1A, and HSPA7, which are known for their roles in protein folding and stress responses (Revathi2021Expression). These interactions imply that MRPS18B may participate in cellular stress response mechanisms. 

Furthermore, MRPS18B has been implicated in tumorigenic processes through its interaction with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction suggests a role in p53-related pathways, which are critical in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Revathi2021Expression). The protein's interaction with Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA6) also indicates a potential role in cell cycle regulation by competing with the E2F transcription factor for binding to Retinoblastoma (Revathi2021Expression).
