# SEPHS1

## Overview
SEPHS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme selenophosphate synthetase 1, which plays a pivotal role in selenium metabolism and redox homeostasis. Unlike its paralog SEPHS2, SEPHS1 is not a selenoprotein and does not directly participate in selenoprotein synthesis. Instead, it is involved in the synthesis of selenophosphate, a selenium donor crucial for the production of selenoproteins with oxidoreductase functions. These proteins are essential for managing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and preventing oxidative stress. SEPHS1 is highly expressed in human embryonic stem cells and is vital for cell survival and pluripotency acquisition through its regulation of ROS pathways. Additionally, SEPHS1 interacts with various cellular pathways, including the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway, and is implicated in diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma and osteoarthritis, where its expression levels influence disease progression and cellular homeostasis (Yang2021SEPHS1; Kang2022Selenophosphate; Mariotti2015Evolution).

## Structure
The SEPHS1 protein, also known as selenophosphate synthetase 1, is involved in selenium metabolism. It is a paralog of SEPHS2 and evolved through gene duplication during metazoan evolution. SEPHS1 is present in vertebrates and insects, carrying threonine in vertebrates and arginine in insects instead of selenocysteine, which is found in SEPHS2 (Mariotti2015Evolution; Santesmasses2022Selenocysteine).

Structurally, SEPHS1 shares significant similarities with SEPHS2, as indicated by its use as a template in molecular modeling studies of SEPHS2 due to a 73% sequence identity in a specific region (Nunziata2019Structural). The protein likely includes α-helices and β-sheets, similar to SEPHS2, which has been modeled to contain these secondary structures (Nunziata2019Structural). The tertiary structure of SEPHS1 is not explicitly detailed, but it is implied to have a conserved fold similar to other selenophosphate synthetases, which typically exhibit an aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase (AIRS)-like fold (da2020Trypanosomatid).

SEPHS1 is not a selenoprotein and does not participate in selenoprotein synthesis, suggesting its function may be related to redox homeostasis regulation rather than direct involvement in selenocysteine biosynthesis (Mariotti2015Evolution; da2020Trypanosomatid).

## Function
Selenophosphate synthetase 1 (SEPHS1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining redox homeostasis and cellular antioxidant defense in healthy human cells. It is involved in the synthesis of selenophosphate, a selenium donor essential for the production of selenoproteins, which contain the amino acid selenocysteine. These selenoproteins have oxidoreductase functions that are crucial for managing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and preventing oxidative stress (Kang2022Selenophosphate).

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), SEPHS1 is highly expressed and is essential for the acquisition of pluripotency, although it does not directly regulate pluripotency gene expression. Instead, it influences cell survival by regulating ROS pathways and apoptosis (Lee2019The). SEPHS1's role in redox signaling is also significant in chondrocytes, where it helps prevent oxidative stress and cellular senescence, thereby maintaining cartilage homeostasis and potentially preventing osteoarthritis (Kang2022Selenophosphate).

SEPHS1 is active in the cytoplasm and supports the synthesis of stress-related selenoproteins, such as GPX1, SELENOW, and MSRB1, which protect cells from oxidative damage (Kang2022Selenophosphate). Its deficiency can lead to increased ROS levels and contribute to various pathologies, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress (Kang2022Selenophosphate).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SEPHS1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SEPHS1 is overexpressed, particularly in advanced stages, and is associated with poor prognosis. This overexpression promotes the expression of SMAD2/3/4 proteins, which are involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway, contributing to cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Knockdown of SEPHS1 in HCC cells reduces cell migration and invasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in HCC (Yang2021SEPHS1).

In osteoarthritis (OA), SEPHS1 expression is significantly downregulated in cartilage, leading to increased oxidative stress and cellular senescence in chondrocytes. This deficiency exacerbates OA symptoms, including cartilage destruction and inflammation, by disrupting redox homeostasis. The deficiency also results in increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cartilage-degrading enzymes, highlighting its role in OA pathogenesis (Kang2022Selenophosphate).

SEPHS1 deficiency during early embryogenesis in mice leads to developmental abnormalities and embryonic lethality. The deficiency causes increased reactive oxygen species levels, disrupting critical signaling pathways and resulting in growth retardation and structural abnormalities (Bang2021Identification).

## Interactions
SEPHS1 (selenophosphate synthetase 1) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It forms a complex with SEPHS2 and Sec synthase (SEPSECS), which is essential for the formation of Sec tRNA, a critical component in selenoprotein synthesis (Kang2022Selenophosphate). This interaction highlights SEPHS1's role in the selenium metabolic pathway, which is vital for maintaining redox homeostasis and preventing oxidative stress.

In the context of osteoarthritis, SEPHS1 deficiency leads to impaired synthesis of stress-related selenoproteins such as GPX1, SELENOW, and MSRB1, which have oxidoreductase functions. This deficiency results in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, contributing to DNA damage and cellular senescence in chondrocytes (Kang2022Selenophosphate). The interactions of SEPHS1 with these selenoproteins underscore its importance in regulating oxidative stress and maintaining cartilage integrity.

SEPHS1 also interacts with the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It acts as a positive regulator of SMAD proteins, enhancing the expression of SMAD2/3/4, which are key mediators of TGF-β signaling. This interaction promotes HCC cell migration and invasion, linking SEPHS1 to cancer progression (Yang2021SEPHS1).
