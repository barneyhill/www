# USP9Y

## Overview
The USP9Y gene, located on the Y chromosome, encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 9 Y-linked, which is a deubiquitinating enzyme. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by removing ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability and preventing their degradation. The USP9Y protein is characterized by a ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase domain, essential for its enzymatic activity, and a novel domain with a β-grasp fold that may aid in its cellular localization. It is particularly significant in the context of male fertility, as it is involved in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. Mutations or deletions in the USP9Y gene can lead to male infertility, although some studies suggest that it may not be essential for normal fertility, as evidenced by cases of normospermic men with complete deletions of the gene (Lee2003Ubiquitinspecific; Luddi2009Spermatogenesis).

## Structure
The USP9Y gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein turnover by removing ubiquitin from ubiquitinated proteins, thereby preventing their degradation. The protein structure of USP9Y includes several distinct domains and features. It contains a ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a key process in spermatogenesis (Ginalski2004Protein).

The USP9Y protein also features a novel domain with a β-grasp fold, characteristic of ubiquitin-like proteins, located in its N-terminal region. This domain may facilitate the targeting of USP9Y to specific cellular locations, potentially interacting with ubiquitin-binding sites on the proteasome (Ginalski2004Protein). The protein's structure includes four cysteine residues in the Fingers domain, which may coordinate a zinc ion, forming a zinc ribbon-like structure. Additionally, three long α-helical regions are predicted to form a right-handed superhelical structure (Ginalski2004Protein).

Mutations in the USP9Y gene can lead to male infertility by disrupting its structure and function, as evidenced by the deleterious effects of certain non-synonymous SNPs on protein stability (Nailwal2017Analysis).

## Function
The USP9Y gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein turnover by removing ubiquitin from specific protein substrates. This activity is essential for maintaining protein stability and regulating various cellular processes, including protein degradation, localization, and activity (Lee2003Ubiquitinspecific; Nailwal2017Analysis). USP9Y is particularly important in the context of male fertility, as it is involved in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. The gene's function in this process is linked to its ability to stabilize specific target proteins through de-ubiquitination, which is critical for the development of male germ cells (Lee2003Ubiquitinspecific).

In healthy human cells, USP9Y is active in testicular cells, where it contributes to maintaining protein homeostasis. The enzyme's activity is specific to ubiquitin, as it does not exhibit protease activity for other ubiquitin-like proteins such as NEDD8 (Lee2003Ubiquitinspecific). Mutations in USP9Y can disrupt its function, potentially leading to male infertility due to impaired protein regulation (Nailwal2017Analysis). Despite its critical role in spermatogenesis, some studies suggest that USP9Y may not be essential for normal fertility, as evidenced by cases of normospermic men with complete deletions of the gene (Luddi2009Spermatogenesis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deletions in the USP9Y gene are associated with male infertility, particularly conditions such as azoospermia and oligozoospermia. These conditions are characterized by a failure in spermatogenesis, which is the process of sperm cell development. The USP9Y gene, located on the Y chromosome, encodes a protein with ubiquitin-specific protease activity, crucial for the de-ubiquitination process that stabilizes proteins necessary for male germ cell development (Lee2003Ubiquitinspecific). Deletions of USP9Y have been observed in infertile males, leading to its designation as a male infertility gene (Lee2003Ubiquitinspecific). 

In cases of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a genetic disorder often linked to Y chromosome microdeletions, mutations or deletions in USP9Y are implicated, although specific polymorphisms in the gene do not significantly increase the risk of NOA (Kalhor2021The). The gene's role in male infertility is further supported by studies showing that its deletion or mutation can lead to a partial arrest of spermatogenesis at the spermatocyte stage, with few post-meiotic germ cells (Lee2003Ubiquitinspecific). 

While USP9Y mutations have been linked to male infertility, there is no direct association with tumorigenesis, although its allele, USP9X, has been implicated in various malignancies (Zhu2015Clinical).
