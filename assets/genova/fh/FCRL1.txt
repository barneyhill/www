# FCRL1

## Overview
FCRL1 (Fc receptor-like 1) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly expressed on B cells. The protein, also referred to as FCRL1, is characterized by its three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequences, which are crucial for its role in B cell signaling and activation (Mamidi2023FCRL1; Davis2007Fc). FCRL1 functions as a co-activating receptor, enhancing B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and modulating immune responses through interactions with various intracellular signaling molecules, including the kinase c-Abl (Zhao2019Fc). The gene's expression is tightly regulated during B cell development, with implications in both normal immune function and pathological conditions such as B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases (Mamidi2023FCRL1).

## Structure
The FCRL1 protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein primarily expressed on B cells. It features three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains in humans, organized in a tandem membrane-distal to membrane-proximal arrangement, which is conserved among FCRL molecules (Mamidi2023FCRL1; Davis2007Fc). The transmembrane region of FCRL1 contains a charged glutamic acid residue, which is unique to humans and suggests potential interaction with transmembrane adaptor proteins via a salt bridge (Mamidi2023FCRL1; Davis2007Fc).

The cytoplasmic tail of FCRL1 is notable for its length and contains seven tyrosines in humans, with sequences resembling immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which are important for signaling (Mamidi2023FCRL1). These ITAM-like sequences differ between species, with variations in the residues at the +3 position relative to the tyrosines (Mamidi2023FCRL1). The Y281ENV motif within the cytoplasmic tail serves as a docking site for the SH2 domain of the kinase c-Abl, enhancing B cell activation and function (Zhao2019Fc).

FCRL1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, and exists in multiple splice isoforms, which may affect its structure and function (Davis2007Fc).

## Function
FCRL1 (Fc receptor-like 1) is a protein primarily expressed in B cells, where it plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses. It is involved in B cell activation and proliferation by enhancing B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. FCRL1 is equipped with cytoplasmic ITAM-like elements, which suggest its role in modulating B cell regulation through the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing molecules (Davis2007Fc). Upon BCR engagement, FCRL1 is phosphorylated at the Y281 residue, creating a docking site for the kinase c-Abl, which enhances B cell activation and proliferation (Zhao2019Fc).

FCRL1 is expressed on naïve and memory B cells and is involved in the formation of the BCR signalosome, modulating B cell signaling and promoting humoral responses (Mamidi2023FCRL1). It enhances calcium flux when co-ligated with the BCR, indicating its role as a co-activating receptor in B cells (Mamidi2023FCRL1). FCRL1's expression peaks on naïve B cells and declines during Ig diversification and affinity maturation, reemerging on memory B cells at lower levels (Mamidi2023FCRL1). This expression pattern suggests that FCRL1 is tightly regulated during distinct stages of B cell development, influencing later steps of maturation and terminal differentiation (Mamidi2023FCRL1).

## Clinical Significance
The FCRL1 gene has been implicated in various B cell malignancies and autoimmune conditions due to its role in B cell regulation and signaling. In aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), particularly diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), FCRL1 is overexpressed, correlating with worse disease progression and survival outcomes. This overexpression suggests that FCRL1 could serve as a biomarker for aggressive lymphomas and a potential target for immunotherapy, especially in cases where other B cell antigens are downregulated or lost (Mamidi2023FCRL1).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), FCRL1 is expressed on all CD19+ CD5+ leukemic cells at moderate to high levels, indicating its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (Davis2007Fc). However, studies have shown significant down-regulation of FCRL1 in B-CLL patients compared to normal subjects, suggesting a complex role in the disease's molecular pathology (Kazemi2008Fc).

FCRL1's expression is also associated with B cell activation in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, where it is elevated in acute hepatitis B patients, indicating its role in amplifying B-cell receptor-induced activation (Wang2012Overexpression). Despite these associations, specific mutations in FCRL1 and their direct clinical significance remain underexplored.

## Interactions
FCRL1 interacts with several proteins that play significant roles in B cell signaling and activation. One of the key interactions is with the Abelson tyrosine kinase (c-Abl), which is recruited to FCRL1 through the phosphorylated Y281ENV motif in its cytoplasmic tail. This interaction enhances B cell activation and proliferation by facilitating the recruitment of c-Abl as an intracellular effector molecule (Zhao2019Fc). The Y281 residue is crucial for this interaction, as mutations in this motif result in a loss of binding affinity for c-Abl (Zhao2019Fc).

FCRL1 also interacts with other signaling molecules such as GRB2, SHIP-1, and SOS1. GRB2 remains associated with FCRL1 upon BCR stimulation, while SHIP-1 binds weakly, and SOS1 is not detected. GRB2 may serve as a docking site for SHIP-1 and SOS1, facilitating indirect associations with FCRL1 (Mamidi2023FCRL1). These interactions suggest that FCRL1 acts as a proximal regulator with variable effects on B cell signaling, depending on the context and the specific proteins involved (Mamidi2023FCRL1).
