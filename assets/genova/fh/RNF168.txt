# RNF168

## Overview
RNF168 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 168, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. This protein is primarily involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by facilitating the ubiquitination of histones, which is crucial for the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of damage. The RNF168 protein contains a RING domain, which is essential for its E3 ligase activity, and additional domains that enable its interaction with other proteins involved in DNA repair. These interactions are vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing the onset of genetic disorders. Mutations in the RNF168 gene are linked to RIDDLE syndrome, a condition characterized by radiosensitivity and immunodeficiency, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in human health (Kelliher2021New; Doil2009RNF168; Stewart2009The).

## Structure
RNF168 is a protein characterized by a well-defined structural architecture that includes several distinct functional domains. At the N terminus, it contains a RING domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and substrate specificity. This domain features an arginine-rich region that interacts with the nucleosome's acidic patch, facilitating the ubiquitination of histone H2A at lysines K13 and K15 (Kelliher2021New; Horn2019Structural). The RING domain's interaction with the nucleosome is essential for the DNA damage response, as it directs the E2 enzyme towards the target lysines (Horn2019Structural).

RNF168 also contains two ubiquitin-dependent double-strand break (DSB) recruitment modules, UDM1 and UDM2. UDM1 includes motifs such as LRM1, UMI, and MIU1, which are important for binding to ubiquitinated RNF8 and K63-linked ubiquitin chains. UDM2 comprises UAD, MIU2, and LRM2, with MIU2 playing a key role in recognizing distal K63 chains and facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to damaged chromatin (Kelliher2021New).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which are critical for its function in the DNA damage response pathway (Kelliher2021New). RNF168's domains are highly conserved across vertebrates, indicating their evolutionary importance (Kelliher2021New).

## Function
RNF168 is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by ubiquitinating histones H2A and H2AX. This ubiquitination creates a scaffold for the recruitment of DNA repair proteins, such as 53BP1 and BRCA1, to the sites of damage, thereby promoting the assembly of repair complexes necessary for maintaining genomic stability (Kelliher2021New; Doil2009RNF168).

RNF168 operates downstream of RNF8, amplifying the ubiquitination signal at DSBs, which is essential for the retention of repair proteins at these sites (Doil2009RNF168). It forms K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are crucial for modulating chromatin structure and facilitating DNA repair processes (Pinato2009RNF168). RNF168 also influences homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by regulating the recruitment of repair factors, thus playing a dual role in both DNA repair and chromatin modification (Kelliher2021New).

In addition to its role in DDR, RNF168 is involved in regulating promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, affecting their ubiquitylation and SUMOylation status, which is important for various cellular processes, including DNA repair (Shire2016Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNF168 gene are associated with RIDDLE syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, dysmorphic features, and learning difficulties. This condition results from biallelic mutations in RNF168, which lead to impaired DNA damage response due to defective recruitment of repair proteins like 53BP1 and BRCA1 to DNA double-strand breaks (Kelliher2021New; Stewart2009The). Specific mutations, such as a duplication of a G nucleotide at position 397 and a deletion of nucleotides 1323-1326, result in frameshifted mRNAs and aberrant RNF168 proteins, contributing to the syndrome's pathology (Stewart2009The).

RNF168 deficiency can mimic the radiosensitivity syndrome of ataxia-telangiectasia, presenting with symptoms like ataxia, telangiectasia, elevated alpha-fetoprotein, and immunodeficiency (Devgan2011Homozygous). The absence of RNF168 protein disrupts the ubiquitylation cascade necessary for DNA repair, leading to defective DNA damage checkpoints (Devgan2011Homozygous).

Alterations in RNF168 expression or function may also contribute to cancer progression. Its role in maintaining genomic stability suggests that RNF168 might act as a tumor suppressor, with potential links to lymphoid malignancies and breast cancer (Kelliher2021New; Devgan2011Homozygous; Stewart2009The).

## Interactions
RNF168 is a ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the DNA damage response by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is involved in the recruitment of key DNA repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. RNF168 interacts with 53BP1, facilitating its recruitment to double-strand breaks (DSBs) and promoting non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) while suppressing homologous recombination (HR) (Kelliher2021New). It also interacts with BRCA1, influencing HR function, and recruits PALB2 and RAD18 to DNA damage sites, supporting HR independent of BRCA1 (Kelliher2021New; Luijsterburg2017A).

RNF168's interaction with PALB2 is direct, mediated by the C-terminal PALB2-Interacting Domain (PID) of RNF168 and the WD40 domain of PALB2, which is crucial for PALB2's recruitment to DSBs (Luijsterburg2017A). RNF168 also interacts with RNF8, as its recruitment to DSBs is dependent on RNF8-generated ubiquitin conjugates (Doil2009RNF168). The RING domain of RNF168 is essential for its E3 ligase activity, directing ubiquitination of histone H2A at lysines 13 and 15, which is critical for the recruitment of repair proteins (Horn2019Structural). These interactions highlight RNF168's central role in orchestrating the assembly of repair protein complexes at sites of DNA damage.
