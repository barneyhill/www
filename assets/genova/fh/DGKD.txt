# DGKD

## Overview
Diacylglycerol kinase delta (DGKD) is a gene that encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase delta, a member of the kinase family involved in lipid signaling pathways. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by catalyzing the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid (PA), both of which are critical lipid signaling molecules. DGKD is expressed ubiquitously across various tissues and is involved in regulating key intracellular signaling pathways that influence cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein exists in two main isoforms, DGKδ1 and DGKδ2, which differ in their molecular structure and regulatory functions. These isoforms share common structural domains, such as the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which are essential for their subcellular localization and function. DGKD is implicated in several physiological processes, including the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway and glucose metabolism, and is associated with various diseases, such as type II diabetes, epilepsy, and certain cancers (Gravina2023Role; Shulga2011Regulation; Sakai2012Recent).

## Structure
The human diacylglycerol kinase delta (DGKD) gene encodes a protein involved in lipid signaling, converting diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid. DGKD has two main splice variants, DGKδ1 and DGKδ2, which differ in their molecular structure and regulatory functions. DGKδ1 is composed of 1169 amino acids with a molecular mass of 130 kDa, while DGKδ2 consists of 1214 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 135 kDa (Sakane2002Alternative; Sakai2012Recent).

Both isoforms share common structural features, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the N-terminus and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain at the C-terminus, which are crucial for their subcellular localization and oligomerization (Sakane2002Alternative; Sakai2012Recent). The SAM domain forms helical polymers, which are important for retaining the enzyme in cytoplasmic puncta and inhibiting its activity at the plasma membrane until pathway activation (Knight2010Zinc).

DGKδ2 has a unique N-terminal region with Pro-rich and Glu/Asp-rich sequences, which are absent in DGKδ1 (Sakane2002Alternative). This region is responsible for the distinct cellular distribution and response to stimuli of DGKδ2 (Sakane2002Alternative). The PH domain is essential for TPA-dependent translocation, a feature that is inhibited in DGKδ2 due to its specific N-terminal sequence (Sakane2002Alternative).

## Function
Diacylglycerol kinase delta (DGKD) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular signaling by converting diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic acid (PA), both of which are important lipid signaling molecules. This conversion is crucial for regulating intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Shulga2011Regulation; Sakai2012Recent). DGKD is a type II diacylglycerol kinase and is expressed ubiquitously in various tissues, including skeletal muscle and testis (Shirai2014Diacylglycerol).

DGKD is involved in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. It acts as a positive regulator by modulating protein kinase C (PKC) activity, which influences EGFR expression and activity (Shulga2011Regulation; Sakai2012Recent). In DGKD-deficient cells, there is enhanced ubiquitination of EGFR due to decreased expression of ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8), affecting EGFR degradation and signaling (Sim2020Beyond).

DGKD also plays a role in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling. It is implicated in glucose-induced insulin resistance, with reduced expression and activity observed in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic patients (Shulga2011Regulation). The enzyme's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its translocation to the plasma membrane, a process essential for its function in lipid metabolism (Shirai2014Diacylglycerol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DGKD gene are implicated in several diseases. In type II diabetes, DGKD is associated with insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. Reduced levels of DGKD are observed in the skeletal muscle of patients, leading to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. DGKD haploinsufficient mice also exhibit these metabolic dysfunctions, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes (Sakai2012Recent; Sakai2014Diacylglycerol).

In epilepsy, a translocation disrupting DGKD is linked to seizures, with DGKD expression noted in neurons of the neocortex and hippocampus (Sakai2012Recent). This suggests a potential role in neuronal function and seizure susceptibility.

DGKD is also involved in cancer, particularly through its role in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. Elevated DGKD expression is observed in certain cancerous cell lines, such as lung carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma, suggesting its involvement in carcinogenesis (Sakai2012Recent). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DGKD is overexpressed, although its expression does not significantly correlate with patient survival, indicating a complex role in AML biology (Gravina2023Role).

## Interactions
Diacylglycerol kinase delta (DGKD) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. DGKD interacts with various protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, including conventional PKCα and novel PKC isozymes such as PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCζ. These interactions lead to the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in its inactivation and degradation (Sakai2012Recent). DGKD also plays a role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis by interacting with AP2α, a subunit of the adaptor protein complex AP-2, and RACK1, a scaffolding protein. DGKD recruits RACK1 to clathrin-coated vesicles, suggesting its involvement in EGFR regulation through endocytosis (Sakai2012Recent).

Despite being part of the diacylglycerol kinase family, DGKD does not strongly interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins, as its PDZ-binding motifs (PBMs) are likely nonfunctional in terms of PDZ domain binding. This contrasts with other DGK family members that show promiscuous binding with PDZ proteins (Zambo2023Comparative). The interactions of DGKD with nucleic acids or other proteins outside these contexts are not detailed in the available literature.
