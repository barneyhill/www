# TLE6

## Overview
TLE6 is a gene that encodes the protein TLE family member 6, which is a crucial component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) in mammalian oocytes and early embryos. The TLE6 protein belongs to the transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) family and is characterized by its WD40 repeat domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. Unlike other TLE family members, TLE6 lacks certain domains involved in transcriptional repression, suggesting a unique role in cellular processes. It is involved in critical functions such as meiotic spindle positioning, mitochondria redistribution, and zygotic epigenetic reprogramming, which are essential for pre-implantation embryonic development (Lin2020Expanding; Yu2022Roles). Mutations in the TLE6 gene have been linked to female infertility, highlighting its significance in reproductive health (Akbari2022A).

## Structure
The TLE6 protein is a member of the transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) family and is distinct due to its short length and unique sequence. It consists of 581 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 65 kDa (Mao2021A). TLE6 contains five tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat units, which are characteristic of the WD40 repeat domain. This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for the protein's function within the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) (Zhang2021Identification).

Unlike other TLE family members, TLE6 lacks domains involved in Groucho/TLE oligomerization and specific transcription factor binding, suggesting it may not form heterodimers with other TLE proteins and might interact with other proteins independently (Mao2021A). The protein is a substrate of protein kinase A (PKA) during oocyte maturation, indicating that phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification that influences its function (Zhang2021Identification).

The absence of TLE6 affects the formation of the F-actin cytoskeleton, leading to asymmetric cleavage and early embryonic arrest, highlighting its role in maintaining the stability and function of the SCMC (Zhang2021Identification).

## Function
TLE6 is a crucial component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which is specifically expressed in mammalian oocytes and early embryos. This complex is essential for pre-implantation embryonic development, playing a significant role in various cellular processes such as meiotic spindle positioning, mitochondria redistribution, translation regulation, and zygotic epigenetic reprogramming (Lin2020Expanding). TLE6 is highly expressed in the reproductive system and is involved in oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryogenesis by regulating cell division and maintaining genomic stability (Yu2022Roles). Unlike other TLE family proteins, TLE6 lacks certain domains involved in transcriptional suppression, which may influence its specific functions in the reproductive system (Yu2022Roles).

In the context of pancreas development, TLE6, also known as Grg6, is noted for its role in antagonizing interactions with other proteins, potentially limiting or preventing target gene repression during developmental transitions (Hoffman2008Expression). TLE6's expression peaks during specific embryonic stages, indicating its involvement in developmental processes (Hoffman2008Expression). These functions underscore TLE6's importance in maintaining cellular and developmental integrity in early human development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TLE6 gene are associated with female infertility, particularly in cases involving recurrent failures of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These mutations can lead to conditions such as preimplantation embryonic lethality (PEL) and embryonic developmental arrest (EDA), which are characterized by early embryonic arrest and poor-quality embryos (Lin2020Expanding; Zhang2021Identification; Akbari2022A). 

In several studies, novel mutations in TLE6, including homozygous missense mutations and compound heterozygous variants, have been identified in families with a history of female infertility. These mutations often result in impaired protein function, leading to embryonic arrest and high fragmentation rates, with embryos failing to form blastocysts (Zhang2021Identification; Mao2021A). 

The TLE6 gene is crucial for early embryonic development as part of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which regulates cell division and development in embryos. Disruptions in TLE6 function due to mutations can impair oocyte maturation and fertilization, contributing to infertility (Duncan2014TransducinLike; Zhang2021Identification). These findings underscore the importance of TLE6 in reproductive outcomes and its potential role in genetic diagnoses related to infertility.

## Interactions
TLE6 is a component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which is essential for early embryonic development. It interacts with other maternal effect proteins such as NLRP5 and PADI6, which are also part of the SCMC. These interactions are crucial for processes like spindle assembly and migration during oocyte maturation (Duncan2014TransducinLike; Zhang2021Identification). TLE6's role in the SCMC involves its phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), which is necessary for proper oocyte maturation and embryonic development. This phosphorylation affects TLE6's binding to other SCMC proteins, influencing spindle assembly and F-actin cytoskeleton formation (Zhang2021Identification).

TLE6 also interacts with transcription factors through its conserved WD-repeat domain, which is critical for protein-protein interactions. Although specific interactions involving TLE6 are not detailed, this domain is known to mediate interactions with various transcription factors (Jennings2008The; Yu2022Roles). TLE6's interactions within the SCMC and with other proteins highlight its significant role in regulating meiotic progression and early embryonic development (Duncan2014TransducinLike).
