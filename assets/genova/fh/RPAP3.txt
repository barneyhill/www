# RPAP3

## Overview
RPAP3 is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase II-associated protein 3, a critical component of the R2TP co-chaperone complex. This protein is involved in the assembly and stabilization of various macromolecular complexes, including RNA polymerase II, small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinases (PIKKs) (Rodríguez2020RPAP3; Boulon2010HSP90). The RPAP3 protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate interactions with molecular chaperones such as HSP90 and HSP70, playing a pivotal role in protein homeostasis and transcription regulation (Rodríguez2020RPAP3; Martino2018RPAP3). Additionally, RPAP3's involvement in the R2TP/PAQosome complex underscores its significance in cellular processes and its potential implications in oncogenesis, making it a subject of interest in cancer research (Kakihara2020R2TPPAQosome).

## Structure
The RPAP3 protein is a component of the human R2TP complex and plays a crucial role in its assembly and function. It is a large, multi-domain protein with a molecular weight of approximately 75 kDa and consists of 665 amino acids (Rodríguez2020RPAP3; Henri2018Deep). RPAP3 contains two tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains in its N-terminal region, which are responsible for binding to HSP90, with the first TPR domain showing a higher affinity for HSP90 than the second (Rodríguez2020RPAP3; Henri2018Deep).

The C-terminal region of RPAP3, known as the RUVBL2-binding domain (RBD), is composed of eight α-helices and interacts with the ATPase face of RUVBL2 in the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ring, which is essential for the assembly of the R2TP complex (Rodríguez2020RPAP3; Martino2018RPAP3). This domain is structurally characterized by cryo-EM and NMR techniques (Rodríguez2020RPAP3).

RPAP3 exists in at least two isoforms due to alternative splicing, with isoform 1 being 34 residues longer than isoform 2. This additional sequence in isoform 1 is crucial for binding with PIH1D1, another component of the R2TP complex (Henri2018Deep). The protein is also known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Henri2018Deep).

## Function
The RPAP3 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the R2TP co-chaperone complex, which collaborates with the HSP90 molecular chaperone to facilitate the assembly and stabilization of various macromolecular complexes. RPAP3 plays a significant role in the assembly of RNA polymerase II, a key enzyme in gene regulation, by stabilizing its subunits in the cytoplasm and facilitating their proper assembly and nuclear import (Boulon2010HSP90). The protein contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that interact with HSP90 and HSP70, aiding in the stability and assembly of RNA polymerase II, small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinases (PIKKs) (Rodríguez2020RPAP3).

RPAP3's C-terminal domain is essential for its interaction with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase complex, which is critical for the structural integrity and function of the R2TP complex (Rodríguez2020RPAP3). This interaction allows RPAP3 to act as a flexible scaffold, recruiting HSP90 to the R2TP complex and facilitating the assembly of large multiprotein complexes (Martino2018RPAP3). RPAP3 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to processes such as transcription regulation and protein homeostasis (Martino2018RPAP3).

## Clinical Significance
RPAP3 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. Altered expression levels of RPAP3 are associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). High RPAP3 expression in CRC tissues correlates with tumor relapse and increased patient mortality, and patients with high RPAP3-expressing tumors have a lower disease-free survival rate (Maurizy2021The). The gene's role in the R2TP complex, which is crucial for cell proliferation, suggests that its overexpression may contribute to tumor growth and progression (Maurizy2021The).

RPAP3 is also involved in the DNA damage response. It interacts with Reptin, influencing the phosphorylation of H2AX, a marker of DNA damage. Overexpression of RPAP3 can lead to increased apoptosis following UV-induced DNA damage, suggesting a role in promoting cell death in response to DNA damage (Ni2009RPAP3). This function may have implications in cancer, where genomic instability is a key factor in disease progression.

In addition, RPAP3's involvement in the R2TP/PAQosome complex, which is linked to oncogenesis, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in cancers such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Kakihara2020R2TPPAQosome).

## Interactions
RPAP3 is a key component of the human R2TP co-chaperone complex, interacting with several proteins to facilitate the assembly and stability of multiprotein complexes. It interacts with PIH1D1, a crucial interaction for the formation of the R2TP complex. This interaction is mediated by residues 400-420 of RPAP3, which are necessary and sufficient for binding PIH1D1 (Martino2018RPAP3; Henri2018Deep). RPAP3 also binds to the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 heterohexamer, specifically interacting with RUVBL2 through its C-terminal domain, known as the RUVBL2-binding domain (RBD) (Rodríguez2020RPAP3; Martino2018RPAP3).

RPAP3 contains TPR domains that bind to the HSP90 C-terminal MEEVD motif, with the second TPR domain (TPR2) showing a higher affinity for HSP90 than the first (TPR1) (Rodríguez2020RPAP3; Henri2018Deep). It can also associate with HSP70, suggesting a role in bridging protein client exchange between HSP70 and HSP90 (Henri2018Deep). RPAP3 interacts with TRBP, a cofactor for Dicer, forming a ternary complex with HSP90, which suggests a role in stabilizing TRBP and potentially influencing Dicer activity (Abel2020Structure).
