# POLR2E

## Overview
The POLR2E gene encodes a protein subunit known as RNA polymerase II, I, and III subunit E, which is integral to the function of the three major nuclear RNA polymerases. These polymerases are responsible for the transcription of DNA into various forms of RNA, including messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA), which are crucial for protein synthesis and other cellular processes. The POLR2E protein is a shared component of these polymerases, playing a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of the transcriptional machinery. It is involved in essential interactions with other proteins and complexes, such as the RPAP3/R2TP/prefoldin-like complex and the PAQosome, which facilitate the assembly and function of RNA polymerases (Pinard2022Riluzole; Cloutier2010New). The gene's proper function is critical for maintaining normal cellular activities and ensuring accurate transcription, which is fundamental for organismal development and homeostasis (Muste2023Deregulations).

## Function
The POLR2E gene encodes a subunit of RNA polymerases II, I, and III, which are essential for the transcription of DNA into RNA. This protein plays a critical role in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA), thereby contributing significantly to gene expression and cellular function. In healthy human cells, POLR2E is involved in the transcription of mRNA, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) by RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for translating genetic information into functional proteins and regulating various cellular processes (Muste2023Deregulations).

POLR2E is active in the nucleus, where it participates in the assembly and function of the RNA polymerase complexes. These complexes are responsible for the transcription of different types of RNA, each playing a distinct role in cellular growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals. The proper functioning of POLR2E is vital for maintaining normal cellular activities and ensuring the accurate transcription of genetic material, which is fundamental for organismal development and homeostasis (Muste2023Deregulations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the POLR2E gene have been associated with an increased risk of various cancers. The rs3787016 polymorphism in POLR2E is significantly linked to a higher risk of breast and cervical cancer in females, particularly in Chinese populations. The T allele and TT genotype of this polymorphism are associated with increased cancer susceptibility, with odds ratios indicating a 25% to 64% increased risk of breast cancer (Chen2019The). This polymorphism is also associated with prostate cancer risk, potentially affecting splicing and producing a dysfunctional POLR2E protein, which impacts RNA polymerase II transcription (Muste2023Deregulations).

In Western populations, the rs3787016 polymorphism has been studied in relation to esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers. The C allele and CC genotype are more frequently observed in healthy controls, suggesting a potential protective effect against these cancers (Baili2024Associations). The polymorphism's association with cancer risk has been confirmed through meta-analyses, which highlight its significance across different ethnicities and cancer types, including prostate and breast cancer (Ghavami2020Association). These findings suggest that POLR2E rs3787016 could serve as a biomarker for cancer susceptibility.

## Interactions
POLR2E, also known as RPB5, is a subunit shared by all three nuclear RNA polymerases (I, II, and III) and is involved in various protein interactions. It is a component of the RPAP3/R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, which is associated with the assembly and stability of RNA polymerase II (Cloutier2010New). POLR2E interacts with URI (Unconventional prefoldin RPB5 Interactor), a transcriptional repressor that binds to the RPB5 subunit, stabilizing its protein levels and influencing its transcription (Mita2013Analysis). URI is part of the R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, which mediates the assembly of RNA polymerase II in the cytoplasm and is involved in nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation (Mita2013Analysis).

POLR2E also plays a role in the assembly of the RNA polymerase III complex, interacting with the PAQosome, a chaperone complex involved in the early stages of Pol III assembly (Pinard2022Riluzole). The interaction between POLR2E and the PAQosome facilitates the recruitment of the PAQosome to POLR3A, a subunit of Pol III, indicating its role in the assembly process (Pinard2022Riluzole). These interactions highlight POLR2E's involvement in the formation and function of essential transcriptional machinery.
