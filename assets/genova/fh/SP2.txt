# SP2

## Overview
SP2 is a gene that encodes the Sp2 transcription factor, a member of the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors. This family is characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, although in Sp2, these motifs are not essential for its DNA-binding activity. Instead, the N-terminal region of the Sp2 protein, which is glutamine-rich and positively charged, plays a crucial role in its recruitment to target promoters. The Sp2 transcription factor is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to GC-rich motifs in DNA, influencing processes such as cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Unlike other Sp family members, Sp2 has a unique DNA-binding specificity, recognizing GT boxes due to a leucine substitution in its zinc-finger motif. This specificity allows Sp2 to modulate gene expression by interacting with various coactivators and corepressors, thereby playing a significant role in cell proliferation and early development (Völkel2018Transcription; Black2001Sp1; Völkel2015Zinc; Kaczynski2003Sp1andKrüppelliketranscriptionfactors; Vizcaíno2015Sp1).

## Structure
The SP2 transcription factor is part of the Sp/KLF family, characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain composed of three C2H2-type zinc finger motifs located near the C-terminus. These motifs are typically involved in DNA binding, but in SP2, they are not essential for its genomic binding activity (Völkel2018Transcription; Völkel2015Zinc). Instead, the N-terminal region, which is glutamine-rich and positively charged, plays a crucial role in SP2's recruitment to target promoters (Völkel2018Transcription; Völkel2015Zinc).

The N-terminal region includes the Sp-box, a hallmark of the Sp transcription factor family, located between amino acids 28 and 93. This region is essential for SP2's binding function and acts as a protein-protein interaction domain (Völkel2018Transcription; Völkel2015Zinc). SP2 interacts with other proteins, such as the TALE homeobox protein Prep1, its partner PBX homeobox 1 (Pbx1), and the nuclear transcription factor Y (Nf-y), facilitating their binding to composite motifs in many promoters (Völkel2018Transcription).

The zinc finger domain and the buttonhead box, another conserved motif, are dispensable for SP2's function, indicating that SP2's primary structure, particularly the N-terminal region, is critical for its activity (Völkel2018Transcription; Völkel2015Zinc).

## Function
SP2, a member of the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors, plays a significant role in regulating gene expression by binding to GC-rich motifs in DNA. This binding influences the transcription of various genes involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Black2001Sp1; Kaczynski2003Sp1andKrüppelliketranscriptionfactors). SP2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the expression of target genes essential for maintaining cellular functions (Vizcaíno2015Sp1).

SP2 has a unique DNA-binding specificity compared to other Sp family members, as it preferentially recognizes the GT box rather than the GC box due to a leucine substitution in its first zinc-finger motif (Kaczynski2003Sp1andKrüppelliketranscriptionfactors). This specificity allows SP2 to activate or sometimes repress expression from different promoters, contributing to its role in cell proliferation and early development, as evidenced by its necessity for the proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Vizcaíno2015Sp1).

The transcriptional regulatory domains of SP2 are highly variable, allowing it to interact with coactivators and corepressors, which further modulates its transcriptional activity (Kaczynski2003Sp1andKrüppelliketranscriptionfactors).

## Interactions
The Sp2 transcription factor is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. Sp2 interacts with the histone-fold domain protein Nf-y, a crucial interaction for Sp2's recruitment to chromatin. This interaction is essential for the binding of Sp2 to CCAAT motifs, where Nf-y is also present. Sp2 enhances Nf-y binding at these shared sites, indicating a mutual dependency between the two proteins for chromatin binding (Völkel2015Zinc).

Sp2 also forms a complex with the TALE homeoproteins Pbx1 and Prep1. This complex is recruited to composite genomic sites where the recognition sequences for Pbx1:Prep1 and Nf-y are separated by 11 base pairs. Sp2 potentiates the binding of Pbx1:Prep1 and Nf-y to these sites, facilitating the formation of an active chromatin state. The Sp-box within the N-terminal region of Sp2 is crucial for this interaction, while the zinc finger domain is not required (Völkel2018Transcription).

These interactions highlight Sp2's role as a cofactor, enhancing the binding of other transcription factors to DNA and influencing gene expression through specific genomic binding patterns (Völkel2018Transcription).
