# PSEN2

## Overview
The PSEN2 gene encodes presenilin 2, a transmembrane protein that is a crucial component of the γ-secretase complex, which is involved in the proteolytic processing of several integral membrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch receptors. Presenilin 2 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in cellular processes such as calcium signaling, mitochondrial function, and inter-organelle communication (Pizzo2020Presenilin2; Zampese2011Presenilin). The protein is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, due to its involvement in the cleavage of APP, which is a precursor to amyloid-beta peptides, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology (SolerLópez2010Interactome). Mutations in the PSEN2 gene are associated with familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease and other disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Jayadev2010Alzheimer’s; An2015Mutations).

## Structure
Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) is a transmembrane protein consisting of 448 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 55 kDa. It is predicted to span the lipid bilayer nine times, forming a structure integral to the γ-secretase complex (An2015Mutations). The protein shares a 67% similarity with presenilin 1 (PSEN1), with notable differences at the N-terminus and the hydrophilic loop, while the hydrophobic regions are highly conserved (An2015Mutations). 

The PSEN2 protein undergoes autocatalytic endoproteolysis within its large cytoplasmic loop domain, resulting in a stable and biologically active heterodimer. The active sites of the γ-secretase complex in PSEN2 are two aspartyl residues, D263 and D366, located in the adjacent transmembrane regions TM-VI and TM-VII (An2015Mutations). 

PSEN2 has two isoforms: Isoform 1 is found in the placenta, skeletal muscle, and heart, while Isoform 2, which lacks amino acids 263-296, is found in the brain, heart, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney (An2015Mutations). The protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in neurons (An2015Mutations).

## Function
Presenilin 2 (PS2), encoded by the PSEN2 gene, is a multi-pass membrane protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, with some presence in the plasma membrane and endosomes (Pizzo2020Presenilin2). It is a component of the γ-secretase complex, which is involved in the proteolytic processing of various integral membrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch receptors (Pizzo2020Presenilin2). Beyond its role in the γ-secretase complex, PS2 modulates several cellular processes independently, such as calcium signaling, mitochondrial function, and inter-organelle communication (Pizzo2020Presenilin2).

PS2 plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis by modulating interactions between the ER and mitochondria, enhancing calcium transfer and influencing mitochondrial calcium uptake (Zampese2011Presenilin). It affects the opening probability of IP3 receptors, thereby influencing calcium release from the ER (Zampese2011Presenilin). PS2 is also involved in maintaining mitochondrial oxidative capacity and morphology, which is essential for energy metabolism and cell survival (Contino2017Presenilin). Its absence leads to impaired respiratory capacity and altered mitochondrial morphology, highlighting its importance in cellular bioenergetics (Contino2017Presenilin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PSEN2 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD). PSEN2 mutations are a rare cause of familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and have been linked to a wide range of onset ages and clinical phenotypes. The N141I mutation is particularly significant, found in multiple families, including 11 Volga German families, and is associated with early-onset AD, with a mean onset age of 53.7 years (Jayadev2010Alzheimer’s). The Thr421Met mutation has been identified in patients with EOAD, showing symptoms such as amnesia and personality changes, and is predicted to be damaging based on bioinformatic analyses (Yang2022PSEN2).

PSEN2 mutations are also implicated in other disorders. For instance, the p.His169Asn mutation is associated with early-onset AD, characterized by progressive memory decline and cognitive impairments (Giau2018A). Beyond Alzheimer's, PSEN2 mutations have been linked to frontotemporal dementia, breast cancer, dilated cardiomyopathy, and Parkinson's disease with dementia, suggesting shared genetic factors or pathogenetic mechanisms across these conditions (An2015Mutations).

## Interactions
Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) is involved in several protein interactions that are significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. PSEN2 is a component of the gamma-secretase complex, where it interacts with presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and both are involved in the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (SolerLópez2010Interactome). PSEN2 also interacts with programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which is implicated in apoptosis and is up-regulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissues (SolerLópez2010Interactome).

PSEN2 is part of a broader Alzheimer's Disease Protein Interaction Network (AD-PIN), which includes interactions with ECSIT, a gene linked to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD (SolerLópez2010Interactome). In the context of synucleinopathies, PSEN2 is part of a genetic risk module involving beta-amyloid and actin, and it interacts with the SNCA gene, which is associated with increased neuronal toxicity when PSEN2 is downregulated (Nazeen2024Deep).

PSEN2 also interacts with proteins involved in apoptosis pathways, such as BCL2 and CASP3, and is identified as a hub in a network of neurodegenerative disorder-related protein interactions (Limviphuvadh2007The). These interactions highlight PSEN2's role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, mitochondrial function, and cytoskeletal regulation.
