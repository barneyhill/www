# LRRC34

## Overview
The LRRC34 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 34 protein, which is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in various cellular processes. The LRRC34 protein is primarily localized in the nucleolus and nucleus of pluripotent stem cells, transitioning to the cytoplasm upon differentiation, indicating its involvement in cellular differentiation and pluripotency maintenance (Lührig2014Lrrc34). In the context of papillary thyroid carcinoma, LRRC34 is associated with cytoskeletal functions, co-localizing with α-tubulin in the cytoplasm (Comiskey2020Variants). The protein interacts with key cellular proteins such as RANBP1, influencing GTP signaling pathways, and is implicated in ribosome biogenesis through interactions with nucleolar proteins like nucleophosmin and nucleolin (Lührig2014Lrrc34). Variants in the LRRC34 gene have been linked to altered protein function and are associated with increased risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Comiskey2020Variants).

## Structure
The LRRC34 protein, encoded by the human gene LRRC34, is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are known for their role in protein-protein interactions. These domains are predicted to have a structure similar to ribonuclease inhibitors, featuring beta-strands and alpha-helices that form a horseshoe shape (Lührig2014Lrrc34). This structural similarity suggests that LRRC34 may share functional characteristics with ribonuclease inhibitors, such as protecting RNA from degradation (Lührig2014Lrrc34).

The protein is primarily localized in the nucleolus and nucleus in pluripotent stem cells, but it translocates to the cytoplasm upon differentiation (Lührig2014Lrrc34). In the context of papillary thyroid carcinoma, LRRC34 is localized to the cytoplasm and co-localizes with α-tubulin, indicating its involvement in cytoskeletal functions (Comiskey2020Variants).

Missense variants in LRRC34, such as S246G and S286I, are predicted to be deleterious to the protein's folding, potentially affecting its function (Comiskey2020Variants). These variants do not alter the subcellular localization of the protein but may impact its binding affinity and interactions with other proteins, such as RANBP1, which could influence cellular processes like GTP signaling (Comiskey2020Variants).

## Function
The LRRC34 gene encodes a protein involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with RANBP1, which is crucial for GTP signaling in cells. In healthy human cells, LRRC34 is expected to maintain normal levels of RanGTP, a GTP-bound form of the Ran protein, which is important for various cellular processes including nuclear transport and cell cycle regulation (Comiskey2020Variants). The protein is localized in the cytoplasm, particularly in the cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and cytokinetic bridges, suggesting its involvement in cellular structure and function (Comiskey2020Variants).

LRRC34 is also implicated in the regulation and maintenance of pluripotency in stem cells. It is highly expressed in pluripotent stem cells and downregulated upon differentiation, indicating a role in maintaining pluripotency. The protein interacts with nucleolar proteins Nucleophosmin and Nucleolin, suggesting a role in ribosome biogenesis in pluripotent stem cells (Lührig2014Lrrc34). The localization of LRRC34 shifts from the nucleolus to the nucleus and cytoplasm upon differentiation, further supporting its involvement in cellular differentiation processes (Lührig2014Lrrc34). These functions highlight LRRC34's role in cellular signaling pathways and maintaining cellular structure or function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LRRC34 gene have been implicated in the predisposition to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), a common type of thyroid cancer. Genome-wide association studies have identified significant variants, such as the missense variant rs6793295, which are associated with PTC. These variants are believed to affect the protein folding of LRRC34, potentially altering its function (Comiskey2020Variants). The missense variants in LRRC34 have been shown to impair its interaction with RANBP1, a protein involved in catalyzing RanGTP, leading to decreased RanGTP levels and increased apoptosis in cells. This suggests a mechanism by which these variants contribute to cellular dysfunction and cancer progression (Comiskey2020Variants).

In addition to missense variants, regulatory variants upstream of LRRC34 have been found to exhibit allele-specific transcriptional activity, influencing the expression levels of the gene. Risk alleles of these variants are associated with higher expression of LRRC34, which may contribute to PTC risk. Conversely, minor regulatory variants can mitigate this risk by downregulating LRRC34 expression (Comiskey2020Variants). Knockdown experiments have demonstrated that reduced LRRC34 expression affects genes involved in cell motility, leading to decreased cell migration, which is a key factor in cancer metastasis (Comiskey2020Variants).

## Interactions
LRRC34 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function. In the context of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), LRRC34 interacts with RanBP1, a protein involved in nuclear transport. Missense variants in LRRC34, such as rs6793295, reduce its affinity for RanBP1, which may alter the protein's function by affecting its interactions rather than its localization (Comiskey2020Variants). This impaired interaction is associated with reduced RanGTP levels and increased apoptosis, suggesting a disruption in cellular signaling pathways (Comiskey2020Variants).

In pluripotent stem cells, LRRC34 is a nucleolar protein that interacts with nucleophosmin (NPM1) and nucleolin (NCL). These interactions are confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, indicating LRRC34's role in ribosome biogenesis and pluripotency regulation (Lührig2014Lrrc34). The protein's localization changes during stem cell differentiation, initially found in the nucleolus and later translocating to the nucleus and cytoplasm, which may reflect its dynamic role in cellular processes (Lührig2014Lrrc34). These interactions highlight LRRC34's involvement in maintaining pluripotency and its potential impact on cellular differentiation and development (Lührig2014Lrrc34).
