# ELOVL4

## Overview
ELOVL4 is a gene that encodes the ELOVL fatty acid elongase 4, an enzyme integral to the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). This enzyme is a member of the ELOVL family of fatty acid elongases and is characterized as a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Deák2019Novel; Jin2017Molecular). The ELOVL4 protein plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of very long-chain saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cellular membranes, particularly in the retina and central nervous system (Donato2018Stargardt; Deák2019Novel). Mutations in the ELOVL4 gene are linked to several hereditary disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 and Stargardt disease type 3, highlighting its clinical significance in neurological and visual health (CadieuxDion2014Expanding; Tamura2023Incomplete).

## Structure
The ELOVL4 protein is a member of the ELOVL family of fatty acid elongases, characterized by its role in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids. It is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is predicted to have seven transmembrane domains, which facilitate its function within the lipid bilayer (Deák2019Novel; Jin2017Molecular). The protein contains a conserved histidine box motif (HXXHH), which is crucial for its enzymatic activity, likely involved in electron reception during fatty acid elongation (Lagali2003Evolutionarily; Jin2017Molecular).

The ELOVL4 protein also features an ER retention signal at its carboxyl terminus, which is responsible for the retrieval of transmembrane proteins to the ER from the Golgi apparatus (Lagali2003Evolutionarily; Jin2017Molecular). The N-terminus and N-linked glycosylation site are located in the ER lumen, while the C-terminus ER-retention motif is on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane (Deák2019Novel).

ELOVL4 is known to form homodimers, and its dimerization can lead to mislocalization and a dominant negative effect on enzyme function. It can also hetero-oligomerize with other ELOVL family members (Deák2019Novel). The precise structure of ELOVL4 remains unresolved, as no crystal structures of any full-length ELOVL proteins are available (Deák2019Novel).

## Function
The ELOVL4 gene encodes an enzyme that is crucial for the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), specifically very long-chain saturated fatty acids (VLC-SFA) and very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFA) in mammals. This enzyme is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the addition of two-carbon units to long-chain fatty acids, enabling the synthesis of VLCFAs with chain lengths up to 38 carbons (Deák2019Novel).

ELOVL4 plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cellular membranes. In the retina, it is involved in the production of VLC-PUFA, which are incorporated into phosphatidylcholine and are essential for the health and survival of photoreceptors (Donato2018Stargardt; Deák2019Novel). In the central nervous system, VLC-SFA produced by ELOVL4 are incorporated into sphingolipids, contributing to synaptic vesicle function and presynaptic release (Deák2019Novel).

In the skin, ELOVL4 is responsible for producing VLC-SFA, which are critical for forming the hydrophobic extracellular lipid lamellae of the stratum corneum, serving as a water barrier (Deák2019Novel). The enzyme's activity is essential for normal cellular functions, particularly in the retina and central nervous system, where its dysfunction can lead to severe neurological and visual impairments (Deák2019Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELOVL4 gene are associated with several hereditary diseases, primarily affecting the nervous system and skin. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 (SCA34) is linked to specific missense mutations in ELOVL4, such as p.L168F and p.W246G, which lead to symptoms including gait ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, and sometimes erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV) (CadieuxDion2014Expanding; Ozaki2015A; Tamura2023Incomplete). These mutations result in incomplete elongation of ultra-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, causing cerebellar atrophy and ataxia (Tamura2023Incomplete).

Stargardt disease type 3 (STGD3), a juvenile macular dystrophy, is caused by frameshift and nonsense mutations in ELOVL4, leading to truncated proteins that disrupt retinal cell function (Deák2019Novel; Tamura2023Incomplete). This condition results in progressive macular degeneration and loss of central vision (CadieuxDion2014Expanding).

Homozygous mutations in ELOVL4 can cause a severe neuro-ichthyotic syndrome, characterized by ichthyosis, spastic quadriplegia, seizures, and intellectual disability (Deák2019Novel; Tamura2023Incomplete). These mutations often lead to protein truncation, affecting critical regions such as the ER retention motif, and result in significant neurological and dermatological conditions (Deák2019Novel; Zwara2021Alterations).

## Interactions
ELOVL4, a member of the ELOVL family of fatty acid elongases, participates in several critical interactions for its function. It can homodimerize, and this dimerization can lead to mislocalization of the complex away from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), particularly when involving the STDG3 mutant form, which exerts a dominant negative effect on enzyme function (Deák2019Novel). ELOVL4 also forms hetero-oligomers with other ELOVL family members and enzymes associated with very long chain fatty acid (VLC-FA) elongation. The STDG3 mutants of ELOVL4 have been shown to interact more strongly with other ELOVL family elongases and VLC-FA-associated enzymes than the wild-type ELOVL4, suggesting that these mutant forms might affect the synthesis of other fatty acid species beyond VLC-FA (Deák2019Novel).

In the context of its role in the retina, ELOVL4 interacts with synaptic proteins, potentially affecting vesicle tethering, recycling pathways, and glutamate release mechanisms. This indicates that ELOVL4 participates in complex interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, impacting cellular processes in the retina (Donato2018Stargardt). These interactions are essential for the biosynthesis of very long chain saturated fatty acids (VLC-SFA) and very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFA) (Deák2019Novel).
