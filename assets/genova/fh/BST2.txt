# BST2

## Overview
BST2, or bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein known as tetherin. This protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, an extracellular domain, and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Tetherin plays a critical role in the immune response by inhibiting the release of enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1, from infected cells, thereby preventing their spread. It achieves this antiviral function by tethering budding virions to the host cell surface. Beyond its antiviral activity, BST2 is involved in various cellular processes, including pre-B-cell growth and immune signaling, and has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in breast and colorectal cancers (Swiecki2011Structural; Welbourn2015Positioning; Mahauad2024Role).

## Structure
BST2, also known as tetherin, is a type II transmembrane protein with a unique molecular structure that is crucial for its function in inhibiting the release of enveloped viruses such as HIV-1. The primary structure of BST2 includes a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular domain that ends with a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Yang2010Structural; Swiecki2011Structural).

The secondary structure of the extracellular domain predominantly forms an extended α-helix, which assembles into a parallel dimeric coiled coil. This coiled coil is stabilized by three intermolecular disulfide bonds, specifically at cysteines C53, C63, and C91, which are essential for its antiviral function (Schubert2010Structural; Swiecki2011Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, the extracellular domain of BST2 can form a tetramer under reducing conditions, with the N-terminal third forming an antiparallel four-helix bundle (Schubert2010Structural). The quaternary structure involves the formation of disulfide-linked dimers, which are crucial for the protein's stability and function (Hinz2010Structural).

Post-translational modifications of BST2 include glycosylation, which is important for its structural stability and function (Swiecki2011Structural). The protein's ability to form dimers and tetramers is essential for its antiviral activity, with evidence suggesting that it may function as a tetramer during certain stages, such as trafficking (Schubert2010Structural).

## Function
BST2, also known as tetherin, is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in the immune response by inhibiting the release of enveloped viruses from infected cells. It functions by tethering budding virions to the host cell surface, thereby preventing their release and subsequent spread. This antiviral activity is facilitated by the protein's unique structure, which includes an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, an ectodomain, and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Swiecki2011Structural; Welbourn2015Positioning).

BST2 is expressed on lipid rafts at the cell surface and in the trans-Golgi network, where it is involved in antiviral cell signaling and the activation of NF-kB. The protein's ectodomain contains cysteine residues that form disulfide-linked dimers, essential for its antiviral function (Swiecki2011Structural; Welbourn2015Positioning). In addition to its role in viral restriction, BST2 is implicated in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and may interact with other cellular proteins to modulate immune responses (Welbourn2015Positioning).

BST2 is also involved in pre-B-cell growth, as its expression enhances the growth of pre-B-cell lines, suggesting a role in hematopoietic cell development (Ishikawa1995Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BST2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, high BST2 expression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, larger tumor size, and reduced patient survival. It is notably elevated in high-grade luminal B tumors and metastatic tumors compared to primary ones (Mahauad2024Role). BST2 overexpression enhances cell migration, invasion, and growth, contributing to cancer progression and resistance to pro-apoptotic drugs (Mahauad‐Fernandez2015The). In colorectal cancer, BST2 promotes tumor progression by facilitating macrophage M2 polarization, which is linked to increased tumor growth and macrophage infiltration (He2023BST2).

BST2 expression is also implicated in breast cancer with bone metastasis, where it is significantly upregulated. This upregulation enhances the migratory capacity of cancer cells and is associated with increased serum levels in patients with bone metastasis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Cai2009Upregulation). The dimerization of BST2 is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis, with disruptions in dimerization leading to reduced tumor size and metastasis (Mahauad2024Role). These findings underscore the role of BST2 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers.

## Interactions
BST2, also known as tetherin, is a host restriction factor that interacts with various proteins to exert its antiviral effects. One of the primary interactions of BST2 is with the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu. This interaction occurs through their transmembrane domains, where Vpu binds to BST2, leading to the downregulation of BST2 from the cell surface and its degradation in lysosomes. This process is partially dependent on the cellular protein β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), which is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation pathways (Iwabu2009HIV1).

The interaction between BST2 and Vpu is crucial for the enhancement of virion release, as Vpu-deficient viral particles accumulate at the cell surface. Structural studies have identified key residues in the transmembrane domains of both proteins that are critical for their interaction, such as P40 in BST2 and L11 in Vpu (Pang2013Identification). Additionally, BST2 forms homodimers through disulfide-bond interactions in its extracellular domain, which is essential for its function in tethering virions to the cell membrane (Arias2011Structural). These interactions highlight the complex role of BST2 in viral restriction and its antagonism by viral proteins.
