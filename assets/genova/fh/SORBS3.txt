# SORBS3

## Overview
SORBS3 is a gene that encodes the protein sorbin and SH3 domain containing 3, commonly referred to as vinexin. This protein is a member of the SORBS family and is characterized by its inclusion of SH3 domains, which are critical for mediating protein-protein interactions. Vinexin plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and the organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly in focal adhesions where it influences cell adhesion and migration. It is involved in mechanotransduction processes, which are essential for cellular responses to mechanical stimuli and are implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including obesity, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. The regulation of SORBS3 expression and function is complex, involving epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, which can impact its role in metabolic and inflammatory pathways (Kuroda2018Vinexin; Day2017Alterations; Luo2023Elevated).

## Function
SORBS3, also known as vinexin, is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. It contains SH3 domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for actin cytoskeleton dynamics. SORBS3 is active in focal adhesions, where it is involved in cell adhesion and migration processes, influencing cellular responses and tissue development (Day2017Alterations).

In the context of obesity, SORBS3 is implicated in mechanosignal transduction mediated by cytoskeletal elements. This function may be altered in obesity due to chronic inflammation, which can lead to insulin resistance. The gene's expression is regulated by DNA methylation, with increased methylation associated with decreased expression in skeletal muscle. This suggests that SORBS3 may play a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity and related metabolic dysfunctions (Day2017Alterations).

Post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, a decrease in SORBS3 methylation and an increase in gene expression were observed, indicating a potential restoration towards normal levels. These changes in SORBS3 methylation and expression may be linked to metabolic improvements following the surgery (Day2017Alterations).

## Clinical Significance
SORBS3, also known as vinexin, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In the context of brain aging, increased expression of SORBS3 is associated with a decline in autophagic activity, which is linked to impaired proteostasis and genomic instability. This decline contributes to age-related cellular decline and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (Park2021Vinexin).

In obesity, SORBS3 expression is decreased in skeletal muscle, with increased DNA methylation observed in obese individuals. This alteration is associated with insulin resistance, and its expression can be restored following weight loss surgery, suggesting a role in metabolic health (Day2017Alterations).

SORBS3 also functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its re-expression in HCC cells inhibits tumor growth and migration, indicating that loss of SORBS3 contributes to cancer progression (Roessler2012Integrative). Additionally, SORBS3 is involved in regulating inflammatory responses by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, with its absence leading to increased pro-inflammatory signaling (Vdovenko2020The).

Alterations in SORBS3 expression or interactions can thus influence a range of conditions, from metabolic disorders to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
SORBS3, also known as vinexin, is a protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. It is part of the SORBS protein family, which includes vinexin α, CAP (c-Cbl-associated protein), and Arg-binding protein 2 (ArgBP2). These proteins share domain structures, including a sorbin homology (SoHo) domain and three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins (Kuroda2018Vinexin).

SORBS3 interacts with vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein, and is crucial for vinculin's association with the cytoskeleton and its conformational change in response to extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness. This interaction is important for the mechanotransduction and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (Kuroda2018Vinexin). SORBS3 is also involved in the regulation of ECM stiffness-dependent processes, such as the nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ, which are essential for MSC differentiation (Kuroda2018Vinexin).

In the context of uveal melanoma, SORBS3 is negatively regulated by the transcription factor ZNF704, which promotes cancer cell growth and migration. The down-regulation of SORBS3 by ZNF704 is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and migration, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role for SORBS3 in this cancer type (Luo2023Elevated).
