# EBLN1

## Overview
EBLN1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as endogenous Bornavirus-like nucleoprotein 1, which is categorized as a nucleoprotein. This gene is derived from ancient viral sequences integrated into the human genome, specifically from bornaviruses, and is expressed predominantly in human oligodendroglia cells. The protein encoded by EBLN1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. It is involved in several signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and p53 pathways, and may influence the Notch and JAK/STAT pathways. Although the precise physiological role of EBLN1 remains to be fully elucidated, its potential involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer highlights its significance in human health and disease (He2016KnockDown; Honda2017Potential).

## Function
EBLN1, an endogenous Bornavirus-like nucleoprotein, is implicated in several cellular processes, particularly in human oligodendroglia cells. The gene is highly expressed in these cells and appears to play a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Silencing EBLN1 results in significant inhibition of cell growth, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in cell cycle regulation and survival pathways (He2016KnockDown). 

Gene expression profiling following EBLN1 knockdown reveals substantial changes in the expression of genes associated with the cell cycle, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, p53 signaling, and apoptosis, indicating that EBLN1 may influence these pathways (He2016KnockDown). The gene's role in modulating the Notch and JAK/STAT signaling pathways is also suggested, with specific genes like RND3 and OSMR being notably affected by EBLN1 silencing (He2016KnockDown).

Despite its significant role in cellular processes, the exact function of EBLN1 in healthy cells remains unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its potential implications in neuropsychiatric disorders and cancers (He2016KnockDown).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the EBLN1 gene, which is derived from ancient bornavirus sequences, is an area of ongoing research. EBLN1 has been implicated in cancer development due to its involvement in tumorigenic pathways, such as cell cycle regulation, genome stability, and apoptosis. Silencing of EBLN1 can lead to defects in microtubule and centrosomal splitting, which are critical for proper cell division, and may contribute to cancer progression (Honda2017Potential). Although no specific mutations in EBLN1 have been directly linked to cancer, its expression appears to regulate neighboring genes, such as COMMD3, which may influence tumorigenesis (Honda2017Potential).

In the context of neurological disorders, EBLN1 has been mentioned in studies exploring genetic mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, the specific clinical implications of EBLN1 mutations in this context remain unclear, as the focus has been more on statistical associations rather than detailed clinical outcomes (Vélez2016Mutations). Overall, while EBLN1's role in disease is not fully understood, its potential involvement in cancer and neurological conditions warrants further investigation.
