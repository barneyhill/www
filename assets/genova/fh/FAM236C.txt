# FAM236C

## Overview
FAM236C is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 236 member C. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, which suggests a potential role in specific cellular processes, although its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. The FAM236C protein is implicated in various cellular interactions and pathways, contributing to its significance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts. Research into FAM236C has highlighted its involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, indicating a possible regulatory function in cellular signaling and development (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further studies are required to fully understand the molecular mechanisms and clinical implications associated with FAM236C.
