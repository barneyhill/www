# C5orf22

## Overview
C5orf22 is a gene located on chromosome 5 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 5 open reading frame 22. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including its role as a component of the WBP11/PQBP1 splicing complex, which is crucial for RNA splicing and processing (Zi2019A). The gene has been associated with several pathological conditions, such as non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer, where it is often over-expressed due to chromosome 5p gain, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression (Scotto2008Integrative). Additionally, C5orf22 has been identified in studies of cardiovascular diseases, such as aortic valve stenosis and tetralogy of Fallot, indicating its involvement in diverse biological pathways (Ghorbel2010Transcriptomic; Tojo2023Molecular).

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
C5orf22 has been identified as a novel component of the WBP11/PQBP1 splicing complex, indicating a physical interaction with the proteins WBP11 and PQBP1. This discovery was made through protein covariance analyses, which are used to identify functional protein networks. The study by Zi et al. highlights the importance of these interactions in understanding the proteomic changes in non-small cell lung cancer cells in response to chemical perturbagens (Zi2019A).

In cervical cancer, C5orf22 is one of the over-expressed genes associated with chromosome 5p gain. This genomic alteration is suggested to provide a growth advantage and contribute to tumor progression. However, specific physical interactions of C5orf22 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Scotto2008Integrative).

In the context of aortic valve stenosis, C5orf22 was identified as one of the differentially expressed genes, but the study does not provide specific information about its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Tojo2023Molecular). Similarly, in the study of tetralogy of Fallot, C5orf22 is mentioned as downregulated, but no interactions are described (Ghorbel2010Transcriptomic).
