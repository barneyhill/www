# KLF7

## Overview
KLF7, or Krüppel-like factor 7, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the Krüppel-like factor family, characterized by the presence of three conserved C2H2 zinc finger motifs at the C-terminal region. The KLF7 protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression, particularly in the nervous system, where it influences neuronal morphogenesis, axon growth, and dendritic organization. It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes critical for cell cycle control and neuronal differentiation, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. KLF7's activity is primarily nuclear, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression. The protein interacts with various cofactors, including MoKA and Fbxw7, which influence its stability and function. Alterations in the KLF7 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Mao2023Molecular; Powis2018De; Laub2005Transcription).

## Structure
The KLF7 protein in humans is a transcription factor composed of 302 amino acids. It features a transcriptional regulation domain at the N-terminus and a DNA binding domain at the C-terminus. The transcriptional regulation domain includes two functional subdomains: an acidic amino acid domain (aa 1-47) and a serine-rich hydrophobic domain (aa 76-211). An evolutionarily conserved leucine zipper (aa 59-119) facilitates protein interaction with the cofactor MoKA (Smaldone2004Identification; Mao2023Molecular). The transcriptional regulatory domain is followed by a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (aa 212-218), which is crucial for the protein's nuclear import (Mao2023Molecular).

KLF7 is part of the Krüppel-like factors family, characterized by three conserved tandem C2H2 zinc fingers at the C-terminal region, which serve as DNA-binding domains (Mao2023Molecular). The N-terminal region, less conserved among KLFs, acts as a transcriptional regulatory domain (Mao2023Molecular). The expression of KLF7 is regulated by its N-terminal sequence, with the loss of amino acids 1-76 leading to increased protein expression (Mao2023Molecular). KLF7 can bind to the CACCC motif and Sp1 binding site, showing a higher affinity for the CACCC motif (Mao2023Molecular).

## Function
KLF7 (Kruppel-like factor 7) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in neuronal morphogenesis and development. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression related to cell cycle control and neuronal differentiation. KLF7 is particularly important in the nervous system, where it influences axon growth, target innervation, and the organization of dendrites, especially in the hippocampus (Laub2005Transcription). It regulates neuronal morphogenesis by stimulating the transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 cip/waf and p27 kip1, which are essential for cell cycle regulation and neurite remodeling (Laub2005Transcription).

KLF7 is active in postmitotic neuroblasts and is crucial for the differentiation of neuroectodermal and mesodermal cell lineages. Its expression is necessary for maintaining specific neuronal gene expression, such as TrkA and MAP2, which are vital for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth (Caiazzo2010Transcription). In the olfactory and visual systems, KLF7 is linked to axonal growth and the regulation of olfactory marker protein and neural cell adhesion protein L1, which are critical for olfactory development (Bialkowska2017Krüppellike). KLF7's activity is primarily nuclear, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KLF7 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. KLF7 haploinsufficiency is associated with a neurodevelopmental phenotype characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, feeding and swallowing issues, psychiatric features, and neuromuscular symptoms. Specific de novo missense variants, such as c.410C>T (p.T137M), c.415C>T (p.P139S), and c.790G>A (p.D264N), have been identified in individuals with these clinical features (Powis2018De).

In cancer, KLF7 expression is significantly upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where it correlates with poor overall and disease-free survival. KLF7 influences cancer progression by regulating IGF2BP2 expression through super-enhancers (Cai2024KLF7). High KLF7 expression is also linked to poor prognosis in gastric carcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, glioma, and colon adenocarcinoma, where it promotes tumor progression and metastasis (Zhang2024KLF7; Mao2023Molecular).

KLF7 deficiency in mice has been shown to cause autistic-like behaviors, potentially through its regulation of the Clock gene, a core component of the circadian rhythm system. This disruption in circadian gene expression is linked to autism spectrum disorder (Tian2022Krüppellike).

## Interactions
KLF7 (Kruppel-like factor 7) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with MoKA, a novel F-box protein. MoKA acts as a coactivator of KLF7, enhancing its transcriptional activity on the p21 WAF1/Cip1 gene promoter. This interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens, GST pull-down assays, and coimmunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. MoKA and KLF7 are coexpressed in the developing nervous system and adult testes, suggesting a role in cell differentiation and gene regulation (Smaldone2004Identification).

KLF7 also interacts with the F-box protein Fbxw7, which targets KLF7 for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is dependent on GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of KLF7, which facilitates its recognition by Fbxw7. The degradation of KLF7 by Fbxw7 is crucial for regulating its stability and function in neuronal differentiation (Sugiyama2019SCFFbxw7).

In chicken preadipocytes, KLF7 interacts with PU.1, a transcription factor that enhances KLF7's transcriptional activity on the CDKN3 promoter. This interaction promotes cell proliferation and inhibits differentiation, highlighting KLF7's role in adipogenesis and insulin resistance (Tan2023PU.1).
