# NABP2

## Overview
NABP2, or nucleic acid binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes the protein hSSB1, also known as OBFC2B. This protein is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in DNA repair and replication processes. hSSB1 is characterized by its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domain, which is essential for binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and is conserved across various species. The protein is involved in critical cellular pathways, including base excision repair and homologous recombination, which are vital for maintaining genomic stability. hSSB1 functions by forming oligomers, such as dimers or tetramers, which are necessary for its role in DNA repair. Additionally, NABP2 is implicated in the cellular response to oxidative stress and is associated with genomic stability, making it a significant factor in cancer susceptibility and other diseases related to DNA damage (ElKamand2020A; Kariawasam2016Backbone; Paquet2015hSSB1).

## Structure
The human gene NABP2 encodes the protein hSSB1, also known as OBFC2B, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and replication. The protein contains a single oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domain, a structural motif characterized by a closed β-barrel formed by five anti-parallel, highly bent β-strands. This domain is essential for binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and is conserved across various species (Kariawasam2016Backbone).

The interaction with ssDNA is primarily mediated by base-stacking interactions involving four key aromatic residues: W55, Y74, F78, and Y85. These residues are crucial for ssDNA recognition, as demonstrated by mutational analysis, which showed that replacing these residues with alanines significantly increased the dissociation constants (Kariawasam2016Backbone; Touma2016A).

hSSB1 can form oligomers, such as dimers or tetramers, depending on the conditions. This oligomerization is stabilized by cysteines C81 and C99, along with charged and hydrophobic residues, and is necessary for its function in base excision repair (Touma2017A; Kariawasam2016Backbone). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Kariawasam2016Backbone).

## Function
The human gene NABP2, also known as hSSB1 or OBFC2B, plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in DNA repair processes. NABP2 is involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, where it facilitates the repair of oxidative DNA damage, specifically 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG) lesions. It achieves this by forming a complex with human oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1), enhancing hOGG1's localization to damaged chromatin and its activity in removing 8-oxoG lesions (ElKamand2020A; Paquet2015hSSB1).

NABP2 is also essential for the repair of double-strand DNA breaks through the homologous recombination pathway. It binds to single-stranded DNA and is crucial for recruiting repair proteins to the site of damage, thereby promoting efficient DNA repair mechanisms (Touma2017A; Paquet2016hSSB1). The protein functions by forming stable oligomers, particularly tetramers, under oxidative conditions, which is necessary for its role in BER (Touma2017A).

In the cellular context, NABP2 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and preventing genomic instability (ElKamand2021Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NABP2 gene, also known as hSSB1, have been associated with various diseases, particularly those involving genomic instability and cancer. NABP2 is crucial for DNA repair processes, including the repair of double-strand breaks and the maintenance of replication fork stability. Deficiencies in NABP2 can lead to the accumulation of DNA strand breaks and chromosomal aberrations, contributing to genomic instability and increasing cancer susceptibility (Shi2013Essential; Bolderson2014Human).

Research has identified a significant association between genetic variations in NABP2 and the risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in NABP2, rs57343616, has been linked to increased BCC susceptibility, highlighting the gene's role in skin cancer risk (Lin2017Association).

NABP2 is also involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Cells lacking NABP2 show sensitivity to oxidizing agents and have impaired ATM and p53 activation, which are critical for responding to DNA damage. This deficiency can lead to the accumulation of oxidative lesions, such as 8-oxo-guanine, which are associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Paquet2015hSSB1).

## Interactions
NABP2, also known as hSSB1, is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes. It interacts with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) primarily through its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold domain. This interaction is mediated by base-stacking involving aromatic residues such as W55, Y74, F78, and Y85, which are essential for ssDNA recognition and binding (Kariawasam2016Backbone).

NABP2 is involved in the repair of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) via homologous recombination. It forms a complex with the MRN complex (Mre11-Rad51-Nbs1), which is crucial for efficient DSB resection (Kariawasam2016Backbone). NABP2 also interacts with the integrator complex subunit 3 (INTS3) and the small SOSSC protein, forming heterotrimeric complexes known as SOSS1 and SOSS2, which are involved in ssDNA binding (Kariawasam2016Backbone).

Under oxidative conditions, NABP2 can form disulphide-bonded tetramers and higher oligomers, enhancing its DNA binding affinity. This oligomerization is facilitated by cysteine residues and other charged and polar residues, which do not overlap with the ssDNA binding surface, allowing for ssDNA recognition by stable tetramers (ElKamand2020A).
