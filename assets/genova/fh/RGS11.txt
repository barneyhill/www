# RGS11

## Overview
RGS11 is a gene that encodes the protein Regulator of G protein signaling 11, which is a member of the R7 family of RGS proteins. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, particularly within the retina. RGS11 is characterized by its modular structure, which includes a catalytic RGS domain, a GGL (G protein gamma-like) domain, and DEP (Disheveled, Egl-10, Pleckstrin) and DHEX (DEP helical extension) domains. These domains facilitate its interactions with other proteins, such as Gβ5, R9AP, and R7BP, which are crucial for its localization and function in specific signaling pathways (AbramowNewerly2006RGS; Anderson2009The). In the retina, RGS11 is specifically expressed in ON-bipolar neurons, where it forms a complex with Gβ5S and R9AP, targeting the mGluR6 receptor to modulate visual signal transduction (Cao2009RetinaSpecific). Beyond its role in the retina, RGS11 has been implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma, where its overexpression is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis (Yang2016Overexpression).

## Structure
RGS11 is a member of the R7 family of RGS proteins, characterized by a modular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains a catalytic RGS domain, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Gα subunits, accelerating GTP hydrolysis and thus inactivating G protein signaling (AbramowNewerly2006RGS; Anderson2009The). The GGL (G protein gamma-like) domain of RGS11 is structurally homologous to conventional Gγ subunits and specifically interacts with the Gβ5 subunit, forming a stable complex (Anderson2009The; Snow1999Fidelity). This interaction is crucial for the protein's function in G protein signaling pathways.

RGS11 also contains DEP (Disheveled, Egl-10, Pleckstrin) and DHEX (DEP helical extension) domains, which are involved in interactions with membrane proteins such as R9AP and R7BP, facilitating the protein's localization and function in specific signaling pathways (AbramowNewerly2006RGS; Anderson2009The). Alternative splicing of RGS11 can lead to variability in domain composition, potentially altering its function (Anderson2009The). In the retina, RGS11 forms a trimeric complex with Gβ5S and R9AP, specifically targeting mGluR6 in ON-bipolar neurons (Cao2009RetinaSpecific).

## Function
RGS11 (Regulator of G protein signaling 11) is a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, particularly in the retina. It functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Gα subunits, accelerating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, which in turn terminates GPCR signaling. This activity is crucial for controlling the duration and magnitude of cellular responses to GPCR activation (Anderson2009The; Ross2000GTPaseActivating).

In the retina, RGS11 is specifically expressed in ON-bipolar neurons, where it forms a heterotrimeric complex with Gβ5S and R9AP. This complex is localized at the photoreceptor-to-bipolar synapse and is selectively targeted to mGluR6, a glutamate receptor essential for the ON-bipolar light response (Cao2009RetinaSpecific). The interaction with mGluR6 is crucial for the postsynaptic localization and stability of the RGS11 complex, as it protects the protein from proteolytic degradation (Cao2009RetinaSpecific).

Despite its role in enhancing GTPase activity, the absence of RGS11 does not significantly alter the kinetics of bipolar cell responses to light, suggesting that other proteins may compensate for its function in the mGluR6-Gαo signaling pathway (Cao2009RetinaSpecific).

## Clinical Significance
RGS11 overexpression has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma. Studies have shown that RGS11 is highly expressed in metastatic tissues, particularly in lymph-node and bone-metastatic tumors, and is associated with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. Approximately 57.1% of lung adenocarcinoma samples exhibited RGS11 overexpression, which correlates with increased primary tumor status and nodal metastasis. This overexpression promotes cell migration through the activation of the c-Raf/ERK/FAK pathway via Rac1 activity, although it does not enhance cell invasion and proliferation without additional factors like proteolytic activity (Yang2016Overexpression).

In the context of retinal function, RGS11, along with RGS7, plays a critical role in ON-bipolar cells. Mutations or deficiencies in RGS11 can lead to visual impairments, as evidenced by studies in mice where the absence of RGS11 resulted in delayed electroretinogram (ERG) b-waves. This suggests that RGS11 is a major physiological GTPase acceleration protein for Gαo1 in these cells, and its absence can disrupt normal visual processing (Chen2010Functional; Cao2009RetinaSpecific).

## Interactions
RGS11 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its GGL and DEP domains. The GGL domain of RGS11 forms a stable complex with the G protein subunit Gβ5, which is crucial for its role in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (AbramowNewerly2006RGS; Anderson2009The). This interaction is highly specific, as the GGL domain of RGS11 binds specifically to Gβ5, unlike other Gβ subunits (Snow1999Fidelity). Mutations in the GGL domain, such as the Trp-to-Phe mutation at position 274, can destabilize this interaction, highlighting the importance of specific residues in maintaining binding fidelity (Snow1999Fidelity).

RGS11 also interacts with membrane anchor proteins such as R9AP and R7BP. These proteins are essential for the localization and stability of RGS11 at the plasma membrane. R9AP is particularly important for the presence of the RGS9-1/Gβ5 complex in the retina, while R7BP facilitates the recruitment of RGS11 to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells (AbramowNewerly2006RGS; Anderson2009The). These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of RGS11 in neuronal signaling pathways, as they influence the expression, localization, and activity of RGS11 complexes (Anderson2009The).
