# CASTOR2

## Overview
CASTOR2 is a gene that encodes the protein cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunit 2, which plays a pivotal role in the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating cell growth, metabolism, and survival. Unlike its homolog CASTOR1, the CASTOR2-encoded protein does not bind arginine due to specific structural differences, particularly at the ACT2-ACT4 interface (Seibert2021Amino; Gai2016Structural). CASTOR2 functions as a cytosolic protein and interacts with the GATOR2 complex in an amino acid-insensitive manner, contributing to the regulation of mTORC1 activity (Xia2016Structural). The protein's inability to bind arginine distinguishes its role in the mTORC1 pathway, where it is involved in modulating cellular responses to nutrient availability. Additionally, CASTOR2 has been implicated in tumor suppression, particularly in the context of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) transformation, where its expression is downregulated to facilitate oncogenic processes (Li2019Kaposi). Understanding the function and regulation of CASTOR2 is essential for elucidating its role in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and metabolic disorders.

## Structure
CASTOR2 is a human protein involved in the regulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. It shares approximately 63% sequence identity with its homolog CASTOR1, but unlike CASTOR1, CASTOR2 does not bind arginine. This difference is attributed to specific residues at the ACT2-ACT4 interface, which are crucial for arginine binding in CASTOR1 (Seibert2021Amino; Gai2016Structural).

CASTOR2 exists as a homodimer in solution and can also form heterodimers with CASTOR1. Both proteins interact with the GATOR2 complex, likely at the same binding site (Xia2016Structural; Seibert2021Amino). The inability of CASTOR2 to bind arginine is linked to its ACT2 and ACT4 domains. Chimeric proteins, where these domains are replaced with those from CASTOR1, regain the ability to bind arginine, indicating the importance of these domains in arginine sensing (Xia2016Structural).

The structural details of CASTOR2 remain less clear due to the lack of diffracting crystals, but it is known to be constitutively associated with GATOR2 (Gai2016Structural). The protein's structure is thought to be similar to that of aspartate kinases, suggesting an evolutionary link (Xia2016Structural).

## Function
CASTOR2 is a cytosolic protein that serves as an arginine sensor for the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a crucial regulator of cell growth and metabolism. In the presence of arginine, CASTOR2 binds to mTORC1, facilitating its activation. This activation is essential for promoting protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and survival, which are vital processes for maintaining overall organismal growth and metabolic homeostasis. CASTOR2 operates primarily in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other components of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Through its role as an arginine sensor, CASTOR2 helps modulate the mTORC1 pathway, ensuring that cells respond appropriately to nutrient availability, particularly the presence of arginine, thereby influencing cellular and organismal metabolic processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CASTOR2 gene can significantly impact the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell growth and metabolism. Disruptions in this pathway are associated with various diseases, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. In cancer, aberrant mTORC1 signaling due to CASTOR2 mutations or altered expression can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival, contributing to tumorigenesis. Similarly, in metabolic disorders, improper regulation of mTORC1 can affect cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis, potentially leading to conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Neurodegenerative diseases may also be linked to CASTOR2 alterations, as mTORC1 plays a role in neuronal function and survival. Understanding the specific mutations and expression changes in CASTOR2 that lead to these conditions is crucial for developing targeted therapies that can modulate mTORC1 activity and restore normal cellular functions.

## Interactions
CASTOR2 is a human protein that interacts with the GATOR2 complex, a key component in the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Unlike its homolog CASTOR1, CASTOR2 binds to GATOR2 in an amino acid-insensitive manner and does not bind arginine (Xia2016Structural). The interaction between CASTOR2 and GATOR2 is likely at the same binding site as CASTOR1, although CASTOR2's binding is not affected by the presence of arginine (Xia2016Structural). CASTOR2 can also form a heterodimer with CASTOR1, although this does not occur through simple dissociation and reassociation of homodimers in vitro (Xia2016Structural).

In the context of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) transformation, CASTOR2, along with CASTOR1, acts as a tumor suppressor. Both proteins are downregulated by KSHV, which is crucial for maintaining the growth transformation of KSHV-transformed cells. Overexpression of CASTOR2 impairs proliferation and cellular transformation in these cells, indicating its role in inhibiting tumorigenesis (Li2019Kaposi). However, specific interactions of CASTOR2 with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature (Xia2016Structural; Li2019Kaposi).
