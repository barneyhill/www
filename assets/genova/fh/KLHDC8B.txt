# KLHDC8B

## Overview
KLHDC8B is a gene that encodes the protein kelch domain containing 8B, which is a member of the kelch protein family. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, consisting of seven kelch repeats that form a β-propeller configuration, facilitating protein-protein interactions crucial for its role in cell division processes, particularly cytokinesis (Krem2012The). Unlike other kelch proteins, KLHDC8B lacks additional domains such as the BTB/POZ domain, which may influence its specific functional roles (Krem2012The). The protein is predominantly active during mitosis, where it localizes to the midbody, playing a critical role in maintaining mitotic integrity and chromosomal stability (Salipante2009Mutations; Krem2012The). Disruptions in KLHDC8B function have been linked to mitotic errors and chromosomal instability, conditions that are associated with certain cancers, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma (Salipante2009Mutations; Krem2012The).

## Structure
KLHDC8B is a member of the kelch protein family, characterized by the presence of kelch motifs that form a β-propeller configuration. This protein is unique within its family as it contains seven kelch repeats and lacks other recognizable domains, such as the BTB/POZ domain, which are commonly found in other kelch proteins (Krem2012The). The β-propeller structure is typically involved in facilitating protein-protein interactions, which is crucial for the protein's role in cytokinesis and maintaining mitotic integrity (Krem2012The).

The molecular structure of KLHDC8B does not include additional domains beyond the kelch repeats, which distinguishes it from other proteins in the kelch family. This structural simplicity may influence its specific functional roles in cell division processes. The protein's ability to bind actin and participate in protein-protein interactions is essential for its function in cytokinesis and chromosomal stability (Krem2012The).

While the context does not provide detailed information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of KLHDC8B, these factors could potentially affect its function and interactions, as is common with many proteins. However, specific details on these aspects are not available in the provided context.

## Function
KLHDC8B is a kelch domain-containing protein that plays a critical role in maintaining mitotic integrity and chromosomal stability in healthy human cells. It is primarily active during mitosis, where it localizes to the midbody, a structure essential for the final stages of cell division, particularly cytokinesis (Salipante2009Mutations; Krem2012The). KLHDC8B is involved in the proper completion of abscission, ensuring the correct separation of daughter cells and preventing the formation of multinucleated cells (Salipante2009Mutations; Krem2012The).

The protein's function is linked to its ability to bind actin and participate in protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for cytokinesis (Krem2012The). Disruption of KLHDC8B, such as through knockdown experiments, leads to mitotic errors, centrosomal amplification, and chromosomal instability, resulting in conditions like aneuploidy and multinucleation (Krem2012The). These disruptions mimic pathological features seen in certain cancers, highlighting KLHDC8B's role in preventing chromosomal missegregation and maintaining genomic integrity (Krem2013Mitotic; Krem2012The).

KLHDC8B is expressed predominantly during the S phase of the cell cycle and is translated during mitosis and cytokinesis, indicating its specific role in these phases (Salipante2009Mutations). Its rapid degradation after cell division underscores its tightly regulated function in cell cycle progression (Salipante2009Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KLHDC8B gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and potentially other cancers. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of KLHDC8B, identified as a C to T substitution at position +28, has been associated with familial cHL. This variant is linked to reduced translation of the KLHDC8B protein, which may contribute to the development of the disease by affecting cytokinesis and leading to the formation of binucleated Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells, a hallmark of cHL (Salipante2009Mutations).

In addition to familial cases, KLHDC8B dysfunction has been observed in sporadic cHL, where loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in RS cells suggests somatic mutations may also play a role (Salipante2009Mutations). The gene's disruption, such as through chromosomal translocations, can lead to impaired cytokinesis and chromosomal instability, contributing to the multinucleation and aneuploidy characteristic of RS cells (Krem2013Mitotic; Krem2012The).

KLHDC8B's role in maintaining mitotic integrity and chromosomal stability suggests it may function as a tumor suppressor, with its dysfunction potentially increasing cancer risk through the formation of genetically unstable tetraploid cells (Salipante2009Mutations; Krem2012The).

## Interactions
KLHDC8B is a kelch domain-containing protein involved in maintaining chromosomal stability and proper mitotic function. It is known to participate in protein-protein interactions essential for cytokinesis. KLHDC8B accumulates in the midbody of the cytoplasmic bridge linking daughter cells during cell division, indicating its role in the final stages of cytokinesis (Salipante2009Mutations). The protein's interactions are crucial for preventing mitotic errors, centrosomal amplification, and chromosomal instability, which are key features of multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin lymphoma (Krem2012The).

KLHDC8B's function in cytokinesis is linked to its ability to bind actin and participate in protein-protein interactions, although it lacks additional recognizable domains that might limit its range of interactions compared to other kelch proteins (Krem2012The). The presence of a dominant-negative fusion protein, FuKG, which mimics KLHDC8B depletion, leads to multinucleation and centrosomal amplification, suggesting that KLHDC8B interacts with other proteins involved in spindle checkpoint regulation to maintain mitotic integrity (Krem2012The). These interactions are critical for ensuring proper chromosomal segregation and preventing aneuploidy, which is associated with increased cancer risk (Krem2012The).
