# EPHB4

## Overview
EPHB4 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor B4, a type I transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. This protein is a member of the Eph receptor family, which plays a pivotal role in cell signaling processes, particularly in angiogenesis, vascular development, and cell migration. The EPHB4 protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, including an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular kinase domain, which are essential for its function in cellular communication and signaling pathways (Salgia2018EphB4:; Chrencik2006Structural). EPHB4 specifically interacts with its ligand ephrinB2, forming a heterodimer that is crucial for regulating cell adhesion and boundary formation, thereby influencing tissue patterning and morphogenesis (Noren2004Interplay). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are critical for proper cardiovascular and lymphatic development, and mutations in EPHB4 have been linked to various vascular and lymphatic disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Lyons2021Mutations; MartinAlmedina2016EPHB4).

## Structure
The EPHB4 protein is a type I transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function. The extracellular region includes a globular ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich region with an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motif, and two fibronectin type III repeats (Salgia2018EphB4:). The intracellular region contains a juxtamembrane domain, a conserved tyrosine kinase domain, a sterile α-motif (SAM), and a PDZ binding motif (Chrencik2006Structural).

The tertiary structure of EPHB4 is characterized by a large, hydrophobic binding cavity and a flexible 'lid,' which are typical features of promiscuous receptors, yet EPHB4 shows specificity for its ligand ephrinB2 (Chrencik2006Structural). The EphB4-ephrinB2 complex forms a heterodimer, with the interface characterized by hydrophobic interactions involving specific loops of the receptor (Chrencik2006Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in the function of EPHB4, particularly in the activation of its kinase domain (Du2020The). The presence of splice variant isoforms may alter the function or localization of the protein, although specific variants are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
EPHB4 (EPH receptor B4) is a member of the Eph receptor family, which are receptor tyrosine kinases involved in cell signaling. In healthy human cells, EPHB4 plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, vascular development, and cell migration. It interacts with its ligand, ephrin-B2, to regulate cell adhesion and boundary formation, influencing tissue patterning and morphogenesis (Noren2004Interplay). EPHB4 is primarily active in endothelial cells and is essential for proper cardiovascular development and function.

In the mammary epithelium, EPHB4 is involved in cell differentiation and tissue morphogenesis. Its signaling is crucial for pattern formation, tissue compartmentalization, and guided cell migration (Kaenel2014Overexpression). EPHB4 overexpression in the mammary epithelium leads to an increase in bi-potent progenitor cells and shifts differentiation towards the luminal lineage, enhancing branching activity and stimulating angiogenesis (Kaenel2014Overexpression). This receptor also interacts with several signaling pathways, including integrin-mediated matrix interaction and cell-cell adhesion, influencing cell fate decisions and promoting vascularization (Kaenel2014Overexpression).

EPHB4's interaction with the Wnt signaling pathway is significant for mammary gland morphogenesis, affecting branching and cell fate control (Kaenel2014Overexpression). The receptor's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and proper development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EPHB4 gene are associated with several vascular and lymphatic disorders. Heterozygous mutations in EPHB4 can lead to human venous valve aplasia, resulting in a significant reduction in venous valves, early onset deep venous reflux, and venous insufficiency. This condition is more severe than those caused by mutations in other genes affecting venous valves, such as FOXC2 or GJC2 (Lyons2021Mutations). EPHB4 mutations are also linked to central conducting lymphatic anomaly (CCLA), characterized by lymphatic misbranching and venolymphatic dysfunction. These mutations often result in reduced phosphorylation and loss of function, affecting lymphatic development and signaling pathways (Li2018Pathogenic).

EPHB4 mutations can cause autosomal dominant lymphatic-related hydrops fetalis (LRHF), leading to subcutaneous edema and abnormal lymphatic development. These mutations disrupt the phosphorylation activity of EPHB4, crucial for lymphatic valve formation (MartinAlmedina2016EPHB4). Additionally, EPHB4 is implicated in vascular anomalies such as capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) and vein of Galen malformation (VGAM), often due to its interaction with RASA1 in regulating the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway (Chen2023EPHB4RASA1Mediated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of EPHB4 in vascular and lymphatic development and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
EPHB4 (EPH receptor B4) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling. One of the primary interactions is with its ligand ephrinB2, which is significant for angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity, largely due to the presence of a leucine residue at position 95 in EPHB4, which is critical for its specificity and binding strength to ephrinB2 (Chrencik2006Structural).

EPHB4 also forms part of a ternary complex with vascular endothelial receptor tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) and TIE2, which plays a role in endothelial cell functions. VE-PTP has been identified as a phosphatase that interacts with EPHB4, influencing its phosphorylation state and activity. This interaction is important for regulating endothelial cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (Drexler2019Vascular).

Additionally, EPHB4 is involved in the suppression of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway through its interaction with ephrinB2, which recruits p120-RasGAP. This interaction inhibits VEGF-induced proliferation and migration in endothelial cells, highlighting EPHB4's role as a negative regulator of this pathway (Kim2002EphB).
