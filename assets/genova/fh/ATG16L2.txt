# ATG16L2

## Overview
ATG16L2 is a gene that encodes the protein autophagy related 16 like 2, which is a member of the ATG16L family involved in the autophagy process. This protein plays a role in cellular homeostasis by participating in the formation of autophagosomes, essential structures for the degradation and recycling of cellular components. Structurally, the ATG16L2 protein is characterized by an N-terminal region, a coiled-coil domain, and seven WD repeats at the C-terminal region, which allow it to form complexes with other autophagy-related proteins such as Atg5 and Atg12 (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). Despite its structural similarities to ATG16L1, ATG16L2 exhibits distinct functional properties, including a weaker affinity for Rab33B, which may influence its role in specialized autophagy pathways rather than canonical autophagy (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). The gene is expressed ubiquitously across various tissues, and its dysfunction has been implicated in several diseases, including Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Yin2014Autophagyrelated; Ma2016A).

## Structure
ATG16L2 is a protein that belongs to the mammalian ATG16L family and is involved in autophagy. It is a novel isoform identified on human chromosome 11q13.4 and mouse chromosome 7 E3. The protein structure of ATG16L2 includes three main regions: an N-terminal region homologous to the ATG5-binding region of ATG16L1, a coiled-coil (CC) domain in the middle, and seven WD repeats at the C-terminal region (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). The N- and C-terminal regions are well conserved between ATG16L1 and ATG16L2, with 32.1% and 43.0% amino acid identity, respectively, while the M region has lower homology at 20.7% (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2).

ATG16L2 can form homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with ATG16L1, indicating its potential role in modulating autophagy efficiency (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). Two alternative splicing isoforms of ATG16L2 have been identified: Atg16L2α (short isoform, 602 amino acids) and Atg16L2β (long isoform, 623 amino acids), with Atg16L2β being the dominant form in most tissues (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). Despite its structural similarities to ATG16L1, ATG16L2 has a significantly weaker affinity for Rab33B, which may contribute to its distinct role in autophagy (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). The physiological function of ATG16L2 is not fully understood, but it may be involved in specialized types of autophagy rather than starvation-induced autophagy (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2).

## Function
ATG16L2 is a gene involved in the autophagy process, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and the degradation and recycling of cellular components. The protein encoded by ATG16L2 forms a complex with Atg5 and Atg12, which is essential for autophagosome formation, a key step in autophagy (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). Despite its ability to form this complex, ATG16L2 does not mediate canonical autophagy due to dysfunction in its coiled-coil domain and weaker binding affinity to Rab33B, which is important for autophagosome formation (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2).

ATG16L2 is expressed ubiquitously across various tissues and developmental stages in mice, similar to its isoform ATG16L1, but it is not required for starvation-induced autophagy (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). The protein can form homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with ATG16L1, potentially modulating autophagy efficiency by replacing ATG16L1 in the complex (Yin2014Autophagyrelated). ATG16L2 may be involved in specialized types of autophagy, such as the exclusion of infectious bacteria or clearance of insoluble aggregates in neural cells, rather than in canonical autophagy pathways (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2).

## Clinical Significance
The ATG16L2 gene has been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in autophagy and immune response regulation. In the context of Crohn's disease (CD), a missense SNP in the ATG16L2 gene, specifically rs11235604, has been identified as a risk factor in the Chinese population. The T allele of this SNP is associated with a 1.46-fold increase in CD incidence, and patients with the TT/CT genotype exhibit lower mRNA levels of ATG16L2, suggesting a link between reduced gene expression and disease susceptibility (Ma2016A).

ATG16L2 is also associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), where its expression is significantly reduced in patients compared to healthy controls. This reduction may lead to dysfunction in the Atg12-Atg5•Atg16 complex, affecting autophagy in T cells and potentially contributing to MS pathogenesis (Yin2014Autophagyrelated).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the ATG16L2 rs11235604 polymorphism has been studied, but no significant association with RA was found. However, genetic interactions between ATG16L1 and ATG16L2 polymorphisms suggest a shared genetic basis for RA and other autoimmune diseases (Mo2021Genetic).

## Interactions
ATG16L2 is a protein that participates in several interactions with other proteins, primarily within the context of autophagy. It forms a complex with Atg12 and Atg5, similar to its isoform Atg16L1, resulting in an approximately 800-kDa multimeric complex. This complex is crucial for LC3 lipidation, a key step in autophagosome formation (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). ATG16L2 interacts with Atg5 through its N-terminal domain, allowing it to form both homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with Atg16L1, despite low sequence similarity in their coiled-coil domains (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2).

ATG16L2 also exhibits E3-like activity in LC3 lipidation in vitro, although it is not essential for canonical autophagy due to dysfunction in its coiled-coil domain-containing middle region (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). Unlike Atg16L1, ATG16L2 has a significantly weaker interaction with Rab33B, with an EC50 value approximately a hundred times lower than that of Atg16L1 (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). Despite this, ATG16L2 maintains the same Rab-binding specificity as Atg16L1, interacting specifically with Rab33A/B but not with other Rabs (Ishibashi2011Atg16L2). These interactions suggest that while ATG16L2 shares some biochemical properties with Atg16L1, it does not mediate autophagy in the same manner.
