# FLRT2

## Overview
The FLRT2 gene encodes the fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 2, a type I single-pass transmembrane protein involved in various cellular and developmental processes. This protein is characterized by its large extracellular region, which includes leucine-rich repeats and a fibronectin type III domain, facilitating its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Burbach2019Latrophilin’s; Matsushima2019Leucine). FLRT2 functions as both a homophilic cell adhesion molecule and a heterophilic repulsive ligand, interacting with Unc5/Netrin receptors to influence cell migration, synapse formation, and vascular development (Li2021Expression; TaiNagara2017Placental). It is implicated in critical processes such as monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and cortical neuron migration, with its expression regulated by factors like RANKL and miRNA (Fang2023Fibronectin). Alterations in FLRT2 expression are associated with various pathologies, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ando2022Tumorspecific; Fleitas2021FLRT2).

## Structure
FLRT2 is a type I single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by a large extracellular region and a short intracellular region. The extracellular region includes 10 leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and a fibronectin type III domain. The LRR domain is described as an elongated, incurvated structure with inward-facing beta strands and outwardly extending loops (Burbach2019Latrophilin’s). FLRT2 interacts with various proteins, such as UNC5D and latrophilin, through its LRR domain, which is crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Burbach2019Latrophilin’s; Matsushima2019Leucine).

FLRT2 is involved in several cellular processes, including monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, where it interacts with the UNC5B receptor via its extracellular domain (Fang2023Fibronectin). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like glycosylation, which can affect its function and interactions. FLRT2 may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Fang2023Fibronectin). The structural details of FLRT2's primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not explicitly detailed in the available sources.

## Function
FLRT2 (fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 2) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular and developmental processes. It acts as a homophilic cell adhesion molecule and a heterophilic repulsive ligand for Unc5/Netrin receptors, playing a significant role in cell adhesion, migration, and synapse formation (Li2021Expression). FLRT2 is crucial for the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, a process mediated through the UNC5B receptor and the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for macrophage functions such as adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis (Fang2023Fibronectin).

In the central nervous system, FLRT2 is involved in regulating cortical migration during late gestation and is expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, contributing to axon guidance and synaptogenesis (Li2021Expression). It is also expressed in endothelial cells, where it plays a role in vascular development, particularly in the placental labyrinth, by interacting with the UNC5B receptor to mediate endothelial cell repulsion and organization (TaiNagara2017Placental). FLRT2's expression and function are regulated by various factors, including RANKL and miRNA, and its promoter hypermethylation is associated with certain cancers (Fang2023Fibronectin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FLRT2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and developmental disorders. In colorectal cancer, FLRT2 is highly expressed in the endothelial cells of abnormal vessels, correlating with poorer prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. Its expression is upregulated in response to oxidative stress, and high levels of FLRT2 are an independent risk factor for recurrence-free survival in colorectal cancer patients. The deletion of FLRT2 in endothelial cells reduces tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for colorectal cancer prognosis (Ando2022Tumorspecific).

In the context of brain development, FLRT2, along with FLRT3, plays a crucial role in the migration of cortical interneurons. Mutations or deletions in these genes can lead to abnormal interneuron distribution, potentially contributing to psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. FLRT2 acts as a chemorepellent, influencing interneuron distribution through interactions with Unc5 receptors, and disruptions in these processes can affect inhibitory circuits in the brain (Fleitas2021FLRT2).

FLRT2 is also essential for proper vascular development in the placenta. Its interaction with the UNC5B receptor is crucial for placental labyrinth formation, and deficiencies in FLRT2 lead to disorganized vasculature and embryonic lethality (TaiNagara2017Placental).

## Interactions
FLRT2, a fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein, engages in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling. FLRT2 interacts with other FLRT proteins through homophilic binding, primarily involving the concave surface of its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. This interaction is essential for cell adhesion and sorting, and mutations in this domain can reduce FLRT-FLRT binding affinity (Peregrina2020FLRTing).

FLRT2 also forms heterophilic interactions with Unc5 receptors, particularly Unc5D, through its ectodomain. This interaction involves the convex surface of the FLRT LRR domain and the Ig1 domain of Unc5 receptors, playing a role in neuronal migration and axon guidance by inducing repulsion and growth cone collapse in Unc5-expressing neurons (Peregrina2020FLRTing).

In addition, FLRT2 interacts with Latrophilins, specifically Lphn3, at glutamatergic synapses in hippocampal neurons. This interaction, mediated by the ectodomains of both proteins, is involved in synapse formation and maintenance. FLRT2, Lphn3, and Unc5D can form a ternary complex, which may further multimerize, enhancing cell adhesion properties (Peregrina2020FLRTing).

FLRT2's interaction with fibronectin influences cell adhesion and migration, particularly in the context of cancer metastasis (Bae2017Epigenetically). These interactions highlight FLRT2's role as both an adhesive and repulsive signal, depending on the cellular context and binding partners.
