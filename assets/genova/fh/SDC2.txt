# SDC2

## Overview
SDC2 is a gene that encodes the protein syndecan-2, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Syndecan-2 is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes glycosaminoglycan attachment sites essential for cell signaling and adhesion (Agere2018Syndecans). As a transmembrane protein, syndecan-2 plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, particularly through interactions with vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and its receptor VEGFR2, facilitating vascular development and neovascularization (Corti2019Nterminal). Beyond its physiological roles, SDC2 is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases, notably as a biomarker for colorectal cancer through its methylation status (Yue2022The). The gene's expression and regulation are also implicated in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Agere2018Syndecans).

## Structure
Syndecan-2 (SDC2) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of SDC2 includes a core protein that features glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, which are crucial for its function in cell signaling and adhesion (Agere2018Syndecans). The secondary structure of SDC2 involves regions of alpha helices, particularly within its transmembrane domain, which is essential for dimerization. This domain contains a GXXXG motif that facilitates strong homodimerization, contributing to the stability of the protein's quaternary structure (Chen2021Multiple; Agere2018Syndecans).

The tertiary structure of SDC2 is characterized by the folding of its alpha helices and beta sheets into a specific three-dimensional shape, although detailed structural models are not available due to the intrinsic disorder of the protein (Gondelaud2019Structures). SDC2's extracellular domain is involved in ligand binding and is enriched with glycine, alanine, glutamic acid, and proline residues, contributing to its intrinsic disorder (Gondelaud2019Structures). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common and play a significant role in its function, particularly in the sulfation of heparan sulfate chains, which is crucial for interactions with growth factors like VEGFA165 (Corti2019Nterminal).

## Function
Syndecan-2 (SDC2) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. In healthy human cells, SDC2 is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, particularly through its interaction with vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and its receptor VEGFR2. The N-terminal domain of SDC2 enhances the 6-O sulfation of its heparan sulfate chains, which is crucial for forming a stable complex with VEGFA165 and VEGFR2, thereby promoting VEGFR2 activation and signaling (Corti2019Nterminal).

SDC2 is expressed in endothelial and smooth muscle cells and is essential for proper vascular development and angiogenesis. Its deletion in mice results in impaired VEGFA-induced angiogenesis and delayed vascular development, highlighting its critical role in neovascularization (Corti2019Nterminal). SDC2 also influences cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling, which are vital for cell migration and proliferation (Corti2019Nterminal).

In cardiac tissue, SDC2 is implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization and cell migration, as well as in the sequestration of pro-fibrotic receptors, suggesting its involvement in cardiac remodeling and fibrosis (Mathiesen2020The). These functions underscore SDC2's importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
SDC2 (syndecan 2) is implicated in various diseases, primarily through alterations in its methylation status, which is a significant factor in colorectal cancer (CRC) detection. Aberrant methylation of the SDC2 gene is frequently observed in CRC tissues, making it a promising biomarker for early detection. Studies have shown that SDC2 methylation has high specificity and sensitivity for CRC diagnosis, with digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) demonstrating a sensitivity of 98.17% (Yue2022The). The methylation of SDC2 is also associated with precancerous lesions, indicating its potential as a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker (Oh2017Feasibility).

In addition to CRC, SDC2 methylation is observed in other cancers, such as gastric cancer and HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell cancer, although its clinical performance in these cancers requires further evaluation (Oh2017Feasibility). SDC2 is also involved in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, where its expression is altered. In rheumatoid arthritis, SDC2 plays a role in angiogenesis, suggesting it could be a therapeutic target for regulating new blood vessel formation (Agere2018Syndecans). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SDC2 in cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
Syndecan-2 (SDC2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor CD148 (PTPRJ), which leads to the de-phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and affects β1 integrin activation, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis by reducing endothelial cell migration (De2014Shed). In cardiac cells, SDC2 interacts with proteins such as CAVIN1 and CAVIN2 at caveolae sites, which are implicated in actin polymerization and fibroblast migration (Mathiesen2020The). 

SDC2 also forms complexes with syntenin-1, a PDZ domain-containing adapter protein, which is crucial for the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression and cell invasion in lung adenocarcinoma. This interaction facilitates the activation of NF-κB, a key regulator of cancer cell metastasis (Tsoyi2019Lung). In the cardiac context, SDC2's interactome includes proteins involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and protein metabolism, such as AP2A2 and CTTN, which are associated with endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton linkage (Mathiesen2020The). These interactions highlight SDC2's role in cell communication and its potential implications in various biological processes.
