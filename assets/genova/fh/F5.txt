# F5

## Overview
The F5 gene encodes coagulation factor V, a critical glycoprotein involved in the blood coagulation process. Coagulation factor V functions primarily as a cofactor in the prothrombinase complex, facilitating the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, a pivotal step in the coagulation cascade. This protein is categorized as a cofactor due to its role in enhancing the enzymatic activity of factor Xa (FXa) on phospholipid surfaces. Factor V circulates in plasma as an inactive procofactor and is activated to factor Va through proteolytic cleavage, which is essential for its procoagulant function. Additionally, factor V exhibits anticoagulant properties by acting as a cofactor for activated protein C (APC) in the inactivation of factor VIIIa, thus maintaining hemostatic balance. Mutations in the F5 gene can lead to bleeding disorders, such as Factor V deficiency and the East Texas bleeding disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in hemostasis (Dahlbäck2016Pro‐; Camire2011A; Nuzzo2014Characterization).

## Structure
Coagulation factor V (F5) is a large glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 330 kDa, composed of 2196 amino acids. Its primary structure includes a polypeptide chain organized into six domains: A1, A2, B, A3, C1, and C2 (Nuzzo2014Characterization; Camire2011A). The A and C domains are highly homologous to those of factor VIII, while the B domain is unique and contains charged clusters that maintain factor V in an inactive conformation (Dahlbäck2016Pro‐; Nuzzo2014Characterization).

The secondary structure of factor V features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its complex folding. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a stable conformation, with the A domains forming an integrated structure stabilized by calcium-dependent, noncovalent bonds (Dahlbäck2016Pro‐). The quaternary structure is characterized by the interaction of factor V with other proteins, particularly in its active form, factor Va, which consists of a heavy chain (A1-A2) and a light chain (A3-C1-C2) linked by a calcium ion (CASTOLDI2011Homozygous).

Post-translational modifications of factor V include glycosylation, which is crucial for its function and stability (Bernal2021High). Factor V also has splice variant isoforms, such as FV-Short, which can affect its function and interaction with other proteins (Dahlbäck2016Pro‐).

## Function
The F5 gene encodes coagulation factor V, a crucial protein in the blood coagulation process. In healthy human cells, factor V functions as a cofactor in the prothrombinase complex, which is essential for converting prothrombin to thrombin, a key step in the coagulation cascade. This conversion occurs on the surface of activated platelets and is facilitated by the interaction of factor V with factor Xa (FXa) and calcium ions (Dahlbäck2016Pro‐; Camire2011A). 

Factor V circulates in plasma as an inactive procofactor and is activated to factor Va through proteolytic cleavage by thrombin or FXa, which removes the B domain and generates a heavy chain and a light chain. The heavy chain interacts with FXa and prothrombin, while the light chain binds to membrane phospholipids, enhancing the procoagulant activity of the prothrombinase complex (Kanaji2008Identification; De2022The). 

In addition to its procoagulant role, factor V also has anticoagulant properties. It acts as a cofactor for activated protein C (APC) in the inactivation of factor VIIIa and enhances the anticoagulant efficacy of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) by binding to the TFPI-protein S complex (Dahlbäck2016Pro‐; De2022The). This dual functionality is crucial for maintaining hemostatic balance and preventing excessive coagulation or bleeding.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the F5 gene can lead to several bleeding disorders due to their impact on coagulation factor V (FV). One such condition is Factor V deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a range of bleeding symptoms, from mild mucosal bleeding to severe life-threatening hemorrhages. This deficiency is primarily caused by loss-of-function mutations in the F5 gene, including missense, nonsense, and splicing mutations, which impair FV synthesis or function (Nuzzo2014Characterization).

A specific synonymous mutation, c.1296+268A>G, causes aberrant splicing, leading to FV deficiency by introducing a pseudo-exon with an in-frame stop codon, resulting in a dysfunctional protein (Nuzzo2014Characterization). Another mutation, c.373+2T>C, affects the donor splice site, likely causing exon skipping and contributing to severe bleeding phenotypes (Nuzzo2014Characterization).

The F5 gene is also associated with the East Texas bleeding disorder, an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation that up-regulates an alternatively spliced FV isoform, FV-Short. This isoform has a higher affinity for tissue factor pathway inhibitor alpha (TFPIα), leading to increased TFPIα levels and a bleeding tendency (Nuzzo2014Characterization; Dahlbäck2017Novel).

## Interactions
Coagulation factor V (F5) is a critical component in the blood coagulation process, primarily acting as a cofactor in the prothrombinase complex, which converts prothrombin to thrombin. F5 interacts with factor Xa (FXa) to form the prothrombinase complex on phospholipid membranes, significantly enhancing the catalytic efficiency of FXa (Steen2002Thrombinmediated). The activation of F5 to its active form, FVa, involves thrombin-mediated proteolysis at specific arginine residues, which exposes the FXa-binding site by releasing the B-domain (Steen2002Thrombinmediated).

F5 also interacts with activated protein C (APC), which regulates its activity by cleaving specific peptide bonds, notably at Arg306 and Arg506. The Arg506 site is particularly significant due to the FV Leiden mutation, which leads to APC resistance and an increased risk of thrombosis (Dahlbäck2017Novel). F5 acts as a synergistic cofactor with protein S in the regulation of factor VIIIa in the tenase complex (Dahlbäck2017Novel).

Additionally, F5 binds to tissue factor pathway inhibitor alpha (TFPIa), forming a complex that may influence TFPIa stability and its anticoagulant role. This interaction is particularly relevant in FV-deficient patients and in cases involving the FV-East Texas mutation, which increases TFPIa levels and inhibits thrombin generation (Camire2016Rethinking).
