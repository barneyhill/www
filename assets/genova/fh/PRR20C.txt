# PRR20C

## Overview
PRR20C is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 20C, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by a high content of proline residues. These proteins are often involved in protein-protein interactions due to their structural properties, which allow them to serve as scaffolds or adaptors in various cellular processes. The specific biological functions of the proline-rich 20C protein remain to be fully elucidated, but it is hypothesized to play a role in cellular signaling pathways and structural organization within the cell. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in health and disease, particularly in the context of their potential involvement in signaling pathways and cellular architecture (Qiu2020aarFDC).
