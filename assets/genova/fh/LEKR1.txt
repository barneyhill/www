# LEKR1

## Overview
The LEKR1 gene encodes the protein leucine, glutamate, and lysine rich 1, which is implicated in various biological processes and health conditions. While the specific functions of the LEKR1 protein are not fully characterized, it is suggested to play a role in the myosin complex, potentially influencing muscle structure and function (Loers2022SUBATOMIC:). Genetic studies have linked variants of the LEKR1 gene to several health conditions, including epithelial ovarian cancer and differences in carotid intima-media thickness, indicating its involvement in cancer susceptibility and vascular health (Dong2015Genetic; Permuth2016Exome). Additionally, LEKR1 has been associated with metabolic traits such as birth weight and insulin release, although its direct role in metabolic diseases remains unclear (Andersson2011The). The gene's potential involvement in inflammatory bowel disease further suggests a role in immune regulation and gut microbiota (Hu2020Whole). Despite these associations, the precise molecular interactions and pathways involving the LEKR1 protein require further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
The LEKR1 gene has been implicated in several health conditions through its genetic variants. A study by Permuth et al. identified a missense variant, rs62273959, in the LEKR1 gene that is strongly associated with an increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). This variant, located at the 3q25.31 locus, showed significant association with EOC risk, particularly in serous histology, suggesting a potential role in the disease's genetic basis (Permuth2016Exome).

In another study, a genetic variant near the LEKR1 gene, rs900400, was associated with lower birth weight and increased insulin release following an oral glucose challenge. This variant was studied in the context of its potential link to insulin-related metabolic processes, although it was not directly associated with type 2 diabetes or other metabolic traits in adults (Andersson2011The).

Additionally, rare and deleterious variants in the LEKR1 gene have been identified in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), suggesting a role in regulating the gut microbiota. However, the clinical significance of these variants in relation to specific diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Hu2020Whole).

## Interactions
The LEKR1 gene, while not extensively characterized, has been implicated in several potential interactions based on its module context and genetic associations. In a functional enrichment analysis, LEKR1 was found in a gene module associated with cellular components such as the muscle myosin complex, myosin filament, and sarcomere. This suggests a potential role for LEKR1 in the myosin complex, although specific protein interactions involving LEKR1 were not detailed (Loers2022SUBATOMIC:).

In genetic studies, a variant within LEKR1, rs62273959, has been associated with epithelial ovarian cancer risk, indicating a possible involvement in pathways related to cancer susceptibility. However, the specific protein interactions of LEKR1 in this context remain undefined (Permuth2016Exome).

Additionally, LEKR1 has been identified as a potential modifier gene for sex differences in carotid intima-media thickness, with certain SNPs showing sex-specific effects. This suggests that LEKR1 may interact with pathways involved in vascular health, possibly through its role in weight and adipose tissue control, although direct protein interactions are not specified (Dong2015Genetic). Overall, while LEKR1's precise interactions are not fully elucidated, its genetic associations suggest involvement in significant biological processes.
