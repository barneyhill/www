# CTXND2

## Overview
CTXND2 is a gene that encodes the protein cortexin domain containing 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a cortexin domain, suggesting a role in neural development and function. While the specific biological functions of cortexin domain containing 2 are not fully elucidated, it is believed to participate in intracellular signaling pathways and may have implications in neurodevelopmental disorders. Research into the CTXND2 gene and its encoded protein continues to uncover its potential interactions and clinical significance, particularly in the context of neurological health.
