# GUF1

## Overview
The GUF1 gene encodes the GTP-binding elongation factor GUF1, a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the fidelity of mitochondrial protein synthesis. As a GTPase, GUF1 is involved in the back-translocation of tRNA on ribosomes, a process essential for reducing translational errors, particularly under stress conditions such as extreme pH or low temperatures (Alfaiz2015West; Li2018Mitochondrial). The protein is characterized by a unique C-terminal domain that facilitates tRNA binding, ensuring accurate protein synthesis within the mitochondrial matrix (Alfaiz2015West). GUF1's function is crucial for the assembly of respiratory chain supercomplexes, which are vital for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production (Li2018Mitochondrial). Mutations in the GUF1 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, including West syndrome and developmental epileptic encephalopathy, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial and neurological health (Alfaiz2015West; Bariş2023Importance).

## Structure
The GUF1 protein is a GTPase involved in mitochondrial function, specifically in translation elongation. It is encoded by the GUF1 gene and features a universally conserved structure across eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The protein includes a C-terminal Domain (CTD) that is unique to GUF1 and plays a crucial role in binding tRNA via a beta-sheet structure. This domain is essential for the protein's function in back-translocating tRNA on ribosomes, which helps reduce translational error rates, particularly under stress conditions (Alfaiz2015West).

The GUF1 protein's primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids, with a notable variant at position 609 where an alanine is substituted by a serine (p.Ala609Ser). This variant is located within the KIIARETV stretch of the external beta-strand of the CTD tRNA-binding moiety, which is important for tRNA recognition. The substitution introduces a bulkier residue, potentially altering the beta-sheet's position relative to the alpha-helix or interfering with the tRNA acceptor stem (Alfaiz2015West).

The protein's secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its three-dimensional folding and function. The tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's functional conformation (Alfaiz2015West).

## Function
The GUF1 gene encodes a GTP-binding protein that functions as a mitochondrial elongation factor, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. GUF1 is involved in ensuring the fidelity of translation by facilitating the back-translocation of tRNA on ribosomes, which helps reduce translational error rates. This function is particularly important under stress conditions, such as extreme pH environments or when there is a proton gradient around mitochondria (Alfaiz2015West; Li2018Mitochondrial).

GUF1 is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and is associated with the inner membrane, where it binds to ribosomes in a GTP-dependent manner. This binding is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and proper assembly of mitochondrial translation products, particularly under suboptimal conditions like low temperatures and nutrient limitations (Bauerschmitt2008The). The protein's activity is essential for the production of functional membrane proteins, such as cytochrome oxidase, by ensuring that translation products form functional complexes (Bauerschmitt2008The).

In healthy human cells, GUF1 contributes to the assembly of respiratory chain supercomplexes, which are vital for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production. Its role in mitochondrial translation is linked to the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation complexes and the production of reactive oxygen species (Li2018Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GUF1 gene have been implicated in several neurological and mitochondrial disorders. A notable condition associated with GUF1 mutations is West syndrome, a severe epileptic encephalopathy characterized by infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and developmental regression. In a consanguineous family, a homozygous variant c.1825G>T, resulting in an alanine to serine substitution at position 609 (p.Ala609Ser), was identified in three siblings with West syndrome. This variant is believed to affect mitochondrial function by altering the protein's interaction with tRNA, potentially disrupting mitochondrial protein synthesis and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Alfaiz2015West).

The GUF1 variant has also been associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, as reported in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. However, this association is considered provisional due to limited evidence supporting the pathogenic consequences of the variant (Rausell2020Common).

In another study, a different GUF1 mutation, c.1402_1403delGA (p.Glu468Ilefs*15), was identified in patients with developmental epileptic encephalopathy. This mutation was classified as likely pathogenic, highlighting the role of GUF1 in developmental neurological disorders (Bariş2023Importance).

## Interactions
GUF1, a GTP-binding protein, plays a crucial role in mitochondrial translation by interacting with ribosomal subunits. It facilitates the back-translocation of tRNAs during protein synthesis, which is essential for maintaining translation fidelity. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal domain (CTD) of GUF1, which binds to tRNA molecules via a beta-sheet structure. The interaction is critical for the proper recognition of the tRNA acceptor stem and D-loop, ensuring accurate protein synthesis (Alfaiz2015West).

The GUF1 protein is also associated with the inner membrane of mitochondria, where it binds to ribosomes in a GTP-dependent manner. This binding is similar to the bacterial elongation factor LepA, indicating a conserved function across species. GUF1's role as a fidelity factor in mitochondrial protein synthesis is particularly important under suboptimal conditions, such as low temperatures, where it helps prevent translation errors and coordinates the synthesis and folding of new proteins (Bauerschmitt2008The).

In yeast, GUF1 has been shown to interact with mitochondrial ribosomes, and its absence leads to reduced translation efficiency and impaired growth under stress conditions, highlighting its role in maintaining mitochondrial function (Bauerschmitt2008The).
