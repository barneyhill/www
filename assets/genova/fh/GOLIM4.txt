# GOLIM4

## Overview
GOLIM4 is a gene that encodes the Golgi integral membrane protein 4, a type II transmembrane protein predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of secretory vesicles and protein trafficking within cells. As a scaffold protein, it facilitates the biogenesis of secretory vesicles by interacting with other proteins such as ATP2C1 and GOLPH3, which are essential for processes like Ca2+-dependent cargo loading and Golgi membrane bending. Additionally, GOLIM4 is involved in maintaining intracellular manganese homeostasis, which is vital for various cellular functions. The gene is located on the chromosomal 3q amplicon and is implicated in several cancers, particularly squamous carcinomas, due to its role in secretory vesicle biogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2024Chromosomal).

## Structure
GOLIM4, or Golgi integral membrane protein 4, is characterized by its structure as a type II transmembrane protein. It features a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, which is followed by a single transmembrane helix. This helix anchors the protein within the membrane of the Golgi apparatus. The protein also includes a large C-terminal luminal domain, which is involved in the transport and processing of proteins within the Golgi.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in GOLIM4 and may influence its function and stability. Glycosylation typically occurs in the luminal domain, which is exposed to the Golgi lumen where these modifications are added.

GOLIM4 is known to have multiple splice variant isoforms. These isoforms can result in variations in the protein's function and localization within the cell. The presence of these isoforms suggests a level of functional diversity, allowing GOLIM4 to participate in various cellular processes related to protein transport and processing.

The specific details of the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of GOLIM4 are not provided in the available context. Therefore, further structural analysis would be required to elaborate on these aspects.

## Function
GOLIM4, or Golgi integral membrane protein 4, is a Golgi-resident protein involved in the regulation of secretory vesicles and protein trafficking within the cell. It acts as a scaffold protein, coordinating the biogenesis of secretory vesicles in the Golgi apparatus by recruiting other proteins such as ATP2C1 and GOLPH3. This coordination facilitates processes like Ca2+-dependent cargo loading, Golgi membrane bending, and vesicle scission, which are crucial for maintaining the secretory pathway (Tan2024Chromosomal).

GOLIM4 is also involved in maintaining intracellular manganese (Mn) homeostasis by binding excess Mn in the Golgi lumen, leading to its degradation in lysosomes. This function is particularly relevant in maintaining the balance of Mn within cells, which is essential for various cellular processes (Tan2024Chromosomal).

In addition to its role in protein trafficking, GOLIM4 has been implicated in maintaining the cytoskeletal integrity of podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney, by influencing the arrangement of F-actin stress fibers. This suggests a broader role in cellular structure and function, although the exact mechanisms remain to be further validated (Lu2017Genome-wide).

## Clinical Significance
The GOLIM4 gene, located on the chromosomal 3q amplicon, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in secretory vesicle biogenesis and cargo loading. Amplification of the 3q region, which includes GOLIM4, is observed in several squamous carcinomas, such as those of the lung, esophagus, and head and neck. High expression of GOLIM4 correlates with shorter survival durations in cancer patients, indicating its protumorigenic role (Tan2024Chromosomal). Depletion of GOLIM4 in 3q-amplified cells reduces tumor viability, migratory activity, and colony-forming ability, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2024Chromosomal).

GOLIM4 is also involved in maintaining intracellular manganese homeostasis. Its degradation can be induced by manganese treatment, which inhibits the progression of 3q-amplified malignancies (Tan2024Chromosomal). In addition to its role in cancer, GOLIM4 is mentioned as a somatic mutation gene in circulating cell-free DNA from a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, suggesting its involvement in other cancer types (Song2018Case). While GOLIM4's role in neurological conditions is not directly established, its interaction with manganese-sensitive proteins suggests potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases (Hirst2018Role).

## Interactions
GOLIM4, a Golgi-resident protein, participates in several key interactions that are crucial for its role in secretory vesicle biogenesis and tumorigenesis. It acts as a scaffold protein, interacting with ATP2C1 and GOLPH3, which are essential for Ca2+-dependent cargo loading and Golgi membrane bending (Tan2024Chromosomal). The interaction between GOLIM4 and ATP2C1 is mediated by the intraluminal domain of GOLIM4, which includes an alternatively spliced exon. This interaction is crucial for the secretory and tumorigenic activities of cancer cells (Tan2024Chromosomal).

GOLIM4 also interacts with the BAG6-UBL4A-GET4 protein complex and GGA1, which are involved in membrane protein targeting and transmembrane receptor sorting, respectively. These interactions are particularly significant under conditions of elevated manganese, which induces GOLIM4 degradation (Tan2024Chromosomal). Sortilin is another protein that interacts with GOLIM4, mediating its manganese-induced trafficking to lysosomes (Venkat2017Manganeseinduced).

These interactions highlight GOLIM4's role in maintaining intracellular homeostasis and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in 3q-amplified malignancies (Tan2024Chromosomal).
