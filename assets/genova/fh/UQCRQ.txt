# UQCRQ

## Overview
The UQCRQ gene encodes a protein subunit of mitochondrial complex III, also known as ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein, categorized as a transmembrane protein, is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Su2020Quantitative). The UQCRQ protein is integral to maintaining the structural and functional integrity of mitochondria, which are vital for energy production and various cellular processes. Dysfunction in the UQCRQ gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to a range of diseases, including mitochondrial complex III deficiency (FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear; Feichtinger2017Combined).

## Structure


## Function
The UQCRQ gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex III, also known as ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a significant role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Su2020Quantitative). In healthy human cells, UQCRQ is involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of mitochondria, which are vital for energy production and various cellular processes, including biosynthetic metabolic modulation, cellular signaling, and cell death (Su2020Quantitative).

UQCRQ is in close contact with MT-CYB within the complex III structure, suggesting its role in the early stages of complex III assembly. It potentially stabilizes the structure of cytochrome b, ensuring the proper function of the electron transport chain (FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear). The proper function of UQCRQ is critical for the efficient operation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and dysfunctions in this gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which has been implicated in various diseases (Su2020Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UQCRQ gene, which encodes a structural subunit of mitochondrial complex III, are associated with mitochondrial complex III deficiency. This condition can lead to severe clinical manifestations, including a Leigh-like syndrome characterized by profound mental and extrapyramidal signs. A specific deleterious mutation, c.208C > T in exon 2, results in a p.Ser45Phe amino acid change and has been identified in a large consanguineous Israeli Bedouin family. Affected individuals appear normal at birth but experience delayed development and progressive neurological symptoms, with some surviving into their thirties (FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear; Feichtinger2017Combined).

The mutation in UQCRQ leads to reduced activity of complex III in skeletal muscle, contributing to the observed clinical symptoms. This deficiency affects energy production in cells, resulting in muscle weakness and neurological issues (FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear). The UQCRQ gene is embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane and interacts closely with MT-CYB, which is crucial for the proper assembly and function of complex III (FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear). The clinical significance of UQCRQ mutations underscores the importance of this gene in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.

## Interactions
UQCRQ, a subunit of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (Complex III), is involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It plays a role in facilitating electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. UQCRQ is part of a larger protein-protein interaction network within Complex III, interacting with other subunits such as cytochrome b and cytochrome c1. These interactions are crucial for the proper assembly and function of Complex III, which is essential for mitochondrial respiration and energy production (Fan2020CYC1).

In the context of kidney transplant rejection, UQCRQ has been identified as a key gene within a module of co-expressed genes that correlate with post-transplant days. This module, identified through Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), suggests that UQCRQ may have interactions that are significant in the biological processes related to transplant rejection (Fan2020CYC1).

Although specific transient interactions of UQCRQ with other proteins like C12ORF73 have been reported, these interactions were not strongly supported in subsequent studies, indicating that UQCRQ's primary role remains within the structural and functional framework of Complex III (Dennerlein2021Defining).
