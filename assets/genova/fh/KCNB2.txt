# KCNB2

## Overview
KCNB2 is a gene that encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily B member 2, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of electrical excitability in neurons and other excitable cells. This protein is integral to the function of voltage-gated potassium channels, which are essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and facilitating the repolarization phase of action potentials. KCNB2 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and heart, where it influences neuronal firing patterns and cardiac electrical activity, respectively. The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation by factors such as microRNA-1, which can impact conditions like atrial fibrillation. Mutations in KCNB2 have been associated with several clinical conditions, including Brugada syndrome and certain lymphomas, highlighting its significance in both neurological and cardiac health (Juang2014DiseaseTargeted; Jia2013MicroRNA1; Doyle1998Ataxia; Lee2019Characteristic).

## Function
KCNB2 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel protein that plays a crucial role in regulating membrane potential and electrical excitability in neurons. This protein is primarily active in the plasma membrane of neurons, where it contributes to action potential repolarization and influences neuronal firing patterns. By modulating synaptic transmission, KCNB2 impacts neural circuit function, affecting processes such as cognition and motor control (Doyle1998Ataxia).

In the context of cardiac function, KCNB2 is expressed in the heart and influences cardiac potassium currents, although its specific role in cardiac function is less clear compared to other potassium channels like KCNE1. The study by Jia et al. suggests that miR-1 upregulation leads to reduced expression of KCNB2, which may contribute to the shortening of the atrial effective refractory period and enhance atrial fibrillation inducibility (Jia2013MicroRNA1).

KCNB2 is also involved in insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, where it contributes to the delayed outward potassium current. However, its role in insulin exocytosis is less clear, as its inhibition has variable effects on β-cell electrical function and insulin secretion (Fu2017Kv2.1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCNB2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In primary gastrointestinal T- and NK-cell lymphomas (GI-TNKLs), mutations in KCNB2 were found in 22% of samples, particularly affecting the ion transport and Kv2 channel domains. These mutations, such as Arg307Cys, are predicted to cause significant defects in channel function, and low KCNB2 protein expression is associated with poorer overall survival in systemic mature T- and NK-cell lymphomas (Lee2019Characteristic).

In the context of cardiac conditions, KCNB2 mutations have been linked to Brugada syndrome (BrS), a cardiac arrhythmic disease associated with sudden cardiac death. Specific mutations like Glu522Lys and Arg460Gly in KCNB2 have been identified in patients with BrS, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Juang2014DiseaseTargeted).

Additionally, KCNB2 is involved in atrial fibrillation (AF) vulnerability. The gene is targeted by microRNA-1, which regulates its expression, leading to changes in atrial effective refractory period and cardiac currents. This regulation is associated with increased vulnerability to AF (Jia2013MicroRNA1).
