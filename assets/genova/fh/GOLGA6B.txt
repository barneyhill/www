# GOLGA6B

## Overview
GOLGA6B is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family member B, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. Golgin A6 family member B is thought to play a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the Golgi apparatus. Although the precise biological functions of GOLGA6B are not fully elucidated, its involvement in cellular processes suggests it may be crucial for normal cellular operations and development. Alterations in the expression or mutations of GOLGA6B have been linked to various pathological conditions, including certain cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its potential importance in disease pathogenesis and as a target for therapeutic intervention (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the GOLGA6B gene have been implicated in various diseases, including certain cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders. As a member of the golgin family, GOLGA6B is associated with the Golgi apparatus, which plays a crucial role in maintaining Golgi structure and function. Disruptions in GOLGA6B can lead to abnormalities in these cellular processes, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis. The exact mechanisms by which GOLGA6B mutations or expression changes lead to these conditions are not fully understood, necessitating further research to elucidate its clinical implications. Understanding the role of GOLGA6B in these diseases could provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for intervention.
