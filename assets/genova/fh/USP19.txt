# USP19

## Overview
USP19 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 19, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein stability and function through the removal of ubiquitin moieties. This enzyme is characterized by its modular structure, which includes a conserved USP catalytic domain, CHORD-SGT1/P23 domains, and a MYND Zn-finger domain, contributing to its diverse functional roles in cellular processes (Rossi2022Emerging; Zhu2007High). USP19 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with some isoforms localized in the cytoplasm and others associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, where they may play roles in autoinhibition and protein interactions (Rossi2022Emerging; Lee2014Characterization). Functionally, USP19 is implicated in cell cycle regulation, autophagy, and apoptosis, and it interacts with various proteins, including Hsp90 and components of the hypoxia pathway, to modulate these processes (Altun2012Ubiquitinspecific; Jin2016USP19; Lu2009USP19). Clinically, alterations in USP19 expression have been associated with cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (He2016Cytoplasmic; Kang2021USP19).

## Structure
USP19 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by a modular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains a highly conserved USP catalytic domain with essential Cys and His boxes, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Rossi2022Emerging). The protein also features two CHORD-SGT1/P23 domains at its N-terminus, which are important for protein interactions and regulation of the catalytic core (Rossi2022Emerging). USP19 has a unique structural arrangement with a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain nested within its catalytic core, positioned between a β-strand and an α-helix, and a MYND Zn-finger domain following the UBL domain (Zhu2007High).

USP19 is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can affect its activity and stability (Rossi2022Emerging). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with some isoforms localized in the cytoplasm and others anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum via a transmembrane domain (Rossi2022Emerging). This transmembrane domain is suggested to play a role in autoinhibition by interacting with the catalytic domain (Lee2014Characterization). The structural complexity of USP19, including its domain organization and post-translational modifications, contributes to its diverse functional roles in cellular processes.

## Function
USP19 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by removing ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability and function. In healthy human cells, USP19 is involved in cell cycle regulation by stabilizing KPC1, a ubiquitin ligase for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1. This stabilization promotes cell proliferation by facilitating the degradation of p27 Kip1, which is crucial for the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (Lu2009USP19).

USP19 also interacts with the molecular chaperone Hsp90, which enhances its deubiquitinating activity. This interaction is specific to USP19 and is crucial for maintaining its activity, particularly under conditions of low substrate availability (Lee2014Characterization). Additionally, USP19 is involved in the regulation of autophagy by stabilizing Beclin-1, a key component of the autophagy machinery. This stabilization is dependent on USP19's catalytic activity and is essential for modulating autophagic flux (Jin2016USP19).

USP19 is primarily localized in the cytosol, where it performs its deubiquitinating functions, although it was previously thought to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (Lee2014Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of USP19 have been linked to various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC), low expression of USP19 is associated with cancer recurrence and poor prognosis. This suggests that USP19 may play a role in modulating DNA damage repair and maintaining chromosomal stability, with its downregulation contributing to tumorigenesis (Rossi2022Emerging; Kang2021USP19). 

In breast cancer, USP19 has two splice variants, USP19-CY and USP19-ER, which have opposing roles in TGF-β signaling. USP19-CY enhances TGF-β signaling and is associated with poor prognosis, while USP19-ER inhibits this pathway. The differential expression of these variants can influence cancer progression and may serve as potential therapeutic targets (Zhang2023Opposing).

USP19 also affects cell proliferation by regulating the degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1. In prostate cancer, USP19 promotes cell growth by facilitating the transition from G1 to S phase, although this regulatory function may be altered in certain cancer cells (Lu2009USP19; Lu2011Identification). 

In neurodegenerative diseases, USP19, particularly the USP19_b isoform, modulates the aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded proteins, such as ataxin-3 and huntingtin, through its interaction with the HSP90 chaperone. This interaction may influence the aggregation and stability of these proteins, impacting diseases characterized by protein aggregation (He2016Cytoplasmic).

## Interactions
USP19, a deubiquitinating enzyme, engages in several protein interactions that influence its function and regulatory roles. It specifically interacts with the heat shock protein Hsp90, forming a stable complex that enhances its deubiquitinating activity. This interaction is mediated by the catalytic domain of USP19 and is unique among USP family members (Lee2014Characterization). USP19 also interacts with Hsp70/Hsc70, although this interaction is less specific compared to Hsp90 (Lee2014Characterization).

USP19 is involved in the hypoxia pathway through its interaction with hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). It stabilizes HIF-1α independently of its deubiquitinating activity, indicating a non-catalytic role in hypoxia regulation (Altun2012Ubiquitinspecific). Additionally, USP19 interacts with Siah1 and Siah2, components of the hypoxia pathway (Altun2012Ubiquitinspecific).

In the context of apoptosis regulation, USP19 interacts with c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and XIAP proteins, stabilizing c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 through mechanisms that are both dependent and independent of its deubiquitinating activity (Mei2011The). USP19 also associates with itself, preventing its own degradation through self-deubiquitination (Mei2011The).

USP19's interaction with the KPC1 subunit of the KPC ubiquitin ligase complex plays a role in cell cycle regulation by stabilizing KPC1, which in turn affects the degradation of p27 Kip1 (Lu2009USP19). These interactions highlight USP19's involvement in various cellular processes, including stress responses, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation.
