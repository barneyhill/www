# PRPF6

## Overview
PRPF6 is a gene that encodes the pre-mRNA processing factor 6, a protein integral to the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. This protein is characterized by its involvement in the assembly and function of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, acting as a molecular bridge that facilitates interactions between various spliceosomal components. Structurally, PRPF6 contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) elements, LxxLL motifs, and a leucine zipper motif, which are essential for its role in protein-protein interactions and transcriptional regulation (Song2020Splicing). Beyond its fundamental role in RNA splicing, PRPF6 also functions as a coactivator of the androgen receptor, influencing transcriptional activity in certain cancers (Song2020Splicing). Mutations in the PRPF6 gene have been linked to diseases such as autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and potentially neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Tanackovic2011A; Wood2021The).

## Structure
PRPF6 is a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing, characterized by a complex molecular structure. It consists of 941 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 102 kDa (Song2020Splicing). The protein contains 19 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) elements, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, and these elements are crucial for its function in the spliceosome (Song2020Splicing). Additionally, PRPF6 includes two LxxLL motifs and a leucine zipper motif, which are structural features that contribute to its role as a coactivator in transcriptional regulation (Song2020Splicing).

The tertiary structure of PRPF6 is characterized by a beta-propeller fold, a common structural motif in proteins that mediate interactions with other proteins. This structure is supported by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are known to form such folds (Adler2014An). PRPF6 also contains thirteen half TPR (HAT) domains and a coiled-coil (CC) domain, which are involved in its interaction with other spliceosomal proteins (Fritze2023Pathogenic).

PRPF6 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function in spliceosome assembly and its interactions with other proteins (Adler2014An). These structural features and modifications highlight the protein's role in the formation and function of the spliceosome complex.

## Function
PRPF6 is a crucial component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. It plays a significant role in the assembly and function of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a critical part of the spliceosome. PRPF6 acts as a bridging protein, facilitating interactions between the U5 and U4/U6 snRNPs through protein-protein interactions. It interacts with several proteins within the tri-snRNP, including hSnu66, hPrp3, and hPrp31, and contains multiple HAT and TPR repeats that enable these interactions (Liu2006The).

PRPF6 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the structural rearrangement necessary for the activation of the spliceosome, potentially transmitting a 'power stroke' to disrupt the U4/U6 snRNA helices. This function is essential for the catalytic activation of the spliceosome, highlighting its importance in RNA splicing processes in healthy human cells (Liu2006The). The protein also serves as a scaffold that bridges U5 and U4/U6 snRNPs during the assembly of tri-snRNPs, which are essential for spliceosome function (Yang2021Pre-mRNA). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the spliceosome, impacting gene expression regulation and cellular processes like cell cycle progression and differentiation (Liu2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRPF6 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) and potentially neurodegenerative Kufs disease. The first identified mutation linked to retinitis pigmentosa was a heterozygous c.2185C>T (p.Arg729Trp) variant, which disrupts the interaction with the U4/U6 di-snRNP, leading to impaired tri-snRNP assembly and inefficient splicing of certain introns. This mutation results in the accumulation of PRPF6 in Cajal bodies, indicating defective snRNP maturation (Tanackovic2011A; Wood2021The). Other missense variants, such as p.Arg172Trp and p.Asp184Gly, have been identified in Chinese RP patients, while the p.Asn477Ser variant is associated with Kufs disease and visual impairment (Wood2021The).

In addition to its role in genetic disorders, PRPF6 is implicated in cancer, particularly colon cancer. Overexpression of PRPF6 acts as an oncogenic driver by altering the splicing of gene isoforms, such as the oncogenic ZAK kinase long isoform (ZAK-LF). Knockdown of PRPF6 in cancer models has been shown to reduce tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Adler2014An). The differential splicing effects of PRPF6 mutations in retinitis pigmentosa versus cancer remain to be fully understood (Wood2021The).

## Interactions
PRPF6 is a crucial component of the spliceosome, specifically involved in the formation and stability of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex. It acts as a molecular bridge linking the U5 snRNP with the U4/U6 snRNPs, facilitating the assembly of the tri-snRNP complex essential for pre-mRNA splicing (Liang2022Aberrant; Tanackovic2011A). PRPF6 interacts with several proteins within the tri-snRNP complex, including PRPF31, PRPF8, and SNRNP200, which are vital for the structural integrity and function of the spliceosome (Adler2014An; Tanackovic2011A).

In addition to its role in splicing, PRPF6 has been identified as a coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR) in hepatocellular carcinoma, enhancing AR-mediated transcriptional activity. This interaction occurs independently of androgen treatment and involves the recruitment of AR to androgen response elements, promoting AR self-transcription and contributing to cancer progression (Song2020Splicing).

PRPF6 also interacts with the USH1G/SANS protein, with pathogenic variants in USH1G/SANS affecting this interaction. These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the spliceosome and are implicated in the pathogenesis of certain diseases (Fritze2023Pathogenic).
