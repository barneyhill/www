# AKR1A1

## Overview
AKR1A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme aldo-keto reductase family 1 member A1, a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols, utilizing NADPH as a cofactor. It plays a significant role in detoxifying reactive carbonyl compounds and is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress. AKR1A1 is highly expressed in the liver and kidney, where it contributes to the detoxification of harmful substances and the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid. The enzyme's activity is essential for cellular health, influencing processes such as the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and the regulation of oxidative damage (Penning2007Human; Takahashi2012In; Fujii2021Pleiotropic).

## Structure
AKR1A1, a member of the aldo-keto reductase family, is characterized by a conserved (β/α)8 barrel structure, also known as a TIM barrel fold, which is common among aldo-keto reductases (Stomberski2019Protein). This enzyme functions as a monomer, indicating it does not form quaternary structures (Stomberski2019Protein). The active site of AKR1A1 includes a tetrad of amino acids: tyrosine, aspartate, histidine, and lysine, with the catalytic tyrosine residues being conserved throughout the family (Stomberski2019Protein). 

AKR1A1 is involved in the reduction of S-nitroso-CoA (SNO-CoA) and is expressed in most mammalian tissues, with high activity in the kidney and liver (Stomberski2019Protein). It plays a role in detoxifying lipid peroxides and cytotoxic products, and is involved in ascorbic acid biosynthesis (Lan2022AldoKeto). The enzyme may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. There is no mention of splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The AKR1A1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde reductase, which is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the detoxification of aldehydes and ketones by catalyzing their reduction to corresponding alcohols in an NADPH-dependent manner. AKR1A1 is involved in the detoxification of reactive carbonyl compounds, such as methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic byproduct of glycolysis, converting it to less harmful substances like acetol and lactoaldehyde (O’CONNOR1999Major; Fujii2021Pleiotropic).

AKR1A1 is highly expressed in tissues such as the liver and kidney, where it contributes to maintaining cellular health by mitigating oxidative damage and detoxifying harmful substances (O’CONNOR1999Major). The enzyme also plays a role in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxidizing trans-dihydrodiol metabolites to o-quinones, which are involved in further metabolic activation of PAHs (Palackal2001The).

In addition to its detoxification functions, AKR1A1 is involved in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid, acting as both glucuronate reductase and glucuronolactone reductase, which are essential for maintaining normal ascorbic acid levels in tissues (Takahashi2012In). The enzyme's activity is crucial for cellular redox balance and protection against oxidative stress, contributing to the overall health and function of human cells (Penning2007Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AKR1A1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In cancer, elevated expression of AKR1A1 is observed in many cancer cells, where it plays a dual role. It can protect against carcinogenesis through detoxification of carcinogens, but it may also promote cancer development by reducing the effectiveness of cancer treatments. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the AKR1A1 gene, the homozygous Akr1a1 (282T -> C) variant, is linked to a 1.7-fold increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Fujii2021Pleiotropic).

In alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), AKR1A1 has a protective function by reducing the accumulation of toxic aldehydes like 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Downregulation of AKR1A1 is observed in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, and its deficiency is associated with increased liver damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation (Lan2024Aldoketo).

In schizophrenia, specific variants of the AKR1A1 gene, such as the c.753G > A mutation, lead to exon skipping and a loss of enzymatic activity. This variant is associated with higher glucuronate levels, which may contribute to treatment-resistant schizophrenia by promoting drug excretion (Iino2021AKR1A1).

## Interactions
The human gene AKR1A1, encoding the enzyme aldehyde reductase, participates in several interactions with other proteins that influence its function. One notable interaction is with the tumor suppressor SMAR1, which is involved in cell cycle regulation. In mice, the interaction between SMAR1 and AKR1A (specifically AKR1A4) is inhibitory, as SMAR1 directly binds to and inhibits AKR1A4. The activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase can lead to the dissociation of the SMAR1-AKR1A4 complex, resulting in the activation of AKR1A4 and subsequent cell cycle arrest (Fujii2021Pleiotropic).

AKR1A1 is also involved in the metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). It co-expresses with CYP1A1 and epoxide hydrolase (EH) in multiple tissues, suggesting a role in the formation of PAH o-quinones, which are reactive and can form DNA adducts, contributing to carcinogenesis (Palackal2001Metabolic). However, specific details on direct physical interactions with nucleic acids or the formation of multiprotein complexes are not provided in the available context.
