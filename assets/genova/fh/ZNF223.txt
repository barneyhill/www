# ZNF223

## Overview
ZNF223 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 223, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's ability to bind DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and various cellular processes. Zinc finger protein 223 is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in regulating gene expression. The protein's function can be modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which affect its activity and stability. Additionally, alternative splicing of ZNF223 may result in different isoforms, each potentially having distinct functions or cellular localizations. This versatility underscores the protein's adaptability and significance in cellular regulation and its involvement in diverse biological pathways (Smebye2014Chromosome).

## Structure
ZNF223 is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains. These domains are small protein motifs that coordinate zinc ions, which help stabilize their folds and facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. The protein typically exhibits a modular structure, with multiple zinc finger motifs contributing to its function. This modularity allows ZNF223 to interact with various molecular targets, potentially influencing gene expression and cellular processes.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination can affect the activity and stability of ZNF223. These modifications may play a role in regulating the protein's function and interactions within the cell. Additionally, splice variants of ZNF223 may exist, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions or localization. These isoforms could contribute to the protein's versatility in cellular processes, allowing it to perform various roles depending on the cellular context.

The structural characteristics of ZNF223, including its zinc finger domains and potential post-translational modifications, highlight its importance in cellular regulation and its potential involvement in diverse biological pathways. The existence of splice variants further underscores the complexity and adaptability of this protein within the zinc finger protein family.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF223 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ovarian carcinomas due to its association with DNA gains and increased gene expression. In a study focusing on chromosome 19 rearrangements in ovarian carcinomas, ZNF223 was identified as having a strong association between DNA gain and upregulated expression. Specifically, 67% of samples with DNA amplification of ZNF223 showed overexpression, compared to only 2% of samples without amplification (Smebye2014Chromosome). This suggests that ZNF223 may play a significant role in the development of ovarian carcinomas through its altered expression levels.

The study also highlighted that ZNF223 was among the zinc finger genes with the strongest association between DNA gain and increased expression, with gene expression in samples with DNA gains being more than two-fold higher than in other samples (Smebye2014Chromosome). This overrepresentation of zinc finger genes, including ZNF223, in regions of DNA gain suggests a potential mechanism by which these genes contribute to ovarian carcinogenesis (Smebye2014Chromosome).

While the study provides evidence of the association between ZNF223 and ovarian carcinoma, it does not offer direct information on the clinical significance of ZNF223 gene mutations or their implications in diseases beyond ovarian carcinoma (Smebye2014Chromosome).
