# FAM184B

## Overview
FAM184B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 184 member B. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions remain to be fully elucidated. The FAM184B protein is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it is implicated in several biological pathways and conditions. Research has highlighted its role in epigenetic regulation, particularly through DNA methylation, which affects gene expression in response to environmental factors such as smoking. Alterations in the methylation status of FAM184B have been associated with diseases like orolaryngeal cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggesting its potential as a biomarker for these conditions (Hernández2023Aberrant; WillisOwen2018COPD).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The FAM184B gene has been implicated in several health conditions through alterations in its DNA methylation patterns. In heavy smokers, FAM184B exhibits hypermethylation in oral tissues, which may serve as a biomarker for smoking-related changes and potentially for conditions such as orolaryngeal cancer (Hernández2023Aberrant). The gene's hypermethylation has also been observed in oral cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, suggesting a role in cancer pathogenesis (Hernández2023Aberrant). 

In the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), FAM184B is downregulated in the quadriceps muscle, indicating a possible link to muscle dysfunction associated with the disease (WillisOwen2018COPD). This downregulation is part of broader transcriptional changes affecting mitochondrial and extracellular matrix functions in COPD patients.

The gene's methylation status is also altered in newborns of mothers who smoked during pregnancy, highlighting its potential involvement in developmental changes due to environmental factors (Hernández2023Aberrant). These findings suggest that FAM184B's epigenetic modifications could be significant for noninvasive screening and precision medicine applications.
