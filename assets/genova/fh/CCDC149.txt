# CCDC149

## Overview
The CCDC149 gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 149, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting a potential role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC149 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in genetic alterations, such as the CCDC149-ALK fusion, has been documented in clinical contexts. This fusion has been associated with metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma, indicating a possible role in oncogenesis and highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Lee2022Case).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The CCDC149 gene has been implicated in a novel genetic alteration involving the CCDC149-ALK fusion, which has clinical significance in metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This fusion was identified in a 30-year-old woman with radioiodine-refractory PTC, highlighting its potential role in the disease's progression. The presence of the CCDC149-ALK fusion was confirmed in both the primary thyroid tumor and multiple metastatic samples, suggesting its consistent involvement in the patient's cancer pathology (Lee2022Case).

The clinical relevance of the CCDC149-ALK fusion is underscored by the patient's positive response to treatment with alectinib, an ALK inhibitor. This targeted therapy led to significant clinical improvements, including the regression of palpable disease and a marked decrease in serum thyroglobulin levels, which are indicative of tumor burden. The sustained response over 13 months further supports the therapeutic potential of targeting this genetic alteration in similar cases (Lee2022Case).

The case report recommends deep mutational sequencing in BRAF V600E-negative radioiodine-refractory PTC to identify targetable genetic alterations, such as the CCDC149-ALK fusion, which may offer substantial therapeutic benefits (Lee2022Case).
