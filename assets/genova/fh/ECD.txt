# ECD

## Overview
The ECD gene encodes the ecdysoneless cell cycle regulator protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in cell cycle regulation and progression. This protein is categorized as a cell cycle regulator and is involved in the release of E2F transcription factors through its interaction with the Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein family, facilitating the transcription of genes necessary for cell cycle progression (Zhao2012Overexpression). Beyond its role in the cell cycle, the ecdysoneless protein is implicated in pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA biogenesis, and nuclear export, interacting with components such as Prp8 and DDX39A (Claudius2014Unexpected; Mohapatra2022Ecdysoneless). It also plays a role in cellular stress responses, including endoplasmic reticulum stress, and regulates p53 stability, which is crucial for the genotoxic stress response (Mohapatra2022Ecdysoneless). The protein's interactions with various cellular components underscore its importance in maintaining cellular proliferation and survival, with significant implications in oncogenesis, particularly in cancers associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) (Mirza2021Ecdysoneless).

## Function
The ECD gene encodes the ecdysoneless protein, which plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and progression in healthy human cells. ECD functions by interacting with the Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein family, facilitating the release of E2F transcription factors from their repressive complexes. This release is essential for the transcription of E2F target genes, which are necessary for cell cycle progression (Zhao2012Overexpression). The protein is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, interacting with components of the spliceosome such as Prp8, and is crucial for the splicing of pre-mRNAs with large introns (Claudius2014Unexpected). ECD is also implicated in mRNA biogenesis and nuclear mRNA export, interacting with RNA biogenesis components like DDX39A (Mohapatra2022Ecdysoneless).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, ECD is involved in mitigating cellular stress, including endoplasmic reticulum stress, and regulates p53 stability, which is important for the genotoxic stress response (Mohapatra2022Ecdysoneless). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with RNA polymerase II and other transcription factors, maintaining cellular proliferation and survival, which are crucial for organismal development and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The Ecdysoneless (ECD) gene is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and interaction with other oncogenic factors. In breast cancer, ECD overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in HER2/neu-overexpressing patients. It promotes mammary tumorigenesis by upregulating c-MYC and glucose metabolism, leading to shorter patient survival and increased tumor aggressiveness (Zhao2012Overexpression; Mohapatra2022Ecdysoneless). ECD's role in breast cancer is further highlighted by its correlation with higher histological grades and its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhao2012Overexpression).

In cervical cancer, ECD is overexpressed and acts as a binding partner to HPV16 E6, contributing to oncogenesis by regulating viral and cellular mRNA splicing. This interaction is crucial for sustaining oncogenic traits and is linked to poor prognosis in cervical and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (Mirza2021Ecdysoneless). ECD knockdown in cervical cancer cell lines results in reduced proliferation and altered splicing patterns, indicating its significant role in cancer progression (Mirza2021Ecdysoneless).

Overall, ECD overexpression and its interactions with oncogenic pathways are critical in the development and progression of several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
The Ecdysoneless (ECD) protein interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. ECD is known to bind with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoproteins, particularly HPV16 E6, through its C-terminal region. This interaction is crucial in the context of HPV-driven cancers, as ECD is involved in the splicing of E6/E7 RNA and other cellular RNAs linked to oncogenesis (Mirza2021Ecdysoneless).

ECD also interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (RB), RUVBL1, and PIH1D1, which are components of the R2TP cochaperone complex. This complex is part of the HSP90 cochaperone complex known as the PAQosome, which facilitates the assembly of ribonucleoproteins essential for the biogenesis of large protein-protein complexes (Mirza2021Ecdysoneless). ECD's interaction with PRPF8, a key component of the spliceosome machinery, suggests its role in RNA splicing (Mohapatra2022Ecdysoneless).

In gastric cancer, ECD interacts with hnRNP F via its N-terminal STG1 domain, stabilizing hnRNP F by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZFP91. This interaction promotes cancer cell migration and invasion (Xu2018ECD).
