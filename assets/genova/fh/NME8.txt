# NME8

## Overview
NME8 is a gene that encodes the protein NME/NM23 family member 8, which is part of the NME/NM23 family of nucleoside diphosphate kinases. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, comprising an N-terminal thioredoxin domain and three C-terminal nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) domains, which are crucial for its function in cellular processes (Zhu2024Nme8). NME8 plays a significant role in ciliary function and motility, particularly in ciliated structures such as respiratory epithelial cells and sperm cells, where it contributes to the assembly and stabilization of axonemal dynein arms (Boissan2009The; Desvignes2009Nme). The protein's involvement in DNA repair and redox balance further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhu2024Nme8). Mutations in the NME8 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary movement, highlighting its clinical significance in respiratory health and fertility (Boissan2009The).

## Structure
The NME8 protein, also known as non-metastatic family member 8, is part of the NME/NM23 family and is characterized by a specific molecular structure that includes an N-terminal thioredoxin domain and three C-terminal nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) domains (Zhu2024Nme8). The thioredoxin domain functions as an antioxidant, playing a crucial role in maintaining intracellular redox stability by reducing protein disulfides and participating in DNA and protein repair through redox-dependent signaling pathways (Zhu2024Nme8). This domain is also involved in the rapid removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by providing electrons to peroxiredoxins, which helps maintain redox balance (Zhu2024Nme8).

NME8 exhibits 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, suggesting a role in DNA repair and proofreading (Zhu2024Nme8). In mice, NME8 is specifically expressed in the testis and incorporated into the fibrous sheaths of the sperm tail, indicating its involvement in sperm tail maturation (Zhu2024Nme8). The protein's structure and function may be influenced by post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The study also notes the potential for splice variant isoforms, which could contribute to structural and functional diversity, but specific isoforms are not described (Zhu2024Nme8).

## Function
The NME8 gene, also known as NM23-H8, is a member of the NME/NM23 family of nucleoside diphosphate kinases and plays a crucial role in ciliary function and motility. It is primarily expressed in ciliated structures, such as the respiratory epithelial cells and sperm cells, where it contributes to the assembly and stabilization of axonemal dynein arms, essential for the movement of cilia and flagella (Boissan2009The; Desvignes2009Nme). 

In healthy human cells, NME8 is involved in the organization of sperm axonemes, which are critical for sperm motility and male fertility (Desvignes2009Nme). The protein is characterized by a thioredoxin domain followed by three tandemly repeated NDP kinase domains, although no thioredoxin activity has been detected (Desvignes2009Nme). NME8 also exhibits exonuclease activity, which may contribute to its functional roles in cellular processes (Adam2020NME/NM23/NDPK).

Mutations in the NME8 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary movement, leading to chronic respiratory tract infections and male infertility (Boissan2009The). This highlights the gene's importance in maintaining normal ciliary function and respiratory health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NME8 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function. This condition leads to chronic respiratory tract infections, randomization of left-right body asymmetry, and male infertility due to the failure of cilia movement (Boissan2009The; Zhu2024Nme8). Specific mutations, such as a nonsense mutation (p.Leu426X) and an intronic variant (c.271-27 C > T), have been linked to PCD, affecting ciliary function and leading to symptoms like reduced sperm motility and testis damage under stress conditions (Zhu2024Nme8).

Alterations in NME8 expression have also been implicated in chemotherapy-induced reproductive toxicity. In mice, NME8 plays a protective role against cisplatin-induced testicular damage by maintaining redox homeostasis and facilitating DNA repair processes. NME8 deficiency results in increased oxidative stress and DNA damage, affecting spermatogenesis and sperm motility (Zhu2024Nme8).

Additionally, NME8 has been identified as a candidate gene in breast cancer predisposition, with certain variants found in patients from families negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, suggesting a potential role in cancer susceptibility (Shahi2019Identification).

## Interactions
NME8, a member of the NME/NM23 family, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in ciliary function. It shares domain arrangement similarities with dynein intermediate chains, suggesting a role in sperm axonemal organization and ciliary movement (Desvignes2009Nme). NME8 is an integral component of the fibrous sheet of spermatozoa and is associated with the axoneme, a structure critical for ciliary and flagellar movement (Boissan2009The). 

Although specific protein interactions of NME8 are not extensively detailed, its involvement in ciliary function implies interactions with components of the axonemal structure, such as dynein and tubulin, which are essential for the assembly and function of dynein arms in cilia (Ćetković2014Nme). The presence of a thioredoxin domain in NME8, despite lacking detectable thioredoxin activity, suggests potential interactions with other proteins involved in redox processes, although these interactions remain to be fully elucidated (Desvignes2009Nme). 

NME8's role in primary ciliary dyskinesia, a condition characterized by defective ciliary movement, further underscores its importance in maintaining proper ciliary function through these interactions (Boissan2009The).
