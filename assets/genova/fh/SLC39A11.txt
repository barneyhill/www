# SLC39A11

## Overview
SLC39A11 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 11, which is a zinc transporter belonging to the ZIP (Zrt-, Irt-like Protein) family. This protein is primarily localized to the plasma membrane and plays a critical role in zinc homeostasis by facilitating the influx of zinc ions into the cytosol from extracellular spaces or intracellular compartments (Kambe2015The). As a member of the LIV-1 subfamily of ZIP transporters, SLC39A11 is characterized by specific structural motifs that may regulate zinc transport and are essential for cellular trafficking and zinc uptake (Kambe2015The). The protein's function is vital for various cellular processes, including enzyme activity, gene expression, and cell signaling, impacting physiological processes such as cell development, growth, differentiation, and death (Wang2022Role; Bafaro2017The). SLC39A11 has also been implicated in the progression of certain diseases, including lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2022Role).

## Function
SLC39A11, a member of the solute carrier family 39, is involved in zinc transport across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in maintaining zinc homeostasis. This gene encodes a protein that functions as a zinc transporter, facilitating the influx of zinc into the cytosol from extracellular spaces or intracellular compartments (Kambe2015The). The protein is primarily localized to the plasma membrane and is involved in replenishing cytosolic zinc, which is essential for various cellular processes, including enzyme function, gene expression, and cell signaling (Kambe2015The).

SLC39A11 is part of the LIV-1 subfamily of ZIP transporters, characterized by specific motifs that may regulate zinc transport by forming disulfide bonds, which are important for cellular trafficking and zinc uptake (Kambe2015The). The protein's activity in zinc ion transport is essential for cellular homeostasis, impacting physiological processes such as cell development, growth, differentiation, and death (Bafaro2017The). Although the specific function of SLC39A11 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in zinc transport suggests it is vital for maintaining intracellular zinc balance and overall cellular health (Wang2022Role).

## Clinical Significance
SLC39A11 has been implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma, a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer. Studies have shown that SLC39A11 is significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues, and its high expression levels are associated with lower patient survival rates (Wang2022Role). Knockout experiments in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines indicate that silencing SLC39A11 inhibits cell proliferation, cloning, and migration, while promoting apoptosis and suppressing the cell cycle, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2022Role). The gene's expression is also linked to the regulation of the cell cycle and migration in lung adenocarcinoma cells (Wang2022Role).

Beyond cancer, SLC39A11 has been associated with other conditions, such as Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome 2 and acrodermatitis, due to its role in maintaining zinc ion balance within cells (Wang2022Role). However, specific clinical implications of SLC39A11 mutations or expression alterations in these conditions are not fully elucidated. The gene's involvement in pathways like metal ion SLC transporters and the Nrf2 pathway further underscores its potential impact on various physiological and pathological processes (Wang2022Role).
