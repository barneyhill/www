# USP17L2

## Overview
USP17L2 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 2, also known as DUB3. This protein is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, which is involved in the deubiquitination process, a critical mechanism for regulating protein degradation and cellular signaling. As a cysteine protease, USP17L2 plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription factors such as Slug and Twist, which are essential for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Albertsen2019Whole). The protein is also implicated in DNA repair mechanisms and cell cycle regulation, influencing cell proliferation and survival (Fraile2017Functional; Ducker2021USP17-mediated). Due to its involvement in these processes, USP17L2 is of interest in the study of diseases such as cancer and endometriosis, where its expression and activity may be altered, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Albertsen2019Whole).

## Function
USP17L2, also known as DUB3, is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, which plays a critical role in deubiquitination, a process essential for regulating protein degradation and cellular signaling. In healthy human cells, USP17L2 is involved in several key molecular processes. It regulates transcription factors such as Slug and Twist by interacting with and stabilizing them through deubiquitination. These transcription factors are crucial for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that provides cells with increased plasticity necessary during embryonic development and tissue remodeling (Albertsen2019Whole).

USP17L2 also plays a role in DNA repair mechanisms by controlling H2AX ubiquitination, which is vital for the DNA damage response and maintaining genome stability (Fraile2017Functional). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in regulating the cell cycle, particularly influencing cell proliferation and survival (Ducker2021USP17-mediated). Its activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which is important for its catalytic function (Ducker2021USP17-mediated). Overall, USP17L2's regulation of these processes is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Albertsen2019Whole).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the USP17L2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly endometriosis and cancer. In a study of a family with a high incidence of endometriosis, hemizygous deletions in the USP17L2 gene were identified, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of the condition. The loss of USP17L2 may affect mesothelial integrity, increasing the risk of endometriosis by allowing endometrial cells to adhere to the peritoneal stroma (Albertsen2019Whole).

USP17L2 is also suggested as a potential biomarker for ovarian cancer prognosis. Its inhibition might be a strategy for treatment, as it regulates transcription factors involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (Albertsen2019Whole). The gene's involvement in EMT suggests that alterations in its expression could contribute to cancer progression by facilitating cell migration and invasion.

Overall, the clinical significance of USP17L2 lies in its potential role in the development and progression of endometriosis and certain cancers, making it a target for further research and potential therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
USP17L2, also known as DUB3, is a member of the USP17 subfamily of cysteine proteases and plays a significant role in regulating key cellular processes through its deubiquitinating activity. It interacts with and stabilizes transcription factors such as Slug and Twist by de-ubiquitination, which are crucial in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. EMT is associated with tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, indicating that USP17L2's interactions with these transcription factors are vital for cellular transformation and cancer progression (Albertsen2019Whole).

The study by Albertsen et al. suggests that the dosage-dependent loss of USP17L2 may impact mesothelial integrity, potentially increasing the risk of developing endometriosis. This implies that USP17L2's interactions are not only critical in cancer biology but also in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing disease (Albertsen2019Whole). The gene's role in these processes highlights its importance in cellular signaling pathways and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by aberrant EMT and related pathologies.
