# USP34

## Overview
USP34 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 34) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme, which is a type of protease involved in the removal of ubiquitin from proteins. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. The protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 34 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, differentiation, DNA repair, and signaling pathways, such as the Wnt signaling pathway (Li2018Expression). By modulating the stability of key proteins like β-catenin and RNF168, USP34 influences cellular homeostasis and genome stability, making it essential for normal cellular function and organismal development (Sy2013The). Its dysregulation has been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2024Stabilization; Li2018Expression).

## Structure


## Function
USP34 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 34) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein degradation, localization, and activity. It is involved in the ubiquitin proteasome system, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, differentiation, DNA repair, and signaling pathways (Li2018Expression).

USP34 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences key signaling pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway. By stabilizing β-catenin, USP34 modulates Wnt signaling, which is crucial for cell growth and development (Li2018Expression). This regulation is important for maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal development.

In the context of DNA repair, USP34 is involved in the DNA damage response, particularly at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It stabilizes the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168, which is essential for the assembly of DNA damage-repair factors. This stabilization prevents the rapid degradation of RNF168, ensuring proper ubiquitylation at DSBs and facilitating the recruitment of repair proteins like BRCA1 and 53BP1 (Sy2013The). The activity of USP34 in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining genome stability and cell survival under genotoxic stress (Sy2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of USP34 have been implicated in various cancers. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), USP34 expression is significantly higher compared to reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Overexpression of USP34 in DLBCL is associated with older age, the germinal center B cell-like subtype, multiple extranodal involvements, and higher International Prognostic Index scores. However, there is no significant association between USP34 protein levels and patient survival, although low USP34 mRNA expression is linked to poor disease-free survival (Li2018Expression).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), USP34 is preferentially expressed in glioma stem cells (GSCs) and is crucial for maintaining their tumorigenic capacity. Disruption of USP34 impairs GSC maintenance and reduces tumor growth, suggesting its role in promoting GBM progression (Zhu2024Stabilization).

In pancreatic cancer, downregulation of USP34 inhibits the growth and migration of cancer cells and induces apoptosis. This effect is mediated through the inhibition of PRR11 and the inactivation of several signaling pathways, highlighting USP34 as a potential therapeutic target (p&gt; Downregulation; Lin2020&lt).

USP34 also plays a role in DNA damage response by stabilizing the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168, which is essential for the assembly of DNA damage-repair factors. Its absence leads to impaired recruitment of repair proteins and compromised cell survival following ionizing radiation (Sy2013The).

## Interactions
USP34, a ubiquitin-specific protease, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with axin, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it regulates axin stability by opposing tankyrase-dependent ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for maintaining axin homeostasis and modulating Wnt signaling (Lui2011The).

USP34 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78, protecting it from proteasomal degradation. This interaction is significant for the regulation of lipid droplet formation and the broader biological functions of gp78, including its roles in cell signaling and metabolism (Wang2019The).

In the context of DNA damage response, USP34 interacts with RNF168, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in DNA repair. USP34 stabilizes RNF168 by deubiquitylating it, which is essential for effective DNA damage signaling and repair (Sy2013The).

In glioma stem cells, USP34 interacts with Pin1, a process enhanced by the phosphorylation of Pin1 by Plk1. This interaction is crucial for the maintenance of glioma stem cells and the growth of glioblastoma tumors (Zhu2024Stabilization).
