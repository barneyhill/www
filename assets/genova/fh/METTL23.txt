# METTL23

## Overview
The METTL23 gene encodes the protein methyltransferase 23, arginine, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This protein is involved in the transfer of methyl groups to various substrates, a process that is crucial for numerous cellular functions, including epigenetic regulation and cellular differentiation (Bernkopf2014Disruption; Khan2020Two). METTL23 is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is essential for normal neuronal development and function, with disruptions in its activity linked to intellectual disabilities (Smaili2020Exome; Bernkopf2014Disruption). The gene's role in methylation processes underscores its importance in maintaining cognitive development and function (Khan2020Two). Mutations in METTL23 have been associated with intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal recessive 44, and other neurodevelopmental conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Zha2024Identification; Khan2020Two).

## Structure
The METTL23 protein is encoded by the METTL23 gene and is believed to function as a methyltransferase. It has two isoforms: isoform 1, which is 190 amino acids long, and isoform 2, which is 123 amino acids long (Bernkopf2014Disruption). The protein's structure includes a typical methyltransferase fold with a binding site for the methylation cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) (Bernkopf2014Disruption). The 3D structure of METTL23 was modeled using templates from the Protein Data Bank, revealing a SAM/SAH-binding site involving 25 residues, half of which are conserved among similar proteins (Bernkopf2014Disruption). 

The protein's tertiary structure was modeled using the Phyre2 server, which selected templates with 19-26% sequence identity to METTL23, including human methyltransferase-like proteins 21A and 21D (Bernkopf2014Disruption). The SWISS-MODEL was also used to build the 3D model, indicating high structural reliability due to the sequence similarity with other methyltransferase-like proteins (Khan2020Two). The METTL23 protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and forms aggregates in the cytoplasm when mutated, suggesting its subcellular localization is crucial for its function (Bernkopf2014Disruption).

## Function
The METTL23 gene encodes a protein that functions as a methyltransferase, specifically predicted to be S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent, which catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to various substrates such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small metabolites (Bernkopf2014Disruption; Khan2020Two). This methylation process is crucial for regulating multiple cellular mechanisms, including epigenetic modifications that influence tissue differentiation and proliferation (Bernkopf2014Disruption). 

In healthy human cells, METTL23 is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane for isoform 1, while isoform 2 is primarily localized in the nucleus (Bernkopf2014Disruption). The protein's proper folding and activity are essential for its function, as misfolded variants lack methyltransferase activity (Bernkopf2014Disruption). METTL23 is involved in normal neuronal development and function, potentially through its interaction with chaperone proteins like GroEL, which is homologous to human heat shock protein HSP60 (Smaili2020Exome). 

Disruptions in METTL23 function can lead to intellectual disabilities, highlighting its role in the development and function of the central nervous system (Bernkopf2014Disruption). The gene's involvement in methylation processes suggests its critical role in maintaining normal cognitive development and function (Khan2020Two).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the METTL23 gene are associated with intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal recessive 44, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability (ID), and variable dysmorphic features. Clinical phenotypes linked to METTL23 variants include developmental delays in motor and language skills, seizures, specific facial features, abnormal brain MRI findings, and behavioral problems such as autism and ADHD (Zha2024Identification). A novel variant was identified in a Chinese girl with global developmental delay and multiple facial deformities, expanding the spectrum of METTL23 gene variants related to ID (Zha2024Identification).

Studies have identified homozygous missense and frameshift mutations in METTL23, which are highly conserved and predicted to be damaging, leading to intellectual disability and cognitive impairment (Smaili2020Exome; Khan2020Two). These mutations are associated with autosomal recessive inheritance patterns and are often found in consanguineous families (Khan2020Two). Dysmorphic features associated with METTL23-related ID include macrocephaly, brachycephaly, and specific facial characteristics (Smaili2020Exome).

The METTL23 gene has also been implicated in normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), where a mutation affects the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, linking it to neurodegenerative processes (Liu2023Epigenetics).
