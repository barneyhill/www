# UBE4B

## Overview
UBE4B is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitination factor E4B, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein functions as an E3/E4 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the polyubiquitination of target proteins, thereby marking them for degradation. Ubiquitination factor E4B is involved in various cellular processes, including protein homeostasis, DNA damage response, and regulation of signaling pathways. It is characterized by the presence of a U-box domain, which is crucial for its E3 ligase activity, and a UBA domain, which aids in binding ubiquitin. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may differ in function. UBE4B's involvement in critical cellular functions underscores its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Sirisaengtaksin2014UBE4B; Antoniou2019The).

## Structure
UBE4B is a protein encoded by the human gene UBE4B, playing a significant role in the ubiquitination process. The protein contains several important domains that contribute to its function. Notably, it includes a U-box domain, which is essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This domain facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzymes to substrate proteins, marking them for degradation. Additionally, UBE4B possesses a UBA domain, which is responsible for binding ubiquitin, further supporting its role in polyubiquitination.

The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. UBE4B may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for variations in its structure and potentially its function. These isoforms can result in differences in the presence or absence of specific domains, affecting the protein's overall activity and interactions within the cell.

The structural complexity of UBE4B, with its multiple domains and potential isoforms, underscores its versatile role in cellular processes related to protein degradation. The precise arrangement and interaction of these domains are crucial for its function in the ubiquitination pathway.

## Function
UBE4B, also known as ubiquitination factor E4B, is a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, functioning as an E3/E4 ubiquitin ligase. It facilitates the polyubiquitination of target proteins, marking them for degradation, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes (Antoniou2019The). UBE4B is involved in the degradation of membrane proteins, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), by interacting with the ESCRT-0 complex to promote lysosomal trafficking and degradation. This process is vital for regulating EGFR levels and downstream signaling pathways, impacting cellular proliferation and signaling (Sirisaengtaksin2014UBE4B).

In addition to its role in protein degradation, UBE4B is implicated in the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. It acts as a regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53, promoting its polyubiquitination and degradation, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Antoniou2019The). UBE4B is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to protein quality control and cellular homeostasis (Antoniou2019The).

## Clinical Significance
UBE4B is implicated in various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases due to its role in protein degradation and cellular stress responses. In cancer, UBE4B is known to regulate the tumor suppressor protein p53 by promoting its degradation, which can lead to increased tumorigenesis. This mechanism is particularly significant in cancers such as breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer, where UBE4B is often overexpressed (Antoniou2019The). In renal cell carcinoma, UBE4B expression is up-regulated and associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Huang2020&lt; p&gt; The).

In neuroblastoma, UBE4B is located in a region on chromosome 1p that is frequently deleted, correlating with poor prognosis. Mutations in UBE4B, such as the c.1439 + 1G > C SNP, are linked to adverse outcomes in neuroblastoma patients (Carén2006The; Krona2003Screening). Low expression of UBE4B in neuroblastoma is associated with increased levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), leading to enhanced cell proliferation and chemoresistance (Memarzadeh2019Low).

UBE4B is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Machado-Joseph disease, by poly-ubiquitinating abnormal proteins for degradation, indicating its role in neuronal development and DNA damage repair (Antoniou2019The).

## Interactions
UBE4B, a ubiquitin chain assembly factor, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with the HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein, promoting NF-κB activation through polyubiquitination. This interaction primarily occurs in the cytoplasm and is crucial for Tax-induced NF-κB signaling, although UBE4B does not promote Tax degradation (Mohanty2020The). UBE4B also interacts with MDM2, facilitating the polyubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby regulating p53 levels and activity (Wu2011UBE4Ba; Wu2011UBE4B).

In the context of neuroblastoma, UBE4B interacts with the ITCH E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce polyubiquitination of Ku70 and c-FLIPL, proteins involved in apoptosis. This interaction is essential for the degradation of these proteins and the promotion of apoptosis (Clorennec2023UBE4B). UBE4B is also involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), interacting with the ESCRT protein Hrs to facilitate EGFR sorting and degradation (Sirisaengtaksin2014UBE4B). These interactions highlight UBE4B's role in regulating protein stability and signaling pathways through ubiquitination.
