# TAF11L10

## Overview
TAF11L10 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 10, which is involved in the regulation of gene transcription. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, which is essential for the initiation of gene expression. The TAF11L10 protein interacts with other transcription factors and components of the transcription machinery to facilitate the accurate transcription of DNA into RNA. Its function is critical in various cellular processes, and alterations in its expression or function can have significant implications for cellular homeostasis and may contribute to disease states.
