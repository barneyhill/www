# TAC4

## Overview
The TAC4 gene encodes the tachykinin precursor 4 protein, which is a member of the tachykinin family of peptides. This family is characterized by its involvement in a wide range of physiological processes, including immune regulation, pain modulation, and inflammation. The protein products of TAC4, such as hemokinin-1 (HK-1) and endokinins, are primarily expressed in peripheral tissues and blood cells, particularly B lymphocytes, indicating a significant role in the immune system (Page2004Hemokinins; Borbély2017Role). Unlike other tachykinins, TAC4-derived peptides interact with neurokinin receptors, including NK1 and NK2, to mediate various biological effects, such as airway tone regulation and reproductive functions (GrassinDelyle2010Expression; Borbély2017Role). The gene's expression is regulated by factors like early B-cell factor (EBF), highlighting its involvement in early B-cell development and broader immune responses (Khorasani2020The). The clinical significance of TAC4 is underscored by its association with inflammatory diseases, mood disorders, and pain mechanisms, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Hunyady2019Hemokinin1; Borbély2017Role).

## Function
The TAC4 gene encodes hemokinin-1 (HK-1) and endokinins, which are part of the tachykinin family of peptides. These peptides are involved in various physiological processes, including immune regulation, pain modulation, and inflammation. Unlike other tachykinins, HK-1 is primarily expressed in peripheral tissues and blood cells, particularly B lymphocytes, suggesting a significant role in immune system regulation (Page2004Hemokinins; Borbély2017Role).

TAC4-derived peptides, such as endokinins A and B, interact with the tachykinin NK1 receptor, although they may bind to distinct sites and activate different signaling pathways compared to other tachykinins like substance P (Page2006Characterization; Borbély2017Role). The expression of TAC4 in tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscle, skin, and thyroid indicates its involvement in peripheral endocrine functions (Page2004Hemokinins).

In the human airways, HK-1 exerts a contractile effect, primarily mediated through NK2 receptor stimulation, indicating a role in regulating airway tone (GrassinDelyle2010Expression). The gene's expression in reproductive tissues and its modulation by factors like kisseptin suggest potential roles in reproductive biology and sperm motility (Borbély2017Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TAC4 gene, which encodes hemokinin-1 (HK-1), have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, show upregulated TAC4 expression, suggesting a role in gastrointestinal inflammation (Borbély2017Role). In the context of mood disorders, HK-1 has been associated with anxiety and depression-like behaviors. Studies using Tac4 gene-deleted mice indicate that HK-1 may have an anti-anxiety and stress-coping role, highlighting its potential as a target for new antianxiety and antidepressant therapies (Borbély2017Hemokinin1).

In pain mechanisms, particularly neuropathic and inflammatory pain, HK-1 plays a significant role. Tac4-deficient mice exhibit reduced chronic neuropathic pain and lower levels of nerve growth factor, indicating that HK-1 contributes to pain modulation and neuroinflammatory responses (Hunyady2019Hemokinin1). Inflammatory orofacial pain models also show upregulated Tac4 expression, suggesting its involvement in peripheral sensitization and neuron-glia interactions, which are crucial in chronic pain conditions (Aczél2020Hemokinin1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TAC4 in inflammatory and pain-related disorders.

## Interactions
The TAC4 gene encodes the tachykinin precursor 4 protein, which is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the immune system. TAC4-derived peptides, such as hemokinin-1 (HK-1), interact with neurokinin receptors (NKRs), including the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R). These interactions are crucial for modulating immune responses and cellular differentiation processes (Steinhoff2014Tachykinins; Khorasani2020The). HK-1, through NK-1R signaling, promotes dendritic cell maturation and T-cell activation, enhancing antigen presentation and the expression of costimulatory molecules, which are vital for T-cell proliferation and differentiation (Khorasani2020The).

TAC4-derived peptides also participate in signaling pathways involving G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), influencing cellular responses such as inflammation and proliferation (Khorasani2020The). The interactions of TAC4 with NKRs suggest a role in signaling pathways that may involve interactions with GPCRs, affecting various physiological processes (Steinhoff2014Tachykinins). Additionally, TAC4 expression is regulated by early B-cell factor (EBF), which binds to EBF sites in the TAC4 promoter, indicating a role in early B-cell development (Khorasani2020The). These interactions highlight the complex network of signaling pathways and receptor interactions that TAC4 is involved in, contributing to its physiological and pathological roles.
