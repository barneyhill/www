# TFDP3

## Overview
TFDP3 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein transcription factor Dp family member 3, a member of the transcription factor DP family. This protein is characterized by its conserved DNA-binding and heterodimerization domains, which allow it to interact with E2F transcription factors, although it exhibits limited DNA-binding activity compared to other family members (Huang2021TFDP3). TFDP3 primarily functions as a competitive inhibitor of TFDP1, modulating E2F-mediated transcriptional activity, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (Huang2021TFDP3). It is predominantly expressed in the testis and plays a role in cellular homeostasis by inducing autophagy independently of E2F (Huang2021TFDP3). Clinically, TFDP3 is implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, where it influences cell proliferation, chemoresistance, and tumorigenesis (Ding2018TFDP3; Li2020CREBTFDP3; Huang2021TFDP3). Its classification as a cancer-testis antigen also highlights its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy (Huang2021TFDP3).

## Structure
The TFDP3 protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome X, q26.2, and consists of 405 amino acids (Huang2021TFDP3). The primary structure of TFDP3 includes a conserved DNA-binding domain and a heterodimerization domain, which are characteristic of the TFDP family (Huang2021TFDP3). The DNA-binding domain contains an RRXYD E2F DNA recognition motif, specifically RRTYD, which is distinct from the RRVYD motif found in TFDP1 (Huang2021TFDP3). 

TFDP3 forms heterodimers with E2F proteins, influencing DNA-binding functions and transcriptional regulation (Huang2021TFDP3). The TFDP3/E2F1 complex, however, exhibits lower DNA-binding activity compared to TFDP1, suggesting potential defects in DNA binding (Huang2021TFDP3). This interaction is crucial for its role as a competitive inhibitor of TFDP1, affecting cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Huang2021TFDP3).

At the protein level, TFDP3 is primarily located in the cytoplasm but translocates to the nucleus when coexpressed with E2F1-3, indicating its role in modulating E2F transcriptional activity through intracellular movement (Huang2021TFDP3). The C-terminal region of TFDP3 is similar to that of TFDP1, contributing to its functional properties (Huang2021TFDP3). Specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of TFDP3 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
TFDP3, a member of the transcription factor DP family, plays a significant role in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in the testis and weakly in the pancreas, with its expression being cell cycle-dependent. TFDP3 is mainly nuclear at the end of mitosis, diffusely present in the G1 phase, and cytoplasmic in the G2 phase, with high expression in the S phase (Huang2021TFDP3). Unlike other TFDP family members, TFDP3 forms heterodimers with E2F family members but exhibits little or no DNA-binding activity, acting as a repressor of E2F-mediated transcriptional activation (Huang2021TFDP3). This repression is achieved by modulating E2F1's access to chromatin, thereby inhibiting E2F1-mediated transcriptional activity, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation (Huang2021TFDP3).

TFDP3 also induces autophagy in a non-E2F-dependent manner, suggesting a role in cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Huang2021TFDP3). Its involvement in these processes indicates that TFDP3 is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions, particularly in tissues where it is predominantly expressed, such as the testis (Huang2021TFDP3).

## Clinical Significance
The TFDP3 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma, TFDP3 regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis, with its silencing leading to increased apoptosis rates (Huang2021TFDP3). In childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), elevated TFDP3 expression is linked to chemoresistance, and its downregulation can reverse this resistance, suggesting its potential as a target for gene therapy to combat chemoresistance (Chu2016TFDP3). In breast cancer, TFDP3 is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing migratory and invasive activity, and contributes to chemoresistance by triggering autophagy during chemotherapy (Ding2018TFDP3). In prostate cancer, TFDP3 suppresses apoptosis, aiding cancer cell survival, and is involved in the CREB/TFDP3/E2F1 signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Li2020CREBTFDP3; Chun2020The). TFDP3 is also considered a potential target for cancer immunotherapy due to its classification as a cancer-testis antigen, with identified immunogenic peptides that could be used in vaccines (Huang2021TFDP3).

## Interactions
TFDP3 interacts with E2F transcription factors, forming heterodimers with E2F1-6. These interactions are crucial for modulating E2F-mediated transcriptional activity. Unlike other members of the TFDP family, TFDP3/E2F complexes exhibit little or no DNA-binding activity, which results in the inhibition of E2F1-mediated transcriptional activation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation (Huang2021TFDP3). TFDP3 competes with TFDP1 to form inactive complexes with E2F1, thereby inhibiting E2F1 activity and reducing apoptosis (Chu2016TFDP3).

TFDP3 also forms ternary complexes with E2F1 and pRb, although its DNA-binding activity is significantly lower compared to TFDP1/E2F1 heterodimers (Huang2021TFDP3). The TFDP3/E2F1 complex can bind to E2F-regulated genes in the presence of E2F1, modulating the access of E2F1 to chromatin and negatively regulating E2F target genes (Huang2021TFDP3).

In prostate cancer, TFDP3 interacts with CREB, a transcription factor that enhances TFDP3 expression. This interaction inhibits E2F1-dependent apoptosis, promoting cell growth and proliferation (Li2020CREBTFDP3). The CREB/TFDP3 axis is implicated in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer by driving cell cycle progression (Li2020CREBTFDP3).
