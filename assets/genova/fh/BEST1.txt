# BEST1

## Overview
The BEST1 gene encodes the bestrophin-1 protein, a calcium-activated chloride channel predominantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium. Bestrophin-1 is characterized by its transmembrane structure, typically forming homopentamers, and plays a crucial role in ion transport and cellular conductance. The protein is involved in modulating calcium signaling and chloride conductance, impacting various physiological processes, particularly in the retina. Mutations in the BEST1 gene are linked to several retinal degenerative diseases, collectively known as bestrophinopathies, which include conditions such as Best vitelliform macular dystrophy and autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy. These mutations can lead to altered channel function and mislocalization of the protein, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Johnson2017Bestrophin; Marmorstein2018Mutant).

## Structure
The BEST1 gene encodes the Bestrophin 1 (Best1) protein, which is primarily expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium. Best1 is a calcium-activated chloride channel with a molecular mass of approximately 68 kDa and consists of 585 amino acids (Johnson2017Bestrophin; MoskovaDoumanova2013Best1). The protein's structure includes transmembrane domains, with models suggesting either four or five transmembrane domains. The Tsunenari model proposes five transmembrane domains with both N- and C-termini facing the cytosol, while the Milenkovic model suggests four transmembrane domains with a large cytoplasmic loop (MoskovaDoumanova2013Best1).

The quaternary structure of Best1 is debated, with reports of it existing as tetramers or pentamers, although hydrodynamic studies suggest it is a dimer (MoskovaDoumanova2013Best1). The crystal structure has revealed that Best1 forms homopentamers, a configuration conserved across different species (Johnson2017Bestrophin). The protein includes a calcium clasp near the neck region, which is crucial for channel gating (Johnson2017Bestrophin).

Alternative splicing of the BEST1 gene results in several isoforms, including isoform 1, the full-length protein, and isoform 2, which results from alternative splicing of exon 7 (MoskovaDoumanova2013Best1). The C-terminus of Best1 contains a calcium-sensing domain, essential for channel activity (Kuo2014Effects).

## Function
The BEST1 gene encodes the bestrophin-1 protein, which functions as a calcium-activated chloride channel in epithelial cells. This protein is crucial for enabling calcium-activated chloride conductance, particularly in tissues such as the airways, colon, and kidney. In these tissues, BEST1 is associated with calcium-activated chloride currents, suggesting its role in ion transport and cellular conductance processes (Barro2009Bestrophin1). 

In the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), bestrophin-1 is involved in modulating L-type calcium channel activity, which is essential for proper cellular function and visual processes. Mutations in BEST1 can affect the kinetics of these channels, leading to altered calcium entry and impaired cellular function (Rosenthal2006Expression). 

Bestrophin-1 is also implicated in regulating intracellular calcium signaling. It interacts with stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) and influences calcium transients, which are important for the activation of membrane-localized calcium-dependent chloride and potassium channels (Kunzelmann2011Role). The protein is found in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a role in calcium uptake and homeostasis, acting as a chloride counter ion channel (Kunzelmann2011Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BEST1 gene are associated with a group of retinal degenerative diseases collectively known as bestrophinopathies. These include Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD), autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB), adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD), autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC), and retinitis pigmentosa 50 (RP50) (Marmorstein2018Mutant; Johnson2017Bestrophin). BVMD is the most common condition, characterized by vitelliform lesions in the macula and a dominant inheritance pattern (Nowomiejska2021Disease; Johnson2017Bestrophin). ARB, a rarer condition, presents with widespread retinal pigment epithelium irregularities and subretinal fluid accumulation, typically requiring mutations in both alleles due to its recessive inheritance pattern (Nowomiejska2021Disease; Johnson2017Bestrophin).

Mutations in BEST1 can lead to decreased chloride-selective currents and mislocalization of the bestrophin-1 protein, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Davidson2009Missense). The phenotypic expression of BEST1 mutations is highly variable, with some mutations showing incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity (Nguyen2018Next; Ramsden2012Clinical). Despite the commonality of these retinal disorders, they remain untreatable, highlighting the need for further research into potential therapeutic options (Johnson2017Bestrophin).

## Interactions
BEST1 interacts with several proteins that influence its function and regulation. One significant interaction is with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, which targets BEST1 for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. This interaction is mediated through the 3rd and 4th WW domains of NEDD4L, with lysine 370 (K370) on BEST1 being a critical site for ubiquitination. Mutating this site reduces polyubiquitination and affects the inhibition of BEST1 activity by NEDD4L, indicating the importance of this interaction for regulating BEST1's activity and degradation (Park2019The).

BEST1 also interacts with the 14-3-3γ protein, which promotes its surface expression in astrocytes. This interaction is specific to the γ isoform of 14-3-3 and involves the C-terminus of BEST1, particularly the region between amino acids 292-380. The phosphorylation of serine 358 (S358) within this region is crucial for binding, as mutation of this site significantly reduces the interaction. This binding enhances the surface expression of BEST1, which is essential for its function in astrocytes (Oh2017Direct).

Additionally, BEST1 interacts with GAD65, a glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform, which enhances its permeability to neurotransmitters like glutamate and GABA. This interaction involves the C-terminal tail of BEST1 and plays a role in modulating its function as a neurotransmitter channel (Wang2024GAD65).
