# TMCC3

## Overview
TMCC3, or transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transmembrane protein family characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains. The TMCC3 protein is notable for its structural features, including three coiled-coil domains and two transmembrane domains, which are essential for its role in protein-protein interactions and cellular localization. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including ribosome recruitment to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interaction with key signaling molecules such as AKT, which is crucial for cell survival and growth pathways (Wang2021Transmembrane; Kho2024Identification). TMCC3's expression and function have been linked to cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer, where it is associated with cancer stem cell properties and poor prognosis (Wang2021Transmembrane). The evolutionary conservation of TMCC3 across species underscores its potential functional importance (Kho2024Identification).

## Structure
TMCC3 is a member of the transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family, characterized by specific structural features. The protein contains three coiled-coil domains and two transmembrane domains, both located in the C-terminal region, spanning amino acids 571-653 (Kho2024Identification). These structural motifs are crucial for protein-protein interactions, with the coiled-coil domains facilitating the formation of supercoil structures. The TMCC family, including TMCC3, exhibits high sequence homology, particularly in three conserved regions: the middle region (225-315 amino acids), the coiled-coil region (310-575 amino acids), and the transmembrane region (571-653 amino acids) (Kho2024Identification).

TMCC3 is transcribed from chromosome 12 and shares functional similarities with other TMCC proteins, such as potential roles in ribosome recruitment to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Kho2024Identification). Although specific details about the molecular structure of TMCC3 are not provided, it is suggested that TMCC3, like TMCC1, may localize to the ER, as GFP-tagged versions of TMCC proteins colocalize with calnexin in the ER (Kho2024Identification). The presence of TMCC genes in various lower organisms indicates their evolutionary conservation and potential functional importance across species (Kho2024Identification).

## Clinical Significance
TMCC3 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer, where its expression is associated with cancer stem cell properties and AKT activation. High TMCC3 mRNA expression in breast cancer patients correlates with increased risk of lymph node involvement, relapse, and death. Low TMCC3 expression is linked to better relapse-free survival and overall survival, especially in early-stage luminal A and B breast cancer patients, making it an independent prognostic factor for these outcomes (Wang2021Transmembrane). TMCC3 is also associated with poor prognosis in other cancers, including cervical, prostate, pancreatic, lung, glioblastoma, skin, hepatoma, and thyroid gland papillary carcinoma (Wang2021Transmembrane).

In prostate cancer, TMCC3 is part of a gene signature used to predict biochemical recurrence risk. This signature, derived from genes upregulated in patients with low TMEFF2 expression, has shown significant prognostic value (Georgescu2019A; Georgescu2018A). TMCC3's role in cancer progression is linked to its involvement in maintaining cancer stem cell features and facilitating metastasis through AKT activation, suggesting it could be a target for cancer therapy (Wang2021Transmembrane).

## Interactions
TMCC3 interacts directly with the AKT protein, a key player in various signaling pathways related to cell survival and growth. This interaction is facilitated through the 1-153 amino acid domain of TMCC3, which is crucial for AKT activation. The interaction between TMCC3 and AKT has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and a Luminex immunosandwich assay, demonstrating that the 1-153 amino acid domain of TMCC3 can bind AKT in vitro. This binding is essential for the phosphorylation of AKT at S473, a modification necessary for its activation (Wang2021Transmembrane).

The interaction between TMCC3 and AKT is significant in the context of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), where TMCC3 is highly expressed. This interaction enhances mammosphere formation and migration ability in breast cancer cells, indicating its role in maintaining BCSC properties. The 1-153 amino acid domain of TMCC3 is particularly important for these effects, as it significantly improves these properties compared to the 154-477 amino acid domain, which does not show such effects (Wang2021Transmembrane). These findings suggest that TMCC3's interaction with AKT is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer.
