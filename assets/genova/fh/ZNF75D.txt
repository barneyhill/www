# ZNF75D

## Overview
ZNF75D is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 75D, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs enable the protein to function as a transcription factor, binding to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. The protein plays a significant role in cellular processes such as differentiation and development by modulating the transcription of target genes. ZNF75D is predominantly active in the cell nucleus, where it interacts with other molecular components to maintain the balance of gene expression necessary for proper cellular function and organismal development. Its regulatory functions are crucial for ensuring healthy cell biology, impacting cellular growth, division, and specialization (Ito2020Endogenous; Ito2020Endogenousa).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF75D is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor in human cells. It is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which enable the protein to bind to specific DNA sequences. This binding capability allows ZNF75D to regulate the expression of target genes, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development. By modulating gene transcription, ZNF75D influences the cellular machinery that governs these processes, ensuring proper cellular function and organismal development. The activity of ZNF75D is integral to maintaining the balance of gene expression necessary for healthy cell biology, impacting how cells grow, divide, and specialize. The precise mechanisms by which ZNF75D exerts its regulatory functions involve interactions with other molecular components within the cell nucleus, where it is predominantly active. Through these interactions, ZNF75D contributes to the complex network of gene regulation that underpins normal cellular and developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF75D has been implicated in cancer, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The expression of ZNF75D is influenced by adjacent human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), such as LTR5_Hs and THE1D-int, which exhibit enhancer activity. These HERVs modulate the transcription of ZNF75D, and their deletion using CRISPR-Cas9 results in decreased expression of ZNF75D, suggesting their role in its transcriptional regulation (Ito2020Endogenous; Ito2020Endogenousa). Increased expression of ZNF75D, along with other KRAB zinc-finger proteins (KZFPs), is associated with better disease conditions in multiple cancer types, as these proteins can suppress cancer progression by altering gene expression (Ito2020Endogenous; Ito2020Endogenousa).

In the context of Parkinson's disease, ZNF75D is mentioned in association with an enhancer variant, rs11646653, identified within Parkinson's disease GWAS loci. However, the specific clinical significance of ZNF75D gene mutations or expression alterations in Parkinson's disease is not detailed (Farrow2023Finemapping).

Overall, while ZNF75D is linked to cancer suppression mechanisms, specific clinical implications of its mutations or expression changes in other diseases remain less documented.
