# GZMB

## Overview
Granzyme B (GZMB) is a gene that encodes the serine protease enzyme granzyme B, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system's ability to induce apoptosis in target cells. This enzyme is primarily produced by cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells, where it is stored in granules and released upon activation to mediate cell death. Granzyme B is characterized by its unique structural features, including a catalytic triad and specificity for aspartate residues, which facilitate its function in cleaving intracellular substrates such as pro-caspase-3, thereby triggering apoptotic pathways (EstébanezPerpiñá2000Crystal; Boivin2009Intracellular). Beyond its intracellular role, granzyme B also participates in extracellular matrix remodeling and modulates inflammatory responses by interacting with cytokines and other proteins (Buzza2005Extracellular; Afonina2011Granzyme). The gene's expression and activity are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including autoimmune diseases and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Russo2018Granzyme; Zhang2024Expression).

## Structure
The molecular structure of human granzyme B (GZMB) is characterized by its resemblance to an oblate ellipsoid with diameters of approximately 35 and 50 Å. The polypeptide chain of GZMB is folded into two six-stranded β-barrels connected by three trans-domain segments. The surface of the protein includes several turn structures and helices, such as a single turn α-helix from residues Ala56 to Cys58, a two-turn helix from Leu165 to Ser170, and a C-terminal mixed 3_10-α-helix from Val231 to Lys243 (EstébanezPerpiñá2000Crystal).

The active site of GZMB contains a catalytic triad composed of Ser195, His57, and Asp102, similar to other serine proteinases like trypsin and chymotrypsin. The specificity pocket (S1) is characterized by a unique Arg226 side chain that interacts with the P1-Asp side chain of substrates, conferring specificity for aspartate residues (EstébanezPerpiñá2000Crystal). The structure also features a high number of basic residues, contributing to its overall basic nature (EstébanezPerpiñá2000Crystal).

GZMB is a glycoprotein, with carbohydrate chains N-linked to Asn65, which mediate significant protein-protein interactions and contribute to its stability and activity (EstébanezPerpiñá2000Crystal). The protein's structure is suitable for inhibitor binding studies, which could aid in the design of therapeutic agents (EstébanezPerpiñá2000Crystal).

## Function
Granzyme B (GZMB) is a serine protease primarily involved in inducing apoptosis in target cells, a critical function in immune defense. It is synthesized and stored in cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, where it is directed to lytic granules and activated by the removal of an N-terminal dipeptide. Upon activation, granzyme B is delivered to target cells through the immunological synapse, traditionally mediated by the pore-forming protein perforin. Once inside the target cell, granzyme B induces apoptosis by cleaving substrates such as pro-caspase-3, leading to the activation of caspase-3 and subsequent apoptotic pathways (Boivin2009Intracellular).

Beyond its intracellular role, granzyme B also exhibits extracellular functions, including remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) by cleaving proteins such as vitronectin, fibronectin, and laminin. This activity can lead to cell detachment and anoikis, a form of programmed cell death due to loss of cell-matrix interactions. Granzyme B's ability to cleave ECM components suggests a role in modulating cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and invasion, contributing to tissue remodeling and immune responses (Boivin2009Intracellular; Buzza2005Extracellular).

Granzyme B also enhances the proinflammatory activity of cytokines like interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) by cleaving it at specific sites, increasing its bioactivity and potentially influencing inflammatory responses (Afonina2011Granzyme). This multifunctional activity positions granzyme B as a significant player in both apoptosis and inflammation, with implications for various physiological and pathological processes (Velotti2020Granzyme).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the GZMB gene have been implicated in various diseases. In autoimmune blistering diseases such as bullous pemphigoid and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, Granzyme B (GzmB) contributes to the degradation of key anchoring proteins at the dermal-epidermal junction, including α6/β4 integrin, collagen VII, and collagen XVII. This degradation can lead to epidermal separation and blister formation, suggesting that GzmB plays a pathogenic role in these conditions (Russo2018Granzyme).

In the context of cancer, GZMB expression is associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). It is significantly increased in early-stage tumor tissues but decreases in later stages, potentially affecting prognosis. GZMB is involved in immune pathways and is correlated with immune cell presence, particularly activated CD8+ T cells, indicating its role in tumor microenvironment interactions (Zhang2024Expression).

Genetic variations in GZMB, such as the rs8192917 SNP, have been linked to cancer risk in individuals with Lynch syndrome. The CC genotype of this SNP is associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer in these patients, highlighting the potential of GZMB genetic variants as disease-modifying factors (Grolmusz2023A).

## Interactions
Granzyme B (GZMB) is involved in various interactions with proteins that facilitate its role in immune responses. Intracellularly, GZMB cleaves several substrates, including pro-caspase-3, leading to apoptosis. It also interacts with proteins like serglycin and heat shock protein-70 (Hsp-70), which aid its entry into target cells (Boivin2009Intracellular). GZMB cleaves the BH3-only protein Bid, which then interacts with pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and/or Bak, disrupting mitochondrial membrane integrity and promoting apoptosis (Boivin2009Intracellular).

Extracellularly, GZMB cleaves components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibulin-1C, peroxidasin, and laminin beta-2, facilitating the transmigration of cytotoxic lymphocytes (Prakash2014Granzyme). It also cleaves cytokines like IL-1α, enhancing their proinflammatory activity (Afonina2011Granzyme). GZMB interacts with receptors such as NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and IGF2R on T cells, playing a role in regulatory functions (Sailliet2023Human).

In the tumor microenvironment, GZMB is secreted by various cell types, including regulatory T cells, where it can degrade the T cell receptor zeta chain, contributing to immunosuppression (Wang2021Interaction).
