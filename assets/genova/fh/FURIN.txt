# FURIN

## Overview
FURIN is a gene that encodes the protein furin, a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase enzyme. This enzyme is integral to the activation of a wide array of precursor proteins by cleaving them at specific sites, a process essential for numerous physiological functions. Furin is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is predominantly localized within the Golgi/trans-Golgi network secretory pathway, where it facilitates the conversion of proproteins into their active forms. The protein's structure is characterized by multiple domains, including a catalytic domain that is crucial for its enzymatic activity. FURIN's role extends to the regulation of various biological processes, such as embryogenesis, cellular growth, and the maintenance of sodium-electrolyte balance. Dysregulation of FURIN expression or function is implicated in several diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (Osman2021Why; Shiryaev2013HighResolution; Thomas2002Furin).

## Structure
The FURIN protein is a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase enzyme characterized by a complex molecular structure with several distinct domains. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal signal peptide, an inhibitory prodomain, a catalytic endopeptidase domain, a P domain, a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Osman2021Why). The catalytic domain contains a highly conserved catalytic triad composed of Asp153, His194, and Ser368, which is common among subtilisin-like proteases (Osman2021Why). The secondary structure features a highly twisted β-sheet in the catalytic domain and a β-sandwich structure in the P domain (Osman2021Why).

The tertiary structure involves stabilization of the catalytic domain by the P domain through hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic salt bridges (Osman2021Why). FURIN's activity is calcium-dependent, with three calcium ions bound per subunit, influencing the active-site geometry (Osman2021Why). The protein also contains a sodium binding site near the active site cleft (Osman2021Why). Disulfide bonds within the catalytic and P domains are crucial for folding (Osman2021Why).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at Ser773 and Ser775, glycosylation at Asn387, Asn440, and Asn553, and ubiquitination at Lys748 (Osman2021Why). FURIN exists in an 'off-state' that transitions to an 'on-state' upon ligand binding, necessary for substrate recognition (Osman2021Why).

## Function
FURIN is a proprotein convertase enzyme that plays a critical role in the activation of various proteins by cleaving their inactive precursors at specific sites. It is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is primarily localized within the Golgi/trans-Golgi network secretory pathway (Shiryaev2013HighResolution). FURIN cleaves after basic residues, transforming secretory proproteins into biologically active proteins, which is essential for normal cellular functions, including the activation of growth factors, hormones, metalloproteinases, and cell receptors (Shiryaev2013HighResolution).

In healthy human cells, FURIN is involved in the processing of growth factors and enzymes that are essential for normal cellular functions. For instance, it cleaves pro-BMP-4, a morphogen involved in embryogenesis, ensuring the correct activity of BMP-4 by processing it at specific sites (Thomas2002Furin). FURIN also activates TGF-β, which is crucial for embryogenesis (Thomas2002Furin). The enzyme's activity is regulated through a multistep autoactivation process, where its prodomain acts as an intramolecular chaperone guiding the folding and activation of the enzyme (Thomas2002Furin). FURIN's role extends to the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system and factors that maintain sodium-electrolyte balance (Turpeinen2013Genetics).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the FURIN gene are implicated in various diseases. In cancer, FURIN is often upregulated, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. It is associated with increased aggressiveness in glioblastomas, non-small-cell lung carcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. This upregulation is linked to the activation of matrix metalloproteinases, promoting tumor growth and neovascularization (Thomas2002Furin). High FURIN expression is also correlated with poor prognosis in cancers such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and lung adenocarcinoma (Zhou2021PanCancer).

In neurodegenerative diseases, reduced FURIN expression is observed in Alzheimer's disease, where it affects the processing of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and amyloid-beta production. This reduction is linked to increased amyloid-beta levels, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology (Zhang2022The). In schizophrenia, downregulation of FURIN affects neurotrophin maturation, contributing to cognitive impairments (Zhang2022The).

FURIN is also involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and cerebral ischemia, where its dysregulation affects synaptic transmission and blood-brain barrier integrity, respectively (Zhang2022The). These findings highlight FURIN's significant role in various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
FURIN interacts with several proteins that influence its localization and function. It binds to the adaptor protein Mint3, which regulates its localization in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The PTB domain of Mint3 is crucial for this interaction, binding to an acidic peptide signal within the cytoplasmic domain of FURIN. This interaction retains FURIN in the TGN, affecting its trafficking and localization (Han2008Interaction).

FURIN also interacts with the actin-binding protein ABP-280, which modulates its internalization and routing within cells. ABP-280 tethers FURIN to the cell surface, influencing its internalization rate and sorting from early endosomes to the TGN (Liu1997Cytoskeletal).

In renal cells, FURIN interacts with proMT1-MMP and integrin αV at the plasma membrane. It colocalizes with proMT1-MMP, facilitating the cleavage of its pro-domain, which is essential for its activation. FURIN also binds to the αV integrin subunit, potentially escorting it to the cell surface (Mayer2003Furin).

These interactions highlight FURIN's role in protein trafficking, activation, and localization, impacting various cellular processes.
