# AXDND1

## Overview
AXDND1 is a gene that encodes the protein axonemal dynein light chain domain containing 1, which is integral to the process of spermatogenesis and male fertility. This protein is categorized as a component of the dynein motor complex, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of cilia and flagella motility, which is essential for sperm movement (Vandenbrouck2016Looking). AXDND1 is predominantly expressed in the testis, particularly in round and elongating spermatids, where it contributes to the later stages of sperm development (Ma2021AXDND1). The protein's involvement in the dynamics of the manchette, a structure critical for shaping the sperm head and assembling the sperm flagellum, underscores its importance in the proper formation of sperm tail structures and sperm individualization (Houston2024AXDND1). Mutations in the AXDND1 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly non-obstructive azoospermia, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health (Ma2021AXDND1; Houston2024AXDND1). Additionally, AXDND1 has been implicated in kidney diseases, suggesting a broader role in human health (Shigemizu2023Classification).

## Function
The AXDND1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis and male fertility. It is primarily expressed in the testis, particularly in round and elongating spermatids, where it is involved in the later stages of sperm development (Ma2021AXDND1). The protein contains an axonemal dynein light chain domain, which is significant for its role in regulating cilia and flagella motility, essential for sperm movement (Vandenbrouck2016Looking).

AXDND1 is involved in the dynamics of the manchette, a structure critical for shaping the sperm head and assembling the sperm flagellum. It facilitates protein transport along microtubules, which is vital for the proper formation of sperm tail structures and sperm individualization (Ma2021AXDND1; Houston2024AXDND1). The protein's localization to the manchette and its interaction with microtubule structures suggest it acts as an adapter optimizing the interaction between dynein complexes and cargoes for efficient transport (Houston2024AXDND1).

In the absence of AXDND1, structural defects in sperm, such as malformed heads and tails, are observed, leading to immotility and infertility. This highlights its essential role in maintaining normal spermatogenesis and sperm motility (Ma2021AXDND1; Houston2024AXDND1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AXDND1 gene are associated with male infertility, particularly non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in the ejaculate due to impaired spermatogenesis. Studies have identified potentially deleterious mutations in AXDND1 in NOA patients, suggesting a significant role in male reproductive health (Ma2021AXDND1; Houston2024AXDND1). In mice, the absence of AXDND1 leads to sterility, with phenotypes such as oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, which includes low sperm count, poor motility, and abnormal morphology (Ma2021AXDND1). 

AXDND1 is crucial for normal sperm tail development and function. Knockout studies in mice show that the loss of AXDND1 results in structural defects in sperm, including abnormalities in the axoneme and improper loading of accessory structures, leading to immotility and infertility (Houston2024AXDND1). The gene is also implicated in maintaining the balance between spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal and commitment to spermatogenesis, with its absence causing a progressive imbalance and germ cell loss (Houston2024AXDND1).

Additionally, AXDND1 has been associated with kidney diseases, with variants linked to nephrotic syndrome, suggesting a broader clinical significance beyond reproductive health (Shigemizu2023Classification).
