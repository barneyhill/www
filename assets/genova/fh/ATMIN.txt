# ATMIN

## Overview
ATMIN, also known as ATM interactor, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the DNA damage response and repair processes. The ATMIN protein functions as a crucial cofactor for the ATM kinase, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability. ATMIN is characterized by its structural features, including zinc finger domains and SQ/TQ motifs, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in DNA repair. It is involved in various cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation, particularly in response to oxidative stress and chromatin changes. ATMIN's interactions with proteins like DYNLL1 and its regulation by ubiquitination highlight its complex role in cellular signaling pathways. Clinically, alterations in the ATMIN gene are associated with several diseases, including B cell lymphomas and lung adenocarcinoma, underscoring its significance as a tumor suppressor and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2014UBR5mediated; Kanu2007ATMIN; Kanu2010The).

## Structure
ATMIN, also known as ASCIZ, is characterized by several structural features and domains. The protein contains four N-terminal zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Rapali2011LC8). Following these zinc finger domains is a central core domain necessary for Rad51-containing focus formation after single-stranded DNA damage (Rapali2011LC8). The carboxy-terminal end of ATMIN includes a stretch with 11 SQ/TQ motifs, which are potential phosphorylation sites for ATM and ATR kinases, suggesting that ATMIN may be a substrate for these kinases (Rapali2011LC8). In the full-length polypeptide, there are 17 SQ/TQ motifs (Rapali2011LC8).

The interaction between ATMIN and DYNLL1, a dynein light chain, involves multiple SQ/TQ motifs in the carboxy-terminal domain of ATMIN, which is significant for the subcellular localization of ATMIN and may interfere with its function in DNA damage response (Rapali2011LC8). The ATMIN fragment (residues 378-823) is enriched in SQ/TQ motifs and appears to be intrinsically disordered, as indicated by its migration in SDS-PAGE and gel filtration results (Rapali2011LC8). The binding of DYNLL1 to ATMIN does not significantly alter the hydrodynamic behavior of ATMIN (Rapali2011LC8). The ubiquitination of ATMIN at lysine 238 is crucial for ATM signaling and function, particularly in response to ionizing radiation (Zhang2014UBR5mediated).

## Function
ATMIN (ATM interactor) is a protein that functions as a crucial cofactor for the ATM kinase, playing a significant role in the DNA damage response and repair processes. In healthy human cells, ATMIN is involved in the regulation of ATM signaling pathways, particularly in response to oxidative stress and chromatin changes, distinct from the NBS1/MRN complex which is necessary for ATM activation by double-strand breaks (Kanu2010The). ATMIN is essential for the proper activation of ATM, contributing to ATM protein expression and autophosphorylation, which are critical for maintaining genomic stability (Kanu2007ATMIN).

ATMIN is active in the nucleus, where it influences processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It is necessary for efficient phosphorylation of ATM substrates like p53 and Chk2 in response to certain stressors, such as hypotonic stress and replication stress (Kanu2007ATMIN). ATMIN also plays a protective role against oxidative DNA damage, helping to prevent DNA damage accumulation and premature cellular senescence (Kanu2010The). In the nervous system, ATMIN is important for DNA damage signaling and helps prevent neurodegeneration by regulating ATM activation, thus contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability during embryonic development and throughout the life of postmitotic neurons (Kanu2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ATMIN gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in maintaining genomic stability. In B cells, ATMIN deficiency leads to genomic instability, resulting in the development of B cell lymphomas. This is characterized by improper repair of DNA breaks during class switch recombination, leading to translocations and other chromosomal abnormalities. Approximately 40% of mice with ATMIN deletion in B cells develop B cell lymphomas, highlighting its critical role in suppressing these malignancies (Loizou2011ATMIN).

In lung adenocarcinoma, ATMIN functions as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in ATMIN, such as shallow deletions, are observed in 52% of lung adenocarcinoma samples. These genetic changes are associated with poorer patient survival, indicating ATMIN's significant role in this cancer type (Foster2019ATMIN).

ATMIN is also involved in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where it contributes to chemoresistance. High ATMIN expression is linked to resistance to docetaxel and shorter survival in patients. The USP10-ATMIN-LCK axis is identified as a potential therapeutic target, as ATMIN knockdown increases sensitivity to chemotherapy (Fang2024Transcription).

## Interactions
ATMIN interacts with the ATM kinase, a key player in the DNA damage response. This interaction is mediated through a C-terminal motif in ATMIN that is homologous to the motif used by NBS1, suggesting that ATMIN and NBS1 compete for binding to the same region of ATM (Zhang2012Competition). UBR5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitinates ATMIN at lysine 238, which reduces ATMIN's interaction with ATM and promotes MRN complex-mediated signaling. This ubiquitination is crucial for proper ATM pathway activation in response to DNA damage (Zhang2014UBR5mediated).

ATMIN also interacts with DYNLL1, a dynein light chain, through residues 362-823, which include part of the core region and several SQ/TQ motifs. These motifs are potential ATM/ATR phosphorylation sites, indicating a regulatory role in DNA repair processes (Rapali2011LC8). The interaction between ATMIN and DYNLL1 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting its physiological relevance (Rapali2011LC8).

In addition to its role in DNA damage response, ATMIN acts as a transcriptional regulator, influencing the expression of genes involved in ciliogenesis and lung morphogenesis, such as DYNLL1 (Goggolidou2014ATMIN).
