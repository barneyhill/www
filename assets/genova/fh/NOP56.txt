# NOP56

## Overview
NOP56 is a gene that encodes the NOP56 ribonucleoprotein, a critical component of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex involved in ribosome biogenesis. The NOP56 protein is categorized as a nucleolar protein and plays a pivotal role in the site-specific 2'-O-methylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a modification essential for the proper processing and maturation of rRNA, which is crucial for ribosome assembly and function (Yu2018The). Structurally, NOP56 contains several distinct domains, including β-sheets and α-helices, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins such as fibrillarin and NOP58 within the snoRNP complex (Höfler2021Highresolution). These interactions are vital for the assembly and function of the snoRNP complex, enabling RNA-guided methylation processes (Gagnon2012Structurally; Reichow2007The). Mutations in the NOP56 gene have been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36), a neurodegenerative disorder, and its expression is implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Obayashi2014Spinocerebellar; Zhao2023The).

## Structure
The NOP56 ribonucleoprotein is a component of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex, playing a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. The molecular structure of NOP56 includes several distinct domains and features that contribute to its function. The amino-terminal domain of NOP56 consists of five β-sheets, with β-sheets 1-3 arranged in an anti-parallel orientation and β-sheets 4-5 in a parallel orientation. This core is surrounded by seven α-helices, with an insertion of 26 amino acids between β2 and β3 forming α-helices 1 and 2, a feature unique to eukaryotic Nop56 and Nop58 proteins (Höfler2021Highresolution).

The interaction between NOP56 and fibrillarin, a methyltransferase, is characterized by high charge complementarity, with NOP56 having a negative surface charge that complements the positive charge of fibrillarin. This interaction is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and polar contacts, particularly involving the α-helices and β-sheets of NOP56 (Höfler2021Highresolution).

In terms of quaternary structure, NOP56 forms complexes with other proteins, such as Nop58 and fibrillarin, within the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of the complex, facilitating RNA-guided methylation processes (Gagnon2012Structurally; Reichow2007The).

## Function
NOP56 is a crucial component of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which plays a significant role in the biogenesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in eukaryotic cells. It is involved in the site-specific 2'-O-methylation of rRNA, a modification essential for the proper processing and maturation of rRNA, which is critical for ribosome assembly and function (Yu2018The). NOP56, along with its homolog NOP58, forms part of the core structure of the snoRNP complex, interacting with other proteins such as fibrillarin and Snu13p to facilitate these modifications (Yu2018The; Reichow2007The).

In the snoRNP complex, NOP56 is involved in organizing the guide regions of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and potentially in substrate binding, making extensive contact along the length of the snoRNA (Watkins2011The). It is also implicated in the structural rearrangement during snoRNP biogenesis, stabilizing the association of core box C/D proteins (Watkins2011The). NOP56 is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the assembly and function of snoRNPs, essential for the modification and processing of pre-rRNA (Yu2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NOP56 gene are implicated in several diseases, most notably spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36). SCA36 is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion in the first intron of the NOP56 gene. This expansion leads to progressive cerebellar ataxia, motor neuron dysfunction, and other symptoms such as hearing and cognitive impairments (Obayashi2014Spinocerebellar; Lopez2022Spinocerebellar). The expanded repeats can form RNA foci that sequester RNA-binding proteins, potentially disrupting neuronal function, and may also undergo repeat-associated non-ATG-driven (RAN) translation to produce dipeptide repeats that contribute to cytotoxicity (Lopez2022Spinocerebellar; McEachin2020Chimeric).

In cancer, NOP56 expression is often dysregulated. In cervical cancer, its expression is reduced due to promoter hypermethylation, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Zhao2023The). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma, hypomethylation leads to NOP56 overexpression, which may serve as a biomarker (Zhao2023The). High NOP56 expression is also linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, where it promotes tumor growth and progression (Zhao2023The).

## Interactions
NOP56 is a nucleolar protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis as part of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex. It interacts with several key proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate its function. NOP56 forms a stable complex with NOP58 and fibrillarin (also known as Nop1 in yeast), which is essential for the assembly and function of the Box C/D snoRNP complex. This complex is involved in the 2'-O-methylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a critical step in rRNA processing (Höfler2021Highresolution; Gagnon2012Structurally).

The N-terminal domain of NOP56 is particularly important for its interaction with fibrillarin, facilitating the assembly of the snoRNP complex. This interaction is strong and stable, as demonstrated by its resistance to disruption by most chemical reagents (Gagnon2012Structurally). NOP56 also interacts with small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), particularly C/D box snoRNAs, which guide the methylation of rRNA (Zhao2023The).

In yeast, NOP56 forms a trimeric complex with Nop58p and Nop1p, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis. This interaction is crucial for pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (Gautier1997Nucleolar). The protein's interactions are regulated by post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, which enhance its affinity for snoRNAs (Zhao2023The).
