# ACIN1

## Overview
The ACIN1 gene encodes the apoptotic chromatin condensation inducer 1 protein, commonly referred to as Acinus, which is integral to both apoptosis and RNA processing. Acinus is categorized as a splicing factor due to its involvement in pre-mRNA splicing and its role as a peripheral component of the exon junction complex (EJC) (Rodor2016The). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, generated through alternative splicing, and is characterized by domains such as the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal RS-like domain, which facilitate RNA binding and interactions with splicing factors, respectively (Jang2008SerineArginine; Lin2020Altered). Acinus is also a component of the apoptosis-and splicing-associated protein (ASAP) complex, which plays a role in inhibiting RNA processing and promoting apoptosis (Schwerk2003ASAP). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by kinases such as SRPK2 and Akt, which modulate its function in chromatin condensation and splicing regulation (Jang2008SerineArginine; Hu2005Akt). The cleavage of Acinus by caspase-3 during apoptosis results in the formation of an active fragment crucial for chromatin condensation, underscoring its role in apoptotic processes (Sahara1999Acinus).

## Structure
The ACIN1 gene encodes a protein involved in apoptosis and RNA processing, known as Acinus. This protein exists in multiple isoforms, including Acinus-L, Acinus-S, and Acinus-S', which are generated through alternative splicing mechanisms (Schwerk2003ASAP; Lin2020Altered). These isoforms share common domains such as an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal RS-like domain, but differ in their N-terminal regions (Lin2020Altered; Rodor2016The). The RRM is implicated in RNA binding, while the RS-like domain is involved in interactions with splicing factors (Jang2008SerineArginine).

Acinus undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by kinases such as SRPK2 and Akt. Phosphorylation at specific serine residues, such as S422 and S573, affects its function in chromatin condensation and splicing regulation (Jang2008SerineArginine; Hu2005Akt). The protein is also a component of the apoptosis-and splicing-associated protein (ASAP) complex, which includes SAP18 and RNPS1, and plays a role in inhibiting RNA processing and promoting apoptosis (Schwerk2003ASAP).

The cleavage of Acinus by caspase-3 during apoptosis results in the formation of an active fragment, p17, which is crucial for chromatin condensation (Sahara1999Acinus; Rodor2016The). This cleavage highlights the importance of proteolytic processing in the activation of Acinus during apoptotic events.

## Function
The ACIN1 gene encodes the Acinus protein, which plays a significant role in RNA processing and splicing regulation in human cells. Acinus is a peripheral component of the exon junction complex (EJC) and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It binds to pre-mRNAs, particularly associating with suboptimal introns and spliced mRNAs, and is crucial for the inclusion of specific alternative cassette exons (Rodor2016The). Acinus affects both constitutive and alternative splicing, influencing events such as cassette exon skipping and intron retention, particularly in proto-oncogenes and other specific genes (Rodor2016The).

Acinus is also involved in cell cycle regulation, with its RNA targets enriched in genes related to this process. Depletion of Acinus in HeLa cells results in a G1 cell cycle arrest phenotype (Rodor2016The). Additionally, Acinus regulates the splicing of the last intron of the DFFA/ICAD pre-mRNA, producing a transcript that functions as a chaperone for caspase-activated DNase, promoting DNA fragmentation during apoptosis (Rodor2016The).

The protein is predominantly located in the nucleus and is involved in RNA metabolism as a component of functional spliceosomes (Hu2005Akt). Acinus's role in splicing regulation and its involvement in apoptotic processes highlight its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the ACIN1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ACIN1 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This overexpression is associated with its involvement in apoptosis, RNA splicing, and basal autophagy, which are crucial for tumor development. The study highlights that miR-674-5p, a microRNA regulating ACIN1, is downregulated in HCC, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism involving competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and microRNAs (Tang2024Analysis).

In infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), ACIN1 is involved in cryptic gene fusions with NUTM1, particularly in cases without KMT2A rearrangements. These ACIN1-NUTM1 fusions result in transcripts that retain functional domains from both genes, contributing to the pathogenesis of non-KMT2A-r infant ALL. The presence of these fusions is associated with higher NUTM1 expression in leukemic cells, indicating a potential diagnostic marker for this leukemia subtype (Pincez2019Cryptic).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of ACIN1 in cancer, highlighting its role in tumor progression and as a potential target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
ACIN1, also known as apoptotic chromatin condensation inducer 1, is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in RNA processing and apoptosis. ACIN1 is a component of the exon junction complex (EJC) and interacts with eIF4A3 at canonical EJC sites, influencing splicing regulation and intron retention (Rodor2016The). It is also part of the ASAP complex, which includes SAP18 and RNPS1, and is involved in RNA processing and apoptosis. This complex can inhibit RNA processing and is implicated in apoptotic chromatin condensation (Schwerk2003ASAP).

ACIN1 interacts with SRPK2, a serine/arginine protein-specific kinase, which phosphorylates ACIN1 at serine 422. This phosphorylation is crucial for ACIN1's role in regulating cyclin A1 expression and leukemia cell proliferation (Jang2008SerineArginine). ACIN1 also binds to Akt, which phosphorylates it at serine residues S422 and S573, preventing its proteolytic cleavage and subsequent chromatin condensation (Hu2005Akt). These interactions highlight ACIN1's involvement in both RNA metabolism and apoptotic pathways.
