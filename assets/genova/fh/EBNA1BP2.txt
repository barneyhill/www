# EBNA1BP2

## Overview
EBNA1BP2 is a gene that encodes the EBNA1 binding protein 2, a nucleolar protein involved in various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis and mRNA maturation. The protein is known for its interactions with key cellular components, such as the protein kinase PKR and c-Myc mRNA, which are crucial for ribosomal biogenesis and cellular proliferation (Blalock2014Identification; Spiniello2019Comprehensive). Additionally, EBNA1BP2 is regulated by the RECQ1 helicase, which influences its transcriptional activity and suggests a role in cell cycle progression (Lu2016Transcriptome). The involvement of EBNA1BP2 in these pathways indicates its potential significance in tumorigenesis and other cellular functions (Sun2024EBNA1BP2).

## Interactions
EBNA1BP2 is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It has been identified as part of the nuclear interactome of the protein kinase PKR, where it is associated with both active and inactive PKR complexes. This interaction suggests a role for EBNA1BP2 in ribosome biogenesis and rRNA maturation processes linked to PKR activity (Blalock2014Identification).

EBNA1BP2 also interacts with c-Myc mRNA, functioning as a nucleolar protein involved in ribosomal biogenesis. This interaction highlights its role in mRNA maturation, transport, and translation, which are crucial for cellular processes such as tumor growth and metastasis (Spiniello2019Comprehensive).

Additionally, EBNA1BP2 is regulated by the RECQ1 helicase, which binds to G-quadruplex motifs in its promoter region. This binding is essential for the transcriptional regulation of EBNA1BP2, indicating its involvement in cell cycle progression and proliferation (Lu2016Transcriptome).

These interactions suggest that EBNA1BP2 plays a role in tumorigenesis through its involvement in nucleoplasm and RNA binding pathways, as well as its participation in protein complexes that influence cellular functions (Sun2024EBNA1BP2).
