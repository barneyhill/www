# AAMDC

## Overview
The AAMDC gene encodes the protein known as adipogenesis associated Mth938 domain containing, which is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly within the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a signaling molecule due to its involvement in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. AAMDC is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with proteins involved in vesicle trafficking and signal transduction, such as RabGAP1L and Rab7a. The protein's role extends to influencing the expression of enzymes in one-carbon metabolism, which is crucial for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis. Additionally, AAMDC is associated with adipogenesis, suggesting its involvement in energy homeostasis and tissue development. Clinically, the gene is significant in the context of cancer, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, where its amplification and overexpression are linked to poor prognosis and resistance to anti-estrogen therapies (Golden2021The).

## Function
The AAMDC gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism in healthy human cells (Golden2021The). This pathway is involved in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis and cell cycle progression, and is essential for maintaining proper cell growth and metabolism (Golden2021The). AAMDC influences the expression of enzymes involved in the folate and methionine cycles of one-carbon metabolism, such as MTHFD1L and CBS, which are important for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis (Golden2021The).

AAMDC is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with proteins like RabGAP1L and Rab7a, suggesting a role in vesicle trafficking and signal transduction (Golden2021The). The protein's activity is linked to the translation of specific oncogenic transcription factors and the transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes, indicating its involvement in cellular homeostasis and metabolic reprogramming (Golden2021The). AAMDC's expression pattern in adipose tissue also suggests a role in adipogenesis, the formation of fat cells, which may influence energy homeostasis and tissue development (Golden2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The AAMDC gene is clinically significant in several types of cancers, particularly estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. It is frequently amplified in aggressive forms of ER+ breast cancers, with a reported amplification frequency of about 10% across multiple databases (Golden2021The). AAMDC overexpression is linked to poorer overall survival in breast, ovarian, and lung cancers, and is significantly correlated with lower survival in aggressive luminal B breast cancers treated with tamoxifen, suggesting a role in anti-estrogen therapy resistance (Golden2021The). In luminal B breast cancers, AAMDC is amplified in approximately 25% of cases, correlating with lymph node involvement and larger tumor size, indicating its role in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Golden2021The).

AAMDC is involved in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor growth, especially under metabolic stress conditions such as growth factor and estrogen deprivation (Golden2021The). Its overexpression can lead to estrogen-independent tumor growth, suggesting that tumors with high AAMDC expression might be particularly susceptible to PI3K-mTORC1 blockers combined with anti-estrogens (Golden2021The). The gene's amplification and overexpression could serve as a biomarker for identifying patients with poor prognosis ER+ breast cancer, guiding the development of targeted therapies (Golden2021The).

## Interactions
The AAMDC protein interacts with the GTPase-activating protein RabGAP1L, a relationship identified through yeast two-hybrid screens. This interaction is significant for activating AKT signaling, as both proteins are co-expressed in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus of luminal cancer cells. The interaction involves the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of RabGAP1L, with AAMDC containing a PTB binding consensus motif. AAMDC also interacts with a subset of Rab proteins, including Rab13, Rab22a, Rab7a, and Rab35. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that RabGAP1L can bind to AAMDC and selected Rab proteins, particularly Rab7a. However, in the absence of RabGAP1L, no direct interaction between AAMDC and the Rab proteins was observed. Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assays demonstrated that RabGAP1L enhances the interaction between AAMDC and Rab proteins. Deletion of specific domains in RabGAP1L, such as the PTB or TBC domains, affects these interactions, indicating their importance in mediating the binding of AAMDC to RabGAP1L and Rab proteins (Golden2021The). The study does not mention any interactions of AAMDC with nucleic acids (Golden2021The).
