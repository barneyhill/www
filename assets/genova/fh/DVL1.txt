# DVL1

## Overview
DVL1 (dishevelled segment polarity protein 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathways, which are critical for regulating various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The DVL1 protein is categorized as a signaling protein and is characterized by three conserved domains: the DIX, PDZ, and DEP domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways (Wallingford2005The; Sharma2018Dishevelled:). Through these interactions, DVL1 plays a pivotal role in the formation of protein complexes that regulate the stability and localization of β-catenin, a key effector in the Wnt pathway (Kishida1999DIX). Additionally, DVL1 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and congenital disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (White2018WNT; Huang2013Significant).

## Structure
The DVL1 protein is composed of 695 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 75 kDa (Lee2012DVL1; Christensen2019PDZ). It features three conserved domains: the N-terminal DIX domain, the central PDZ domain, and the C-terminal DEP domain (Wallingford2005The; Sharma2018Dishevelled:). The DIX domain, spanning amino acids 1-82, is involved in protein-protein interactions crucial for Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Lee2012DVL1; Sharma2018Dishevelled:). The PDZ domain, essential for interactions with the Frizzled receptor, consists of 5 or 6 β-strands and 2 or 3 α-helices, forming a hydrophobic cleft for ligand binding (Wallingford2005The; Sharma2018Dishevelled:). The DEP domain, comprising three α-helices, facilitates membrane localization and is critical for non-canonical signaling pathways (Wallingford2005The; Sharma2018Dishevelled:).

Post-translational modifications of DVL1 include phosphorylation by kinases such as CK1ε and CKII, which regulate its activity in Wnt signaling (Lee2012DVL1; Kafka2014The). DVL1 also undergoes ubiquitination, affecting its stability and function (Sharma2018Dishevelled:). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its functional properties (Kafka2014The).

## Function
DVL1 (dishevelled segment polarity protein 1) is a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathways, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, DVL1 is involved in the formation of large molecular supercomplexes at the plasma membrane, which include Wnt-Fz-LRP5/6-DVL-AXIN. This complex formation prevents the degradation of beta-catenin, allowing it to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of Wnt target genes involved in critical cellular functions such as embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis (Kafka2014The).

DVL1 also plays a significant role in myogenic differentiation and proliferation in human myoblasts. It is necessary for efficient proliferation and must be present in the nucleus to regulate this process, although it operates through different protein domains compared to other DVL proteins like DVL3. The activity of DVL1 in this context is independent of the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus, which is typically associated with active canonical Wnt signaling (Pruller2022DVL1). DVL1's role in these pathways highlights its importance in maintaining cellular functions related to development and cell signaling (Wallingford2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DVL1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In cancer, DVL1 overexpression has been linked to colorectal cancer, particularly in patients with liver metastasis, where it is overexpressed in over 45% of primary colorectal cancers and shows high immunoreactivity in 78.9% of cases with liver metastasis (Huang2013Significant). DVL1 is also significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer, with a correlation to beta-catenin expression and increased expression levels associated with worsening histological grades (Mizutani2005Upregulation). In intracranial meningiomas, mutations in DVL1, such as g.14004delA, enhance Wnt signaling and are associated with higher tumor grades and active β-catenin expression, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Bukovac2021Decoding).

DVL1 mutations are also implicated in Robinow syndrome, a congenital skeletal dysplasia. Pathogenic variants in DVL1, particularly frameshifting indels in the penultimate exon, are linked to the dominant form of Robinow syndrome, contributing to the genetic heterogeneity of the condition (White2018WNT). These mutations may cause the syndrome through a gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect (White2018WNT).

## Interactions
DVL1, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, engages in various protein interactions crucial for its function. It interacts with Axin through two binding sites, with the DIX domain being necessary but not sufficient for this interaction. DVL1 binds to specific regions of Axin, particularly the segment containing amino acids 530 to 712, and can inhibit Axin-promoted GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin and APC, though it does not affect GSK-3β activity itself (Kishida1999DIX). DVL1 also induces the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, a process requiring both the DIX and PDZ domains (Kishida1999DIX).

DVL1 forms complexes with other dishevelled proteins, such as Dvl-3, through its DIX domain, which is essential for homo-oligomerization and interaction with Axin (Kishida1999DIX). It also interacts with β-arrestin1 (βarr1), which modulates lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcriptional activity through interaction with phosphorylated DVL1. This interaction enhances DVL1-stimulated LEF transcriptional activity, highlighting βarr1's role in regulating DVL1 signaling pathways (Chen2001βArrestin1).

DVL1's interactions extend to Dact scaffold proteins, which form stable or semi-stable complexes with DVL1 and other proteins, suggesting roles in intercellular signaling and protein trafficking (Kivimäe2011All).
