# LEAP2

## Overview
LEAP2, or liver enriched antimicrobial peptide 2, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional peptide primarily expressed in the liver and small intestine. The peptide, also referred to as LEAP-2, is categorized as a cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) and is involved in both immune defense and metabolic regulation. Structurally, LEAP-2 is characterized by a unique fold with a β-hairpin and a 3_10-helix, stabilized by disulfide bonds, and features a positively charged surface that facilitates its interaction with bacterial membranes (Henriques2010Structural). Functionally, LEAP-2 acts as an antagonist to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), modulating ghrelin signaling pathways and influencing energy balance and appetite regulation (Mani2019LEAP2; Shankar2021LEAP2). The gene's expression and the peptide's activity have significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including obesity, cognitive decline, and liver disease (Ezquerro2023Antagonic; Shankar2021LEAP2; Tian2023Liverexpressed).

## Structure
The liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2) is a 40-residue peptide derived from a 77-residue precursor. Its primary structure includes a disordered, hydrophobic N-terminal region and a compact central core. The secondary structure of LEAP-2 features a β-hairpin and a 3_10-helix, stabilized by disulfide bonds between Cys17-28 and Cys23-33, and a network of hydrogen bonds (Henriques2010Structural). The tertiary structure is characterized by a positively charged surface due to clustered arginine and lysine residues, with a large hydrophobic region at the N-terminus (Henriques2010Structural). The peptide's structure is unique among cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs), with a novel fold that may suggest additional physiological roles beyond antimicrobial activity (Henriques2010Structural).

LEAP-2 does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a single peptide chain. The peptide's membrane binding is driven by electrostatic interactions, with the N-terminal hydrophobic domain and core cationic domain being crucial for this interaction (Henriques2010Structural). The disulfide bonds, while stabilizing the structure, are not essential for its antimicrobial function (Henriques2010Structural).

## Function
LEAP2 (liver enriched antimicrobial peptide 2) is a multifunctional peptide primarily expressed in the liver and small intestine, playing significant roles in both immune response and metabolic regulation. In terms of immune function, LEAP2 exhibits antimicrobial properties, contributing to the body's defense against pathogens. It is known to bind preferentially to negatively charged bacterial membranes, which are rich in anionic phospholipids, thereby targeting bacterial cells without affecting mammalian cells. This selective binding is crucial for its antimicrobial activity, as it may involve binding to internal targets rather than causing membrane permeabilization (Henriques2010Structural).

In metabolic regulation, LEAP2 acts as an antagonist and inverse agonist of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), counteracting the effects of acyl-ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite and growth hormone secretion. LEAP2 reduces acyl-ghrelin-induced food intake and growth hormone secretion, suggesting its role in modulating energy balance and appetite regulation (Mani2019LEAP2; Shankar2021LEAP2). The N-terminal region of LEAP2 is particularly important for its interaction with GHSR, where it acts as a competitive antagonist, influencing ghrelin signaling pathways and potentially impacting physiological processes such as insulin secretion and appetite (M’Kadmi2018NTerminal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LEAP2 gene have been implicated in several metabolic and cognitive conditions. In the context of obesity, LEAP2 levels are elevated, which may contribute to a state of ghrelin resistance. This resistance is characterized by reduced food intake and energy expenditure, as LEAP2 counteracts the orexigenic effects of acyl-ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite and growth hormone secretion (Shankar2021LEAP2). In LEAP2 knockout mice, the absence of LEAP2 enhances ghrelin's actions, leading to increased food intake and growth hormone secretion, particularly in diet-induced obesity (Shankar2021LEAP2).

LEAP2 dysregulation is also associated with age-related cognitive decline. Elevated LEAP2 levels in aged mice disrupt ghrelin signaling, leading to reduced synaptic density and impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which are linked to cognitive deficits. Downregulation of LEAP2 in these mice has been shown to restore cognitive function, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for age-associated cognitive decline (Tian2023Liverexpressed).

In liver disease, particularly nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), increased LEAP2 levels are associated with liver fibrosis and inflammation, indicating a potential role in the progression of liver fibrosis in obesity-related conditions (Ezquerro2023Antagonic).

## Interactions
LEAP2 interacts with the ghrelin receptor (GHSR), a G-protein-coupled receptor, acting as an antagonist and inverse agonist. This interaction inhibits both ghrelin-induced and constitutive signaling activities of GHSR. LEAP2 binds to GHSR with high affinity, particularly through its N-terminal region, which is crucial for its inhibitory effects (Mustafá2021LEAP2; M’Kadmi2018NTerminal). The N-terminal fragment of LEAP2 stabilizes an inactive conformation of GHSR, reducing basal activity and blocking ghrelin-induced responses such as inositol phosphate production and calcium mobilization (M’Kadmi2018NTerminal).

LEAP2 also affects the interaction between GHSR and the dopamine 2 receptor (D2R). It impairs the GHSR's ability to regulate D2R signaling, particularly in the context of CaV2.2 currents, by affecting the preassembly of GHSR with Gαq in the GHSR-D2R complex. This suggests that LEAP2 modulates the arrangement or dynamics of this receptor complex without physically disrupting it (Mustafá2021LEAP2). These interactions highlight LEAP2's role in modulating neuronal activity and plasticity by influencing GHSR and D2R interactions.
