# LRRC3B

## Overview
The LRRC3B gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing 3B protein, which is a transmembrane protein characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. These motifs are integral to protein-protein interactions and are typically involved in forming a horseshoe-like structure. The LRRC3B protein is highly conserved across mammalian species, indicating its essential functional role. It is primarily localized to the plasma membrane, where it participates in various cellular processes, including immune response, cell adhesion, and signaling. The protein is implicated in maintaining genomic stability and regulating cell cycle progression, acting as a tumor suppressor by engaging in DNA damage and repair pathways. Alterations in the expression and methylation of the LRRC3B gene have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its significance in tumor suppression and potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment response (Kim2008LRRC3B; Luo2023LRRC3B; Wang2021LRRC3B).

## Structure
The LRRC3B protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein encoded by the LRRC3B gene. It is a 259 amino acid protein that is highly conserved among mammals, with a molecular weight of approximately 29.3 kDa (Bennett2010Odor-evoked; Kim2008LRRC3B). The protein structure includes a signal peptide, an LRR NH2-terminal domain, three internal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an LRR COOH-terminal domain, and a transmembrane domain (Kim2008LRRC3B). These LRR motifs are known for their role in protein-protein interactions and typically form a horseshoe-like structure (Bennett2010Odor-evoked).

The LRRC3B protein is predicted to span the membrane once near its carboxy-terminus and extend an extracellular 176 amino acid domain (Bennett2010Odor-evoked). It is localized to the plasma membrane and is glycosylated, as indicated by a reduction in size upon EndoH treatment (Bennett2010Odor-evoked). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as N-methylation, which are linked to processes like cell differentiation and gene expression regulation (Luo2023LRRC3B). The high level of conservation across species suggests an important functional role for LRRC3B (Kim2008LRRC3B).

## Function
The LRRC3B gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, LRRC3B is involved in mediating immune responses, cell adhesion, cell growth, cell death, intercellular signaling, and metabolism (Luo2023LRRC3B). The protein is primarily localized to the cell membrane, where it participates in cellular signaling and interactions, suggesting its importance in maintaining cellular communication and structural integrity (Kim2008LRRC3B).

LRRC3B is associated with maintaining genomic stability and regulating cell cycle progression, which are crucial for preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Wang2021LRRC3B). It is also involved in DNA damage and repair pathways, contributing to the preservation of genomic integrity (Wang2021LRRC3B). The protein's activity is linked to tumor suppressor pathways, such as fatty acid metabolism, DNA repair, and oxidative phosphorylation, indicating its role in regulating cell metabolism and cycle progression (Luo2023LRRC3B).

In the context of immune function, LRRC3B is positively correlated with immunostimulators and MHC modules, enhancing the infiltration of antitumor immune cells like B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells, while suppressing M2 macrophages, MDSCs, CAFs, and Tregs (Luo2023LRRC3B).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC3B gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In gastric cancer, LRRC3B is frequently silenced through aberrant methylation of its promoter region, leading to reduced expression levels in tumors compared to normal tissues. This silencing is associated with increased tumorigenicity and may facilitate tumor escape from immune detection (Kim2008LRRC3B). 

In breast cancer, specific polymorphisms in the LRRC3B gene, such as rs1907168, are linked to a reduced risk of the disease, while others like rs78205284 are associated with an increased risk. These genetic variations suggest that LRRC3B may influence breast cancer susceptibility and its clinical manifestations (Wang2021LRRC3B).

LRRC3B expression is generally lower in tumors across multiple cancer types, and its higher expression is correlated with better overall survival and lower tumor stages. The gene's promoter hypomethylation status is a potential predictor of response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, indicating its role in immune modulation and tumor suppression (Luo2023LRRC3B). 

Overall, alterations in LRRC3B expression and methylation status are significant in understanding its role in cancer progression and treatment response.
