# CDC37

## Overview
CDC37 is a gene that encodes the cell division cycle 37 protein, which functions as a co-chaperone in association with the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). This protein is integral to the stabilization and activation of protein kinases, playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and signal transduction. CDC37 is characterized by its ability to bind to protein kinases and facilitate their proper folding and function, primarily through its interaction with HSP90. The protein is categorized as a molecular chaperone and is involved in forming complexes that are essential for the maturation and stabilization of kinases such as CDK4 and RAF1. CDC37's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which enhances its binding affinity and functional interactions. The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest in clinical research due to their involvement in cancer and other diseases, where they are often found to be overexpressed or dysregulated (Stepanova1996Mammalian; Calderwood2014Cdc37; Oberoi2022HSP90CDC37PP5).

## Structure
CDC37 is a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in stabilizing and folding protein kinases, functioning as a co-chaperone with HSP90. The protein is composed of several domains, including an N-terminal domain (NTD) that is essential for binding to client proteins, and a middle domain that interacts with HSP90 (Verba2016Atomic; Stetz2018Functional). The N-terminal domain features a coiled-coil structure with a leucine zipper-like motif, which is involved in interactions with kinases such as Cdk4 and RAF1 (GarcíaAlonso2022Structure; Verba2016Atomic).

The primary structure of CDC37 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific secondary structures, such as alpha helices and beta sheets. The N-terminus (residues 1-120) predominantly forms a long coiled-coil alpha-hairpin, while the C-terminal part (residues 136-378) is more globular and helical (Oberoi2022HSP90CDC37PP5). The two halves of CDC37 are connected by an extended beta-strand, which interacts with the middle domain of HSP90 (Oberoi2022HSP90CDC37PP5).

Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification of CDC37, with serine 13 being a critical site for its function in protein kinase activation (Verba2016Atomic; Oberoi2022HSP90CDC37PP5). This modification stabilizes the N-terminus of the coiled coil and is essential for the electrostatic interactions with HSP90 (Verba2016Atomic). The quaternary structure of CDC37 involves its interaction with HSP90, forming a complex that stabilizes and activates kinases (Verba2016Atomic).

## Function
CDC37 is a co-chaperone protein that plays a critical role in the stabilization and activation of protein kinases in human cells. It functions primarily in conjunction with the molecular chaperone Hsp90, targeting protein kinases to ensure their proper folding and stability. This interaction is essential for the regulation of various intracellular signaling pathways that control cell growth, division, and response to external stimuli (Calderwood2014Cdc37).

In mammalian cells, CDC37 is particularly involved in stabilizing cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), a key player in cell cycle progression. CDC37 binds to Cdk4, forming a complex with Hsp90 that stabilizes the kinase, which is crucial for the formation of active cyclin D/Cdk4 complexes necessary for the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Stepanova1996Mammalian). CDC37 is also phosphorylated by CK2 at a conserved serine residue, Ser13, which enhances its binding activity with various kinases, further influencing cellular functions (Miyata2004CK2).

CDC37 is active in the cytoplasm, where it forms high molecular weight complexes with Hsp90 and Cdk4, distinct from cyclin D/Cdk4 complexes, indicating its role in the formation and stabilization of specific protein complexes (Stepanova1996Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the CDC37 gene are implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In prostate cancer, CDC37 is overexpressed, which is linked to the progression of the disease. This overexpression is regulated by the transcription factor MZF1, which enhances CDC37 transcription, and SCAND1, which represses it. The reduced expression of SCAND1 in cancerous prostate cells suggests its role as a tumor suppressor (Eguchi2019MZF1). 

CDC37 is also involved in the stabilization of oncogenic kinases through its interaction with HSP90, making it a critical player in cancer cell survival. This interaction is particularly significant in cancers where CDC37 is overexpressed, such as breast, lung, liver, and colorectal cancers (Wang2021Targeting; Eguchi2019MZF1). Targeting the HSP90-CDC37 chaperone cycle is considered a promising therapeutic strategy, as it could disrupt the maturation and function of oncogenic kinases (Wang2021Targeting).

In rheumatoid arthritis, CDC37 is upregulated in synovial tissues, promoting synoviocyte proliferation and migration through the ERK signaling pathway. Inhibition of CDC37 expression has been shown to reduce symptoms in animal models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis (Sun2023Inhibition).

## Interactions
CDC37 is a co-chaperone that primarily interacts with the molecular chaperone HSP90, forming a complex that stabilizes and assists in the folding of protein kinases. This interaction is crucial for the maturation and stabilization of various kinases, including CDK4, CDK6, and CRAF (Stepanova1996Mammalian; Smith2013Restricting). CDC37 binds to the N-terminal domain of HSP90, inhibiting its ATPase activity and stabilizing the closed state of HSP90 (Verba2017How). The interaction between CDC37 and HSP90 is modulated by phosphorylation, particularly at Ser13, which is necessary for CDC37's interaction with client proteins (Li2018Targeting).

CDC37 also forms a ternary complex with HSP90 and client kinases, such as CDK4, through direct binding interactions. The CDC37 N-terminal domain interacts with the C-lobe of CDK4, mimicking the interaction pattern of the CDK4 N-lobe with the C-lobe (Czemeres2017Atomistic). CDC37's interaction with kinases involves binding to the glycine-rich loop, a common feature in many client kinases, including Raf-1 and Akt1 (Terasawa2006Cdc37). These interactions are essential for the chaperone-kinase cycle, contributing to the stabilization and proper function of the kinase clients.
