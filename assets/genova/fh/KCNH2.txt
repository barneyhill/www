# KCNH2

## Overview
The KCNH2 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2, commonly referred to as the hERG channel. This protein is a critical component of cardiac electrophysiology, functioning as a transmembrane ion channel that facilitates the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (I_Kr) essential for cardiac action potential repolarization (Sanguinetti1995A; Anson2004Molecular). Structurally, the hERG channel is characterized by six transmembrane segments and a pore-forming region, forming a tetrameric complex that is highly selective for potassium ions (Sanguinetti1995A). The channel's function is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, which are crucial for its proper localization and activity (Gessner2019ANK2; Biliczki2009Traffickingdeficient). Mutations in the KCNH2 gene are associated with Long QT Syndrome type 2, a condition that can lead to severe cardiac arrhythmias, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Ono2020Long).

## Structure
The KCNH2 gene encodes the hERG potassium ion channel, which plays a crucial role in cardiac repolarization. The primary structure of the hERG protein includes six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and a pore-forming region. The secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices. The tertiary structure comprises a voltage-sensor domain and a pore domain, which are essential for the channel's function. The quaternary structure of the hERG channel forms a tetramer, allowing it to function as a complete ion channel.

Post-translational modifications of the hERG protein include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are important for its proper function and regulation. These modifications can affect the channel's kinetics and interactions with drugs. The hERG channel is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that can influence its electrophysiological properties and response to pharmacological agents.

The COOH terminal of the hERG channel is involved in channel trafficking and inactivation, similar to the SCN5A Na+ channel, and contains regions where common polymorphisms such as K897T, R1047L, P967L, and Q1068R reside. These polymorphisms can lead to subtle functional changes in the channel's physiology (Anson2004Molecular).

## Function
The KCNH2 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel, which is crucial for cardiac action potential repolarization. This channel mediates the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I_Kr) in cardiac cells, playing a vital role in cardiac electrophysiology by contributing to the I_Kr current essential for cardiac repolarization (Sanguinetti1995A; Anson2004Molecular). The hERG channel is highly selective for potassium ions (K+) over sodium ions (Na+), and its activity is modulated by extracellular potassium concentration (Sanguinetti1995A).

In healthy human cells, the hERG channel undergoes voltage- and time-dependent gating transitions, which are critical for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm (Anson2004Molecular). The channel's function is characterized by specific voltage dependence of activation and rapid inactivation, which is faster than activation, contributing to its rectification properties (Sanguinetti1995A). The hERG channel is not activated by cyclic nucleotides, aligning with observations in cardiac myocytes (Sanguinetti1995A). Dysfunction in the KCNH2 gene can lead to arrhythmias, such as Long QT Syndrome, due to its crucial role in cardiac repolarization (Anson2004Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNH2 gene, which encodes the Kv11.1 potassium channel, are primarily associated with Long QT Syndrome type 2 (LQT2), a condition that affects cardiac repolarization and can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes (Ono2020Long). LQT2 is characterized by a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), resulting from loss-of-function mutations that reduce the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) in cardiomyocytes (Ono2020Long). These mutations can disrupt the trafficking and function of Kv11.1 channel proteins, leading to decreased folding efficiency and increased degradation (KekenesHuskey2022MutationSpecific).

The clinical presentation of LQT2 can vary significantly, with some individuals experiencing severe symptoms while others remain asymptomatic. This variability is often due to genetic modifiers, such as the KCNH2-K897T polymorphism, which can exacerbate the effects of other mutations like A1116V, leading to more pronounced QT prolongation and arrhythmias (Crotti2005KCNH2). The presence of these genetic modifiers highlights the complexity of diagnosing and managing LQT2, as they can influence the severity of the condition (Crotti2005KCNH2).

In Danish populations, specific mutations such as p.F29L have been identified as founder mutations, further emphasizing the genetic diversity and population-specific nature of KCNH2-related LQT2 (Christiansen2014Mutations).

## Interactions
KCNH2, also known as hERG, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function and localization. It interacts with the KCNQ1 protein, where the wild-type KCNQ1 (KCNQ1-WT) enhances the membrane localization of KCNH2, acting as a chaperone. However, the KCNQ1-T587M mutation disrupts this interaction, impairing KCNH2's trafficking to the plasma membrane and contributing to Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) (Biliczki2009Traffickingdeficient).

KCNH2 also interacts with ANK2, where the ANK2-E1813K variant, in combination with the KCNH2-H562R mutation, diminishes KCNH2 channel currents. This interaction is functional rather than structural, as co-immunoprecipitation did not show direct binding between ANK2 and KCNH2 (Gessner2019ANK2).

In addition, KCNH2 is part of a broader network of protein interactions in cardiac cells. Studies have identified numerous protein interactors, highlighting the complexity of its interaction network. These interactions are essential for maintaining cardiac electrophysiological homeostasis and are linked to various cardiac phenotypes (Maurya2023Outlining).
