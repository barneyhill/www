# ZBED1

## Overview
ZBED1 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger BED-type containing 1 protein, a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. This protein is characterized by the presence of a BED zinc finger domain, which facilitates its binding to specific DNA sequences, such as the human DNA replication-related element (DRE) consensus sequence. ZBED1 is widely expressed in various human tissues, particularly in epithelial and stromal cells, and plays a significant role in fetal development, especially within female reproductive tissues and the placenta. It is implicated in the regulation of ribosomal protein genes and the histone H1 gene, which are crucial for DNA replication and cell differentiation. Additionally, ZBED1 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex through SUMOylation, influencing transcriptional repression. Its expression patterns and interactions suggest a role in inhibiting cell differentiation and maintaining an immunotolerant environment at the fetal-maternal interface (Johansen2022ZBED1; Hansen2018Human).

## Function
The ZBED1 gene encodes a nuclear protein that is widely expressed in multiple human tissues derived from all three primary germ layers, particularly in epithelial and some stromal cells. It is notably expressed in female reproductive tissues and the placenta, suggesting a role in fetal development (Hansen2018Human). ZBED1 is involved in epigenetic regulation and may influence transcription by mediating the SUMOylation of Mi2α, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex, potentially affecting transcriptional repression by NuRD (Hansen2018Human).

ZBED1 is implicated in the regulation of ribosomal protein genes and the histone H1 gene, which are associated with DNA replication (Hansen2018Human). It is also involved in regulating genes important for trophoblast cell differentiation, survival, and apoptosis, playing a significant role in placental biology (Johansen2022ZBED1). ZBED1 expression tends to diminish with cell maturation, indicating a possible role in inhibiting cell differentiation (Hansen2018Human). Despite its broad expression, ZBED1 is absent in certain parenchymal cells, such as those in the liver and cerebellum, highlighting its selective role in different tissues (Hansen2018Human).

## Interactions
ZBED1, also known as zinc finger BED-type containing 1, is a nuclear protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It contains a BED zinc finger domain that facilitates DNA binding, allowing it to interact with specific DNA sequences, such as the human DNA replication-related element (DRE) consensus sequence (Hansen2018Human). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of histone H1 gene expression and ribosomal protein genes, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Hansen2018Human).

ZBED1 is also involved in epigenetic regulation through its interaction with Mi2α, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. This interaction occurs via SUMOylation, which may influence transcriptional repression (Hansen2018Human). In the context of placental biology, ZBED1 regulates genes important for trophoblast cell differentiation, survival, and apoptosis, affecting pathways related to cell proliferation and the maintenance of an immunotolerant environment at the fetal-maternal interface (Johansen2022ZBED1). These interactions highlight ZBED1's multifaceted role in gene expression regulation and its involvement in critical biological processes.
