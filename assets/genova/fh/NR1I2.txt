# NR1I2

## Overview
The NR1I2 gene encodes the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a member of the nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I. PXR is a ligand-activated transcription factor primarily involved in the regulation of genes associated with drug metabolism and detoxification processes. It is predominantly expressed in the liver and intestine, where it plays a crucial role in the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics and endobiotics. The protein structure of PXR includes a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain, which allows it to interact with a wide variety of ligands, including prescription drugs, thereby influencing drug-drug interactions and pharmacogenetics (Kliewer2002The; Ihunnah2011Nuclear). PXR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes and other drug-metabolizing enzymes, contributing to metabolic balance and protection against toxic substances (Forman2002The; Ihunnah2011Nuclear). The gene's polymorphisms and mutations have significant clinical implications, affecting drug metabolism, cancer progression, and susceptibility to liver damage (Reuter2015Role; Liebe2016Heterozygous).

## Structure
The NR1I2 gene encodes the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor involved in xenobiotic metabolism. The PXR protein is composed of several domains, including a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD). The DBD, encoded by exons 3 and 4, contains zinc finger motifs crucial for DNA interaction (di2009Nuclear). The LBD, encoded by exons 5-10, features a large and flexible ligand-binding cavity, allowing PXR to bind a wide variety of ligands. This domain is characterized by a three-layered alpha-helical sandwich and a unique five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, which is distinct from other nuclear receptors (di2009Nuclear).

The PXR LBD can form a homodimer and interacts with coactivators such as SRC-1, which stabilizes the receptor and influences ligand orientation (Watkins2003Coactivator). The protein also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. Isoform-1 is the wild-type, while isoform-2 includes an additional 39 amino acids at the N-terminus, and isoform-3 lacks 37 amino acids in the LBD due to an in-frame deletion (di2009Nuclear). These structural features and variations contribute to PXR's ability to regulate gene expression in response to diverse chemical stimuli.

## Function
The NR1I2 gene encodes the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of drug metabolism and detoxification processes in healthy human cells. PXR is primarily expressed in the liver and intestine, where it functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor. It regulates the expression of a wide array of genes involved in the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics and endobiotics, including cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2B6 (Kliewer2002The; Forman2002The; Synold2001The).

PXR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to specific DNA response elements, leading to the transcriptional activation of target genes. This activation enhances the solubility and elimination of various compounds by upregulating Phase I and Phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases, as well as drug transporters like MDR1 and OATP2 (Forman2002The; Ihunnah2011Nuclear).

PXR also influences glucose and lipid metabolism, bile acid detoxification, and cholesterol homeostasis, contributing to metabolic balance and protection against toxic substances (Ihunnah2011Nuclear). Its activation by a diverse range of ligands, including prescription drugs, highlights its role in drug-drug interactions and pharmacogenetics (Kliewer2002The; Ihunnah2011Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the NR1I2 gene, which encodes the pregnane X receptor (PXR), have significant clinical implications. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs1054190 and rs1054191 are associated with reduced PXR protein expression, although they do not significantly impact overall survival (Reuter2015Role). In metastatic colorectal cancer, the NR1I2-rs1054190 polymorphism is linked to shorter overall survival and increased disease progression in patients treated with the FOLFIRI regimen, potentially due to altered microRNA binding affecting PXR expression (De2019Germline).

In neuroblastoma, hypermethylation of the NR1I2 gene leads to its silencing, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Restoring NR1I2 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines has been shown to suppress tumor growth (Misawa2005MethylationAssociated). Additionally, NR1I2 polymorphisms are implicated in drug metabolism and resistance, affecting the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of various cancer treatments, such as irinotecan in colorectal cancer (Mbatchi2016Effect).

Alterations in NR1I2 expression or function can also influence susceptibility to liver damage, as seen in a case of cholestatic liver injury linked to a rare frameshift mutation in the gene (Liebe2016Heterozygous).

## Interactions
The human gene NR1I2, also known as the pregnane X receptor (PXR), engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function as a transcription factor. PXR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) to regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA response elements (Rigalli2021Regulation). It interacts with coactivator proteins such as PGC1α and p300, which are crucial for its transcriptional activity. The interaction with p300 involves histone acetylation and PXR acetylation at K109, which is necessary for the upregulation of CYP3A4 by rifampicin (Rigalli2021Regulation). 

PXR also interacts with corepressor proteins like NCoR and NCoR2, which lead to chromatin compaction and gene repression. The interaction with NCoR2 is particularly strong in certain PXR splicing variants, affecting transcriptional activity (Rigalli2021Regulation). Post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation and ubiquitylation further modulate PXR's interactions and stability. SUMOylation can recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) to target promoters, leading to transcriptional repression (Rogers2021The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving PXR and its role in drug metabolism and other cellular processes.
