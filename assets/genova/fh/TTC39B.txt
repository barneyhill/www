# TTC39B

## Overview
TTC39B is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39B, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, making TTC39B a crucial player in various cellular processes, particularly in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the regulation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, influencing metabolic health and disease susceptibility. TTC39B modulates the activity of liver X receptors (LXRs), which are key regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism, by promoting their ubiquitination and degradation. This regulatory function positions TTC39B as a significant factor in maintaining lipid balance and has implications for conditions such as atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Wang2018(–; Rodriguez2015Lipids)Epigallocatechin3Gallate page 0 of 4). Additionally, TTC39B has been implicated in chromatin interactions relevant to cancer progression, highlighting its multifaceted role in human health (French2016Germline).

## Function
TTC39B encodes a protein that contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. This protein plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. In healthy human cells, TTC39B is active in the cytoplasm and influences cellular processes such as lipid transport and storage, impacting overall metabolic health and disease susceptibility (Wang2018(–)Epigallocatechin3Gallate page 0 of 4).

TTC39B is associated with the regulation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Lower transcript levels of TTC39B correlate with higher HDL cholesterol levels in humans, and knockdown of TTC39B in murine models also results in increased HDL levels (Rodriguez2015Lipids). The protein promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of liver X receptors (LXRs), which are nuclear receptors involved in cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Wang2018(–)Epigallocatechin3Gallate page 3 of 4). By modulating LXR activity, TTC39B influences the expression of genes involved in cholesterol mobilization and lipid regulation, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining lipid balance within the body (Wang2018(–)Epigallocatechin3Gallate page 0 of 4). The gene's expression is predominantly found in gastrointestinal tissues, with significant expression in the gallbladder, suggesting a potential role in gallbladder disease (Rodriguez2015Lipids).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TTC39B gene have been associated with several metabolic and liver-related conditions. Variants in TTC39B, such as the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs471364-G, are linked to increased liver damage markers and lower bone mineral content in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) (Chatterjee2023Severe). This SNP is associated with a liver-specific expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) effect, where the rs471364-T allele results in reduced expression of TTC39B in liver tissues, correlating with higher albumin levels and increased liver damage markers (Chatterjee2023Severe).

The TTC39B gene is also implicated in lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Studies have shown that TTC39B deficiency can lead to increased HDL-cholesterol levels and decreased LDL levels, reducing atherosclerosis risk (Wang2018(–)Epigallocatechin3Gallate page 3 of 4). The gene's expression is modulated by (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a component of green tea, which decreases TTC39B expression and is associated with reduced hepatic lipid accumulation and atherosclerotic plaque formation (Wang2018(–)Epigallocatechin3Gallate page 0 of 4). These findings suggest that TTC39B plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders and liver diseases.

## Interactions
TTC39B, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39B, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. The protein encoded by the TTC39B gene is associated with changes in blood lipoprotein levels and interacts with liver X receptors (LXRs), which play a role in cholesterol mobilization. TTC39B promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of LXRs, affecting cholesterol homeostasis (Wang2018(–)Epigallocatechin3Gallate page 3 of 4). In the context of atherosclerosis, TTC39B deficiency stabilizes endogenous LXRs and their target genes, reducing the incidence of atherosclerosis and fatty liver (Wang2018(–)Epigallocatechin3Gallate page 0 of 4).

In ovarian cancer, TTC39B is implicated in chromatin interactions. The gene contains single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are located in a putative regulatory element (PRE) interacting with the promoters of PSIP1 and CCDC171. These interactions suggest a regulatory role in gene expression, particularly affecting PSIP1 expression through Sp1-mediated chromatin looping (French2016Germline). The PRE acts as a transcriptional enhancer for PSIP1 and CCDC171 promoters, with variable effects on the TTC39B promoter depending on the cell line (French2016Germline). These interactions highlight the complex role of TTC39B in both lipid metabolism and cancer progression.
