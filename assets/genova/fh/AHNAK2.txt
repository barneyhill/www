# AHNAK2

## Overview
AHNAK2 is a gene that encodes the AHNAK nucleoprotein 2, a large scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes, including calcium channel modulation and membrane repair. The AHNAK2 protein is characterized by a tripartite structure, which includes a nonrepetitive N-terminal segment, a central region with multiple repeat segments, and a C-terminal segment. These structural features enable AHNAK2 to participate in forming large protein complexes at the plasma membrane, linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, and playing a role in calcium channel function (Komuro2004The). AHNAK2 is implicated in cardiac and skeletal muscle function, as well as in stress-induced cellular responses, such as the nonclassical secretion pathway of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) (Kirov2015AHNAK2). Additionally, AHNAK2 has clinical significance, with mutations and expression alterations associated with various cancers, influencing prognosis and treatment responses (Cui2022Deleterious; Mai2024Impaired).

## Structure
AHNAK2 is a large protein characterized by a tripartite structure, including a nonrepetitive N-terminal segment, a central region with 24 repeat segments, and a C-terminal segment. Each repeat segment is approximately 165 amino acids long and is hypothesized to form β-propeller structures, similar to those found in proteins like RCC1 and clathrin (Komuro2004The). The N-terminal domain of AHNAK2 contains a segment predicted to function as a PDZ domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Han2014Periaxin; Komuro2004The).

The secondary structure of AHNAK2 is predicted to predominantly fold into β-strands, forming a seven-bladed propeller structure stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Komuro2004The). The PDZ domain of AHNAK2 forms intertwined homodimers through domain swapping, creating a unique structural basis for dimerization (Han2014Periaxin).

AHNAK2 is involved in forming large protein complexes at the plasma membrane, linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. It is associated with calcium channel proteins in cardiomyocytes, particularly with the β-subunit of the calcium channel and components of the Z-band complex (Han2014Periaxin; Komuro2004The). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a role in calcium channel function and the organization of multimolecular complexes.

## Function
AHNAK2, also known as AHNAK nucleoprotein 2, is a large scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes, including calcium channel modulation and membrane repair. It plays a significant role in the structural integrity and function of skeletal muscle fibers by participating in the costameric network, which is crucial for the lateral transmission of force from sarcomeres to the extracellular matrix (Marg2010AHNAK1). AHNAK2 is also implicated in cardiac function, where it co-localizes with AHNAK in the sarcolemmas and Z-bands of cardiomyocytes, potentially compensating for the absence of AHNAK (Zhang2023AHNAKs).

In the context of stress-induced cellular responses, AHNAK2 is involved in the nonclassical secretion pathway of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). Under heat shock conditions, AHNAK2 enhances the association with FGF1, facilitating its export from cells, a process that is crucial for cellular stress responses (Kirov2015AHNAK2). Additionally, AHNAK2 is suggested to play a role in cytoskeleton regulation and peripheral nerve development, with implications in diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and systemic lupus erythematosus (Zhang2023AHNAKs). These functions highlight AHNAK2's importance in maintaining cellular structure and responding to physiological challenges.

## Clinical Significance
AHNAK2 mutations and alterations in its expression are implicated in various cancers, influencing prognosis and treatment responses. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), AHNAK2 mutations are associated with impaired TGF-β signaling, leading to increased sensitivity to genotoxic therapies and immunotherapy. These mutations correlate with higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) and neoantigen load, enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration and potentially improving disease-free survival (Mai2024Impaired). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), deleterious AHNAK2 mutations predict better responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), linked to an activated immune microenvironment with increased CD8+ T cell and NK cell activity (Cui2022Deleterious).

AHNAK2 expression levels also serve as prognostic markers in other cancers. In bladder cancer, high AHNAK2 expression is associated with lower recurrence-free and cancer-specific survival, suggesting it as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis (Zhang2023AHNAKs). In prostate and cervical cancers, AHNAK2 expression correlates with poorer survival outcomes, while in ovarian cancer, its role is complex, with both overexpression and knockdown affecting cancer progression differently (Zhang2023AHNAKs). These findings highlight AHNAK2's potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment stratification.

## Interactions
AHNAK2 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly under stress conditions. It plays a role in the stress-induced nonclassical secretion pathway of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). During heat shock, AHNAK2 associates with FGF1, facilitating its translocation to the cytoskeletal fraction where they colocalize with F-actin near the cell membrane. This interaction is crucial for the stress-induced export of FGF1, as the depletion of AHNAK2 significantly reduces FGF1 release (Kirov2015AHNAK2).

AHNAK2 also interacts with dysferlin, a protein involved in muscle regeneration. The carboxyterminal end of AHNAK2 binds to the C2A domain of dysferlin, as demonstrated by pull-down assays. This interaction is specific and direct, indicating a role for AHNAK2 in the dysferlin protein complex, which is important for muscle repair processes (Huang2006AHNAK).

In skeletal muscle fibers, AHNAK2 functions as a costameric protein, co-localizing with proteins such as vinculin, myomesin, and α-actinin. This suggests that AHNAK2 is part of the costameric network, which is essential for the lateral transmission of force from sarcomeres to the extracellular matrix (Marg2010AHNAK1).
