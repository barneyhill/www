# CD48

## Overview
CD48 is a gene that encodes a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored protein, which is a member of the CD2 family within the immunoglobulin superfamily. The CD48 protein is predominantly expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, where it plays a pivotal role in immune cell activation and adhesion. As a member of the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family, CD48 is involved in both adaptive and innate immune responses, facilitating interactions with other immune receptors such as CD2 and CD244 (2B4). These interactions are crucial for modulating immune functions, including T cell activation, cytokine production, and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The CD48 protein is characterized by its lack of a transmembrane domain, being anchored to the cell membrane via a GPI linkage, which allows it to participate in dynamic signaling complexes within lipid rafts (McArdel2016Roles; Elishmereni2011CD48:).

## Structure
CD48 is a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored cell-surface protein that belongs to the CD2 family within the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is characterized by its structure, which includes a distal immunoglobulin variable-like (IgV) domain and an immunoglobulin constant 2-like (IgC2) domain. These domains contain conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability (McArdel2016Roles; Elishmereni2011CD48:).

A unique feature of CD48 is the absence of a transmembrane domain, as it is anchored to the cell surface via a GPI linkage. This GPI anchor is attached to the C-terminus of the polypeptide, which is covalently bound to ethanolamine linked to an oligosaccharide containing mannose and glucosamine. This structure allows CD48 to be highly motile within the membrane, clustering in lipid rafts and participating in signaling protein complexes (Elishmereni2011CD48:).

CD48 exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. In humans, the CD48 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms with differences in the 3' UTR and coding region, leading to unique C termini, although the functional differences between these isoforms remain unclear (McArdel2016Roles).

## Function
CD48, a member of the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein expressed on most hematopoietic cells, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. It plays a crucial role in immune cell activation and adhesion, particularly in T cell signal transduction and activation. CD48 is localized to lipid raft domains in the cell membrane, which are rich in signal transduction molecules and actin cytoskeletal components, facilitating its interaction with other proteins (McArdel2016Roles).

CD48 interacts with CD2 and CD244 (also known as 2B4), influencing T cell activation and cytokine production. The CD48:CD2 interaction enhances early T cell signaling by recruiting signaling components to the T cell receptor (TCR), promoting T cell activation and IL-2 production (McArdel2016Roles). CD48 also acts as a counter-receptor for CD244 on NK and CD8+ T cells, modulating their cytotoxic activity and contributing to immune surveillance (McArdel2016Roles).

In addition to its role in adaptive immunity, CD48 is involved in innate immune responses. It serves as a receptor for bacterial components, such as FimH on Escherichia coli, facilitating bacterial recognition and triggering immune responses like TNF-α release in mast cells (Malaviya1999The). CD48's interactions are crucial for modulating various aspects of immune function, including cytotoxicity and memory during immune responses (McArdel2016Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the CD48 gene are implicated in various diseases and conditions. In autoimmune diseases, CD48 is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Polymorphisms in CD48 have been linked to MS susceptibility, although their impact on expression or function is not fully understood (McArdel2016Roles). In SLE, CD48 deficiency can exacerbate lupus-like symptoms, highlighting its immunoregulatory role (McArdel2016Roles).

In the context of hematological malignancies, CD48 expression is upregulated in conditions such as multiple myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma. This upregulation is associated with tumor progression and immune evasion (McArdel2016Roles). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CD48 is often downregulated, allowing the leukemia to escape immune surveillance by natural killer (NK) cells. However, the AML1-ETO fusion protein can increase CD48 expression, enhancing NK cell recognition and killing of AML cells, which is linked to better clinical outcomes (Wang2020AML1ETO).

In glioma, high CD48 expression is associated with a more malignant phenotype and poor prognosis. It is particularly enriched in glioblastoma multiforme and is linked to immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment (Zou2019&lt; CD48; p&gt). CD48's role in immune modulation suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in these conditions.

## Interactions
CD48 is a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored cell-surface protein that interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in immune responses. It primarily acts as a ligand for immunoreceptors such as CD2 and CD244 (2B4), facilitating cell-cell interactions and signaling in both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells (McArdel2016Roles; Elishmereni2011CD48:). The interaction between CD48 and CD244 is particularly notable for its high affinity, with a Kd of approximately 8 μM in humans (McArdel2016Roles).

CD48 also binds to the bacterial lectin FimH on E. coli, which aids in bacterial detection and endocytosis by macrophages and mast cells (McArdel2016Roles). This interaction is significant for bacterial adhesion and invasion, particularly in the context of E. coli K1 binding to CD48 on endothelial cells (McArdel2016Roles).

Despite lacking an intracellular domain, CD48 can induce signaling cascades by associating with signaling molecules like Src kinases and caveolin, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and rearrangement of signaling factors in lipid rafts (Elishmereni2011CD48:). CD48's interactions with CD2 and CD244 are influenced by electrostatic complementarity, which is crucial for the specificity of these interactions (Evans2006Crystal). These interactions are essential for CD48's role in immune regulation, including T cell activation and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (McArdel2016Roles).
