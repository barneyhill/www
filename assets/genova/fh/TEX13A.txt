# TEX13A

## Overview
TEX13A is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 13A, which is predominantly expressed in male germ cells within the testes. The TEX13A protein is categorized as a transcriptional repressor, although it lacks a canonical DNA-binding domain, suggesting it may interact with other DNA-binding proteins to exert its function. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis, particularly influencing genes involved in signaling and organ development. Despite its significant role in transcriptional repression, studies have shown that TEX13A is not essential for fertility in mice, indicating potential redundancy or compensation by other genes in reproductive processes (Kwon2016TEX13; Bellil2021Human). Additionally, TEX13A has been implicated in clinical contexts such as neurodegenerative diseases and male infertility, highlighting its broader biological significance (Stouffs2009Male; Bayram2024Genetic).

## Function
TEX13A is a gene expressed exclusively in male germ cells, particularly in the testes, and plays a significant role in spermatogenesis. The TEX13A protein is localized in the nuclei of germ cells and is involved in transcriptional repression, influencing the expression of numerous genes related to signaling, organ development, and gene expression (Kwon2016TEX13; Bellil2021Human). TEX13A is expressed in a stage-specific manner, initially in spermatogonia, and its transcripts are stored in a translationally inactive state until the late meiotic stage, indicating its role in the later stages of germ cell development (Bellil2021Human).

The protein is thought to act as a transcriptional repressor, potentially through interactions with DNA-binding proteins, as it lacks a canonical DNA-binding domain (Kwon2016TEX13). TEX13A's involvement in transcriptional regulation is further supported by its ability to alter the expression of 130 genes when overexpressed in cell models (Bellil2021Human). Despite its significant role in gene regulation, studies in mice have shown that TEX13A is not essential for fertility, as mice lacking this gene remain fertile (Bellil2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
The TEX13A gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly concerning its role in neurodegenerative diseases and potential links to male infertility. In the context of Lewy body dementia (LBD), rare variants of TEX13A, specifically missense mutations, have been found to be enriched in female cases. One notable variant, rs41312550 (p.Glu179Val), was observed to be twice as frequent in female LBD cases compared to controls, suggesting a sex-specific genetic architecture for LBD risk (Bayram2024Genetic). However, TEX13A was not significantly associated with LBD in males, indicating a potential sex-specific influence of this gene in the disease (Bayram2024Genetic).

In terms of male infertility, TEX13A is a testis-specific gene, and its expression is crucial for normal spermatogenesis. Although the exact clinical significance of TEX13A mutations in male infertility is not fully established, its role in sperm development suggests that disruptions could potentially lead to reproductive issues (Stouffs2009Male; Bellil2021Human). Despite the identification of TEX13A as a testis-expressed gene, no mRNA has been amplified from human testicular tissues, raising questions about its functionality in humans (Stouffs2009Male).
