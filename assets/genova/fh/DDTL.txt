# DDTL

## Overview
The DDTL gene encodes the protein D-dopachrome tautomerase like, which is a member of the tautomerase family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in catalyzing the tautomerization of D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole, a reaction that plays a role in the melanin biosynthesis pathway. The D-dopachrome tautomerase like protein is structurally similar to other members of the tautomerase family and is characterized by its ability to facilitate the rearrangement of chemical bonds within its substrate. This protein is implicated in various biological processes, including pigmentation and potentially in immune response modulation, although its precise physiological roles remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to understand the full spectrum of its functions and interactions within cellular pathways.
