# SLC27A6

## Overview
SLC27A6 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 27 member 6, which functions as a fatty acid transporter. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is part of the very-long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase family, playing a crucial role in the uptake and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. Predominantly expressed in cardiac tissue, the protein facilitates the transport and activation of fatty acids, which are essential for energy production and storage in the heart (Korbecki2023Reduced). The activity of SLC27A6 is vital for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and membrane structure, particularly in tissues with high fatty acid metabolism. Its interactions with other proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism underscore its importance in cardiac function and metabolic regulation (zhu2023analysis).

## Function
SLC27A6, also known as solute carrier family 27 member 6, encodes a protein that functions as a fatty acid transporter, primarily involved in the uptake and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. This protein is part of a family of very-long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, which are crucial for the activation and transport of fatty acids across cell membranes. In humans, SLC27A6 is predominantly expressed in cardiac tissue, where it plays a significant role in the uptake of palmitic acid (C16:0) and the activation of arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6), although it shows weak activity towards lignoceric acid (C24:0) (Korbecki2023Reduced).

The protein's activity is essential for energy production and storage, particularly in tissues with high fatty acid metabolism such as the heart. SLC27A6 is involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into cells, facilitating their incorporation into triglycerides, glycerophospholipids, and cholesteryl esters, which are vital for cellular energy homeostasis and membrane structure (Korbecki2023Reduced). Despite its significant role in cardiac tissue, the expression of SLC27A6 is very low in the brain, indicating a limited role in brain fatty acid metabolism (Korbecki2023Reduced).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC27A6 gene have been associated with several cardiovascular conditions. A specific polymorphism in the SLC27A6 gene, also known as FATP6, has been linked to lower fasting and postprandial triglyceride levels, reduced blood pressure, and decreased left ventricular hypertrophy, suggesting a protective role against cardiovascular diseases (Auinger2011A). In individuals of African ancestry, downregulation of SLC27A6 has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a condition characterized by the thickening of the heart's left ventricular wall, which can lead to heart failure (Irvin2021WholeExome). The knockdown of SLC27A6 in cardiomyocyte models resulted in decreased expression of caveolin 3 (CAV3), a protein involved in cell growth and hypertrophy, which may contribute to ventricular remodeling and hypertrophic pathways (Irvin2021WholeExome).

Additionally, genetic variations in SLC27A6 have been implicated in resuscitation outcomes from sudden cardiac arrest. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SLC27A6 was found to be negatively associated with survival to hospital discharge, indicating that alterations in fatty acid transport and metabolism may influence cardiac resuscitation outcomes (Johnson2012Common).

## Interactions
SLC27A6, a member of the solute carrier family, is involved in fatty acid transport and interacts with several proteins related to fatty acid metabolism. It colocalizes with CD36 on the sarcolemma, indicating a structural and functional interaction that is crucial for fatty acid uptake and transport in cardiomyocytes (zhu2023analysis). SLC27A6 also interacts with fatty acid-binding proteins such as FABP3 and FABP4, which are involved in the intracellular transport of fatty acids. These interactions are upregulated during cardiac maturation, suggesting their importance in this developmental process (zhu2023analysis).

In the context of left ventricular hypertrophy, SLC27A6 knockdown has been associated with changes in the expression of caveolin 3 (CAV3), a structural protein involved in cell growth and hypertrophy. This suggests that SLC27A6 may influence the formation of caveolae, membrane microdomains that organize receptors and signaling molecules (Irvin2021WholeExome). The knockdown of SLC27A6 also leads to the upregulation of SLC27A1, which may act as a compensatory mechanism, indicating a complex interaction network within the fatty acid transport protein family (Irvin2021WholeExome). These interactions highlight the role of SLC27A6 in cardiac function and metabolic regulation.
