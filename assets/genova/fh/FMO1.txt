# FMO1

## Overview
FMO1, or flavin-containing monooxygenase 1, is a gene that encodes an enzyme belonging to the flavin-containing monooxygenase family, which is involved in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. The FMO1 protein is categorized as an enzyme and plays a critical role in the detoxification processes by catalyzing the oxygenation of substrates with soft nucleophilic heteroatoms, such as nitrogen and sulfur. This enzymatic activity facilitates the conversion of these substrates into more water-soluble forms, aiding in their excretion from the body. FMO1 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and requires flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), NADPH, and oxygen for its catalytic function. The gene's expression and activity have significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including energy metabolism and cancer prognosis, particularly in papillary thyroid cancer (Phillips2019Endogenous; Luo2019Fmo1; Huang2021FlavinContaining).

## Structure
The FMO1 protein is a flavin-containing monooxygenase involved in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which includes characteristic motifs such as the GXGXXG/A motif for FAD- and NADPH-pyrophosphate-binding sites (Uno2013Molecular). The secondary structure of FMO1 likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of proteins with enzymatic functions, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of FMO1 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges. This structure is crucial for its enzymatic activity, particularly the FAD binding domain, which is essential for the protein's function (PHILLIPS2008Flavincontaining). The quaternary structure may involve dimerization, although specific details are not mentioned in the context.

FMO1 may undergo common post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect its activity and stability. The presence of splice variant isoforms can result in structural and functional diversity, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context provided. Overall, the high sequence identity of cynomolgus FMO1 with human FMO1 suggests similar structural characteristics (Uno2013Molecular).

## Function
FMO1, or flavin-containing monooxygenase 1, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics, including drugs and pesticides, in human cells. It catalyzes the oxygenation of substrates with soft nucleophilic heteroatoms, such as nitrogen and sulfur, converting them into more water-soluble forms that are easier to excrete. This process aids in detoxification and is essential for maintaining cellular and organismal health (Phillips2019Endogenous).

In healthy human cells, FMO1 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it utilizes FAD as a prosthetic group and requires NADPH and oxygen for its catalytic activity. The enzyme is involved in the metabolism of various compounds, including the conversion of trimethylamine (TMA) to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), particularly in tissues where FMO3 is not expressed, such as the liver in male mice (Huang2021FlavinContaining).

FMO1 also influences energy metabolism by modulating pathways such as mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. Overexpression of FMO1 in certain cell types has been shown to enhance mitochondrial respiration, indicating its role in shifting energy production towards more efficient pathways (Huang2021FlavinContaining).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FMO1 gene have been associated with various clinical implications, particularly in the context of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). In classical PTC, FMO1 expression is significantly downregulated compared to adjacent normal tissues. Despite this downregulation, high expression levels of FMO1 are independently associated with favorable recurrence-free survival (RFS) in classical PTC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Luo2019Fmo1). The study by Luo et al. highlights that high FMO1 expression correlates with better outcomes, although the exact mechanisms of its dysregulation remain unclear (Luo2019Fmo1).

FMO1 is involved in the oxygenation of substrates containing 'soft-nucleophiles', which may have protective effects against thyroid carcinogenesis (Luo2019Fmo1). Its role in detoxification and regulation of thyroid-related hormones could contribute to its association with favorable outcomes in classical PTC. However, the relevance of FMO1 expression in other PTC subtypes, such as the tall cell or follicular variants, is not well established (Luo2019Fmo1). The study also notes that FMO1 dysregulation may affect individual responses to drugs like tamoxifen, used in breast cancer treatment (Luo2019Fmo1).
