# ZNF730

## Overview
ZNF730 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 730, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in human embryonic stem cells, where it plays a crucial role in early developmental processes and the maintenance of pluripotency (Zhang2022Active). ZNF730 is regulated by long terminal repeat (LTR) elements, such as MER57E3, which influence its transcriptional activity (Zhang2022Active). The protein is also implicated in sex-biased gene expression and interacts with various transcription factors, including TEF, to modulate gene expression in different tissues (Jones2024Biological; AgudeloRomero2023Transcriptomic). Clinically, alterations in ZNF730 have been associated with diseases such as pancreatic cancer, schizophrenia, and bronchial asthma, highlighting its potential significance in human health and disease (John2019Oligogenic; Meng2018Neoepitope; Akhmerova2023Genetic).

## Function
ZNF730 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression in human cells. It is particularly active in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where it is expressed from the 8-cell stage of the early embryo and maintains high expression levels during the pluripotent stage. This suggests its involvement in early developmental processes and the maintenance of pluripotency (Zhang2022Active).

The protein is associated with the regulation of other long terminal repeat (LTR) elements, such as MER57E3, which are proximal regulatory elements influencing the transcription of ZNF genes. ZNF730's expression is specifically regulated by these LTR elements, as demonstrated by CRISPR interference studies that showed a significant reduction in ZNF730 mRNA levels when the MER57E3-ZNF730 locus was targeted (Zhang2022Active).

ZNF730 also plays a role in sex-biased gene expression. It is one of the transcription factors that influence the expression of sex-biased genes, and adjusting for sex differences in ZNF730 expression can reduce sex-bias in target gene expression (Jones2024Biological). The protein's activity is localized in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate transcription, impacting cellular processes such as growth and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF730 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In pancreatic cancer, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from a patient recognized a peptide derived from ZNF730, suggesting its potential role as a target for immune responses in this type of cancer (Meng2018Neoepitope). In schizophrenia, ZNF730 is among the genes with rare variants shared across different families, indicating a possible contribution to the genetic heterogeneity and polygenic nature of the disorder (John2019Oligogenic). 

ZNF730 has also been associated with bronchial asthma, as it is part of a cluster of zinc finger protein-coding genes linked to the pathogenesis of the disease in the Russian population (Akhmerova2023Genetic). In the context of multiple primary ground-glass nodules (GGNs) in the lungs, a nonsynonymous mutation in ZNF730 was identified, which helped differentiate between multiple primary GGNs and intrapulmonary metastatic GGNs (Zhou2022Utility). These findings suggest that ZNF730 may play a role in various diseases, although its precise clinical significance requires further investigation.

## Interactions
ZNF730, a member of the zinc finger protein family, is involved in gene regulation through interactions with various elements. It is associated with the ancient long terminal repeat (LTR) element MER57E3, which is located near transcription start sites of coding genes, particularly those encoding zinc finger proteins (ZNF). ZNF730 binds strongly to different classes of LTR elements, with a significant portion of its binding sites located in promoter regions, suggesting a role in regulating host gene transcription and other LTR elements (Zhang2022Active).

The transcription factor TEF has been shown to interact with MER57E3 elements to regulate ZNF730 expression. Overexpression of TEF in human embryonic stem cells leads to the upregulation of MER57E3-related genes, including ZNF730. However, in ZNF730-MER57E3 knockout cell lines, TEF overexpression does not result in ZNF730 upregulation, indicating a specific interaction between TEF and MER57E3 in regulating ZNF730 (Zhang2022Active).

In lung tissue, ZNF730 is identified as a differentially expressed gene, with its expression modulated by transcription factors in lung airway epithelial cells. This suggests potential interactions with other transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression in lung tissue (AgudeloRomero2023Transcriptomic).
