# LIME1

## Overview
LIME1 is a gene that encodes the Lck interacting transmembrane adaptor 1, a protein that plays a significant role in immune cell signaling. This transmembrane adaptor protein is primarily involved in the regulation of T-cell and B-cell receptor signaling pathways by interacting with Src family kinases, such as Lck and Lyn (Li2021DNA). Located in the plasma membrane, LIME1 facilitates critical signal transduction processes essential for immune responses, particularly in T-cells (Li2021DNA). Beyond its immunological functions, LIME1 has been implicated in neurobiological processes, with studies suggesting a potential link between its DNA methylation and attention deficits, highlighting its relevance in neurodevelopmental research (Grégoire2007Deletion; Li2021DNA).

## Function
The LIME1 gene encodes a transmembrane adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in immune system signaling by linking the T and B-cell receptors to downstream signaling pathways. This is achieved through its association with the Src family kinases Lck and Lyn, respectively (Li2021DNA). LIME1 is primarily located in the plasma membrane, where it facilitates signal transduction pathways essential for T-cell function, contributing to the activation and regulation of T-cells (Li2021DNA).

In healthy human cells, LIME1 is involved in inflammatory pathways, such as the MAPK signaling pathway, which are implicated in various pathophysiological conditions. The transcription start site of the LIME1 gene is significant in these pathways and has been associated with cerebral palsy, suggesting a potential impact on brain development and function (Li2021DNA). DNA methylation of the LIME1 gene may influence its function and affect the corresponding inflammatory pathway, potentially linking it to attention deficits (Li2021DNA). This highlights the gene's role in neurobiological processes, although specific neuron-related pathways were not enriched in the study (Li2021DNA).

## Clinical Significance
The LIME1 gene has been studied for its potential role in attention deficits in children, particularly in the context of Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research has shown that DNA methylation levels at specific CpG sites in the LIME1 gene are significantly higher in children with poorer performance on attention tests, such as the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT). This suggests that alterations in LIME1 methylation may be associated with attention deficits, although no direct link to ADHD diagnosis has been established (Li2021DNA).

The study also highlights that while DNA methylation levels in LIME1 were not directly associated with an ADHD diagnosis, they were correlated with attention deficits, particularly in boys (Li2021DNA). These findings suggest that LIME1 methylation could serve as a biomarker for identifying attention deficits in clinical settings, although the study acknowledges limitations such as small sample size and the use of total white blood cells for analysis (Li2021DNA).

Overall, while LIME1's role in immune signaling is not considered critical, its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD through epigenetic modifications is an area of ongoing research (Grégoire2007Deletion).

## Interactions
LIME1, a transmembrane adaptor protein, is involved in several key interactions within immune cell signaling pathways. It interacts with Src family kinases, particularly Lck and Fyn, in T cells. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and involves the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of these kinases, preventing the induction of their closed conformation and keeping them enzymatically active (Hořejší2004Transmembrane). LIME1 also recruits the carboxy-terminal Src kinase (CSK) to lipid rafts, which is a negative regulator of Src family kinases (Hořejší2004Transmembrane).

Despite the presence of CSK, LIME1 maintains Lck in an active state by preventing the binding of its phosphorylated C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine to its own SH2 domain, as it is already engaged by phosphorylated LIME1 (Hořejší2004Transmembrane). This suggests that LIME1 acts as a positive regulator of T-cell receptor-mediated signaling. Additionally, LIME1 may interact with other SH2-domain-containing signaling molecules, potentially converting Src kinases into scaffolding proteins (Hořejší2004Transmembrane). These interactions highlight LIME1's role in modulating immune responses through its influence on key signaling pathways.
