# TBL1X

## Overview
TBL1X is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the transducin beta-like 1 X-linked protein, a key component of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) complexes. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional regulator due to its role in modulating gene expression through interactions with nuclear receptors and chromatin remodeling complexes. The TBL1X protein contains several functional domains, including an N-terminal LisH domain, a putative F-box domain, and a C-terminal WD40 domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its function in transcriptional repression and activation (Hu2023The; García2018Central). TBL1X is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of thyroid hormone and retinoid-dependent gene expression, Wnt signaling, and synaptic activity, highlighting its importance in both endocrine and neurodevelopmental pathways (Takamizawa2018Transducin; García2018Central). Mutations in the TBL1X gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as central hypothyroidism, neurodevelopmental disorders, and Chiari malformation type I, underscoring its significance in human health (García2018Central; Chung2011An).

## Structure
The TBL1X protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in transcriptional regulation. It contains an N-terminal LisH domain, which is involved in protein dimerization, and a putative F-box domain that also facilitates dimerization (García2018Central). The C-terminal region of TBL1X includes a WD40 domain composed of eight WD repeats, which are crucial for interactions with other nuclear proteins (García2018Central). These WD40 repeats form a beta-propeller structure, providing a scaffold for protein-protein interactions (Hu2023The).

The TBL1X protein is a component of the NCoR-SMRT corepressor complexes, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression (García2018Central). It acts as an adaptor, recruiting the ubiquitin-conjugating/19S proteasome complex to facilitate the exchange of co-repressors for co-activators (Takamizawa2018Transducin). TBL1X undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and function. The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, affecting its role in cellular processes. These structural features and modifications enable TBL1X to play a significant role in regulating gene expression through its interactions with nuclear receptors and other transcriptional regulators.

## Function
The TBL1X gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the NCoR-SMRT corepressor complexes, which are involved in the regulation of gene transcription. These complexes play a significant role in remodeling nuclear chromatin through histone deacetylase 3 and interact with classical DNA-binding nuclear receptors at the promoters of target genes (García2018Central). TBL1X is essential for the transcriptional regulation mediated by thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and retinoic acid receptors (RAR, RXR), influencing T3-dependent and retinoid-dependent gene expression (García2018Central).

In healthy human cells, TBL1X functions as a specific adaptor that recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating/19S proteasome complex, facilitating the exchange of corepressors for coactivators, which is crucial for the regulation of gene transcription by thyroid hormone receptors (Takamizawa2018Transducin). TBL1X is also involved in the regulation of Wnt-responsive genes, which control cell proliferation and cell fate, and is implicated in synaptogenesis and synaptic activity (García2018Central). The protein is active in the nucleus and is expressed in several hypothalamic nuclei, including the paraventricular nucleus and pituitary gland, playing a role in maintaining normal thyroid function (Takamizawa2018Transducin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBL1X gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting neurodevelopment and endocrine function. A notable condition linked to TBL1X mutations is central hypothyroidism, which can occur alongside sensorineural hearing loss. This is due to the gene's role in the NCoR-SMRT corepressor complexes that regulate thyroid hormone action in the pituitary and hypothalamus (García2018Central). 

Patients with TBL1X mutations may also exhibit neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The gene's involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, crucial for central nervous system development, suggests its significant role in these conditions (García2018Central; Chung2011An). 

Additionally, TBL1X mutations have been linked to Chiari malformation type I and gastrointestinal dysmotility, expanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with this gene (García2018Central). The presence of a nonsense mutation in TBL1X can lead to a truncation of the WD-40 repeat domain, which is essential for protein interactions, further contributing to the diverse clinical manifestations observed in affected individuals (García2018Central).

## Interactions
TBL1X is a component of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) complexes. It interacts with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and is involved in the repression of gene transcription by supporting histone deacetylation on target genes when the ligand is absent (Hu2023The). TBL1X interacts with NCoR through two distinct regions: the repression domain 1 (RD1) and a region between residues 1801 and 1965 of NCoR (Yoon2003Purification). These interactions are crucial for the formation of a stable TBL1X-SMRT-HDAC3 complex, which mediates transcriptional repression (Guenther2000A).

TBL1X also interacts with histones, specifically binding to histones H2B and H4 through its N-terminal domains, which is essential for its role in transcription repression (Yoon2003Purification). Additionally, TBL1X can be recruited to the estrogen receptor (ER) complex, along with NCoR1 and HDAC3, when bound by 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, acting as an ER corepressor in breast and ovarian cell lines (Hu2023The). These interactions highlight TBL1X's role in modulating transcriptional regulation through its involvement in multiprotein complexes.
