# TAFA3

## Overview
TAFA3 is a gene that encodes the TAFA chemokine-like family member 3 protein, which is part of the broader TAFA family known for its role in immune modulation and neural function. The TAFA3 protein is categorized as a signaling molecule, contributing to cell communication and migration, processes that are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological changes. In the central nervous system, TAFA3 is implicated in neuroprotection and the regulation of inflammation, playing a role in pain perception and tissue repair. These functions suggest that TAFA3 is crucial for maintaining neural health and responding to injury or stress, highlighting its importance in orchestrating complex biological responses necessary for organismal health (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
TAFA3, a member of the TAFA chemokine-like family, plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and neural activities. As a signaling molecule, TAFA3 is involved in cell communication and migration, which are crucial processes in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological changes. In the central nervous system, TAFA3 is active and may contribute to neuroprotection and the regulation of inflammation. These functions are essential for processes such as pain perception and tissue repair, indicating that TAFA3 could be involved in maintaining neural health and responding to injury or stress. By influencing these molecular and cellular activities, TAFA3 helps in orchestrating complex biological responses that are vital for organismal health.
