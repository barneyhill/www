# TNFRSF1A

## Overview
The TNFRSF1A gene encodes the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFR1), a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in mediating inflammatory and immune responses. This receptor is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is characterized by its extracellular cysteine-rich domains, which are essential for binding ligands such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-α. The intracellular region of TNFR1 contains a death domain crucial for signal transduction, particularly in apoptotic pathways. TNFR1 is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cytokine production, through its interactions with other proteins like TRADD and TRAF2. Mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene can lead to conditions such as Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), highlighting its clinical significance in autoinflammatory disorders (Rebelo2006Modeling; Galon2000TNFRSF1A).

## Structure
The TNFRSF1A gene encodes a protein that is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, known as TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). This protein is a type I membrane protein with a molecular weight of 55 kDa and consists of several distinct structural domains. The extracellular region of TNFR1 contains four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are crucial for ligand binding and are characterized by a specific pattern of disulfide bonding (Kimberley2007Falling; Galon2000TNFRSF1A). These CRDs are involved in the receptor's ability to bind ligands such as TNF and lymphotoxin-α (Kimberley2007Falling).

The intracellular portion of TNFR1 includes a 'death domain,' which is essential for signal transduction and mediates apoptotic signaling pathways (Galon2000TNFRSF1A). The protein can form homotrimers, a structural feature that is important for its signaling function (Galon2000TNFRSF1A).

Mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene, particularly those affecting the cysteine residues in the extracellular domains, can lead to misfolding and impaired function, contributing to conditions such as tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) (Rebelo2006Modeling; Galon2000TNFRSF1A). These mutations often disrupt disulfide bonds, which are critical for maintaining the protein's structural integrity (Galon2000TNFRSF1A).

## Function
The TNFRSF1A gene encodes the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A), a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in cell signaling. In healthy human cells, TNFRSF1A functions as the primary receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine involved in inflammation and immune regulation (Rebelo2006Modeling). The receptor is composed of four cysteine-rich domains (CRD1-4), a transmembrane region, and a conserved intracellular death domain (DD), which are essential for its signaling capabilities (Rebelo2006Modeling).

Upon TNF binding, TNFRSF1A undergoes trimerization, which facilitates the interaction of its intracellular DD with the TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD). This interaction leads to the recruitment of additional signaling molecules, forming a complex that can activate downstream pathways, including apoptosis via the caspase cascade or cytokine production through NF-kB activation (Rebelo2006Modeling). TNFRSF1A is also involved in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis, with its proper function being crucial for normal immune responses and maintaining immune self-tolerance (Pucino2015Differential). The receptor is constitutively expressed in various cell types, including lymphocytes, and is active at the cell surface, where it mediates TNF signaling (Pucino2015Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene are primarily associated with Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, and inflammatory symptoms. TRAPS is linked to autosomal dominant mutations, particularly heterozygous missense mutations in the extracellular domain of the TNFRSF1A gene on chromosome 12p13 (Menon2017Tumor; Aganna2003Heterogeneity). These mutations often involve cysteine residues, which are crucial for the receptor's structure, leading to impaired conformation and stability (Cantarini2012Tumour). 

The mutations can result in impaired TNFRSF1A trafficking to the cell surface, reduced TNF-α binding, and defective receptor shedding, contributing to uncontrolled inflammation and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Huggins2004Shedding; Cantarini2012Tumour). Some mutations, such as R92Q and P46L, are associated with milder clinical manifestations and occur in a small percentage of the general population (Cantarini2012Tumour). 

TRAPS can lead to severe complications like systemic AA amyloidosis, which is potentially life-threatening (Aganna2003Heterogeneity). Treatment strategies have evolved from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids to targeted therapies like TNF receptor inhibitors and interleukin-1 blockers (Menon2017Tumor).

## Interactions
TNFRSF1A, also known as TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), is involved in various protein interactions that mediate its role in apoptosis, inflammation, and immune responses. It interacts with several key proteins through its cytoplasmic death domain (DD), which is crucial for transducing prodeath signals. These interactions include binding with TRADD (TNF receptor-associated death domain), TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2), and RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1), forming complexes that are essential for signaling pathways such as NF-κB activation and apoptosis (Zhou2022Bioinformatics).

Mutations in TNFRSF1A can lead to altered interactions and signaling. For instance, the T50K mutation in TNFRSF1A can sustain inappropriate NF-κB activation even in the absence of the TNF ligand, leading to persistent autoinflammation (Yousaf2005Tumor). The S59P mutation results in constitutive activation of the NF-κB pathway and other signaling pathways, such as IL-1β, MAPK, and SRC/JAK/STAT3, affecting cytokine secretion and apoptosis (Greco2015The). These mutations can lead to abnormal oligomerization and impaired receptor shedding, contributing to the pathophysiology of conditions like Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS) (Nedjai2007Abnormal).
