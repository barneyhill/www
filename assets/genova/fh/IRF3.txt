# IRF3

## Overview
IRF3, or interferon regulatory factor 3, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor critical for the innate immune response, particularly in the context of viral infections. The protein product, interferon regulatory factor 3, is a member of the interferon regulatory factor family and functions as a transcription factor. It is characterized by a conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal IRF association domain, which facilitate its role in gene regulation (Panne2004Crystal; Chen2010Structural). In its inactive state, IRF3 resides in the cytoplasm, but upon viral infection, it undergoes phosphorylation, leading to dimerization and nuclear translocation. Once in the nucleus, IRF3 activates the transcription of type I interferon genes and other interferon-stimulated genes, thereby initiating an antiviral response (Qin2005Crystal; Yoneyama1998Direct). The protein's activity is modulated by various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which are essential for its function in immune signaling pathways (Chen2010Structural). IRF3's role in immune regulation makes it a significant factor in both viral defense mechanisms and the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases (Jefferies2019Regulating).

## Structure
IRF3 is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal IRF association domain (IAD). The DBD features a helix-turn-helix motif and a conserved tryptophan cluster, which facilitates binding to specific DNA sequences known as IRF-binding elements (Panne2004Crystal; Chen2010Structural). The IAD is involved in dimerization and is structurally similar to the SMAD family of transcription factors (Panne2004Crystal).

The secondary structure of IRF3 includes an alpha/beta architecture in the DNA-binding domain, comprising a four-stranded antiparallel beta sheet and three alpha helices (Panne2004Crystal). The tertiary structure involves a β-sandwich core flanked by helices and loops within the IAD (Chen2010Structural).

IRF3 functions as a dimer in its active form, which is crucial for its role in transcriptional activation. This dimerization is facilitated by phosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine residues, leading to conformational changes that relieve autoinhibition and promote interaction with coactivators like CBP/p300 (Panne2004Crystal; Chen2010Structural). Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, are essential for IRF3's activation and function (Chen2010Structural).

## Function
IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the innate immune response to viral infections. In healthy human cells, IRF3 is typically found in a latent form in the cytoplasm. Upon viral infection, IRF3 undergoes phosphorylation at specific serine and threonine residues, which triggers its dimerization and translocation into the nucleus (Lin1998VirusDependent; Qin2005Crystal; Yoneyama1998Direct). In the nucleus, IRF3 forms a complex with coactivators such as CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, binding to DNA at promoter regions of type I interferon genes and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to their transcriptional activation (Servant2002Multiple; Qin2005Crystal).

IRF3 is involved in the transcriptional activation of antiviral cytokines, including interferon β (IFN-β), and other genes such as RANTES and IL-15, which are important for recruiting immune cells to sites of infection (Servant2002Multiple). The protein is constitutively expressed in various cell types and is directly activated by viral infection or double-stranded RNA stimulation, acting as a preexisting factor that is activated by phosphorylation rather than de novo synthesis (Yoneyama1998Direct). IRF3's activation is crucial for establishing an early antiviral state in cells, contributing to the suppression of viral replication and the modulation of immune responses (Petro2020IFN).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IRF3 gene have been linked to increased susceptibility to viral infections, particularly herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). A specific mutation, c854G>A, results in an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at position 285 (R285Q) in the IRF3 protein. This mutation impairs the protein's ability to become phosphorylated, dimerized, and transcriptionally activated, leading to deficient interferon (IFN) responses. The impaired IFN response is particularly detrimental in the central nervous system, contributing to the patient's vulnerability to HSE (Andersen2015Functional).

IRF3 is also implicated in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In SLE, IRF3 is associated with elevated IFN-α levels, and genetic associations have been identified in certain populations. In RA, increased levels of phosphorylated IRF3 have been observed in synovial tissue, suggesting its involvement in disease pathogenesis (Jefferies2019Regulating).

Alterations in IRF3 expression and regulation can also affect its stability and function. For instance, ubiquitination by TRIM21 regulates IRF3 degradation, and dysregulation of this process can lead to autoimmune-like symptoms (Jefferies2019Regulating). These findings underscore the clinical significance of IRF3 in both viral and autoimmune conditions.

## Interactions
IRF3 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in the antiviral response. Upon viral infection, IRF3 undergoes phosphorylation, which facilitates its interaction with the transcriptional coactivators CBP/p300. This interaction is essential for the activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and type I interferon genes, as CBP/p300 assists in chromatin remodeling, allowing IRF3 to access DNA and form a potent transcription factor complex known as VA-IRF (Lin1998VirusDependent; Yoneyama1998Direct).

Phosphorylation of IRF3 at specific serine and threonine residues, such as Ser-396 and Ser-398, is critical for its binding to CBP/p300. Mutations at these sites can disrupt the interaction, highlighting their importance in the binding process (Lin1998VirusDependent). IRF3 also forms homodimers upon C-terminal phosphorylation, which is necessary for its nuclear translocation and subsequent gene activation (Lin1999Structural).

IRF3 can interact with IRF7 to form heterodimers, potentially enhancing transcriptional activation from the IFN-β promoter (Lin1999Structural). Additionally, IRF3's interaction with cFLIP L can disrupt its association with CBP, inhibiting IRF3-driven transcription (Gates2016cFLIPL). These interactions underscore IRF3's role in regulating gene expression in response to viral infections.
