# KRT9

## Overview
KRT9 is a gene that encodes keratin 9, a type I cytokeratin protein predominantly expressed in the suprabasal layers of the palmoplantar epidermis. As a structural protein, keratin 9 plays a crucial role in maintaining the mechanical integrity and resilience of the skin in these regions. It is categorized as an intermediate filament protein, forming heterodimers with type II keratins, such as keratin 6C, to create stable filamentous networks essential for cytoskeletal organization and keratinization processes (Li2022Proteomic; Knöbel2015Keratins). Mutations in the KRT9 gene are linked to epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK), a genetic skin disorder characterized by thickened skin on the palms and soles (Ke2014KRT9). The study of KRT9 and its encoded protein is significant for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying skin integrity and related pathologies (Liu2019Keratin).

## Structure
Keratin 9 (KRT9) is a type I cytokeratin predominantly expressed in the suprabasal layers of the palmoplantar epidermis. Its primary structure consists of a central α-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains (Ho2022Update; Liu2019Keratin). The α-helical domain is organized in a heptad repeat pattern, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers, which are essential for the protein's secondary structure (Ho2022Update). 

The tertiary structure of KRT9 involves the assembly of these coiled-coil dimers into intermediate filaments, providing mechanical integrity to the epidermis of palms and soles (Ho2022Update). In its quaternary structure, KRT9 forms heterodimers with type II keratins, such as KRT6C, to create stable filamentous networks crucial for cytoskeletal organization and keratinization processes (Li2022Proteomic).

Mutations in KRT9, particularly in the helix initiation motif or the 1A rod domain, can disrupt these structural formations, leading to conditions like epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK) (Liu2019Keratin). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and stability (Ho2022Update).

## Function
Keratin 9 (KRT9) is a type I cytokeratin predominantly expressed in the suprabasal layers of the palmoplantar epidermis, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of these skin regions (Knöbel2015Keratins). KRT9 forms intermediate filaments that contribute to the cytoskeleton, supporting cellular shape and stability under mechanical stress (Fischer2016Keratins). 

In healthy human cells, KRT9 is involved in the organization of the intermediate filament-based cytoskeleton and keratinization processes, which are essential for the structural stability and flexibility of epithelial cells (Li2022Proteomic). The protein forms heterodimers with keratin 6C (KRT6C), creating a coiled-coil structure that is crucial for cytoskeletal organization (Li2022Proteomic). This interaction is significant for maintaining the function and integrity of the epidermis, particularly in areas subjected to significant mechanical stress, such as the palms and soles (Li2022Proteomic).

KRT9 also plays a role in cell proliferation, migration, organelle transport, and cell size determination, and it may be involved in processes related to malignant transformation (Li2022Proteomic). Its expression is vital for normal epidermal homeostasis, and its downregulation is associated with impaired terminal differentiation and skin pathologies (Zieman2019Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT9 gene are primarily associated with epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK), an autosomal dominant genodermatosis. EPPK is characterized by diffuse yellowish thickening of the skin on the palms and soles, often with erythematous borders, and typically manifests in the first weeks or months after birth (Liu2012The; Ke2014KRT9). Histologically, the affected skin shows hyperkeratosis and vacuolar cytolysis of the granular layer (Ke2014KRT9).

The KRT9 gene mutations responsible for EPPK are often located within the highly-conserved coil 1A region of the α-helical rod domain of keratin 9, which is crucial for the structural integrity of keratin intermediate filaments (Liang2014A; Liu2019Keratin). Common mutations include p.Arg163Trp, p.Arg163Gln, and p.R163W, with codon 163 being a frequent mutation site (Li2019Genetic; Ke2014KRT9). These mutations can lead to severe clinical phenotypes, including early onset of symptoms, knuckle pads, and camptodactyly (Liang2014A; Liu2019Keratin).

There is currently no satisfactory treatment for EPPK, highlighting the importance of prenatal genetic diagnosis to prevent the birth of affected offspring, especially in low- and middle-income countries (Ke2014KRT9).

## Interactions
Keratin 9 (KRT9) is known to interact with keratin 6C (KRT6C) to form a heterodimer, which plays a crucial role in the structural organization of intermediate filaments in the epidermis of palms and soles. This interaction is significant for the cytoskeletal structure and keratinization processes, particularly in conditions like epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK) (Li2022Proteomic). The KRT6C/KRT9 pair forms a coiled-coil structure, as demonstrated by in silico modeling, which suggests specific interactions between residues of these proteins (Li2022Proteomic). 

The interaction between KRT9 and KRT6C is part of a densely connected protein-protein network involved in cytoskeleton organization, highlighting its physiological importance (Li2022Proteomic). This interaction may also explain phenotypic overlaps in conditions like EPPK and pachyonychia congenita (PC-K6c), where the dysfunction of this keratin pair could disrupt epidermal homeostasis (Li2022Proteomic). Additionally, KRT9 is involved in various biological processes, including RNA metabolism and translation regulation, as identified through gene ontology enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analysis (Li2022Proteomic).
