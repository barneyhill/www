# GART

## Overview
The GART gene encodes a trifunctional enzyme that is integral to the de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) pathway, a critical biochemical route for the production of purine nucleotides in human cells. This enzyme, categorized as a synthetase, catalyzes three sequential reactions essential for the assembly of purine bases, ultimately leading to the synthesis of inosine monophosphate (IMP), a precursor for adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) (Mazzarino2021Transcriptome; Dewulf2022Disorders). The GART enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and plays a vital role in DNA and RNA synthesis, energy metabolism, and other cellular processes, particularly during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle (Mazzarino2021Transcriptome). Its function is crucial for mammalian development, including embryonic development, due to the limited transport of purine bases across placental membranes (Mazzarino2021Transcriptome). Additionally, GART's interactions and stability are influenced by specific histidine and aspartic acid residues, which are significant for its catalytic activity (Morikis2003The). The gene's dysregulation has been implicated in various conditions, including Down syndrome and breast cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Mazzarino2021Transcriptome; Cipolletti2023A).

## Function
The GART gene encodes a trifunctional enzyme that plays a critical role in the de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) pathway, which is essential for the production of purine nucleotides in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes three sequential reactions: the conversion of phosphoribosylamine to phosphoribosylglycinamide, the formylation of phosphoribosylglycinamide, and the conversion of phosphoribosylglycinamide to phosphoribosylaminoimidazole. These reactions are crucial for the assembly of a purine base onto a phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) backbone, ultimately leading to the synthesis of inosine monophosphate (IMP), a precursor for adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) (Mazzarino2021Transcriptome; Dewulf2022Disorders).

The GART enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is vital for DNA and RNA synthesis, energy metabolism, and other biochemical processes. It is particularly important during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle to supply purines for DNA replication and RNA transcription, supporting cellular division and growth (Mazzarino2021Transcriptome). The gene's function is also significant in mammalian development, including embryonic development, due to the inefficiency of purine base transport across placental membranes (Mazzarino2021Transcriptome).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GART gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Down syndrome (DS), the GART gene is triplicated, leading to its dysregulation and altered purine levels, which are crucial for neural development. This dysregulation is associated with intellectual disabilities, congenital heart malformations, epilepsy, and obesity in DS (Mazzarino2021Transcriptome). The overexpression of GART in fetal hearts with trisomy 21 suggests a potential role in cardiac defects associated with DS (Li2006Cell).

In breast cancer, particularly in luminal A estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), GART is overexpressed. Its inhibition has been shown to induce ERα degradation and reduce cell proliferation, suggesting that GART could be a target for therapeutic intervention. Lower GART mRNA levels are associated with prolonged survival in patients with luminal A breast cancers treated with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy (Cipolletti2023A). The study indicates that targeting the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, in which GART plays a crucial role, could be a promising strategy for treating ERα-positive breast cancers (Cipolletti2023A).

## Interactions
GART, a key enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, participates in several interactions that are crucial for its function and stability. The enzyme's catalytic site stability is influenced by a network of interactions involving specific histidine residues (His108, His119, His121, His132, and His137) and aspartic acids (Asp141 and Asp144). These residues contribute significantly to the ionization free energy and the stability of the catalytic site, particularly through Coulombic interactions and desolvation effects (Morikis2003The).

The activation helix of GART undergoes a helix-coil transition influenced by pH, which affects the enzyme's conformation and stability. This transition is stabilized by interactions between histidine residues, notably the strong interaction between His121 and His132, and is further supported by the addition of secondary structures and other residues like His108 and His137 (Morikis2003The).

In the context of breast cancer, GART interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), where its inhibition leads to ERα degradation and reduced cell proliferation. This interaction suggests a potential therapeutic target for ERα-positive breast cancer, highlighting GART's role in cellular signaling pathways (Cipolletti2023A).
