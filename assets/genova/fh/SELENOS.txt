# SELENOS

## Overview
SELENOS is a gene that encodes selenoprotein S, a transmembrane protein primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Selenoprotein S plays a pivotal role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is crucial for the removal of misfolded proteins from the ER, thereby maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. The protein is characterized by its single transmembrane domain and a cytosolic tail that facilitates interactions with various protein complexes, including p97 ATPase and Derlins, which are essential for its function in ERAD. Additionally, selenoprotein S is involved in cellular stress responses and inflammation regulation, with its expression being modulated by metabolic states and stress conditions. The gene's polymorphisms have been linked to several diseases, including autoimmune disorders and type 2 diabetes mellitus, highlighting its clinical significance (Zoidis2018Selenium-Dependent; Turanov2014Selenoprotein; Dogaru2023“Alphabet”).

## Structure
The SELENOS gene encodes selenoprotein S, a transmembrane protein primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. SELENOS is characterized by a single transmembrane domain located in the N-terminal region, with a short ER luminal segment and a longer cytosolic tail (Turanov2014Selenoprotein). The cytosolic region contains two extended α-helices followed by a disordered COOH-terminal region, which may allow flexibility for interaction with various substrates (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). This region also includes a coiled coil domain, which is crucial for protein binding and/or dimerization, and a disulfide bond between Cys174 and Cys188, suggesting the formation of a selenylsulfide bond in the native protein (Turanov2014Selenoprotein; Dogaru2023“Alphabet”).

SELENOS exists in two isoforms due to alternative splicing: isoform 1, which is typically degraded, and isoform 2, which is the functional form with 189 amino acids (Yu2017Selenoprotein). The protein's redox potential is -234 mV, indicating its role in the reduction of disulfide bonds in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). SELENOS interacts with several protein complexes, including p97 ATPase and Derlin 1, through its coiled coil domain, playing a role in the maintenance and transport of multiprotein complexes (Turanov2014Selenoprotein).

## Function
Selenoprotein S (SELENOS) is a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is responsible for the removal of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells (Zoidis2018Selenium-Dependent; Turanov2014Selenoprotein). SELENOS is a transmembrane protein located in the ER and plasma membranes, where it interacts with various proteins, including p97 ATPase and Derlins, to facilitate the ERAD process (Zoidis2018Selenium-Dependent; Turanov2014Selenoprotein).

SELENOS also plays a role in cellular stress responses and inflammation regulation. It is involved in the maintenance and transport of multiprotein complexes, anchoring them to the ER membrane through its cytosolic tail, which contains a coiled coil domain crucial for protein interactions (Turanov2014Selenoprotein). The expression of SELENOS is influenced by metabolic states and is upregulated during conditions such as fasting and ER stress, suggesting its involvement in cellular redox balance and protection against oxidative stress (Zoidis2018Selenium-Dependent; Gromer2005Human). These functions highlight SELENOS's role in supporting cellular homeostasis and immune function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SELENOS gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. Polymorphisms in the SELENOS promoter, such as a change from G to A at position -105, are associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1β. This polymorphism is correlated with a higher incidence of conditions like stroke in women, pre-eclampsia, coronary heart disease, and gastric cancer. It also shows epistasis with the -511 polymorphism of IL-1β, increasing the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”).

In the context of autoimmune diseases, SELENOS is implicated in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Genetic variations in SELENOS, particularly when combined with variations in the NFE2L2 gene, can modulate the risk of HT. The presence of SELENOS minor alleles alongside NFE2L2 minor alleles increases the risk of HT, while NFE2L2 major alleles can mitigate this risk (Santos2019Interaction).

SELENOS is also involved in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its macrovascular complications. Genetic polymorphisms in SELENOS have been linked to T2DM, serum insulin levels, blood glucose levels, and insulin resistance. Increased SELENOS expression in adipose tissue correlates with obesity and insulin resistance (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”).

## Interactions
SELENOS, also known as selenoprotein S, is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) and Derlin 1, facilitating the retro-translocation of misfolded proteins across the ER membrane for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Costantini2022An; Turanov2014Selenoprotein). SELENOS also forms part of multiprotein complexes, interacting with proteins such as p97 ATPase, Derlin 2, Herp, Hrd, ataxin 3, and SelK, which are involved in ERAD (Turanov2014Selenoprotein).

The protein's interactions are not limited to ERAD components. SELENOS is known to interact with proteins involved in redox regulation, such as thioredoxin (TRX) and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR), which are crucial for its oxidoreductase activity. This activity is essential for modulating NF-kB activation in response to cellular stress (Varlamova2020Protein–protein). SELENOS's interaction network is extensive, with nearly 200 proteins identified as interacting partners, many of which are part of well-characterized multiprotein complexes (Turanov2014Selenoprotein). These interactions highlight SELENOS's role in maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating inflammation.
