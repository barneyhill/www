# DYNC2LI1

## Overview
The DYNC2LI1 gene encodes the dynein cytoplasmic 2 light intermediate chain 1 protein, a critical component of the dynein-2 complex involved in retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) within cilia. This protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly, maintenance, and disassembly of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling and sensory functions. The DYNC2LI1 protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal Ras-like G domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil region, which facilitate its interaction with other dynein-2 subunits, such as the DYNC2H1 heavy chain and intermediate chains like WDR60 and WDR34 (Qiu2022Combinations; Rao2024Structure). Mutations in the DYNC2LI1 gene are linked to various ciliopathies, including skeletal disorders and congenital heart defects, underscoring its importance in developmental processes and ciliary function (Liu2020ExomeBased; Kessler2015DYNC2LI1).

## Structure
The DYNC2LI1 protein is a component of the dynein-2 complex, crucial for retrograde intraflagellar transport within cilia. Its molecular structure includes a conserved N-terminal Ras-like G domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil region. The G domain is evolutionarily conserved among light intermediate chains (LICs) of both dynein-1 and dynein-2 complexes, playing a key role in binding to the dynein heavy chain (Qiu2022Combinations; Rao2024Structure). The C-terminal region, which includes a relatively long α-helical coil (residues 318-352), is essential for interaction with the DYNC2H1 heavy chain and other subunits like WDR60, contributing to the structural integrity of the dynein-2 complex (Qiu2022Combinations).

DYNC2LI1 contains a P-loop nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain (position aa 30-240), which includes a dynein light intermediate chain domain (position aa 30-163). This domain is involved in the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates, although specific mutations can impair this function (Kessler2015DYNC2LI1). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels in the brain, kidney, lung, and testes, and it localizes to the primary cilium, centrosomes, basal body, and transition zone (Kessler2015DYNC2LI1). The DYNC2LI1 protein has three isoforms, with the longest being 352 amino acids long, encoded by 13 exons (Kessler2015DYNC2LI1).

## Function
The DYNC2LI1 gene encodes a subunit of the dynein-2 complex, which is essential for retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) within cilia. This process is crucial for the proper assembly, maintenance, and disassembly of primary cilia, which are microtubule-based structures on eukaryotic cells that play key roles in sensing and transducing extracellular signals (Qiu2022Combinations; Kessler2015DYNC2LI1). The dynein-2 complex, including DYNC2LI1, is responsible for transporting proteins and other cargos along microtubules, recycling ciliary components back to the cell body, and maintaining cilia structure and function (Kessler2015DYNC2LI1; Taylor2015Mutations).

DYNC2LI1 is involved in regulating cilia length and ensuring proper ciliary function, which is essential for the repression and activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in response to stimulation (Taylor2015Mutations). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in bone, indicating its significant role in skeletal development (Taylor2015Mutations). In healthy cells, DYNC2LI1 localizes to the primary cilium, centrosomes, basal body, and transition zone, facilitating proper cellular signaling and transport processes (Kessler2015DYNC2LI1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DYNC2LI1 gene are associated with a range of skeletal ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in ciliary function. These include conditions such as short-rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD), Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD), Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EvC), and short rib-polydactyly syndrome (SRPS) (Qiu2022Combinations; Kessler2015DYNC2LI1). These disorders are characterized by clinical features such as a narrow thorax, short stature, polydactyly, and other skeletal abnormalities (Kessler2015DYNC2LI1).

DYNC2LI1 mutations can lead to defects in the dynein-2 complex, which is crucial for retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) within cilia. This results in ciliary defects, including issues with ciliogenesis, ciliary length, and the localization of ciliary proteins like IFT88 and GPR161 (Qiu2022Combinations). Specific mutations, such as compound heterozygous missense and nonsense mutations, have been identified in patients with Jeune-like phenotypes, broadening the clinical spectrum of dynein-2 defects (Kessler2015DYNC2LI1).

In addition to skeletal ciliopathies, DYNC2LI1 mutations have been implicated in congenital heart defects, such as transposition of the great arteries (TGA), highlighting the gene's role in broader developmental processes (Liu2020ExomeBased).

## Interactions
DYNC2LI1 is a component of the dynein-2 complex, which is essential for retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) within cilia. It interacts with the DYNC2H1 heavy chain, with this interaction being mediated by both the N-terminal Ras-like G domain and the C-terminal coil region of DYNC2LI1. The C-terminal coil region is particularly crucial for efficient interaction with DYNC2H1 (Qiu2022Combinations). DYNC2LI1 also interacts with intermediate chains WDR60 and WDR34. WDR60 requires the DYNC2H1-DYNC2LI1 dimer for efficient interaction, while WDR34 primarily interacts with DYNC2H1 (Qiu2022Combinations).

DYNC2LI1 is involved in the transport of the IFT machinery, specifically interacting with the IFT-B subunit IFT54, which is important for the transport of dynein-2 as a cargo of the anterograde IFT train (Qiu2022Combinations). Variants of DYNC2LI1, such as DYNC2LI1(L117V) and DYNC2LI1(P120S), show compromised interactions with DYNC2H1 and WDR60, affecting the dynein-2 complex's function in ciliary biogenesis and retrograde trafficking (Qiu2022Combinations). The interactions between DYNC2LI1 and other dynein-2 components are crucial for maintaining proper ciliary structure and function, with mutations leading to defects in these processes (Kessler2015DYNC2LI1).
