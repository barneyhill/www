# ITM2C

## Overview
ITM2C is a gene that encodes the integral membrane protein 2C, a type II transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This protein plays a crucial role in protein processing and trafficking, influencing the maturation and secretion of proteins. ITM2C is notably implicated in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein processing, a function that is significant for cellular homeostasis and has potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. By modulating the processing of amyloid precursor proteins, ITM2C may affect the production of amyloid-beta peptides, which are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The protein's involvement in the early stages of protein synthesis and modification underscores its importance in ensuring proteins are correctly folded and processed, which is essential for maintaining cellular health and function.

## Function
ITM2C (integral membrane protein 2C) is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as protein processing and trafficking. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it influences protein maturation and secretion. ITM2C is involved in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein processing, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and may have implications in neurodegenerative diseases. By modulating the processing of amyloid precursor proteins, ITM2C potentially impacts the production of amyloid-beta peptides, which are associated with the pathogenesis of conditions like Alzheimer's disease. The protein's activity in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus suggests its involvement in the early stages of protein synthesis and modification, ensuring that proteins are correctly folded and processed before being transported to their final destinations within the cell. This function is vital for the proper functioning of cellular mechanisms and the maintenance of cellular health.
