# ZNF844

## Overview
ZNF844 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 844, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are typically involved in DNA binding and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular development, and differentiation. The specific functions of zinc finger protein 844 remain to be fully elucidated, but like other zinc finger proteins, it is likely involved in gene expression regulation. Understanding the role of ZNF844 and its encoded protein could provide insights into various biological processes and potential implications in human health and disease.
