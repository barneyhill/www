# XG

## Overview
The XG gene is located on the X chromosome and encodes the Xg glycoprotein, which is a component of the Xg blood group system. This glycoprotein is primarily expressed on the surface of red blood cells and is involved in cell-cell recognition and adhesion, suggesting its role in cellular communication and immune response (Yeh2018The; Lee2019A). The Xg glycoprotein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, and its expression is regulated by the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA1, indicating its involvement in erythroid cell differentiation (Yeh2018The). The XG gene is closely linked to the CD99 gene, which shares structural similarities, suggesting potential overlapping immunological functions (Chang2013Sex‐specific). Genetic variations in the XG gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as the Xg null phenotype and have been studied in the context of autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Chang2013Sex‐specific; Lee2019A).

## Function
The XG gene encodes the Xg glycoprotein, which is part of the Xg blood group system and is expressed on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs) and potentially other tissues (Lee2019A). The expression of the Xg glycoprotein on RBCs is regulated by the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA1, which binds to an upstream control element, indicating its role in erythroid cell differentiation (Yeh2018The). The Xg glycoprotein is involved in cell-cell recognition and adhesion processes, suggesting a role in cellular communication and immune response (Yeh2018The).

The XG gene is closely linked to the CD99 gene, which encodes a T-cell surface protein expressed on all leukocytes. This structural similarity and sequence homology suggest that Xg may share similar immunological functions with CD99, such as leukocyte migration and activation, T-cell adhesion, and caspase-independent T-cell death (Chang2013Sex‐specific). The Xg glycoprotein's expression in non-erythroid cells may prevent the immune system from recognizing it as foreign, which could explain the rarity of anti-Xg antibody production (Lee2019A). The presence of Xg in various tissues implies it may have broader roles beyond erythroid cells, potentially contributing to immune and cellular processes across different cell types.

## Clinical Significance
The XG gene, which encodes the Xg glycoprotein, has been implicated in certain clinical conditions due to genetic alterations. A significant deletion spanning the XG and GYG2 genes has been identified as the genetic basis for the Xg null phenotype, which is associated with the production of anti-Xg^a antibodies. This deletion, known as esv2662319, results in the loss of exons 4 through 11 of the XG gene, leading to a complete absence of the Xg glycoprotein on red blood cells. This phenotype is particularly observed in males, who are hemizygous for the XG gene, and is rare in females unless the deletion occurs in a homozygous form (Lee2019A).

Additionally, the XG gene has been studied in the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A common variant within the XG gene has shown a sex-specific association with ASD, particularly in male-only family sets. This suggests a potential role for the XG gene in the male predominance observed in ASD cases, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Chang2013Sex‐specific). These findings highlight the importance of considering genetic variations in the XG gene in understanding certain clinical phenotypes.
