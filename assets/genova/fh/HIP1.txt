# HIP1

## Overview
Huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The HIP1 protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including an ANTH/ENTH domain, a coiled-coil domain, and an actin-binding domain, which facilitate its interactions with clathrin and other proteins (Wilbur2010Accommodation; Fontaine2012Replacement). As a key player in endocytosis, HIP1 is essential for the internalization of macromolecules and the regulation of clathrin-coated vesicle dynamics (Mishra2001Clathrin; Metzler2001HIP1). Beyond its role in endocytosis, HIP1 is implicated in linking membrane traffic to actin cytoskeleton dynamics, influencing cellular homeostasis and development (Wilbur2008Actin). Clinically, HIP1 is associated with several diseases, including cancer and Huntington's disease, due to its involvement in receptor trafficking and apoptotic pathways (Rao2003Altered; Hackam2000Huntingtin).

## Structure
The huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) is characterized by a multi-domain structure that includes an N-terminal ANTH/ENTH domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal actin-binding domain (THATCH) (Fontaine2012Replacement). The coiled-coil domain is crucial for HIP1's function, promoting homodimerization and interaction with clathrin light chains, which regulate actin binding (Wilbur2010Accommodation). This domain is characterized by a heptad repeat pattern, typically featuring hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions, although HIP1's coiled-coil region includes atypical polar or charged residues (Fontaine2012Replacement).

The crystal structure of HIP1 reveals a Y-shaped homodimer with a coiled-coil trunk region that separates towards the N-terminus (Ybe2007Crystal). The coiled-coil domain is conformationally dynamic, with the N-terminal half being more stable and the C-terminal half more flexible, allowing for structural rearrangements (Wilbur2010Accommodation). The flexibility of the coiled-coil domain is suggested to facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as HIPPI, by allowing the structure to adopt different conformations (Niu2008Crystal).

HIP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. The protein may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can alter its function and localization.

## Function
Huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1) is a crucial component in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process essential for the internalization of macromolecules into eukaryotic cells. HIP1 interacts with clathrin and the adaptor protein AP-2, facilitating the assembly and regulation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) (Mishra2001Clathrin; Metzler2001HIP1). The protein contains binding sites for clathrin and AP-2, with specific motifs such as the DPF sequence and the clathrin box sequence (LMDMD) playing significant roles in these interactions (Mishra2001Clathrin).

HIP1 is enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles, particularly in neuronal cells, and is involved in the recruitment of clathrin to phosphoinositide-containing membrane surfaces through its epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain (Mishra2001Clathrin; Metzler2001HIP1). This interaction is crucial for the formation and function of endocytic vesicles, impacting cellular communication and nutrient uptake (Mishra2001Clathrin).

In addition to its role in endocytosis, HIP1 is involved in linking clathrin-mediated membrane traffic to actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The coiled-coil domain of HIP1 binds clathrin light chains, which regulate its interaction with actin, influencing processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis and protein sorting during lysosome biogenesis (Wilbur2008Actin). HIP1's activity in these cellular processes is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) is implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular processes. In cancer, HIP1 is overexpressed in various tumors, including prostate, breast, colon, and brain cancers. Its overexpression is associated with altered receptor trafficking, particularly affecting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which contributes to oncogenic transformation and tumor progression (Rao2003Altered; Bradley2007Huntingtin). In prostate cancer, HIP1 expression correlates with disease progression and is an independent predictor of relapse, making it a potential biomarker for aggressive cancer behavior (Rao2002Huntingtininteracting). 

HIP1 is also involved in Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. It was identified due to its interaction with huntingtin, the protein mutated in this disease. HIP1's altered interaction with mutant huntingtin suggests a role in the disease's pathogenesis by promoting apoptosis (Hackam2000Huntingtin). 

In arthritis, HIP1 influences disease severity by regulating signaling pathways such as PDGFR and RAC1. HIP1 knockout mice exhibit a milder form of arthritis, indicating its role in the inflammatory response (Laragione2018Huntingtininteracting). These findings highlight HIP1's clinical significance across various conditions.

## Interactions
HIP1 (huntingtin interacting protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. HIP1 interacts with clathrin light chains and adaptor protein 2 (AP2), playing a significant role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It is localized to endocytic vesicles and shows colocalization with endocytic markers such as AP2 and clathrin heavy chain (CHC) (Metzler2001HIP1). The coiled-coil domains of HIP1 form stable homodimers that bind clathrin light chains, which regulate their interaction with actin, suggesting that clathrin acts as a negative regulator of HIP1-actin interactions (Wilbur2008Actin).

HIP1 also interacts with huntingtin (Htt), and this interaction is affected by the polyglutamine expansion in Htt, characteristic of Huntington's disease. The expansion reduces Htt's affinity for HIP1, leading to the release of HIP1, which can then bind to a novel protein called HIPPI. This interaction forms a complex that recruits procaspase-8, initiating apoptotic cell death (Gervais2002Recruitment). HIP1's interaction with HIPPI is crucial for the recruitment of procaspase-8, and this interaction is modulated by the presence of Htt (Gervais2002Recruitment).
