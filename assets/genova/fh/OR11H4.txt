# OR11H4

## Overview
OR11H4 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily H member 4, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR11H4 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, including the skin, where it participates in stress response mechanisms, and in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer, where it may influence patient outcomes (Ito2022Differential; Tong2021Ectopic; Alonso2008Overdominance). The gene's involvement in diverse physiological processes and potential implications in clinical contexts, such as olfactory sensitivity and cancer, underscore its significance in both sensory biology and disease (Matejcic2021Rare; Menashe2007Genetic).

## Function
OR11H4 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR11H4 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (Alonso2008Overdominance).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR11H4 is expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the skin, where it is involved in the stress response. Activation of OR11H4 by phenylethyl alcohol and phenylethyl alcohol-rich rose extract has been shown to provide protection against stress in skin cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for treating skin stress (Tong2021Ectopic).

OR11H4 is also expressed in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer, where its expression in stromal cells is correlated with overall survival in patients. This suggests that OR11H4 could serve as a novel marker for predicting colorectal cancer outcomes and a potential target for immunotherapies (Ito2022Differential).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR11H4 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, is not extensively documented. However, some studies have explored its potential associations with certain conditions. In the context of olfactory sensitivity, OR11H4 has been implicated in the perception of isovaleric acid, a compound with a sweaty odor. Genetic variations in OR11H4, along with related genes OR11H6 and OR11H7P, may contribute to differences in olfactory sensitivity, such as hyperosmia, which is an increased sensitivity to odors (Menashe2007Genetic).

In a separate study, OR11H4 was nominally associated with colorectal cancer risk, although the clinical significance of this association remains unclear. The study identified OR11H4 among 17 genes with strong associations in a gene-level analysis, but specific details on how mutations or expression changes in OR11H4 might influence colorectal cancer risk were not provided (Matejcic2021Rare).

Overall, while OR11H4 has been linked to olfactory sensitivity and potentially to colorectal cancer risk, further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance and the impact of its genetic variations.
