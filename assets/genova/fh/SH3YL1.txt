# SH3YL1

## Overview
The SH3YL1 gene encodes the protein SH3 and SYLF domain containing 1, which is involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in endosomal sorting and degradation pathways. This protein is characterized by the presence of an SH3 domain and a SYLF domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and lipids, respectively. The SH3 domain is essential for binding to proline-rich motifs, playing a significant role in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a key regulator of cell signaling pathways (Hasegawa2019SH3YL1). The SYLF domain is involved in lipid binding, contributing to membrane dynamics and cellular signaling (Yoo2020LPSInduced). SH3YL1's interactions and functions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and have implications in various diseases, including cancer and diabetic kidney disease (Han2023SH3YL1; Obeid2016Steroid).

## Structure
The SH3YL1 protein is characterized by two primary domains: the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and the SYLF domain. The SH3 domain is located in the COOH-terminal region and is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly binding to proline-rich motifs. This domain is essential for the interaction with the proline-rich region of p22 phox, facilitating the formation of a ternary complex with Nox4, which is important for hydrogen peroxide production in acute kidney injury (Yoo2020LPSInduced). The SH3 domain also interacts with Vps37B, a component of the ESCRT-I complex, which is vital for the endosomal sorting and degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Hasegawa2019SH3YL1).

The SYLF domain, located in the NH3-terminal region, is involved in lipid binding, particularly with phosphatidylinositol lipids, and is predicted to have an amphipathic alpha helix structure with positive amino acids for lipid interaction (Yoo2020LPSInduced). This domain is also involved in the interaction with the NADPH binding site of Nox4 (Yoo2020LPSInduced).

Post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, are crucial for SH3YL1's interaction with other proteins, such as p22 phox, mediated by Syk kinase (Yoo2020LPSInduced). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its role as an adaptor in various signaling pathways.

## Function
The SH3YL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the endosomal sorting and degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human cells. This protein is involved in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are essential for the degradation of ubiquitinated membrane proteins like EGFR. SH3YL1 localizes to endosomes in the degradative pathway and is necessary for the trafficking of EGF from early to late endosomes. Its function is dependent on its C-terminal SH3 domain, which interacts with the ESCRT-I component Vps37B, facilitating the sorting of EGFR into MVBs. This process is critical for the proper degradation of EGFR, a key step in regulating cell signaling pathways (Hasegawa2019SH3YL1).

SH3YL1 also has a unique lipid-binding domain, SYLF, that binds strongly to D5-phosphorylated phosphoinositides and is required for the formation of membrane ruffles in response to growth factor stimulation. The protein's role in the endocytic pathway and its interaction with ESCRT complexes are indispensable for EGFR degradation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular signaling and homeostasis (Hasegawa2019SH3YL1).

## Clinical Significance
SH3YL1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In the context of cancer, SH3YL1 is identified as a steroid hormone receptor coregulator, interacting with the androgen receptor (AR) and regulating ubinuclein 1 (UBN1), which is associated with aggressive prostate cancer. It is necessary for maximal androgen-mediated prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Obeid2016Steroid).

In diabetic kidney disease (DKD), SH3YL1 serves as a potential biomarker for renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. It regulates NOX4, a contributor to kidney injury, and its elevated levels are associated with poorer renal outcomes. This highlights its role in oxidative stress and kidney damage in DKD (Han2023SH3YL1).

SH3YL1 is also involved in the sorting and degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a process crucial for cellular signaling. Disruptions in SH3YL1 function can impair EGFR degradation, potentially affecting diseases related to EGFR signaling dysregulation (Hasegawa2019SH3YL1). These findings suggest that alterations in SH3YL1 expression or function could have significant clinical implications.

## Interactions
SH3YL1 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the Src homology-3 (SH3) domain of Src, showing a strong binding affinity with a K D value of 187 nM, indicating a highly preferential interaction (Kazlauskas2016LargeScale). SH3YL1 also interacts with the ESCRT-I component Vps37B through its SH3 domain, which is essential for the sorting and degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) within the endosomal pathway. This interaction is crucial for the proper sorting of EGFR into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and its subsequent degradation (Hasegawa2019SH3YL1).

SH3YL1 is also involved in the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within late endosomes, a process that involves the ESCRT complexes. The SH3 domain of SH3YL1 binds to the PxLPxR motifs in Vps37B, facilitating its role in EGFR sorting (Hasegawa2019SH3YL1). Additionally, SH3YL1 interacts with phosphoinositides, including PI(3,5)P2, which may be involved in MVB formation (Hasegawa2019SH3YL1). These interactions highlight SH3YL1's role in endosomal sorting and degradation pathways, as well as its involvement in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization.
