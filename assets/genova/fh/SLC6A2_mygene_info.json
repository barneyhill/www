This member is a multi-pass membrane protein, which is responsible for reuptake of norepinephrine into presynaptic nerve terminals and is a regulator of norepinephrine homeostasis. Mutations in this gene cause orthostatic intolerance, a syndrome characterized by lightheadedness, fatigue, altered mentation and syncope. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified in this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2010].", "symbol": "SLC6A2", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1420212"}, "unigene": "Hs.78036", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P23975", "TrEMBL": ["H3BM11", "H3BRE9", "H3BRS0", "A0A804HLI4", "H3BML6"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "Norepinephrine transporter"}}
