# FXYD5

## Overview
FXYD5 is a gene that encodes the protein FXYD domain containing ion transport regulator 5, commonly referred to as dysadherin. This protein is a member of the FXYD family, characterized by a conserved FXYD motif within its transmembrane domain, which plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase, a key enzyme in maintaining cellular ion gradients (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). As a single-span type I membrane protein, FXYD5 is involved in various physiological processes, including cell adhesion, motility, and epithelial integrity, by influencing cellular junctions and chemokine production (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). Dysadherin's expression is notably significant in 'leaky' epithelia, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract, where it may enhance paracellular permeability (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). Clinically, alterations in FXYD5 expression have been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in ovarian and breast cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy (Tassi2019FXYD5; Bai2019A).

## Structure
The FXYD5 protein, also known as dysadherin, is a member of the FXYD family of single-span type I membrane proteins. It is characterized by a conserved FXYD motif within its transmembrane domain, which is crucial for its interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). The protein consists of 178 amino acids, featuring a long extracellular domain of more than 140 amino acids and a short intracellular C-terminal segment of 15 amino acids (Yang2011Reduced; Lubarski2016FXYD5:).

Post-translational modifications of FXYD5 include O-glycosylation, which is common in cancerous cells and contributes to its molecular weight variation, typically ranging from 50 to 55 kDa (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). The intracellular region contains two cysteine residues, Cys 168 and Cys 170, which may undergo palmitoylation (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). A splice variant of FXYD5 has been identified, resulting in a longer transcript with 10 additional residues at the C-terminus, although the functional effects of this variant have not been fully analyzed (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). The protein's transmembrane segment acts as a kinetic modulator of Na+/K+-ATPase activity, while the roles of the N and C extra-membrane segments remain less characterized (Lubarski2016FXYD5:).

## Function
FXYD5, also known as dysadherin, is a type I membrane protein that plays a significant role in modulating the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase, a crucial enzyme for maintaining cellular ion gradients. This protein is expressed in various epithelial tissues, including the intestine, spleen, lung, and kidney, and is involved in regulating cellular ion balance and homeostasis (Yang2011Reduced; Lubarski2016FXYD5:). FXYD5 interacts specifically with the Na+/K+-ATPase, enhancing its activity by increasing the turnover rate of the pump without altering its expression on the plasma membrane (Lubarski2016FXYD5:).

In healthy human cells, FXYD5 influences cell adhesion and motility, impacting processes such as tissue development and repair. It is involved in modulating cellular junctions and chemokine production, which can affect cell adhesion and epithelial integrity (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). The protein's role in loosening cell-cell contacts and impairing cell-matrix association is consistent across various cell lines, suggesting its involvement in maintaining normal epithelial function (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). FXYD5's expression in 'leaky' epithelia, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract, indicates its potential role in enhancing paracellular permeability during nutrient absorption or immune responses (Lubarski2016FXYD5:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FXYD5 gene, also known as dysadherin, have been implicated in various cancers, including high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In HGSOC, FXYD5 overexpression is associated with shorter overall survival and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, making it a significant prognostic marker. This overexpression is often due to copy number amplification rather than point mutations (Tassi2019FXYD5). In EOC, FXYD5 is upregulated in advanced stages and correlates with poor survival outcomes. It promotes metastasis by driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through a positive feedback loop with the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway (Bai2019A).

FXYD5's role in cancer progression is further supported by its ability to enhance NF-κB transcriptional activity and AKT activation, both of which are involved in carcinogenesis and metastasis (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). The gene's expression is also linked to increased secretion of CCL2, a chemokine involved in tumor progression, and its ability to promote invasion in breast cancer cells is inhibited by CCL2 suppression (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). These findings suggest that FXYD5 could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
FXYD5, also known as dysadherin, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It specifically interacts with the Na+/K+-ATPase, acting as an auxiliary subunit that modulates the pump's activity. This interaction is facilitated by the transmembrane domain of FXYD5, with key residues such as Ala 150, Ile 160, and Leu 161 being crucial for the interaction. The presence of Arg 145 at the membrane-extracellular interface also plays a role in stabilizing this complex (Lubarski2016FXYD5:).

FXYD5 affects the glycosylation state of the β1-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase, potentially through direct interaction, which may alter cell adhesion properties by reducing the glycosylation level of the fully glycosylated form (Lubarski2016FXYD5:). In cancer, FXYD5 is linked to the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway, where it disrupts the SMAD7-SMURF2 complex, stabilizing TβR1 and enhancing TGF-β signaling. This interaction promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and tumor progression in ovarian cancer (Bai2019A). FXYD5 also interacts with the SMAD3/SMAD4 complex, which binds to its promoter, creating a positive feedback loop that enhances its transcription (Bai2019A).
