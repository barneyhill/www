# USP17L7

## Overview
USP17L7 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 7, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family. These enzymes play a critical role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thereby rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The USP17L7 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several pathological conditions when dysregulated. The study of USP17L7 and its encoded protein contributes to a broader understanding of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and its impact on cellular function and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
