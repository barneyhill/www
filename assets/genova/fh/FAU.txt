# FAU

## Overview
The FAU gene encodes a fusion protein known as FAU ubiquitin-like and ribosomal protein S30, which plays a critical role in ribosomal biogenesis and apoptosis regulation. This protein is categorized as a ribosomal protein due to its involvement in the maturation of ribosomal subunits, essential for protein synthesis (O’Dea2023Molecular). The FAU protein consists of a ubiquitin-like domain, Fubi, and the ribosomal protein S30, which together contribute to its dual functionality in cellular processes. Beyond its role in ribosome assembly, FAU is implicated in apoptosis through interactions with proteins such as Bcl-G, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential tumor suppressor function in various cancers (Pickard2010Apoptosis; Pickard2009Dysregulated). The evolutionary conservation of its structure across metazoans underscores its biological importance (Perina2015Functional).

## Structure
The FAU gene encodes a fusion protein consisting of a ubiquitin-like protein (FUBI) and ribosomal protein S30 (RPS30). The primary structure of the FAU protein includes a ubiquitin-like domain fused to the ribosomal protein S30 domain. This organization is conserved across metazoans, indicating its evolutionary significance (Perina2015Functional). The FUBI domain is less conserved than the RPS30 domain, but it retains a conserved G-G dipeptide motif crucial for bond formation between ubiquitin and lysine residues, although lysine residues for polyubiquitin chain formation are absent in FAU homologues (Perina2015Functional).

The FAU protein is involved in ribosomal biogenesis, as suggested by the presence of motifs in its promoter region that are similar to those in human ribosomal protein gene promoters, such as YY1, SP1, and NRF1 binding sites, and an E-box recognized by c-Myc (Perina2015Functional). The FAU protein also exhibits pro-apoptotic activity, which is thought to be mediated by interactions with proteins like Bcl-G (Perina2015Functional). The FAU protein's extraribosomal functions, including its role in apoptosis regulation, are believed to have been established early in metazoan evolution (Perina2015Functional).

## Function
The FAU gene encodes a fusion protein that combines a ubiquitin-like protein, Fubi, with the ribosomal protein S30. This fusion protein, Fubi-S30, is essential for the maturation of ribosomal subunits, which are crucial for the translational competence of cells. The proteolytic maturation of Fubi-S30 by nucleolar deubiquitinases such as USP36 is necessary for forming translationally competent ribosomes, highlighting its role in protein synthesis (O’Dea2023Molecular).

In healthy human cells, FAU plays a significant role in regulating apoptosis, a process vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue turnover. It acts by transferring its ubiquitin-like FUBI domain to target proteins, including the apoptosis-controller Bcl-G, a member of the Bcl-2 family. This post-translational modification is crucial for apoptosis regulation, contributing to the physiological control of cell numbers and preventing inappropriate cell survival (Pickard2010Apoptosis; Pickard2009Dysregulated).

FAU is also involved in immunomodulation and apoptosis through its conjugation to other proteins, a process known as 'Fubiylation'. This activity underscores its importance in various cellular processes beyond ribosome assembly, such as replication and regulation of cell growth (O’Dea2023Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FAU gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, reduced FAU expression is associated with a significant decrease in breast-cancer-specific survival, suggesting that FAU may function as a tumor suppressor. The study by Pickard et al. demonstrated that lower FAU expression correlates with poor prognosis, highlighting its potential role in breast cancer progression (Pickard2009Dysregulated).

In prostate cancer, FAU expression is significantly down-regulated compared to normal prostate tissue. This down-regulation is linked to decreased sensitivity to apoptosis, which may contribute to tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Pickard2010Apoptosis). The study suggests that FAU, along with Bcl-G, may act in the same apoptotic pathway, with their reduced expression contributing to the survival of cancer cells under stress conditions (Pickard2010Apoptosis).

In ovarian cancer, FAU expression is inversely correlated with resistance to carboplatin, a common chemotherapy drug. Increased FAU expression in resistant cell lines restores sensitivity to carboplatin, indicating its role in drug-induced apoptosis. This suggests that FAU may be a critical factor in determining chemotherapy response in ovarian cancer (Moss2009FAU).

## Interactions
The FAU gene encodes a protein that interacts with various components involved in apoptosis and cellular stress responses. FAU is known to interact with the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-G, a member of the Bcl-2 family, which plays a significant role in apoptosis regulation. This interaction suggests that FAU modulates Bcl-G's pro-apoptotic effects, potentially acting in the same apoptotic pathway (Pickard2010Apoptosis; Pickard2009Dysregulated). 

FAU's interaction with Bcl-G is crucial in breast cancer, where both proteins are involved in the same apoptotic pathway, with FAU's effects being mediated by Bcl-G (Pickard2009Dysregulated). In ovarian cancer, FAU's interaction with Bcl-G and maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is important for understanding carboplatin sensitivity, as MELK is known to control Bcl-G (Moss2009FAU).

In addition to protein interactions, FAU is involved in RNA-binding activities. The FAU-1 protein from Pyrococcus furiosus, a homolog of FAU, binds specifically to AU-rich RNA sequences, indicating a role in RNA metabolism and stabilization (KANAI2003Expression).
