# ELMOD1

## Overview
ELMOD1 is a gene that encodes the ELMO domain containing 1 protein, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Arf family of small GTPases. This protein is integral to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, particularly within the stereocilia of hair cells in the inner ear, and plays a crucial role in maintaining their structural integrity and function (Johnson2012Mutations). ELMOD1 is expressed in various cell types, including cochlear and vestibular hair cells, Purkinje cells, and retinal ganglion cells, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes related to actin dynamics and cell signaling (Johnson2012Mutations). Additionally, ELMOD1 is implicated in ciliary function, with localization in the periciliary membrane compartment and basal body, and displays functional redundancy with proteins such as WDR31 and RP2 in regulating cilia morphology (Cevik2023WDR31; Cevik2021Functional). Mutations in ELMOD1 have been associated with neurological and developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Miryounesi2019ELMO).

## Function
ELMOD1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, particularly in the context of hair cell stereocilia in the inner ear. The ELMOD1 protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Arf family of small GTPases, which are part of the Ras superfamily. These proteins play a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is vital for the structural integrity and function of hair cell stereocilia (Johnson2012Mutations). ELMOD1 is part of a signaling pathway involving small GTPases, such as RhoG and Rac1, which influence cell surface morphology and actin dynamics. It may deactivate GTPases that promote actin polymerization, acting as a negative regulator of actin dynamics (Johnson2012Mutations).

In healthy cells, ELMOD1 is expressed in cochlear and vestibular hair cells, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and retinal ganglion cells, indicating its involvement in various cellular functions related to actin dynamics and cell signaling (Johnson2012Mutations). The protein is localized in the periciliary membrane compartment and basal body, suggesting its role in ciliary function (Cevik2021Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELMOD1 gene have been associated with several neurological and developmental disorders. A novel mutation in ELMOD1 (c.571delG, p.D191MfsTer25) was identified in a consanguineous Iranian family, where it was linked to intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Affected individuals exhibited developmental delays, lack of speech, self-mutilation behavior, and signs of autism, such as lack of eye contact and repetitive behavior. This mutation was found in three affected family members, with the parents carrying it in a heterozygous state (Miryounesi2019ELMO).

In mice, mutations in the ELMOD1 gene have been linked to hearing deficits and balance issues due to defects in stereocilia, which are essential for proper inner ear function. These defects are associated with the role of ELMOD1 in regulating ciliogenesis and ciliary protein traffic, particularly in the formation and function of stereocilia in hair cells of the inner ear (Turn2021The). While similar hearing and balance issues have not been directly reported in humans with ELMOD1 mutations, the gene's involvement in ciliary processes suggests potential implications for related conditions (Turn2021The).

## Interactions
ELMOD1 is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics through its interactions with small GTPases. It functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Arf family of small G proteins, which are crucial for actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics in hair cell stereocilia (Johnson2012Mutations). Although ELMOD1 does not possess a plekstrin homology domain to interact with Dock4, it is hypothesized to influence actin cytoskeleton organization by acting as a GAP for Arf-family GTPases (Johnson2012Mutations).

In the context of cilia morphology, ELMOD1 displays functional redundancy with WDR31 and RP2. These proteins are involved in regulating intraflagellar transport (IFT) and BBSome trafficking, which are essential for maintaining normal cilia structure. While specific physical interactions of ELMOD1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in cilia biology suggests potential interactions affecting the localization of IFT proteins and motors (Cevik2023WDR31; Cevik2021Functional). ELMOD1, along with WDR31 and RP2, is implicated in controlling cilia length and morphology, indicating possible physical interactions at the ciliary base (Cevik2023WDR31).
